summary the mandate of the commission of inquiry into postelecti on violence cipev was to investigate the facts and circum stances surrounding the violence the conduct of state security agencies in their handling of it and to make recommendations concerning these and other matters the report comprises 5 parts part i of the report is an introduction which discusses the historical context of the violence part i i is narration of the violence province by province part iii deals with four cross cutting issues sexual violence internally displaced persons the media and the nature and impact of the violence part iv deals wi th acts and omissions of state security agencies and impunity and part v contai ns recommendations made with view to the prevention of future reoccurrence of large scale vio lence the investigation of alleged perpetrators and how to tackle the culture f impunity that has become the hallmark of violence and other crimes in the cou ntry s d l v i l n c h s b n p r t f kenyas electoral processes since the restoration of multi party politics in 1991 however the violence that shook kenya after the 2007 general elections was unprecedented i t was by far the most deadly and the most destructive violence ever experien ced in kenya also unlike previous cycles of election related violence much of it followed rather than preceded elections the 20072008 postelection viol ence was also more widespread than in the past it affected all but 2 provinces and was felt in both urban and rural parts of the country previ ously violence around election periods concentrated in smaller number of districts mainly in rift valley western and coast provinces as regards the conduct of state security agencies they failed institutionally to anticipate prepare for and contain the violence often individual members of the state security agencies were also guilty of acts of violen ce and gross violations of the human rights of the citizens viiiin some ways the postelection violen ce resembled the ethnic clashes of the 1990s and was but an episode in trend of institutionalization of violence in kenya over the years the fact that armed militias most of whom developed as result of the 1990s ethnic clashes were never demobilized led to the ease with which political and business leaders reac tivated them for the 2007 postelection violence secondly the increasing pe rsonalization of power around the presidency continues to be factor in facilitating election related violence the widespread belief that the presidency brings advanta ges for the presidents ethnic group makes communities willing to exert violence to attain and keep power inequalities and economic marginalization often viewed in ethno geographic terms were also very much at play in the postelection violence in places like the slum areas of nairobi one of the main findings of the commissions investigation s is that the post election violence was spontaneous in some geographic are as and result of planning and organization in other areas often with the involvement of politicians and business leaders some ar eas witnessed combination of the two forms of violence where what started as spontaneous violent reaction to the perceived rigging of elections later evol ved into well organized and coordinated attacks on members of ethnic groups associated with th incumbent president or the pnu party this happened where there was an expectation that violence was inevitable whatever the results of the elections the report concludes that the postele ction violence was more than mere juxtaposition of citizenstocitizens opportunistic assaults these were systematic attacks on kenyans based on their ethnicity and their political leanings attackers organized along ethnic lines assembled siderable logistical means and traveled long di stances to burn houses maim kill and sexually assault their occupants because these were of partic ular ethnic groups and political persuasion guilty by as sociation was the guiding force behind deadly revenge attacks with victims bein g identified not for what they did but for their ethnic association to other perpetrators this freeforall was made ixpossible by the lawlessness stemming from an apparent collapse of state institutions and security forces in general the police were overwhelmed by the massive num bers of the attackers and the relatively effective coordination of the attacks however in most parts of the country affected by the violence fail ure on the part of the kenya police and the provincial administration to act on intelligence and ther early warning signs contributed to the escalation of the violence the postelection violence is also the stor of lack of preparedness of and poor coordination among different state curity agencies while the national security intelligence service seemed to possess actionable intelligence on the likelihood of violence in many parts of the country it was not clear whether and through which channel such intelligence was shared with operational security agencies the effectiveness of the kenya police service and the administration police was also negatively affected by the lack of clear policing operational procedures and by political expediencys adverse impact on their policing priorities the report recommends concrete measures to improve perf ormance and accountability of state security agenci and coordination within the state security mechanism including streng thening joint operational preparedness arrangements developing comprehensive operational review processes merging the two police agencies and establishi ng an independent police complaints authority to break the cycle of impunity which is at the heart f the postelection violence the report recommends the creation of special tribunal with the mandate to prosecute crimes committed as result of postelection viol ence the tribunal will have an international component in the form of the presence of nonkenyans on the senior investigations and prosecution staff part i overview 1chapter one introduction the commission of inquiry into the post election violence cipev began on 23rd may 2007 with an announcement published in the kenya gazette notice no4473 vol cxno4 the members of the commission as appointed were its chair mr justice philip waki judg of kenyas court of appeal and two commissioners mr gavin mcfadyen and mr pascal kambale respectively nationals of new zealand and the democr atic republic of congo respectively two kenyans mr david majanja and mr george kegoro were appointed the counsel assisting the commissio n and commission secretary the international members of the commission arrived in nair obi within week of the publication of the gazette notice as required by law the commission took an oath of office before the chief justice on 3rd june 2008 the commission held its first press conference the same day both the government of kenya gok and the multi do nor trust fund for national dialogue and reconciliation managed by the uni ted nations development programme undp funded the commissions w ork the former provided the commission with office space security and t ransport while the latter paid the commissions expenses in cluding staff costs the gok also assisted the commission during field vi sits and hearings in addition the commission received support from the nakuru eldoret kisumu and mombasa local authorities as well as from severa l religious organizati ons during its field visits assistance included various types of facilitation from the anglican church of kenyas naivasha diocese and the catholic dioceses in na kuru kisumu eldoret and mombasa setting up the commission initially the commission attended to nu mber of logistical and administrative matters before beginning its substantiv work these included obtaining office 2space hiring staff and collecting back ground documents one time consuming matter that kept the commission from immediately addressing its substantive work was the lack of office space th is was something the commission did not and could not have anticipated the pa nel of eminent african personalities kindly assisted with temp orary quarters even though they were not formally responsible for the commission however it took three weeks of discussions with the panel and various governmen t officials until the commission was properly settled and was able to clarify wh ich entities would provide the logistical support needed to move forward during this period the commission assembled background documents and other necessary material the commiss ion also identified interviewed and completed staff recruitment full lis t of commission staff is annexed to ensure the independence of its investigat ors the commission advertised locally and internationally for these positions for the same reason the commission decided that the head of its team of in vestigators should be an international rather than local the commission re cruited canadian robert grinstead for this post later the commission also recruited an international consultant dr suzanne mueller political scientist apart from the above it was agreed that because part f the commissions mandate was to investigate the role and conduct of the security forces in the post election violence none of their serving members wo uld be eligible to apply for positions with the commission in addition the commission also recognized the need for specialists who could in vestigate sexual violence this was an important part of the post election violence and something the commission wanted to probe comprehensively as an integral part of its mandate the commission therefore recruited two fe male investigators to examine sexual violence one international ms melind rix of new zealand and another ms gladys mwariri kenyan the commission also had the assistance of full time psychologist counsellor ms nyawira kuria the commission also received assistance from various government ag encies and ngos specializing in this area something discussed in detail in the full report bel ow 3the commission finally acquired office space on 17th june 2008 by 25 june 2008 most of the staff was on board and the commission was able to begin substantive work initially the commission consulted info rmally with variety of groups and held number of consultative meetings the commission concluded early in its nure that it would not have enough time to visit all areas that had been heavily affected by the post election violence the life of the commission as provided in the gazette was only three months and set to expire on 22 august 2008 hence the commis sion immediately wrote to his excellency the president of kenya and to the pane l of eminent african personalities asking for 60 day extension so that it could plan ahead while the panel supported the request the national dialogue nd reconciliation team which was the final decision maker did not instead the commission was granted only 30 day extension publis hed in the gazette notice 7288 vol cx 67 dated 12th august 2008 the commission conducted hearings in public in the followin g areas nairobi between 9 and 25 july 2008 and again from 19 to 27 august 2008 naivasha on 28 and 29 july nakuru from 30 july to 1 august 2008 eldoret from 5 to 7 august 2008 kisumu from 11 to 13 augus t 2008 borabu on 14 and 15 august and mombasa on 1 and 2 september 2008 because of the failure to obtain 60 day extension of time the commission abandoned its origin plans to conduct public hearings and investigations in kakamega busia kerich bungoma laikipia thika and limuru eventually the commission received another two week extension for the purpose of preparing this report through gazette notice 8661 in vol cx 74 dated 12th september 2008 the difficulty of receiving limited extensions piecemeal rather than all at once dim inished the capacity to engage in forward planning establishing comm unication strategy the public legitimately expected the commission to wor k transparently and to keep the public informed both to ma nage public expectations concerning 4information and to develop reciprocal relationship wit h the media the commission appointed ms mildred ngesa an experienced jour nalist as media relations officer in addition the commission desi gned and established website wwwcipevorg to facilitate public access to information about our mand ate and our work the commission also set up secure email address infocipevorg for receiving confidential information and correspondence once the co mmission began hearings the verbatim record of public proceedings was posted on the website aside from the above the commission conducted periodic media briefings to inform the public of its work the thre commissioners appeared together on television interviews in the initial ph ase after which the chair issued press releases and engaged with the media in other ways publication of rules and procedure the commission also used its initial period to develop and p ublish its own rules and procedure the capacity to make ru is granted under the commissions of inquiry act and also under the terms of reference for the c ommission these rules other than providing guidelines to assist the comm ission in its work were designed to allow partnerships between the commission and as many interest groups as possible the rules and pro cedure for the commission were published in the gazette as notice 4923 on 13 june 2008 as well as the newspapers on 24 june 2008 consultations with governme nt departments and others as part of its preparatory work the commission consulted with officials and departments of the governme nt concerned with or whose functions fell within the scope of the investigations the purpose of these sultations was firstly to build level of trust with these institutions that would facilitate the 5commissions investigations secondly the commission sought to explore with the concerned officials the various practical arrangements nec essary to enable investigations the initial meetings with officials were held in private the officials with whom the commission met at this stage inclu ded the commissioner of police the commission er of prisons the commandant of the administration police the chief of the general staff t he attorney general the chairman of the electoral commission of kenya eck represented by members of his commission the director general of the national security intelligence service the permanent secretary to the ministry of justic national cohesion and constitutional affairs and the permanent secretary in the office of the president in charge of internal security and provincial administration this commission appreciates the level of co operation received from the various government departments throughout its work the commission also sought audience with the political leadership and managed to interview the vicepresident the prime minister and one deputy prime minister an appointment so ught with the president did not materialize while the former president declined to meet with the commissioners initially the commission also visited number of areas within nairobi that had been severely affected by the post election violence inc luding kibera this enabled members to interact with local communities obt ain feedback from them and also allowed the internationa l members of the commission to acquire feel for the issues they would encounter elsewhere role of civil society the commission deliberately decided to work closely with kenyan civil society organizations and seek their assistance wi th information contacts and expertise in areas related to postelection violence number of these organizations attended the commissions hearings through lawyers who rep resented victims and communities and provided useful feed back to members of the public on the commissions work these included keny ans for peace with truth and justice 6kptj the interreligious forum the kenyan section of the international commission of jurists icjk the kenya human rights commission khrc the kenya national commission of human rights knchr different chapters of the catholic peace and justice commission and various re ligious and faith based organizations civil society and human rights organi zations greatly contributed to the commissions work by providing background material and reports concerning the history and patterns of human rights violations in kenya this helped the commission establish foundation from which to proceed giving access to their records often including stateme nts from witnesses they had interviewed and helping map out geographic regions that should be the focus of investigations providing contacts with local communit leaders individual victims and other key contacts in communities where they had establ ished trust and credibility assisting and providing victims the commission interviewed in public and in private with emotional support based on long tablished relationships with them and offering various types of assistance to victims incl uding medical services counselling and various types of community support standing before the commission the commission addressed the question of legal standing from persons who wished to participate in its proceedings the followin g government departments were covered by its mandate and hence were allowed to par ticipate in the hearings the kenya police service the administration police the provincial administration the electoral commission of kenya the national security intelligence service the kenya prisons service and the rmed forces 7groups of citizens and civil society orga nizations also applied to participate in the proceedings they included victims representatives exper ts on specific aspects of the commissions work and or ganizations that had been involved in addressing the postelection violence it self all had useful information for the commission the commission considered that the qual ity of proceedings would benefit from allowing as many interest groups as po ssible to participate in the end the commission gave legal standing to the federation of women lawyers fida and the centre for the advancement of women and children both of which were allowed to represent the interests of women in the text of the post election violence the commission also granted the kenyans for peace with truth and justice the rift valley internally disp laced persons association the centre for justice and crimes against humanity and the tegla lorupe fo undation standing as interveners outside nair obi the commission granted regional law societies standing in its proceedings th included the rift valley law society in nakuru the north rift law society in eldoret and the west kenya law society in kisumu and the law society of kenya south rift branch even though the commission did not hold proceed ings in kericho where the society is based the commission declined requests for stan ding by kenyas two main political parties the orange democratic movement odm and the pa rty of national unity pnu because it did not think their part icipation was necessary however each of them testified through their secretaries general all groups participating in the proceedings were asked to furnish the commission with lists of their witness and statements from the witnesses significant number of the witnesses who testified before the commission were identified and processed by lawyers acti ng on behalf of various civil society organisations to maintain control over its proceedings the commission insisted that such witnesses coming in had to be processed with the full participation of counsel assisting the commission this ensured that relevant and credible evidence was presented whenever necessary to avoid gran dstanding the 8commission intervened to limit questi ons from lawyers the commissions experience was that allowing the diverse interests seeking representation greatly increased the quality of the inquiry the lawyers for the various parties brought useful perspectives before the commission that might have be missed altogether if they had been excluded in addition the participation of these same lawyers enabled the commission to reach out to w itnesses who might not otherwise have come forward this broadened participat ion and enriched understanding furthermore number of the lawyers admi tted into our proceedings had sharply opposing points of view this increased the objectivity and the credibility of the testified received methodological issues public investigative inquiries represent methodological challenge they are not courts of law but are influenced by ke nyas common law tradition in deciding how to proceed we adopted mix of chose half way house that mixed both adversarial and inquisitorial methods th rules and procedures reflected this choice the commission also felt this was the optimal m eans to uncover the truth concerning post election violence an d impunity in kenya at the same time the commission went to great lengths to ensure that all witnesses were treated fairly and developed rules to protect them from unfair accusations the commission had to address number of other issues one was how to utilize the reports and other material re ceived from various organizations as provided by paragraph 2a ii of its terms of refere nce the commission treated this information as it did any other testing and evalua ting it independently to complement its own findings although the commission would have preferre d to hold all its hearings in public paragraph 2f of its terms of reference allowed the hold ing of private hearings when necessary to instil confidence in witnesses and to allay their fears of reprisals the commission utilized both meth ods public officials mainly testified openly unless there were good reasons to do otherwise number of victims also 9testified in public however many others chose to speak in private because they feared reprisals or were too traumatized to come forth in public the commission took great care to protect the privacy of witnesses who test ified in camera however we did not have reliable witness protection program which might have given greater solace to others wh avoided speaking to us one of the greatest challenges was to find victims and convince them to testify something the commission went to great lengths to do in spite of its constraints including time the investigation team of the commi ssion was able to come to towns only two to three days before the commission hence they had very limited time to find and prepare witnesses something that elicited disappointment particularly when the commission was unable to stay long enough to hear everyone who wanted to testify nevertheless there was general realizatio n that the commission provided unique opportun ity and venue for individuals who had suffered horribly to come and tell their stories the co mmission did whatever possible to accommodate witnesses in some cases holding extended hearings up to 14 hours day the commission appreciates very well t hat in the final analysis only miniscule sample of the avoidable suffering inflicted upon innocent kenyans was heard the commission also faced criticism that it relied heavily on the testimony of public officials in its hearings the commission viewed as it duty and within its terms of reference to call upon public fficials to account for their actions it was for this reason that for the first time kenyans wer able to hear and see high ranking officers testify in public and be subjected to questio ns about their roles in addition the political parties at the centre of th political dispute that led to establishment of this commission criticized the commission for permitting them only one afternoon to present their side of the story the commission had to balance their desire for an openended forum which alr eady exists in parliament with ordinary citizens wh had far more limited opportunities to be heard 10public hearings were to be managed to ensure good representation of individuals and issues while providing form of outreach for ordinary citizens to hear from those entrusted with their safety and those who suffered from the post election violence as consequence the hearings elicited an overwhelming response by members of the public who came to listen to t he open proceedings in some cases the premises in which the commission hel d its hearings were packed to capacity and others sometimes ran out of space interestingly it was only after the commission had held its hearings that members of the public came forward to the investig ators seeking to testify the commissions methodology by province given the time constraints adverted to above the commission was not able to visit each province and therefore th methodology which the commission adopted for gathering evidence varied to some extent between the various provinces overall the commission relied on ba ckground material and reports from government nongovernmental and comm unity based organizations ngos and cbos and individuals recorded statements of victims taken by our investigators and the sworn testimony statements and exhibits of witnesses who came before us with regard to the rift valley province the commission hea rd witness testimony from 30 individuals 25 in eldoret and 5 in nairobi these included officials from the provincial administration 4 the police 1 the nsis 1 medical officers of health 5 hospital employees 2 and 15 victims and witnesses all of whom came before us in camera in ad dition our investigators took signed statements in private from 24 individuals 17 of whom did not testify before the commission we also made site visits to roads that were blocked with huge boulders to the kiambaa church wher individuals were burned alive by marauding youth and to the moi teaching and referral ho spital 11ngos church groups and other loca l organizations found and prepared witnesses to meet the commission they also allowed thei r premises to be used as safe havens for individuals who wanted to testify in camera in eldoret the commission faced two main drawbacks fi rst as in all places the commission visited there were time constraints give n that some parts of the north rift were major locus of the violence the commi ssion could have benefited from more than the three days it had second and most importantly th ere was pervasive climate of fear facing victims in the eldoret area some w itnesses who were worried about their safety were not prepared to testify in eldoret few came to nairobi to protect their anonymity it is possible some witnesses who would have liked to have testified to the commission did not have the courage to do so and could not afford to travel to meet us elsewhere it wa s our expectation that those against whom allegations had been made especially the socalled kalenjin u t h w u l d b v i l b l t t s t i f b f r u s r t l s t r c r d s t t m n t s however none of them came forward and therefore we di d not have the opportunity to listen to an account of th violence from the perspective of those in the north rift against whom allegations are made owing to constraints of time the commission did not hold formal sittings in central rift but was able to make visit to kuresoi and njoro areas where informal sessions were held with local administrators the police and number of victims during its sittings in nakuru the commission r eceived sworn testimony from various witnesses who had good overview of t he district including the rift valley provincial commissioner pc the former molo district commissioner gave evidence in n akuru town in addition the commission relied to larg extent on the minutes of the molo district security and intelligence commit tee dsic also supplemented by dsic minutes from the neighbouring bureti dist rict noting that these 2 committees on occasion held joint meetings nsis inte lligence reports and the report by the knchr numerous statements taken down by cipev investigators but who for reasons of time were never called to testify and used th is primary and secondary evidence to reconstruct the story of violence in molo dist rict some degree of 12reliance was also placed on reports by ngos and other civil society and faith based groups and organizations the commission received evidence on violence in koibatek through district government officials who test ified in eldoret as well as through statements by victims and eye witnesses who talked with commission investigators formal sittings were held in the district though the dc gave swor n testimony in eldoret while another witness also testified in naivasha on behal f of idps regarding the violence in the district further we rece ived evidence in private from victims of sexual violence and other forms of physical harm w then used dsic minutes furnished by the rift valley province pc and nsis reports to supplement available information finally the commission relied n statements provided to commission investigators but who for constraints of time could not be called to testify the commission also received sworn testim ony from victim of the violence in n r k i n d d i t i n w r i ed n d s i c minutes for narok south district nsis intelligence reports and the knchr report we also placed high premium on the akiwumi report in describing the hi storical context of violence in this district the commission did not conduct any hearin gs in western province due to time constraints in the circumstances it wa s arranged that evidence from western province would be taken when the commiss ion was sitting in kisumu from 11 to 13 august 2008 in kisumu the commission was only able to take the evidence of the following three officials from western province th provincial commissioner the provincial criminal investigations officer and the provincial medical officer because it did not spend time for hearing in western pro vince the commission and its investigators did not interact appreciably with th witnesses to level where it would be satisfied that the evidence presented r eflected the full range of information available in western province further like other parts of the country the commission received little or assistance in the mobilisation of 13witnesses and individuals who could test ify from organized groups within the region correspondence to the local branch of the law society of kenya for example remained unanswered1 the result is that when the commission went to kisumu there were witnesses other than the offic ials who came to testify on matters relating to violence in the province the commission however made brief vi sit to kakamega town on 9th august 2008 and toured the town where it saw pr operties that had been destroyed and damaged during the pev the commission also visited the kakamega police station idp camp in writing this chapter the commission relied on the testimony of the three officials its obser vations during the visit to kakamega and submissions made on behalf of some residents in kakamega and other secondary evidence the commission held formal sittings for 3 days in kisumu though part of this was devoted to western province senior provincial administration officials and police officers testified to get the perspective of the vi olence from government officials this was then juxtaposed from the sworn testimony of victims that was supplemented by information from the ministry of medical services taking into account that the pattern of violence in nyanza was typified by shootings attributed to police the commission so relied heavily on professional associations like the law society of kenya western chapter which furnished detailed depositions from victims owing to the range of w itnesses that were required to provide the commission with the broad range f issues it had to deal with focus was directed to the hardest hit regions namely kisumu town homa bay district and migorirongo districts from which most of the government witnesses were drawn from the commission held formal hearings to receive evidence and testimony with regard to the violence in nairobi senior officials at the highest levels of various security agencies and also representatives from political parties did testify in 1 letter to the dated 19th august 2008 to the law society of kenya western kenya branch 14nairobi but with view to setting the national context and not the violence in nairobi per the commission was able to make site vi sit in kibera in july 2008 where it spoke to some local leaders number of administrators and also the police further sworn testimonies fr om victims of sexual violence were received in camera taking into account this paucity of inf ormation the commission relied heavily on nsis in telligence and situation reports the knchr report and reports by various civil society organizations in putting forth the background for nairobi district the co mmission also relied on desk research to explain the genesis of some of slum ba sed violence that took the character of rent disputes with an ethnic angle although the commission was not able to visit central province due to constraints of time it nevertheless was able to solicit accounts of what happened in that province during the period th commission did not have opportunity to interview witnesses and individuals affected by violence it therefore arranged for officials from the province to provide statements on matters in relation to which it was conducting the inquiry submissions were received from the provincial commissioner central provin ce the district commissioners of kiambu east and kiambu west the commission also received and considered the minutes of the provincial security and intelligence committee an d district security and intelligence committee meetings for the period before and after the ele ctions to enable it appreciate the circumstances of poste lection violence in central province the commission also announced through th media in its public hearings and elsewhere that kenyans were encouraged to submit or send written submissions to the commission however very little information was received from central province in pursuance of this the account on the post election violence in the central province therefore is based on the material received from the officials identified above and from consideration of various reports includ ing the minutes of the psic the dsic 15and the reports of other organizations that have document ed the post election violence in the province much of the two days of formal hearings held at the coast was devoted to hearing the provincial administration an d the police and focused on the violence within mombasa city and its environs subs tantial evidence was also obtained in private from key informants who had good overview of the conflict and were well placed to speak authoritatively on the violence in addition testimony was received from victims and ngos active in the region to piece t ogether the history of violence as it happened in the coast province alleged perpetrators to name or not to name we realize that kenyans and the internat ional community have been hoping the commissions report will identify the in dividuals behind the 2007 post election violence after all the commissions first rm of reference2 is to investigate the facts relating to the postelection violence an import ant part of that investigation is to identify who planned organised facilitated and committed egregious human rights violations in carrying out its tor the commission d to make crucial decision whether or not to name names the issue is whether in narrating th facts and circumstances relating to the postele ction violence the commission should publicly disclose the names of those persons alleged by variou s witnesses to have perpetrated violence at some leve l it is choice the commission found particularly vexing therefore it expended considerabl time in researching and discussing this matter before making its judgment one possible choice for the commission was to name the perpet rators publicly given the clear advantage in doing so kenya has an extremely troubled past its history of ethnic violence has been papered over f or years until it exploded 2 1a of the terms of reference 16in horror during and after the 2007 elections the ca uses of this sort of violence which began in 1992 with the first multi party elections have always been known from official re ports of past commissions of inquiry it isin these reports that some individual s have been identified publicly as being responsible for the violence however there has been serious eff ort made by any government to punish perpetrators of violence or to addr ess the plight of their victims in sum impunity has become the order of the day i n kenya one way of addressing impunity is to publicly unmask and shame those who have been behind the chaos school of thought is that this should b done even if all that is available as proof is the victims ver sion of events which seems probable where there is more than just the victims account ava ilable there is even more compelling reason to name alleged perpetrators legal and procedural niceties the personal safety and reputation of the person named would in that c s b s u b j u g t d t b t h n t i n l i m p r t i v f f i g h t i n g i m p u n i t t h named individuals in any event would have recourse to the courts to seek redress and the media to express their public rebuttals if any an alternative is to be faithful to cert ain legal fundamentals prior to the naming of alleged perpetrators in public this commission was ppointed under the commissions of inquiry act cap 102 ws of kenya where its commissioners are required under section 7 i to make full faithfu l and impartial inquiry the commission espouses the rule of w and is guided accordingly in the discharge of its mandate one of the fundamental princip of law is the application of the rules of natural justice in the adjudi cation of disputes the other is the presumption of innocence and one of the rules of natural justice which the commission jealously guards is t hat n s h u l d b c nd em n d without giving them an opportunity to be heard pursuant to this principle the commission hoped that it would have an opportunity to serve all individuals adversely mentioned du ring its inquiry with notices of such mentions and grant them an opportunity to record their evidence with the comm ission for this commission that opportunity never ar ose for large number of adversely mentioned persons except for few who came before us even in these cases it would still be necessary for the commissi on to carry out further investigations 17before naming names to verify all the material facts the main reason why this threshold was not met is that the time allocated to the c ommission to complete its task was extremely limited it was in fact far too short to contact and hear the side of all those who had been adver sely mentioned during the commissions hearings also in some cases the contacts and addres ses of the named persons were unavailable the second fundamental issue for the commission is neverth eless to ensure that the perpetrators of the post election violence are brought to account for their deeds and that the issue of impunity is addressed for th is to be successful the integrity of the evidence gathered by the commission would have to be safeguarded the evidence the commission has gathered so far is not in our assessment sufficient to meet the threshold of proof req uired for criminal matters in this country that it be beyond reasonable doubt it may even fall short of the proof required for international crimes gainst humanity we believe however that the commissions evidence forms firm basis for further investigations of alleged perpetrators especially concernin g those who bore the greatest responsibility for the post election violence in the nature of things the premature disclosure of such evidence and those it relates to exposes it to possible sabotage or other adulteration before investigators have an opportunity to assess it the commission has in possession the names of powerful individuals in politics government bu siness the police and elsewhere whose capacity for interference with its evidence can neither be ssumed nor dismissed furthermore the recently enacted witness protection act 2008 which became operational on 2nd september 2008 has not been tested it is our recommendation that the act be fully oper ationalised to apply to the witnesses to ensure their ability to testify against powerful individuals without fear of retribution 18the commission has carefully weighed the choices available t it and has decided against publishing the names of alleged perpetrators in its report instead these names will be placed in sealed envelope together with its supporting evidence both will be kept in the custody of the panel of african eminent personalities pending the establishment of spec ial tribunal to be set up in accordance with our recommendations in default of setting up the tribunal consideration will be given by the panel to forwarding the names of alleged perpetra tors to the special prosecutor of the international criminal court icc in the hague to co nduct further investigations in accordance with the icc statutes this is major recommendation made by the commission basis for recommendations under its terms of reference the commission was called u pon to make specific recommendations on specific measures th roughout the hearings and in written submissions the commission received wide array of recommendations covering whole range of issues within and outside f the commissions mandate some of these recommendations were general and thers specific while others related to the normal functions of government many expressed scepticism that whatever recommendati ons the commission makes would never be implemented and as such this commission was waste of time and public resources for those reasons the commission made judgme nt on what was relevant and important for recommendatio n based on the following factors 1 the recommendations should be delibe rately specific to allow scope for avoidance of responsibility in implementation 2 few recommendations are easier to implement and presen t lesser burden financial or otherwise on those tasked to implement them 3 it is important to identify short term and long term re commendations and propose time frame for implementation 4 over the last five years or so there have seen enormous refo rm initiatives in the legal and public ctors and it is therefore necessary 19to reinforce the ongoing reform process and agenda with the aim of empowering kenyan institutions to effect change 5 the commission should also clea rly set out accountabilities and responsibilities for effecting re commendations and monitoring the implementation process we believe the recommendations of this commission are capable of implementation and monitoring and that where there is fa ilure to implement accountability and responsibility can be assigned to specific person or institution supporting documentation the verbatim recording of the commi ssions proceedings statements submissions and other evidence on the basis of which this report is derived have been compiled and handed over to the president of the rep ublic of kenya with the request that it be placed in the nation archives for public reference as has been explained material that was received in camera and w hich tends to show culpability of certain individuals has b een forwarded to the panel of eminent african personalities to deal with the same in accordance with our recommendations 20 part ii the facts and surrounding circumstances relating to the post election violence 21chapter two postelection violence 2007 how deep

commission as the commission to investigate postelection vi olence cipev deems necessary these are the basic terms of reference of the commission this chapter examines the roots of the post2007 electio ns violence in kenya while the main report contains the narra tive findings and recommendations this chapter draws the views expressed at consultative meet ing which the commission held with group of kenyan experts on 26 au gust 2008 and also from other studies and reports on the subjec t specifically it attempts to isolate factors that explain the causes of the violence and why it escalated as it did these factors demonstrate also how and why violence has become way of life in kenya country once known for peace prosperity and its potential for development we enumerate these factors below the first is the growing politicization and proliferation of violence in kenya over the years specifically the institutionalization of violen ce following the legalization of multiparty democracy in 1991 over this deliberate use of violence by politicians to obtain power since the earl 1990s plus the decision not to punish perpetrators has led to culture of impunity and const ant escalation of violence this in turn has caused further diffusio n of violence in the country which now is largely outside of the contro l of the state and its security agencies thus violence has become factor not just of election s but in everyday life what this means in practice is that viol ence is widespread and can be tapped for variety of reasons including but not exclusively to win elections 23second is the growing power and personalization of power round the presidency this has had twofold impact first it has gi ven rise to the view among politicians and the general public that it is essenti for the ethnic group from which they come to win the presidency in order to ensure access to state resources and goods second it also has led to deliberat denudation of the authority and legitimacy of other oversight institutions th at could check abuses of power and corruption and provide some accountability and at the same time be seen by the public as neutral arbiters with respect to tentious issues such as disputed elections results as result in many respects the state agencies are not seen as legitimate third is feeling among certain ethnic groups of historical marginalization arising from perceived inequities concerni ng the allocation of land and other national resources as well as access to public goods and servi ces this feeling has been tapped by politicians to articula grievances about historical injustices which resonate with certain sections of the public this has created an underlying climate of tension and hate and the potenti for violence waiting to be ignited and to explode fourth is the increasing problem of growing population of poor unemployed and youth educated and uneducated who agree to join m ilitias and organized gangs these gangs have been alleged to intersect with parts of the government and the security forces these groups now have become shado w governments in the slums and even in other parts of the country and h ave been used by politicians to attack their opponents to secure their own security and to gain power furthermore these proliferating militias also are said sometimes to dovetail with the state and its security apparatus thereby not only reducing the states capacity to control the violence but also increasingly threatening the integrity of the state and the nation this underlying demic situation has created climate where violence is increa singly likely to be used and where its use is increasingly unlikely to be checked 24the use of political violence violence was part and parcel of the colo nial state which used it to ensure control after independence president jomo kenyatta u sed both the carrot and the stick to maintain power with the use of violence mainly concentrated in the hands of the state rather than outside of it opposition parties were subjected to political harassment and those individuals who refused to support the status quo experienced various types of repression and even deten tion without trial rallies by students and others were dispersed by the gsu usi ng force the government is believed even to have be responsible for the murder of three political figures pio gamma pinto tom mb oya and jm kariuki the last two of whom were viewed as threats to the then regime and potenti contenders for political power at the same time indi vidual members of the opposition were weaned back to the fold through appointments to govern ment positions and allocations of land as well as provision of other perks for variety of reasons repression unde r kenyas second president daniel arap moi became more draconian first he did not start off with the same array of resources eg land civil service jobs and buoyant coffee boom available to kenyatta to reward his supporters and th general public second in 1982 he experienced an attempted coup agains t him this followed an unsuccessful attempt by parts of the kiambu kikuyu ite in 1978 to keep him from becoming the president for both reasons and pe rhaps for others violence including detentions without trial and the routine torture of p erceived and real dissenters became institutionalized early on under mois rule this i n turn generated groundswell of dissent against his rule by growing opposition movement including politicians lawyers students an d others from all parts of the country as well as members of the kikuyu from central province whose economic power he tried and partially succeeded in decimating president mois ctions were designed to destroy the economic base of his opponents and to bolster his own 25position and that of hi s supporters who were mainly drawn from his kamatusa4 allies from the marginal areas in the period leading up to independence and through to 19 64 when kadu was dissolved and its members joined kanu kadu had campaigned for federal system of government known by the swah ili name of majimbo in part to protect the members of the smaller tribes from the numer ical power of the larger ethnic groups such as the kikuyu and luo to consolidate hi s base after becoming the president moi rewarded his supporters pa rticularly the kalenjin through appointments to political offices and with jobs i n the public service and the military rightly or wrongly these individuals given these were viewed by president mois opponents as not qualified or competent as the opposition to mois leadership gr ew over the years civil society became increasingly vocal and donors increased pressure on him including through the use of financial sanctions to democratize in the end president moi very reluctantly agreed to allow multiparty mocracy in 1991 and he presided over two multiparty elections during his ru one in 1992 and another in 1997 although he agreed to multiparty democracy president moi did not accept the idea that through this he might lose the presidency thus it was in this period in the 1990s that violence became institutionalized dur ing presidential and parliamentary elections under the amended constitution to win the presidency president moi needed to win his parliamentary seat obta in majority of the votes cast in the country and receive 25 of the votes cast in five provinces in both the presidential and parliamentary elections the opp osition to president moi and to the then ruling party kanu consisted mainly f nonkamatusa voters various reports covering elections held during this period alleged that high ranking political figures civil servan ts and others close to the heart of the government organized and used violent gang s to intimidate people in areas of potential opposition support most of whom were kikuyu lu luhya kamba 4 acronym for kalenjin maasai turkana and samburu 26and other groups 5 the strategy was to keep opposition supporters from voting and the means used was to hire gangs in the rift valley and elsewhere to kill people and displace individuals from their home areas so that kamatusa candidates could win and president moi co uld be assured of obtaining 25 of the vote in five provinces the majority of the votes cast for the president and the majority of elected members of parliament in short violence became means of securing political power and winning elections elections related violence occurred not just in 1992 but so in 1997 in spite of the death and destruction that these methods caused and th reports from ngos such as the kenya human rights commission hum an rights watch and two government inquiries the kiliku parliamentary co mmittee and akiwumu commission one was ever pu nished for this wanton killing and destruction even though names of perpetrators to be investigat ed and those adversely mentioned were contained in the reports of both commissions the akiwumi report was not made public unti l 2002 even though it was published in 1999 this led to culture of impunity whereby those who maime d and killed for political ends were never brought to ju stice this changed kenyas political landscape with regard to elections point noted by human rights watch each of these reports implicated politicians as the organizers of the violence and killing for political ends and noted th at the warriors and gangs of youth who took action were both paid and pressed into service aside from this youths were sometimes promised land and jobs afte r evicting up country dwellers however from testimony in the akiwumi report it is not clear if they got either pattern had been established of forming groups and using extrastate vio lence to obtain political power and of not being punished for it 5 see ncck the cursed arrow organized violence against democracy in kenya april 1992 republic of kenya report of the parliamentary select

lai kipia district moved to nairobi and became members of mungiki which up throu gh the 1980s had been largely cultural cum religious cult in the kikuyu inh abited parts of the rift valley later it metamorphosed into mafioso style gang that grew and eventually became shadow government in the slums of nai robi and in parts of central province initially the mungiki were seen as substit uting for lack of public services in the slums later it started bullying individuals and businesses including matatus and owners of real estate into making payments for services which it would provide including connecting elect ricity providing pit latrines and meting out justice mung iki and other gangs across the country eg taliban chinkororo kamjeshi baghdad boys and m any others grew and multiplied within the context of political culture that both used and tolerated extra state violence gangs and militias continued to proliferate all over the country thereby increasing the presence of institutionalized extrastate violence both during and after elections pattern that continued to increase up t hrough the 2007 elections even after president mwai kibaki took over pow er in 2002 up through to the last elections mungiki and other political gangs contin ued to sell their services of violence on willing buyer will ing seller basis as late as 2007 long after the government had banned number of gangs including mungiki they continued to operate with their leader maina njenga tell ing his followers to engage in more robberies to compensate for the decrease in revenue from their traditional matatu shakedown operations that had occurred as result of the crackdown by the government as extra state violent gangs began to pr oliferate and continued to be used by politicians the political terrain was tran sformed violence trickled down into daily life and the state longer commanded the monopo ly of force it once had in previous era as such diffused extra state violence existed all over the country where it could be called up and tapped at any time including being used to arbitrate over elections as it has been doing s ince the early 1990s once 28the government itself used both its own and extra stat violence for partisan political ends it lost its legitimacy was not seen as dispassionate and consequently has been unable either to maintain peace and security or to reform itself the personalization of presidential power and the iberate weakening of public institutions power has been personalized around the presidency and thi s has been increased by changes in the constitution under ea ch president since independence laws are routinely passed to increase execut ive authority and those laws seen as being in the way are often changed or ev ignored by 1991 the constitution had been amended about 32 times amon g the amendments was the insertion of section 2a which made kenya jure one party state until that provision was repealed in 1991 even following the elec tion of kibaki in 2002 still rules were ignored within ministries leading to fi nancial scandals such as anglo leasing and others underscoring the once again th fact that the personal power of the president and his close associates trumped the law hen ce as noted in the akiwumi report and in number of arti cles on kenya politics the checks and balances normally associated with demo cracies are very weak in kenya and are deliberately so individuals in various pa rts of government whether in the civil service the judiciary and even in parl iament understand that irrespective of the laws the executive arm of government determines what h appens hence the state is not seen as neutral but as the preserve of those in power the above syndrome has had various consequences the first is sense of lawlessness that has led to government institutions and officials being seen as lack ing in integrity and autonomy one result of this in the 2007 election was the perception by sections of the pub lic that government institutions and officials including the judiciary we re not independent of the presidency were not impartial and lacked integrity henc they were perceived as not able to conduct the election fairly that public secto r institutions were 29seen as biased and unlikely to follow the rules increased the tendency to violence among members of the public furthermore as the akiwum i report and other sources demonstrated members of the prov incial administrati on and the police also understood that it was sometimes in the interest of their personal survival to follow what they understood to be th directives or inclinations of either the president or mps in their areas rather than to uphold th law this led to some officials not following the law themselves and sections of the provincial administration and security forces even engaging in acts of violence themselves the second is the perception on the part of the public t hat given the power of the president and the political class everythi ng flows not from laws but from the presidents power and personal decisions this also has led the public to believe person from their own tribe must be in power both t secure for them benefits and as defensive strategy to keep other ethnic grou ps should these take over power from taking jobs land and entitlements all of this has led to acquisition of presidential power being seen both by politicians and the public as zero sum game in which losing is seen as hugely costly and is not accepted hence there is tendency on the part of variety of political actors to do anything including engaging in violence to obtain or retain political power leading to what one specialist has called race to the bottom be cause of fear of being dominated by other ethnic groups and being subjected to the associated consequences of that this has created climate of fear and spicions which politicians easily exploit and use to mobilize violence the attempt to reduce the personal power that had been accumulated by former president moi initially was the reason opposition forces sought to introduce the post of prime minister this culminated in an informal memorandum of understanding mou before the 2002 ection between the then opposition coalition under which the coalition agreed to introduce th post of prime minister after the election once elected however pres ident kibaki reneged on the mou discussions continued concer ning constitutional change and the devolution of power the kibaki gove rnment then came up with draft constitution put forward by attorney ge neral amos wako watering down some 30of the provisions in the draft agreed to during the boma s discussions the wako draft was put to the public at referendum in 20 05 where voters rejected it as soon as the mou was scuttled group led by raila od inga left the narc coalition government presidents kiba ki government was perceived as being unwilling to abide by its preelection agreement with its partners and as retreating into an ethnic enclave this was criticized by th public and was seen as an attempt by the socalled mount kenya mafia to keep power to itself rather than share it even though the mou was not gal agreement the kibaki governments turning away from it and removing from government the group of ministers associat ed to odinga had the effect of increasing the polarization of politics along ethnic lines even though t he 2005 referendum was peaceful and the results were accepted rather than contested the parameters were nevertheless drawn with the ethnic political fault lines clearly drawn after 2005 and the need to win the presidency seen as paramount tensions began to mount the post election violence therefore is in part consequence of the failure of president kibaki and his first government to exert poli tical control over the country or to maintain sufficient legiti macy as would have allowed civilized contest with him at the polls to be possible kibakis regim failed to unite the country and allowed feelings of marginal ization to fester into what became the post election violence he and his then government were co mplacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority kikuyu community and failed to heed the vi ews of the legitimate leaders of other communities land and inequality kenya consists of 42 ethnic groups wh live in eight provinces many areas outside the major cities and towns are relatively homoge neous ethnically problems of inequality and marginalization thus are often viewed in ethno geographic terms even though the inequalities between ind ividuals of the same 31ethnic group are sometimes more pron ounced than those between different ethnic groups and geographic areas studies done elsewhere have not found that the presence of large number of ethnic groups or inequ ality per explains large scale violence even though most of the violence in the rift valley has occurred mainly in ethnically mixed settlement schemes apart from this citizens everyplace are concerned that r esources including land and services are distributed equitably and are qu ick to point out inequities constitutionally individuals may own land in any place in kenya and in law part of the country belongs to an ethnic group nevertheless this phenomenon is facto characteristic of many areas particularly as many of the newly created districts since the nineteen nineti have been ethnosp ecific leading to the creation of ethnically homogenous effective native res erves this in turn has created the notion of insiders wh are native to place and outsiders who have migrated there notion that s been tapped by aspiring politicians this raises the question of the balance between group interests and the rights of individuals as entrenched in the constitu tion problem that also has crept into slums such as kibera and mathare wh ich are now informally divided into ethnically homogeneous zones apart from the above gross corruption in the acquisiti on registration and administration of land matters has been major problem in kenya the ndungu report noted that throughout the 1980s and 1990s public land was illegally and irregularly allocated in total disreg ard of the public interest and in circumstances that fly in the face of the law6 land grabbing and the allocation of public land as political patronage were part of the gross corruption of this period those involved in this allocation were sen ior public servants but also local land boards the courts and range of officials including members of the provincial administration politician s and others land allocations were therefore used to reward politically correct individuals 7 and became heavily 6 republic of kenya report of the commission of inquiry into the illegal irregular allocation of pubic land the ndungu report nairobi government printer june 2004 p 8 7 abovep 14 32politicized given that the recommendations of the ndungu report were never implemented this has increased the sense of frustration in attempting to deal with land tenure disputes the fact that institutions which could have been used to resolve land disputes have not been impartial has encouraged individuals to take matters into their own hands and to use violence t resolve them furthermore as land is an emotive issue politicians have capitalized on issues surrounding it including encourag ing violence during elections in discussions of postelection violence many kalenjins argue that it is product of longstanding anger over land distribution follow ing independence they argue that land was alienated by th colonial government and then unfairly parcelled out to kikuyus and other groups whom they view s outsiders many kalenjins believe that issues relating to land were the reas on for both the pre electoral violence in the 1990s and the post election vio lence after the december 2007 elections8 others including the akiwumi re port dismiss this explanation pointing out that individuals from differ ent groups lived side by side for many years until the advent of multi party demo cracy when violence was used to kill and displace opposition party voters to keep them from voting hence the report argues that even though the promise of getting land from those wh were displaced was used to entice youth into violence the desire for political power and not land hunger was the causal factor notwithstanding these views the ndungu report noted tha t there has been corruption in the misallocation of land both in settle ment schemes in the countryside and in the urban areas hence there is land issue which needs to be addressed particularly in parts of the country which re not ethnically homogeneous even now this mentality an d the fear that accompanies it has led to type of quasi residential apartheid as kenyans move into more ethnically homogeneous areas even within urban centers and towns 8 see the statements of two cw 78 and 79 and exhibit 78 prepared by the emo foundation 33beyond the above another issue that looms on the horizon is that some communities have done better than others which are poorer less well developed and more marginalized from the mainstream this in turn has generated feelings of resentment and powerlessness sentiments that can and have been mobilized violently furthermore there is larg and growing underclass of urban poor who are not landowners and are unlikely ever to be lando wners the tendency has been to think of kenya almost exclusi vely as agrarian and of land issues as paramount even though the number of kenyans living in urban areas is increasing tendency likely to continue unemployed youth although kenyas population growth rate has been reduced and is now reportedly down to 3 it still has an estimated two million youth who are unemployed furthermore between 1992 and 1996 the num ber of street children increased 300 in just four years many of these initially rootless children who are now adults are the product of displace ment by ethnic violence they have grown up on the streets and are inured to violence something that is clearly very dangerous in addition although many youth speak english something that has raised their expectations they have hope of formal sector employment the combination of being rootless having survi ved amidst violence plus their need for an identity and livelihood makes the m ready recruits for violent gangs which exist all over ke nya and are tapped by politicians particularly but not exclusively during elections the gangs are devoid of ideology and operate on willing bu yer willing seller basis given the hierarchical nature of gangs and the upwardly mobile hopes of their members to become as well off as their leaders youth can be mobilized for variety of reasons not just to meet their daily needs t his in itself is very dangerous situation helping to explain why since the 1990s violent gangs have proliferated all over kenya 34additionally there is also growing problem of unemplo yment among youth who are university educated estimated to be around 40000 year given that only 150000 formal sector jobs have been cr eated since 2003 raising the spectre of whether these individuals will also be ready to engage i n violence as well if they are unable to find work9 violent gangs consisting mainly of unem ployed youth have b een mobilized into gangs along ethnic lines their power to the point of having become shadow governments in many areas stems from two sources first as the main aim of government in the 1990s was to mobilize political support to gain and maintain political power good deal of revenue was spent on patron age rather than on maintaining infrastructure and providing social services this meant that the country started to crumble visually evident in the decay of roads and the proliferation of uncollected garbage even in the capit city of nairobi which once had been called the city in the sun this crumbling as well as decline in social services and security also paved the way for violent gangs which provided them this gave unemployed youth work albeit within gangs and made the latter extremely powerful over time these gangs operated as mafioso shakedown gangs with violence and impunity as they continue to do increasingly citizens began to ask who was in charge of kenya gangs or the government while one might have expected that the po lice could have dealt with the increase in violent gangs operating as virtual sh adow states in so many parts of the country the government has been ineffective in dealing wit h them for several reasons first many politicians themse lves have used these violent gangs to decimate their opponents to protect themselves from dictatorial state in the 1990s and to gain power then and now this has itself given gangs such as mungiki the taliban chinkororo and others life an d the ability to operate without fear of being caught second by the time government was serious about banning the groups they were large controlled number of areas and 9 the numbers come from an experts discussion in the consultative meetings with the commission on 26 august 2008 for other discussions of youth see who is guilty youth perspectives on the 2007 pre ͳpolls electoral violence in kenya nairobi the youth agenda nd peter m kagwanja power to uhuru youth identity and generational violence in kenyas 2002 elections african affairs 105 418 january 2003 pp 25 ͳ49 35continued to operate in spite of the bans third securi ty forces including police often were victims of these gangs themselves and used draconia n but ineffective force against them furthermore the fact that both the police and military are perceived historically to have been recruited along ethnic lines to protect the particular government of the day has increased the likelihood of th eir breaking down along ethnic lines in crisis and being either unable or unwilling to maintai n law and order impartially this meant that post election violence prolif erated and intensified for number of months and that politicians and businessmen allegedly chose to hire gangs of youth to fight their atta ckers rather than call in forces whose loyalties could not necessarily be counted on the post election period infused gangs of unemployed youth with more power than before and has given them an added currency while cl early there is problem of youth who grow up in slums and make their li ving by joining gangs because of lack of good alternatives an d the prospects of up ward mobility the issue is not one of poverty alone inst ead this situation intersects with other phenomena including that of weak in stitutions ethnic polarization and the willingness of the political class to hire gangs to engage in violence to obtain political power furthermore the power of these gangs shoul d not be underrated including their ability to force other poor willing youth to join them as they remain unchecked grow and along with oth er forces threaten the integrity of state and nation in this nse youth are both being exploited and have become exploiters themselves conclusion all of the above factors have dovetailed to make violenc the method of choice to resolve range of political differences and to obtain po litical power furthermore because the violence surro unding elections has been ethnically directed this has increased distrust among different grou ps and vastly eroded any sense of national identity hence ethnicity has now t aken on dangerous 36and negative connotation the basic issue fa cing the nation is how to deal with these issues attempts have been made to crack down on gangs and half heartedly to reform institutions neither has been successful in part because the government has not been serious has not been willing t address generic issues or underlying causes of violence furthermore the main perpetrators of systemic violence have never been prosecuted currently kenya is at critical juncture violence is endemic out of control is used routinely to resolve poli tical differences and threatens the future of the nation because of the ethnic natu re of the postelection violence ethnic fears and hatred have been elevated in importance and coul d turn violent again even more easily than has happened in the past what is r equired to address the points discussed above is political will and some basic decisions to change the way politics is conducted as well as to address its intersectio n with other issues related to land marginalization and inequality and uth short of that violence including that related to elections will continue to app ear and will be ignited ever more readily kenya needs to decide if it wishes to let viol ence corruption and powerless institutions prevail or to in troduce fundamental change simply put the individuals and institutions who have benefited in the short term from the chaos and violence need to give up the methods they have used or kenya could become failed state the report which follows is dedicated to discussing the commissions findings on the post 2007 elections viol ence and making recommendations on transforming the current situation 37 chapter three violence in rift valley province the north rift region introduction the north rift region comprises the dist ricts of uasin gishu trans nzoia west trans nzoia east nandi north nandi south marakwet keiyo baringo north and baringo south the evidence made available to the commission in relation to those districts is examined below but more so in re lation to uasin gishu and trans nzoia which experienced the epicentre of the post election violence in that region the uasin gishu district covers an area of 3218 square kilometres it borders lugari district of western province to the west to the east it borders keiyo marakwet and koibatek on the southern side it borders nandi north and nandi south districts the trans nzoia districts of east and west are in the north it shares small boundary with kipkelion at its south east erly tip the district is divided into six administrative division s namely turbo soy moiben ainabkoi kesses and kapsaret politically it has 3 constituencies namely eldoret north eldoret east and eldoret so uth it has three local authorities namely the municipal council of eldoret the county council of waren g and the town council of burnt forest at an annual growth rate of about 4 the population of uasin gishu estimated at 744083 in 1999 is currently close to one million peo ple and fair mix of all kenyan communities the districts economy is agricultural based there are few industries in eldoret which is the di strict headquarters eldoret town is the c m m r c i l h u b f t h n r t h r i f t r g i n i t i s w l l l i n k d t t h r s t f t h 38country by rail air and road networks it has many institu tions of higher learning referral hospital and other vital installation such as the kenya pipeline oil depot which serves some of the neighbouring countries more than in any other part of the country with the excep tion of the molo district in central rift violence in nort h rift bore resemblance to previous cycles of election related ethnic violence it is worth noting that the akiwumi report and the question related to acting upon its recomme ndation were most discussed in our hearings on the nort h rift the commission therefore felt necessary to examine the pattern actors and consequences of the 2007 post election violence in this region in the general context of the legacy of ethnic clashes experienced during previous election periods preelection period and the legacy of the 1990s state sp onsored violence previously the north rift had experienced serious viole nce before the presidential and parliamentary election s of 1992 and 1997 in 2007 the main difference was that the violence was more intense more w idespread was urban as well as rural lasted longer and occurred after rather than before the elections the north rift is one of the regions which was investigated and extensively covered in the akiwumi report10 according to that report the clashes broke out in tinderet division in nandi district on 29 october 1991 before spreading out to other parts of the rift valley paragraphs 90 and 91 of the report summarize the general nature of the violence and are reproduced be low 90 in each clash area nonkalenjin or nonmaasai as the case may be were suddenly attacked their houses set on fire the ir properties looted and in certain instances some of them were eithe r killed or severely injured with traditional weapons like bows and arrows spears pangas swords and clubs the raiders were well organized 10 exhibit 134 pg 59 189 39and coordinated their attacks were generally under the cov er of darkness and where the attackers were in broad daylight the raiders would smear their faces with clay to conceal thei r identities the attackers targeted mainly the kikuyu but also the kisii the luhya and the luo other nonkalenjin and nonmaasai comm unities were not spared the attacks were barbaric callous nd calculated to drive out the targeted groups from their farms to cr ipple them economically and to psychologically traumatize them many of the victims were forced to camp in schools church compound s and shopping centres there they lived in makeshift structur of polythene sheets cardboard and similar materials th ey had little food and belongings with them and lived in poor sanitary conditions with their children who could longer go to school ther was also general lack of concern by the provincial administration and the police force for their security and general welfare 91 in general the clashes started and ended sudde nly and left trail of destruction suffering and disruption of life hit herto unknown in this country the causes of the clashes have been given as conflict over land cattle rustling political differences and ecol ogical reasons among others as stated elsewhere in this report these reasons were proffered to conceal the real motive or reason for th clashes the akiwumi commission came to the conclusion that there were three underlying reasons for the clashes 1 ambitions by kalenjins of recovering what they think they lost when the europeans forcibly acquired their ancestral land 2 the desire to remove foreigners derogatorily referred to as madoadoa or spots from their midst the reference was mainly towards the kikuyu kisii luo and other communities who had found permanent residence in the rift valley 3 political and ethnic loyalty the akiwumi commission also came to th conclusion that the security forces and the provincial administration were ne gligent and unwilling to take firm and drastic action to prevent the clashes from erupting or nce these erupted to 40bring quick end to them tribal leaders and politicians were also found to have instigated the clashes11 recommendations were made to prevent the future recurrence f violence including recommendations for the in vestigations of named individuals suspected to have had hand in the violence but the fin dings and recommendations of that commission as related to the r ift valley were rejected by sections of the government of the da and there followed further visible action on the report12 build up of tension although several government officials test ified that the lead up to the elections was peaceful and did not experience any violence there was also evidence that in the lead up to the elections all was not well for example the dc for uasin gishu bernard kinyua started by saying th at in his district polling was smooth very smooth indeed the smoothest i have ever seen however when specific incidents were put to him he acknowledg ed that there were violent skirmishes before the elections and these contribute d to an atmosphere of everescalating tension these incidents included the burning in eldoret of vehicle belonging to the brookside factory on 26th december on suspicions later disproved that stuffed ballots were stored in the premises of the company the attempts to burn another vehicle belonging to bus company mololine on t he same day and for the same reason and the suspension two days earlier of th transportation of people to and from eldoret by bus operators who feared for the safety of their vehicles witnesses testified that election eering continued throughout the period after the conclusion of the refere ndum exercise on the proposed new 11 exhibit 134 paragraph 524 12 exhibit 134 b 41constitution in 2005 and that on all sides of the political divide inciteful utterances were made by politicians and their cronies as part of the campaigns according stephen ikua the koibatek dc the kalenjin p eople were made to believe that they had been marginalized by the government and that their people had been removed from government positions unfairly the nsis district co ordinator for uasin gishu informed the commission that during the 2005 referendum the kalenjin viewed the kikuyu as arrogant nd also felt that the kikuyu looked down upon them notwithstanding the fac t that the kalenjin were host to large number of kikuyu peop the dc for koibatek confirmed the extension of campaigns beyond the refere ndum period and also that there was build up of tension resulting from the messages that were livered as part of the campaigning although he was not able to furnish the commission with single example to verify his claims he added that during the campaigns vernacular radio stations were involved in the incitement of people along ethnic lines the majimbo debate was particularly divisive as it brought back the issues of recovery of ancestral land by the kalenjins and rem oval of foreigners madoadoa from the land all underlying reasons for the 1990s cla shes according to the uasin gishu dc bernard kinyua reference s to madoadoa were used frequently even in normal discourse within the district as the political temperature rose so did incident s of violent confrontations between the political actors before election day as discussed later in all those preelection incidents of violence one was arrested and those who wer were released without any charges or prosecution although it was the impression of many wi tnesses that violence in the north rift began on 30 december 2007 immediat ely after the electoral commission of kenya eck announced the presidential re sults of the 27 december polls there was evidence that violence had began even before the election results were announced for example the dc for nandi south mabeya mog aka testified that violence in his district had begun on 29th december the delay in the announcement of the results of the presidential elections allegations of problems in the conduct of the election by both local nd foreign observers the view that any odm loss would be the resu lt of rigging and hence illegitimate as 42well as incendiary remarks and hate sp eech by politicians fm local media stations and the public had built up noticeable tensions in many parts of the country the commission established that this was so also in uasin gishu district which was the epicenter of the violence nature and extent of violence various administrative officials and senio r police officers in the north rift who testified before us reported that massive violence all across uasin gishu district in particular as well as in various parts of nandi and elsewhere erupted suddenly immediately after the eck announced the presid ential results on 30 december in uasin gishu the violence entailed large marauding gangs of 10002000 kalenjin youth brandishin g machetes bows and poisonous arrows occasional firearms matches and projecti filled with petrol these menacing gangs blocked and manned variety of road s with trees trunks and huge rocks some of which were transported by tractors throughout the district they also burned vehicles and tyres while refusing to allow anyone t pass as well as engaging in killing rioting and looting13 this included numerous simultaneous attacks and cutting off all five entran ces to eldoret town other roads and highways as well as the main artery to kisumu and uganda and beyond from timboroa to turbo the director of moi teaching and re ferral hospital prof harun mengech mentioned that some road blocks were established as early as 29 december the violence was so overwhelming that for some time long term trade was at standstill with supplies going in or out of uganda an d eastern congo the provincial security and inte lligence committee psic finally decided to call in the military to clear the blocked highways and other feeder roads including 13 from testimonies of cw 59 60 67 74 81 82 83 84 85 86 also exhibit 125 pp61 ͳ69 testimony from numerous other eye witnesses interviewed by commission investigators 43escorting public service vehicles psvs and tankers from the eldoret pipeline to the kenya uganda border security pe rsonnel deployed by the ocpd also assisted in protecting life and property guarding idp camps and transferring them from the interior to safer locations in the centre the barricades in town were so severe that according to p rof mengech he tried unsuccessfully twice to get to his hosp ital on 30 december first through the mois bridgematunda route and then thro ugh the ziwa route in each case he encountered youths estimated to be between 1520 years old who were blocking the roads and who wa rned him he might not make it to the hospital it took until 2 january 2008 for prof mengech to reach the hospital and then only when the dc and the police gave him an armed escort within eldoret town the less well off areas of munyaka silas and langas estates experienced heavy violence with former internat ional athlete lucas sang killed according to evidence presented by the knch r yamumbi farm area near to eldoret was also seriously affected kalenj in raiders torched houses owned by kikuyus there two deaths ensued with one person dying in the presence of two police officers who had invaded the vict ims home according to the evidence the kalenjin gangs reportedly came from the rural areas to attack kikuyu residents in eldoret town14 the former ocpd for eldoret division angelus karuru told the commission that on 30 december his office began rece iving reports from all over the district of arson theft the dest ruction and looting of property and the taking of livestock outside of town gangs with cr ude weapons also barricaded access to various sites including farming communi ties in the largely kikuyu inhabited settlement schemes here mostly unsuspecting and terrified vict ims were suddenly overwhelmed by large numbers of kalenjin youth who set fire to their compounds burned and stole their possessions as well as m aiming gang raping and hacking to death large numb ers of defenseless families most of whom were kikuyu the dc said that th main areas affected were kiambaa 14 exhibit 125 44rurigi rukuini kiamumbi moiben division matunda in soi division and the area around turbo the nature of violence was best rendered in personal stories the victims and eye witnesses told

beta farm the kalenjins set houses on fire as they retreated overall though both the police and members of communiti perceived to be both foreigners and pnu sympathizers kikuyu and kisii in particular were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the violence and the numb er of the attackers those who escaped death ran to seek refuge in places they thought would be safe including churches police statio ns schools and mosques among these many tragic stories the incident which captured the attention of both kenyans and the world was the deliberate burning alive of mostl kikuyu women and children huddled together in church in kiambaa on 1 january 2008 they had sought refuge in the church following 30 december attack on their village of kimuri bordering kiambaa according to reports including witness testimony mattresses and blankets were set ablaze wi th petrol and thrown into the building while mothers and babies who were trying to flee the infer were pushed back into the church kikuyu men

others escaped and survived with major cuts and inside were so many dead and others burned beyond recognition and some escaped severely burnedi saw many that i know them for many ye ars but the constitution of this country was made for kalen jin because they are able to kill burn houses and also to loot livestock nd there is law to prosecute them16 although many attempts were made to quell the violence in uasin gishu district the testimony of government officials to the commission is t hat it continued 16 the commission was informed that this particular incident is now the subject of court trial nakuru high court criminal case 34 of 2008 republic v stephen leting and 3 others and 4 persons have been charged with 8 counts of murder 48almost unremittingly with increasing numbers of idps pour ing into camps according to officials violence did not abate until the peace accord between the two political aspirants for the presiden cy mwai kibaki and raila odinga was signed in nairobi but even after this according to the dc bernard kinyua they still continued to experience all sorts of incidents the commission also received evidence on the nature and extent of violence in the areas contiguous to uasin gishu including nandi north and nandi south districts in his sworn testimony the former dc for nandi north mabeya mogaka told the commission that there had been tension in the district for s m t i m i n p r t t h r s u l t f l u h s h v i n g b u g h t l n d i n k p k n g n i kipkaren and chepkumia as well as tw luhya candidates having been cleared to contest parliamentary seat someth ing that was not accepted by prominent nandi personalities in the district he also noted that the administration had expected trouble including violence if ei ther luhya candidate won the election according to the dc violence erupted i mmediately after the presidential results were announced on 30 december but had already started b efore then on 29 december overall the violence led to 1475 homes being bu rned and destroyed and 7800 people being displaced even th ough one person died in the end only 12 individuals were arrested despite all the violence and destruction violence was directed at pnu supporters govern ment departments and houses and the ethnically mixed baraton university with the worst destruction occurring after the newly elected mp for ainamoi was shot dead on 31 january 2008 the commission was also told that at the height of the violence the provincial administration allowed demonstration of 70000 indivi duals from nandi north and south to take place in kapsabet after having engaged w ith 12 nandi elders to ensure that it was peaceful the mere idea of larg demonstration was threatening enough to the displaced to make many of them move to the police station for safety while numerous kikuyu and kisii asked f or assistance to leave something we were told the district administratio n helped them do 8000 49idps who had taken refuge in the kapsabet police statio n and other in the kabiyet police station were also bein g threatened and therefore were moved17 impact of the violence according to district commissioner kinyua and ssp karuru 205

of individuals with almost 30 being betwee n 21 and 30 the range in age of those who were injured and died was between 3 to 85 the numb ers include those from hospitals outside the district as the moi teaching and referral hospital is the only one with mortuary and henc when bodies were found they were brought there even then some victims of the violence nev er made it to any hospital which accounts for the higher numbers of 205 dead in district in the police registry mentioned by the dc for uasin gishu 51the commission also heard testimony ab out the impact of the post election violence

commission witness 63 53violence in endebbes which was involved in the ethnic cl ashes in 1992 and 1997 stemmed from spillover from the conflict in mount elgon and consequent attacks by sdlf militia response by police and provincial administration in accordance with our terms of reference one of the ma in areas of our inquiry was to find out whether and to what extent the local administration and police were prepared for the violence that erupted and how t hey ultimately responded to it we shall now discuss the evidence presented before us in this area which indicates that the police and the loca l administration were caught totally unprepared by the violence we shall ex amine the police respon in light of the availability of intelligence information indicating the high likelihood of violence we shall conclude this section by discussing whether violence in n orth rift was planned or spontaneous with prior planning as was th testimony of local administration officials the provincial administration and security forces this issue is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this repo rt we shall limit ourselves to aspects particular to acts and omissions attribut ed to the police and the administration in the north rift according to bernard kinyua uasin gishus district commissioner and the ocpd of keiyo division previously ocpd of eldoret division angelus karu rus testimonies before us the dsic was prep ared for the possibility of preelection violence including the likelihood of some celebratory violence after the election in uasin gishu however they did t anticipate widesp read postelection violence had not developed contingency pl ans for it and had not beefed up their existing force of 600 police officers19 their testimony to the commission was nevertheless that they were ready even though when the violence erupted they 19 the dc admitted in his testimony that the ratio of the districts police to population was not up to international standards 54were forced to call in reinforcements from baringo west pokot and nairobi for contingents of gsu the antistock unit the administrative police ap and some military personnel resident of langas estate in eldore t told commission investigators that the police there were generally ineffective and unable to contr ol roving gangs which surrounded the estate until the police commissioner arrived by helicopter with gsu reinforcements20 that view has the support of local religious leader who asserted that the security forces we re powerless against the violence and furthermore there were ethnic divisions amongst them21 once reinforced the district used its forces to unblock the ma in arteries and to disperse the gangs of young kalenjin attackers in town and sewhere in conjunction with the dcs office they also assisted victims by br inging them to idp camps which initially were established in the area at the as k showground in eldoret at 8 camps in the mau forest and in mathare later they took the initiative to move them out of hostile rural areas when they received intelligence that ka lenjin warriors were planning to attack and evict idps from the camps themse lves the commission was given evidence that the police were obviou sly overwhelmed by criminal gangs who proceeded in larg numbers and appeared to plan their attacks roadblocks were manned and security forces and health care providers denied free movement this hampered th police ability to rescue distressed victims of the attacks the first time dist rict officials heard of plans by kalenjin youth to attack the kiambaa farm for instance was durin g dsic meeting on 31 december 2007 according to the oc pd his office imme diately dispatched officers to the area however because the access road wa s heavily blocked with rocks and old tractors at the turnoff to kiambaa on th nakuru eldoret road they could not proceed by the time they arrived the church at kiambaa had been burned to the ground with the charred remains of th victims still inside 20 commission investigation job sheet 21 cw 74 in camera 55in some cases police on rescue missions faced not just roa d blocks but also attacks by hostile gangs of kalenjin youths the commission heard about an incident in which five policemen in nd rover on mission to assist an old kikuyu man at soi encountered heavy ro ad blocks from huruma to turbo and f r m h u r u m u p t k i t l t h w r r p l l d b g n g s f u t h r m d w i t h bows and arrows and had to return ter to rescue him similar situation ensued at mailu nne on 31 december 2007 in still othe r cases the police themselves were overwhelmed attacked and even killed beyond this the police took two preemptive measures wh ich may have helped to minimize the violence first the opcd for uasin gishu angel us karuru asked all five petrol stations in town to stop selling small am ounts of petrol to individuals as opposed to legitimate motori sts he was acting on intelligence that petrol might have been used to set ki kuyu and kisii houses on fire second upon receiving intelligence of possible attacks on idp ca mps that had been set up in areas where there had been violence also mentioned in nsiss intelligence reports he immediately deployed forces and vehicles to have them moved to safety in town as did some officials in the provincial administration in other parts of the north rift as witness numb er 86 from chegaiya sub location who had lost all his family members and who testified before the commission noted we remained in the administration police camp for four days the attackers continued to attack us even in the camp the kalenjin officers in the camp joined their kinsmen in the attack s and the kikuyu administration police officer had to take rifl from them on the other hand there were numerous reports of the police and other security forces being heavy handed and even worse during the violence they chased group of demonstrators near the moi referral hospital in eldoret and in the process lobbed both tear gas and fired bu llets into the hospital the dc for uasin gishu testifying before the commission denied tha t this had happened saying that the tear gas must have been byproduct of what was used outside the hospital however both the head of the hospital nd its guards told the 56commission that the police tried to enter the hospital by force cross examination revealed that both canister s and bullet casings were found inside the hospital the opcd admitting in his testimony that i t was possible that in fact tear gas and bullets were fired into the hospital the commission also received evidence of numerous other instances of police brutality witnesses spoke under oath of horrifying tales of police brutality and indifference this included police standing by doing nothi ng and not coming to the assistance of individuals and comm unities under attack joining in the attacks including raping already vulnerable victims and t aunting kikuyu victims with one of kibaki s campaign slogans kazi iendelee let the work continue as they stood by watching he lpless victims being attacked in other cases there were reports of victims unde r attack seeking police help and being turned away among many cases the co mmission was able to determine that senior police officer in eldo ret was responsible for pers onally shooting number of individuals the commission visited on such victim at hospital where he had been admitted with wounds sustai ned from gun fire similar allegations were made in the evidence produced by the knchr the commission was told that some ch iefs either passively or actively collaborated with the attackers at least thirteen of t hem were later interdicted after reports against them were made in his sworn testimony the district commissioner of uasin gishu bernard kinyua admitted to having received some information that the chiefs were not helpful nd were not there for the people although he claimed that he had information that chiefs were involved in the violence nor were any names given in the intelligence reports he received22 however evidence received by the commi ssion tells disturbing stories of chiefs either standing by while violence was be ing committed or even actively taking 22 c w 60 57part in the commission of violent acts kikuyu pastor from burnt forest had this to say the young kalenjin men started attacking and shouting t hat non kalenjin had to go we tried telephoning the ocs burnt forest station and the chief countless times nothing happened kikuyu young men started trying to defend themselves there was resp onse the chief arrived with his two police officers who were both kalenjin the ap officers started pushing the kikuyu men back as th kalenjin men burnt houses behind them everyone was pushed to th centre of the kikuyu farm23 moreover resident of kiambaa who testified to the c ommission in private submitted as an exhibit memorandum from residents of uasin gishu identifying by name eight chiefs from ne ethnic group whom they claim had fuelled tribal clashes in 1992 and 1997 who had been threatening people from other communities with eviction during the referendum in 2005 and were frustrating the return of those who were evicted from burnt forest and ainabkoi in short while not denying many instances where police mobi lized quickly to assist victims to quell the violence or where they were verwhelmed the commission also has evidence that in some other cases victim s of post election violence found the very people they thought would help an d defend them as they were under attack participating in the violence themsel ves or indifferent to their plight under these circumstances it is not so surprising that many victims of post election violence chose not to make reports to the police this in itself was another part of the tragic breakdown of law and order and indicative of the lack of integrity of key government institutions including the curity forces and parts 23 statement recorded by commission investigators 58of the provincial administration it is also pattern that supports previous findings from the akiwumi report intelligence concerning postelection violence and its use the national security intelligence servic nsis the provincial security and intelligence committee psic and the district security an d intelligence committee dsic each contributed intell igence information concerning security in kenya before during and after the election befor the election the nsis correctly analyzed the forces at work in the country and said that in the case of either kibaki or odinga loss there wa s strong possibility of post election violence the worst case scenario being if the odm cand idate lost24 some of the preelection intelligence received by the commission from the three agencies predicted the postelection violence which engulfed the rth rift particularly in uasin gishu district the nsiss situation and hot spot anal ysis from june 2007 until february 2008 given to the commission25 mostly concentrates on traditional conflict areas such as trans nzoia molo and othe r parts of the rift and on gangs such as mungiki operating there and elsewhere as early as three months before the elections the nsis warned in its situation report of 2 5 september 2007 that in parts of uasin gishu tension is brewin g between the kalenjin the kikuyu and the kisii following the mugirango skirmishes with some kal enjin tribesmen terming the two communities their political enemies and threatening to evict them it added however with some premonition that viol ence could engulf different parts of the country if cases of incitement are not legally addressed as they emerge 24 exhibit 19a submitted to the commission by the nsis 25 of which are missing situation analysis reports from 25 december 2007 to 2 january 2008 and flashpointshotspots analysis from 24 december 2007 to 11 february 2008 59in its hot spotflash point report of 19 october 2007 the nsis noted that the debate around majimbo was already being used by some politicians in nairobi rift valley and coast provinces scheming and organizing local youth to attack perceived outsiders in order to disenfranc hise them and finally have the incident blamed on majimbo campaigns nsis ad ded that generally the debate has elicited strong antikikuyu sentiment due to the fact that the community is also robustly opposed to the system th same briefing under the heading use of criminal gangs noted that as the campaigns intensify t he possibility of various leaderspoliticians resorting to reactivation and use of such gangs was likely in nairobi nakuru uasin gishu trans nzoia gu siiland kuria and parts of central province on 23 november 2007 nsis noted that in uasin gishu district tension is looming between the kalenjin and the kikuyu within timb oroa area following the arrest of two members of the kikuyu community for circulating anti odm leaflets and on 7 december 2007 nsis warned that in nandi north the nandi and luhya could clash at osrongai area in turbo division w here nandi tribesmen torched houses belonging to luhya to avenge the ki lling of nandi over alleged theft of property it is unclear from what the commission has received and from its examination of the intelligence reports from uasin gishu district whethe r the nsiss analysis and in particular its two case scenar io was communicated downward to the provinces and the districts or not an d why if the violence was planned and organized the nsis either did not have this informat ion or did not transmit it to the field both the dc and the ocpd for uasin gishu testified to the commission that they did not receive any information abou t nsiss two scenarios or potential prob lems if odm did not win however the nsis uasin gishu district coordinator who testified in camera passed on some intelligence information to the dsic about the possibility of pre election violence in kesses as early as 30 october 2007 furthermore he also 60generated security brief on 29 december 2007 which went to the dsic stating that tension was high within uasin gishu district and that there was likelihood of violence targeting the kikuyu community in number of specifically designated spots in the foll owing divisions soy kesses turbo kapsaret eldoret town and ainabkoi26 nevertheless most officials from the rth rift including the dc for uasin gishu who chaired the above 29 december dsic meeting as well s the ocpd for eldoret and other officials testifying before the commission said they did not anticipate postelection violence the commission finds it surprising that provincial administration officials would not anticipate some level of post election violence while they were are that the preelectio n period had been extremely tense filled with incendiary language hate spe ech innuendoes concerning majimboism and the possibility of evicting utsiders pamphlets threatening war and scattered references to politicians encouraging their supporters to violate the law having survived the 2005 referendum on the constitution wit hout incident and having completed what turned out to be peaceful december 2007 election including the announcement of the pa rliamentary results on 27 and 28 december officials did not think there would be serious p roblems after the election leave alone anticipate the debacle that engulfed the country as bernard kinyua uasin gishu district commissioner noted he had been extremely vigilant and had intensified patrols before the election in areas that had experienced preelection violence in the past such as yamumbi turbo and burnt forest but he did not anticipate th at violence could be on the scale on which it happened he explained in his testimony to the commission that previously nothing like this ever happened adding that i n the past immediately after elections were over people would ttle down to their daily business but this time it was the reverse he said he had covered the distr ict properly and 26 this information is contained in exhibits 66a and 66b 61thought he could handle any situation adding however that in this case it was enormous nothing like what we expected and spontaneous nevertheless he admitted that because of the utterances of some politicians he was aware that there was an expectation of an odm win and that there might be refusal to accept anything else however he said he did not receive any information from the nsis or other agencies of unprece dented upheavals if odm did not win this partly contradicts the intelligence info rmation said to have been relayed to the dsic on 29 december 2007 notwithstanding this reality and similar sentiments conveyed from other officials both in uasin gishu district and in other parts of th north rift there were reports of violence in the run up to the election indicat ive of heightened tensions as well as isolated attacks on businesse s and burning of houses on farms even before the eck announced the presidential results on 30 d ecember this included three houses allegedly having be burned in lelmorok farm in kesses on 29 december an incident about which the ocpd said he was not aware but which resident who had been evicted four times previousl confirmed when he testified to the commission in camera also naming some of those he alleged to be the attackers27 furthermore former resident of outspan estate in eldoret said that the chaos there began as early as 27th december causing her to take refuge in church during the evening in her statement to the commission she said that kalenjins started burning houses belonging to the kikuyus on 28 december on 29 december while checking on her property she was then accosted and raped by three men28 evidence submitted to the commi ssion by knhcr also maintained that some kikuyu buried their possessions be fore the election in anticipation of attacks29 while cross examination of official s from eldoret suggested that some 27 cw 85 28 cw 82 29 exhibit 125 62kikuyus had already left the area between 27th and 29th december to ensure their safety in addition the dc of uasin gishu and t he ocpd of eldoret division noted that some public service ve hicles stopped coming to town as early as 24th december because of allegations that they were ferrying ma rked ballots there were also widespread allegations of rigging in spite of these incidents it is not appa rent that either administrative officials or police refined their intelligence as result nor ap parently was there any sense of the unexpected impending disaster to follow fu rthermore witness from nandi hills told the commission th at there were already tyres being burned on the road from nandi hills to kisumu as of 26th december30 angelus karuru opcd for eldoret division during the ection told the commission there were four incidents before the election which h had effectively contained something that gave him confidence abou t handling whatever might come up du ring and after the election there was shooting incident on 17th november 2007 at cheptiret secondary school during the odms parliamentary and civic nomination s when 200 of the partys supporters blocked the highway to the tallying centre using logs b ig stones and their own motor vehicles the second was at zi wa sirikwa trading center on 27th november 2007 when 100 odm youth disrup ted pnu political rally the third was on 26th december 2007 when local politicians and foreign press stormed the divisional headquarters to inspect molo line company minibus which was alleged falsely it turned out to have brought administrat ion police and ballot boxes to be used to rig the election finally on the sam day in the early evening at keiyo petrol station youths burned pickup truck t ransferring ballots from keiyo division to kaptubei polling center but the police m oved in swiftly to rescue the ballots they also containe d the other incidents but one was 30 cw 84 in camera 63arrested point that was criticized under cross examination as having contributed to culture of impunity31 apart from the lack of anticipation of what might fo llow the testimony by the dc for uasin gishu and the ocpd for eldoret suggests t hat neither followed up on local intelligence and information they knew abou t had they taken the initiative to do so they might have pre empted some of the postelection violence which was experienced it is not clear to the commission if this was because of the lack of capacity or the result of not wanting to tread on the toes of powerful political personalities in the district for fear of retr ibution something which had been noted in the akiwumi report neither the provincial administration nor the police investigated claims of incitement by politicians or media statio ns they claimed they did not know the names of the two prominent athletes who were killed dur ing the post election violence they appeared unwilling to disc uss the ethnicity of their staff they said they did not know or follow up on reports concerning politicians engaged in hostile acts or speech they claimed th ey did not have any information on any chiefs or police as having been involved in the violence they did not look into the source of hostile leaflets being dist ributed they said they did not have reports about which politici ans were using the terms madoadoa and makwekwe even though they had heard about this generally the had information that youths were being trained to engage in violence in contrast witness told the commiss ion that the following threatening terms were routinely used against kikuyu madoadoa spots maharagwe bean bunyot enemy sangara wild grass with the additional notation that they should be uprooted32 when asked if he had followed up on some specific i nformation the ocpd said he had not he argued that it was not the function of the police to follow up on 31 testimony of angelus karuru cw 75 32 see for example testimony of cw 85 64general information as opposed to formal reports the ocpd said that he could not rule out that the violence was planned but did not have any information to this effect concerning incitement and speech he told the commission that he did not investigate rumours and that you only investigate what has been reported noting that one came forw ard to report and say abcd said xyz when asked what he did about allegations that some athlete s participated in the post election violence he said he had heard about it bu t one said so and so was doing abcd phrase that was repe ated several times following questions directed at him when he testified to th commission he also did not formally investigate the incident where the moi teaching and referral hospital was invaded and tear gassed by police an incident confirmed to the commission by jonathon k barno head of the security department of the hospital and julius k chelimo the security supervisor at the hospital who had tried to dissuade the gsu officer in charge and who described the behavio r of police officers at the hospital as merciless this attitude of the ocpd is particular ly troubling but ma not be so unusual given the testimony of senior provincial security officer that investigating the postelection violence was extremely difficult given that wi tnesses were very reluctant to come forward to give evidence for fear of reprisals33 something also reiterated by resident of nandi hills34 it is also possible that officials themsel ves did not want to delve too deeply into matters that might come with the names of prominent give n that as an eldoret resident noted in the skirmishes in the rift vall ey leaders from the area condemned the violence as kikuyu from lerumoruk far m in nandi hills explained in trying to get the commission to unders tand why even the multi ethnic composition of the district admini stration was not source of comfort to him and others 33 cw 80 in camera 34 cw 84 in camera 65the do is just two kilometres from the farm but anythi ng can be said anything can be done with or without him there we have v ery powerful people in this district the politicians her in uasin gishu district decide what is to be done it doesnt matter what you s ay furthermore according to the provincial criminal investigation officer pcio even people like him have difficulty dealing with the bi g fish as he noted in testimony to the commission my lordwhen you arrest the socalled politicians people don t look into the crime they say the police have arrest ed one of our own we arrested some councillors in buret and the council was so rowd they stormed the whole buret police station so much so tha t we were compelled to release those councillors35 in the commissions view the lack of robust action by the administration officers and the police to preempt the possibilit of postelection violence can be put down to several factors complacency afte r peaceful polling given past history of pre rather than postelection violence fatigue because so many officials from both the provincial administration had b een up for days either manning polls or counting votes lack of communication from the nsis to th field an unwillingness to act on the of intelligence received admittedly belatedly by the dsic on 29th december and play it safe attitude on the part of district officials who did not want to rock the boat particula rly given the tendency of powerful politicians to call the shots at the local level and exact retribution problems tendencies reported earlier in the akiwumi repo rt 35 rift valley pcio mohamed aman cw 80 the commission was informed that in fact the councillors were protesting the shooting of two civilians by the police when they were arrested 66was the violence planned or spontaneous the question whether violence in north rift was planned or spontaneous has as many answers as there are respondents pending on the respondents ethnic or political inclinations there was also the view of the provincial administration that the post election violence in uasin gishu indeed i n the north rift in general was spontaneous was not planned thus the commission heard testimony in favour of both the view that the violence was pl anned and organized as well as the view that it was spontaneous those who hold the view that the violence was planned bel ieve that it was contingency plan on the part of odm politicians and supporters should the election results go in favour of the pnu those holding the view that the violence was planned and organized cite four factors in support of their view i test imony that information had spread within communities prior to the violence that the kalenjin woul d attempt attacks ii the testimony of witnesses who say they attended meetings or knew of individuals who were or ganizing violence both before and after the announcement of the presidential results iii informati on from nsis intelligence reports which have named key individual s and politicians as having been involved and iv circumstantial evidence pointing in the same direction we shall now examine these four sources in light of evidence w received advance warning of violence conveyed to communities the commission heard numero us testimonies indicating that advance warnings were given to people in anticipation of the violence in most cases advance warnings are said to have been given to members of the kikuyu community by their kalenjin friends tenants busine ss partners or relatives in interethnic marriages in other cases kalenjin elders or church leaders who disapproved of plans to attack kikuyu are said to have sent advance warnings to their kikuyu 67neighbors congregation colleagues and friends statements collected by the commission investigators are illustrative of some of the warnings have been given to individuals in advance of 30th december including the following i wish to state that after the general election i rece ived information from kalenjin friends that there were some kalenjin p eople who were holding meeting and preparing to burn my business on 29 december 2007 i was warned to be careful by my tenants an other friend of mine called on the phone and he informed that there were some people who had been sent with petrol to come and bur n the building down businessman from tambach trading center in keiyo north interviewed by cipev investigators on december 29th i received telephone call from the wife of the pastor at the aic church and she told that young kal enjin were planning to attack the kamuyu farm on december 30 200 8 immediately after the announcement of the election resu lt homes began burning around kamuyu the young kalenjin men started attacking and shouting that nonkalenjin had to go it all happened at the same time in all the areas in kamuyu pastor from burnt forest interviewed by cipev investigators few days before the election kass fm announced that th ere would be rigging and in some of their open forums they encouraged people to use the radio to incite people who gave their vi ews most people used the radio to say that whether pnu or odm won kikuyu would be expelled from rift valley so there was very high tension narc activist from kapseret location uasin gishu district interviewed by cipev investigators furthermore resident of eldoret town who testified i n camera to the commission in nairobi noted that fro m 27 december all my friends from the local community disappeared from town wi th their families something that has 68never happened on the eve of the announcement of presiden tial election results the killings had already begun in such outlying are as such as moiben incitement to and the organization of violence the commission heard from number of witnesses who claimed to have first hand information concerning the incitement to and the orga nization of the violence in north rift some of the witnesses were kal enjin and had participated in meetings they claimed were called wi th the view to organize the violence t h r s w r i n s i d r s w i t h i n f r m t i n n p l n n i n g f t h t t c k s m n w r kalenjins who said they were threatened themselves or even att acked for not joining or opposing the attacks on kikuyu yet others were kalenjins working as campaign organizers for pnu and thus perceived as traito rs to the cause of the kalenjin community the commission so heard from witnesses inferring evidence of planning or organization from their own observation or personal experience of the postelection violence resident of eldoret town36 maintained that the attacks on residents of the outlying residential areas of eldoret such as ilula chepkoilel munyaka kiambaa kambi mumbi and turbo were part of coo rdinated attack in defense of this view he notes that the road blocks were erected by young people under the command of some senior and older people he sai d that road blocks were erected within five minutes of the announcement of the presidential election results making it impossible fo r his family and others to flee to safer places like police stations and the catholic church on th basis of his own observations he felt there had to be lots of serious coo rdination and logistics put in place for the warriors to approach eldoret town from all directions at the same time noting that in his area he observed over 5 000 in one go and that they smeared themselves with the blood of the victims the had killed he said that friends who were under attack an d called him from other areas observed large bands of between 5000 7000 uths approaching from burnt forest 36 cw 130 69kaptarakwa kesses nandi hills kapsabet and turbo wond ering to himself how they could have travelled hundreds of miles in five minutes he also thought that the majority of those involved we re from the kimnyengei age group who had been part of massive oathing ceremony in august 2007 wh ich took place secretly in kipkulei forest this however had been dis puted earlier by representatives of the kalenjin community including an emo official bill ruto and kalenjin elder john kiplagat arap koech both of whom insisted this was nothing more than normal circumcision ceremony this view was disputed by the witness who claimed to have been told by some of his friends who refused to take the oath that its purpose was to conduct cleanup operation to evict foreign communities within their areas another witness kalenjin resident of nandi north and grassroots community activist37 testified before the commission an d said that the violence was not spontaneous view which contrasted with the views of mo st government officials interviewed by the commission he felt the violence was both well coordinated and the actions well organize d he submitted videos of campaign rally on 5 december 2007 to the commission to illustrate what he described as systematic and deliberate effort by both the politicians and the media to whip emotions both before the election and af terwards also ci ting kass fm as perpetrator he also maintained that th incitement by politicians against the kikuyu explained the intensity of the postelection violence he argued that the politicians had prepared the masses to reta liate if elections did not go their way mentioning by name two sitting mps form er and sitting councillors and political activists he also noted that as result of these individua ls behavior it was not s u r p r i s i n g t h t t h x p l s i n s i n t h r i f t v l l n d p r t i c u l r w i t h i n t h kalenjin community happened almost concurrently and in th same manner he claimed that these activities were coordinated using cell phones matatu drivers and touts and that youths who are considered to be idle were also largely used 37 cw 83 70 another witness kalenjin resident of so division in eldoret north division in uasin gishu38 told the commission that even prior to the election ther was concerted campaign to evict the kikuyu from the rift vall ey starting as early as 1st december 2007 he mentioned meeting held on 1st december in eldoret led by lawyer which strategized on how to deal with the kikuyu meeting held by prominent politician whose name he mentioned on 3rd august 2007 describing anyone who voted for pnu as mad and th destruction of eight houses belonging to pnu supporters which were burnt after he had visited t he area on 17th december 2007 he also claimed that on 23rd december meeting between some athletes and prominent politician wh ose name he mentioned was held to prepare the youth for war once they kn ew president kibaki was winning he said that after this meeting an elder informed them he wa s going to get guns from friend in mt elgon and that retired policema n would assist with using the guns and that somebody from marakw et district was sent to purchase bows and arrows from there he also alleged that on 28th december 2007 after the election an elder who was point man for prominent politician went around eldoret north with some athletes and ot her prominent people calling on youths telling them to be ready for war promising them support f rom the mp the witness also testified that on 27th january 2008 the mp held closed door meetings at his house promising to go on with the violen ce after which the road to eldoret town was blocked and the violence went on he said he was willing to mention the names of persons he was referring to and inf ormation concerning the vehicles that were used to transport the youth furthermore in statemen t taken by commission investigators businessman at the tambach trading center in keiy north alleged that two individuals whom he named funded the violence in this area another witness interviewed by cipevs investigators claimed that mil itias were ferried in lorries owned by local politician prominent the attacks on the kiambaa church was caused by 38 cw 128 71some councillors who spread propagan da that the church held mungiki adherents from central province who we re ready to attack the local nandi community information contained in nsis intelligence reports an nsis official gave statement to the commission and also submitted seve ral nsis security briefs which also had been received by the dsic at the time39 as early as 30 october 2007 there was brief to the effe ct that week earlier former member for parliament for eldoret south whose constituents were threatening to unseat him toured the kesses area and t old them they should get rid of madoadoa it was the assessment of the nsis that the former mp likely to use the taliban thugs to intimidate his opponents during the campaign further on 29 december 2007 the nsis identified the areas likel to be affected by post election violence in uasin gishu district if kibaki was declared the winner on 2nd january 2008 the nsis said that the violence threatened to degenerate into anarchy from then through february they had intell igence concerning the presence of gangs of kalenjin and nandi youth planning t attack kikuyus and kisiis seeking refuge in uasin gishu district and of youth p lanning to burn houses in eldoret town belonging to ex mps and others they also noted early in january that some odm supporters intended to raid the ng ano factory in eldoret to steal munitions and were pla nning to seek the assistance of military personnel guarding the factory who were sympathetic to odm l ater on 4 january they identified an employee of the bullet factory in eldoret as the leader of youth groups involved in the violence there further cl aiming that they shared password to be used to mobilize them for attack on 8 january 2008 the nsis situation report identified an employee of the eldoret b ullet factory as trainer of the youth in the handling of firearms use of grenades and the destruction of buildings naming some of the training sites as being in the sigowet forest and kerio valley the report also said that odm leaders allegedly gave money to 39 cw 66 in camera 72kalenjin youth in eldoret on 2nd january 2008 to attack kikuyu at the kipkaren area in eldoret town in report of 8th january 2008 the nisis said that some senior kalenjin personalities were reported to be fund ing odm activists to organize youth for violence the nsis say further that on 11th january they received information that prominent unnamed businessmen and professionals were financing the acquisition of firearms and that kalenjin youth from so divisions in nandi north district and that they had alread had acquired some from mt elgon and marakwet districts which they planned to use to evict kikuyu f rom the rift valley nsis situation reports of 25 janu ary maintain that kalenjin warriors were reportedly being trained on how to handle firearms within the segoit area in moiben divisions of uasin gishu district the warriors were allegedly going to be used to prevent internally displaced in dividuals from returning to their farms and to raise funds to purchase land at throwaway prices the nsis reports throughout january also warned of kalenj in youth from sima division in nandi north regrouping to attack idps in eldo ret in burnt forest and elsewhere in addition to the above the nsiss re port of 8 february 2008 contained in exhibit 19a to the commission stated that certain named kalenjin tribesmen were cautioning members of the community against di sclosing or volunteering information on the post elec tion political violence to any group investigating the clashes40 it can be argued that these nsis reports point to the possibility that the post election violence was concerted and product of organizati on and planning although this does not preclude the possibility that so of the violence was spontaneous as well 40 the commission listened to recorded tapes of kass fm programs and was able to confirm that such messages were indeed broadcast on kass fm on 18 february 2008 73circumstantial evidence most reports from witnesses and others d escribe large groups of kalenjin youth blocking roads with felled trees large boul ders tractors and the use of petrol to burn dwellings and farms in numerous ncontiguous areas for this to have occurred the invaders needed to have cut down trees moved heavy rocks and obtained petrol all factors which can be argued to point to some level of organization and planning the extent of this depends in part on the amount of petrol used where and how it was obta ined whether or not chainsaws were necessary to fell trees and what sort of equipment w as used to move boulders to create barricades in various parts of the north rift in some other cases reports describe what appear to have been simultaneously coordinated attacks from different points and the need for transport to have brought attackers from miles away to gathering points altho ugh the kalenjin youth engaging in these acts had good deal of history to d raw on given the violence of the 1990s the accounts of the violence do not suggest breakdown of law and order arising solely from spontaneous riotin g was the violence spontaneous number of government officials testif ying to the commission described the violence as spontaneous senior prov incial government security officer who testified in camera told the commission th at this was not or ganized crimeit was spontaneous reaction in response to suggestions that officials were reluctant to investigate the big guys the same officer said they had followed up but found there was concrete evidence he nevertheless added that recently we got information and my officers open ed up investigations into three major political figures whom witnesses named as having been inv olved in the organization and training of youth41 another senior police officer the former rift valley ppo everett wasike after suggesting that kalenjin dont need preparation mention ed that from the 41 rift valley pcio cw 80 74pattern of attacks there must have been organized support for attackers in form of transportation provision of food etc evidence of such organization and support appeared clear to him when he explained that of course to run from one district to another burning and lootin g there must be pervisors and it would be difficult to go around burning houses killing people without eating something without the support he also told us about meeting at the nairobi police headquarters in which politicians and other kalen jin leaders were called and told we have information that you pe ople are inciting your members against other people42 the witness did not tell us whether there was any respon from the politicians some of those who hold the view that th violence was spontaneous have sought to explain its scale on the basis of what can be described as kalenjin cultural disposition towards war in testimoni presented to the commission number of kalenjin witnesses and experts used the idea of the socal led kalenjin culture to argue the violence could attain the level of magnitude i t did in north rift and still be spontaneous not planned or organized variances of the kalenjin culture theory aimed to explaining some cultural predilection of kalenjins to engage in warfare were offered by former rift valley p po when answering the question whether violence in north rift was spontaneous or planned he told the commission that the violence wa s probably spontaneous because the kalenjins require just they dont need to plan you injure john kiplangat arap koech kalenjin from tinderet nandi south district who introduced himself as cultural practitioner and lan d dispute tribunal elder and currently involved in carrying out re search on the origin and customs of the kalenjin also resorted to elements of the kalenjin cult ure to explain the violence in north rift he emphatically stated that vio lence was spontaneous and strongly challenged and dismissed as false and maliciousthe notion that the violence was planned funded and organized he explained that given the 42 rift valley ppo cw 57 75nature of the kalenjin set up and cultur inculcation when violence develops into situation akin to war then the entire community rises to defend itself 43 bill ruto writer by profession said the kalenjins just like many other pastoralist communities tend to be militarily organized and can respond to perceived threats in an organized manner this rapid and organized reaction is what most people have confused for preplanning of violence but the kalenjin culture theory as an ex planation for the violence in north rift was strongly challenged by number of kalenjin lay member s and community leaders kalenjin religious leader dismissed the theor and instead accused political leaders who come up and use the ethnic backgrou nd and the unity they found to instil violence and suggested th at to end the cycles of violence we have to break that he added that the same applies to the maasai because they are all the nilotic group so it is the myths that can be changed but it is this unity the politicians are exploiting 44 in his testimony to the commission hon william ruto so dismissed the kalenjin culture theory remarking there is dna for peo ple to fight instead he blamed the kalenjin attacks on kikuyu during the postelection violence on combination of factors including the history of violence since 1992 with friction having been higher in uasin gishu than any other area because of the cosmopolitan makeup of the district he dismissed the nd issue as factor in the 2007 violence he told the commission the issue of the pev is not land let nobody cheat you kikuyus always sit on the land and the only problem is at the end of 5 years it is all politics land is just an excuse he also noted that our politics acquires ethnic dimensions an d communities support parties where their leaders ae at the front and that is one thin g we have to change he finally remarked that the 2007 election was very polarized and the people in the rift valley believed that kibaki oppressed them in the last 5 years they voted more against kibakis presidency than for railas presidency 43 everett wasike former rift valley ppo 44 exhibit 79 evidence submitted by john kiplangat arap koech 76a kalenjin businessman concurred with th religious leader noting the issue of kalenjin warriors does not arise here to those are kalenjin young men who idle around and anyone can take ad vantage of them to be warriors the word warriors in the kalenjin tradit ion is respectable term but nowadays there are warriors they have just classified these young men as warriors they are not warriors he also added people hide behind culturethis the post election violence is nothing to do with culture insisting as well that nd wasnt an issue either adding that it was just used to cover what happened45 as to the real cause of violence kalenjin resident of ldoret offered that the violence was motivated by jealousy against kikuyu who had succeeded in business as opposed to luhya and gusii who also owned lan d with the post election violence being purely politically motivated findings in 2007 in contrast to the 1990s the bu lk of the violence in the north rift followed rather than preceded the electi ons explanations offered for the timing and scale of the 2007 postelection viol ence include general spontaneous anger by odms kalenjin candidates and voters at the announcement of kibaki win amidst allegations of rigging land hu nger and desire to evict socalled outsiders whatever the outcome of the ections and desire by kalenjin odm candidates to overturn the presidential election and assu power it is our finding that violence in north rift caught the police and local administration officials totally unprepared we found th is particularly disturbing given the fact that intelligence was made or should have been made available to local administration and police indicating th high likelihood of violence in either case of the electoral outcome but higher in the case of kibaki win 45 cw 74 77as consequence police reaction to the violence was chaotic to say the least some police officers joined the attackers and participated in the violence others were able to display acts of personal courage that saved li ves in many cases the default line was ethnic along which the police force was divided in general though the police were overwhelmed by the massive numbers of attackers and what appeared to be fairly high level of organization of the attacks 78central rift region central rift valley is to large extent dominated by the larger nakuru district whose kikuyu majority raised feeling of unease and suspi cion among kalenjin politicians following the end of the one party system in 1 992 they felt that the position of daniel arap moi as president was under thr eat by the kikuyu who were at the forefront of the clamour for multiparty democracy46 t hu s i n t h i s period the central rift experienced pattern of clashe s where the non kalenjin and nonmaasai tribes were attacked thei r houses set on fire and many killed with view to driving them out of the region since they w ere perceived not to support the then ruling party kanu na rok was one of the three places in the rift valley where the proone party rallies were held in 1991 and the key message emanating from these political meetings was that violence would be used to resist multi party politics key architect of this school of thought was william ole ntimama the mp for narok north who stated that kanu leaders had resolved to fight together and follow president moi in the clamour to end the debate for multi party politics by use of majimbo as the ntidote against the re introduction of plural politics47 the larger nakuru district due to its hi gh kikuyu population was the hardest hit by the tribal clashes that came to be ssociated with the region from 1991 to 1998 of note is that the larger nakuru district was l ater split to create molo naivasha rongai and subukia districts for purposes of this report the central ri ft valley covers the following districts narok molo koibatek nakuru rongai and naivasha dist ricts while nakuru molo and naivasha districts have clear kikuyu majority narok is predominantly maasai while koibatek has clear kalenj in majority in rongai the population between kalenjin and kikuyu is almost even with slight margin in favour of the kalenjin the rationale for dealing wi th the region separately was 46 akiwumi report at paragraph 212 on page 118 47 above page 117 79informed by the fact that it has been theatre of inter necine ethnic conflict that first erupted in 1991 after the reintroduction of mul party politics further it is cosmopolitan and strategic region which has attracted heavy focus from different political parties seeking to hold sway nakuru town highly multi ethnic town is kenyas fourth largest town and the admi nistrative capital of the entire rift valley province the politics of the region have been extr emely competitive and volatile doubt informed by the fact that this zone havi ng once formed part of the former white highlands saw different ethnic communities purchase land der various settlement schemes some of which were set up prior t independence as noted in the akiwumi report the different tribes in this area only tolerated each ther as there were deep seated ethnic ambitions and prejudices w hich were activated by political events precedin g the 1992 general elections while political re alignments had shifted in 2007the kalenj in and maasai expressing support this time round for the odm and not kanu nevertheless the patterns of violence in 2007 closely echoed what had transpired pr eviously with slight differences ie the use of criminal gangs suspected to be mungiki by the kik uyu in nakuru and naivasha ostensibly to protect the kikuyu community and l argely kalenjin gangs in turn preparing to attack the kikuyu in nakuru but t his time without the tacit support of the state security machinery that had hitherto aided their cause in the 1990s molo district we received evidence on violence in molo district during ur hearings in nakuru and eldoret we also made site visits to njoro and kuresoi and interacted with number of officials from the local police provincial administ ration and citizens the visit provided unique opportunity for the commission to witness first hand some of the scenes affected by violence and hear additional explanation from eye witnesses commission investigators also recorded statements and depositions from displaced persons from molo and ku resoi and these accounts have been in turn amply supported by district security intelligence co mmittee minutes and 80also published reports by other entities including public bodies the totality of such information pieces together the story of molo and kure soi background history of ethnic conflict molo district borders the mau forest whic h is one of kenyas largest forest areas comprising about 36 of the total forest cover in the country the region is situated along the mau escarpment and is one of the most fertile farmlands in the country famous for growing pyrethru m potatoes and other agricultural crops due to its cool climate the district on the other hand has also been theatre of ethnic based conflict since the return of multi party politi cs in 1991 the akiwumi commission noted that in the then nakuru district molo and olenguruone divisions parts of the current molo district were the most ffected by 19921993 clashes and that the molo division was among the few areas declared security operation zones under the preservation of public security act48 the district has two constituencies kuresoi with kalenjin majority sizeable number of k ikuyu and kisii minority and molo with largely kikuyu majority and kalenjin and kisii minority both constituencies also host number of other communities mainly the ogiek an indigenous hunterg atherer community luhya and luo communities the akiwumi reportfurther note d in its findings that this ethnic diversity had been source of tension an d ethnic conflict pitting the kalenjin on the one hand and the kikuyu and kisii on the other ev idence tendered by the knchr also notes that the area experienced ethnic violence i n 1992 and 1997 where the pattern of attacks was kalenjin raiders attackin g and killing members of the kikuyu community and burning th eir houses and in turn the kikuyu community organizing themselves to launch counter attacks in which they killed the kalenjin and also burnt their homes 48 akiwumi report 242 81a witness testified that kuresoi constituency was carved out of the old molo constituency in such way that the majority of the people i n kuresoi were kalenjin the witness claimed that this was influenced by retired president daniel arap moi to ensure that the kalenjin in that co nstituency could get representative in parliament because kalenjin candidate could not win in the bigger molo due to the large kikuyu majority49 this history of ethnic tensions in molo district was confirmed by the rift valley pc hassan noor hassan who stated that since 1992 elections had been the excuse rather than the cause for the violence over land other witnesses however provided broader perspective of the reasons for ethnic infighting notably gordon ogolla chairman of the rift valley c hapter of the law society who gave number of causes firstly that violence was not ove r land as such but rather due to feeling among the kalenjin that during elections the kikuyu and other communities opted not to vote ccording to the wishes of the kalenjin and instead followed the voting patterns of their kinsmen elsewhere which general feeling led to animosity between the communities and s econdly in the areas of nesuit mauche and some plac around njoro the biggest problem appeared to be centered not on politics but on alloca tion of the mau forest in the 1990s to senior government official s and well connected individuals which enraged the ogiek community who consider the western mau forest to be their ancestral home during cross examination of mr ogolla on the issue of the democratic rights of citizens to vote as they wished he stated that the issue of voting patterns in the rift valley where there were mixed communitieskikuyus ki siis luhyas luos and the kalenjinelicited feelings among kalenjin that non kalenjin communities tended to follow the political trends from their ancest ral areas of nyanza western and central provinces which had antagonized the kalen jin since the return of multi party politics hence feeling that if nonk alenjins wished to live harmoniously among the kalenjin then the kalenjin expected them to vote 49 cw 133 82together with them and not with the regions where they were deemed to have come from he did however concede that while such proposi tion was patently undemocratic it nevertheless had the potential to realize inter ethnic coexistence in the province not surprisi ngly mr ogolla was of the view that failure to heed the recommendations fr om the akiwumi kiliku and ndungu reports had contributed to the violence since the under lying grievances remained unresolved the preelection violence the commission established that before the 2007 elections kuresoi and molo constituencies were experiencing violence between the kalenjin on one side and kikuyu and kisii on the other the co mmission was told that the problem in molo district in general and kuresoi in particular was per ennial in nature having started in 1992 when the kikuyu were forcibly evicted from ch epakundi in olenguruone division the witness claimed that this was viewed by the kalenjin as success because the government resettled the displaced ki kuyu at kapsita near molo town thus according to th witness there was feeling among the kalenjin starting from the aftermath of the 2005 referen dum that the olenguruone precedent should be replic ated elsewhere in the district since olenguruone was the only division that had managed to br ing about the complete removal of madoadoas through violence and that if this was repeated elsewhere in the district the government would similarl resettle the displaced kikuyu as had happened with those from chepakundi th witness was therefore of the view that the preelection violence of 200 7 had some connectivity in one way or another to the violence in 1992 during hearings in eldoret the commission was told by the kipkelion dc that kipkelion district had experienced the spill over effects of the violence in molo and kuresoi prior to elections as result of which ethni c animosity built up on account of displaced persons fleeing to kipkelion from kuresoi this was corroborated by the nsis security briefing for the week ending 3rd december 832007 which noted that the animosity in molo had spilled over to belgut and ainamoi divisions where kipsigis youths torched kiosks belonging to kikuyu businessmen mr mohamed salim the dc for molo informed the commi ssion that hostilities began on september 25th 2007 though as we shall see later violence had already been reported as early as 2006 in fact eviden ce produced by the knchr noted that clashes broke out in kuresoi aft er the referendum held in november 2005 pitting the kikuyus who were largely in supp ort of the proposed draft constitution and the kalenjins wh had supported the orange movement that opposed the draft constitution and that these clashes involved the expulsion of kikuyu and kisii from kure soi throughout 2006 and 2007 there were attacks on low scale in kuresoi by the kalenjin agai nst those they deemed not to have supported the orange movement which attacks i ntensified towards november 2007 and rose to their peak on 30th december 2007 the dsic minutes for molo district dated 20th december 2007 corrobo rate this chronology in noting that between 22nd november and 4th december 2007 ethnic hostilities reached fever pitch and that as result deaths injuries displacement and destruction of property through arson had occurred prompting the pc to visit the area on 4th december 2007 the commission was told that violence in kuresoi had erupted in may 2007 at place called chepkinoyo where two children were burnt and several houses destroyed through arson this subsided up till september 2007 when kalenjin attackers from ndoinet forest raided ka mwaura and killed 2 people there were subsequent attacks in gathiriga settle ment scheme and then tetagik scheme where members of the kikuyu burnt kalenjin houses prompt ing the kalenjin to attack karirikania farm occupied by former freedom fi ghters where the kikuyu put up stiff resistance killing 2 kalenjin raiders 50 by the time of going to elections the commission heard there were already idp camps in number of churches in kuresoi 50 cw 133 84 the molo dsic noted that on 20th october 2007 in cheptagum farm in keringet house owned by one wambui john was torched by unknown arsonists in an incident whose motive the dsic believed to be revenge for k alenjin man who had been killed in mid august 2007 during suspected robbery at tebere area further on 26th october 2007 the dsic reported that an unknown number of raiders believed to be kalenjin had killed one benson njuguna kikuyu injured four people and stolen livestock at gathiriga trading cen ter in chemaner location of keringet during this peri od incidents of widespread looting and vandalism of deserted homesteads were reported by the dsic i n kuresoi it was observed that criminals took advantage of the wanton law lessness to loot household goods and stole food crops from abandoned far ms raising fears of food shortages in 2008 between 25th october and 4th december 2007 the molo dc stated that 16 people were killed 67 houses torched and 300 families left homeless after their houses were torched51 indeed similar accounts were provided in detail to commission investigators by number of witnesses who narrated how the preelection campaigns were characterized by tension with the kalenjin saying that on ection day they did not want to see madoadoa this information was corroborated by the testimony of the chief for sachangwany location which we shall revert to shortly the commission further perused reports from the nsis stati ng that in october 2007 number of odm leaders from the kalenjin community w ere planning to instigate killings in kuresoi olengu ruone and molo targeting the kikuyu community domiciled in the area for showing support for president kibaki meanwhile in kuresoi commission investigators received num ber of statements stating that leaflets warnin g nonkalenjins to leave the area had been circulated as early as 2006 the deponents alleged that former 51 statement of then molo dc mr mohamed salim exhibit 56 85politician52 had been behind the violence of the previous years and t hat once current mp zakayo cheruiyot53 came to the scene promising to end the violence if the kikuyu voted for him the supporters of the polit ician went ahead to beat and evict the kikuyu the commission foun d this information credible since it was corroborated by the minutes of the dsic meeting for mol district held on 22nd november 2007 which noted that intelligence had been rece ived that supporters of the fpolitician were poise d to cause clashes to scare nonkalenjins away from kuresoi for support for zakayo cheruiyot nsis also stated that the politician and civic candidate were re sponsible for organizing and financing kalenjin youth who were reportedly pa id kshs 1000 for every house razed down belonging to the kisii and kikuyu in kuresoi from records made available to the commission it is c lear that the district was tense for instance on 1st december 2007 the dsic reported that parliamentary candidate for molo constituency had led d emonstration of about 3000 youths in molo town to press for the release of 59 k ikuyu and kisii youth arrested on 30th november 2007 for erecting an illegal road block at muchorwe with view to attacking kalenjin motorists and passengers during this demonstration looting of businesses by the demonstrators was reported in molo town for the above reasons the evidence of mr hassan noor hassan rift valley provincial commissioner that the provincial administration did not anticipate the violence in molo district suggests that t he administration was not prudent to ignore clear warning signs the post election violence just as in other parts of the rift valley the commission heard from hassan noor hassan the pc for rift valley that violence erupted in molo and kuresoi immediately after the election results were announced on 30th december 2007 52 the nsis furnished information which contains the names of several persons 53 equally nsis had intelligence that supporters of parliamentary aspirant were targeting for destruction the kiptagich tea factory 86involving attacks on mainly kikuyu and kisii many of whom wer killed and injured their homes were burnt animals stolen while roads were barricaded as we discuss elsewhere in this report54 the pc testified that the provincial administration had prior notice of th attacks and did not expect attacks of that magnitude in molo and kuresoi evidence received from the nsis however seems to indicat the contrary for example an nsis security briefing for the week ending 2 3 november 2007 indicated that kalenjin youth were already harbouring pl ans to attack the kikuyu and kisii in murinduko bochege kaplelach muchorwe kuresoi trading center githima mwaragania mwahe farm sondu river t emuyota and kwawira farms to disenfranchise the two communities for sup porting certain politicians the nsis security briefing for the week ending 3rd december 2007 had noted that parliamentary aspirants an d their supporters were suspected of fanning the hostilities for political expe diency one of the aspirants was alleged to be behind the harassment of kikuyu and kisii and to have been rewarding youth according to the houses they burn the commission w as told that nsis security briefing reports were provided to the minister for internal security and provincial administration even without the benefit of such nsis reports it is the commissions view that the molo dsic was in possession of enough intelligence f rom the ground to act more swiftly and more decisively than they did for example molo district security intelligence committee meeting held on 20 decem ber 2007 had indicated that there was likelihood of di sruption of voting and that the morale of police officers was noted to be low due to disaffection with paltry pay rise of 10 this was clear early warning signal of potential s ecurity breach during the same dsic meeting it was highlighte d that due to the ongoing insecurity and preelection violence mobile polling stations had been s et up by the electoral commission of kenya in various places including molo primary school in molo 54 see chapter on violence in nakuru district and refer to the testimony of rift valley pc mr hassan noor hassan cw 43 87town chesengere primary school in muchorwe kamwaura health center kenjogetty in mungetho trading center full gospel churc h muchorwe kimkasia primary school in nyota and kuresoi health cen ter according to the chief of sachangwany cation evans mageto kebira violence in sachangwany erupted immediately result s of the presidential elections were announced on 30th december 2007 where kalenjin youths burned houses owned by kisii and kikuyu prompting him to call meeting at muki nyai on 31st december the witness stated that duri ng this meeting community leaders accused local politician who was present of having been be hind the violence55 following this meeting there was period of calm but vi olence erupted after the killing of josephat kinyanjui an der in the area allegedly by the kalenjin according to statements provided to commission investigators by several witnesses there is consensus from commission witnesses that new wave of violence erupted in molo on 30 december 2007 commission investigators received number of statements confirming that kalenjin raiders sta rted attacking and burning kikuyu homes on the night of 30th december 2007 and that the attackers received support from some pr ominent kalenjins in the area evidence produced by knchr corroborates this information in stat ing that there were reports of kalenjin youth having been transported from utside the district and housed and fed in the homes of well known kalenjin pe rsonalities knchr also stated that the kikuyu and kisii organized counter attacks in molo where they were majority and in response kale njin politicians and wealthy kalenjin businessmen provided transport to bring in attackers from outside the district to buttress the local kalenjin population this information was corroborated by evidence received by commission investigators including from ka lenjins and other sources that gangs of kalenjin were transported to molo from kericho and ndoinet areas 55 testimony was received and also statements recorded by commission investigators in which the local politician is repeatedly named as having planned the violence an allegation which he is reported to have denied during public baraza held at sachangwany dispensary grounds on 14th december 2007 88 on 23 january 2008 the commission hear d that jogoo center in mau summit was razed to the ground in an incident where police shot d ead 2 people said to be behind the attack the commission heard that member s of the kalenjin community held mr evans mageto kebira chief of sachangwa ny location responsible for having called the police who shot dead th 2 people which prompted about 200 kalenjin youth to atta ck his homestead at kimanyi farm on 24 january 2008 burn down all his hous and escape with his 10 cattle and 30 sheep which they took to the neighbouring chesoin f arm at the time of his testimony mr kebira stated that he wa s discharging his duties as area chief of sachangwany location from mukinyai farm since he had been declared persona non grata by the kalenjin in his location the commission received evidence from mohamed aman56 rift valley pcio indicating that on 24 january 2008 about 400 kikuyu uths from molo town incensed by the frequent killings meted against their tribesmen by members of the kalenjin community ganged up and proceeded to sirik wa farm within kalenjin populated kuresoi constituency on revenge attack mission armed with pangas and other crude weapons however the kalenj in got wind of the impending attack and ambushed them just before sirikwa fa rm as result 13 kikuyu were killed and several others escaped with arro ws lodged in their bodies evidence was tendered by witness wh said he had attended meeting of kalenjins held in the area on 28th february 2008 during which local kalenjin leaders discussed how to purchase kikuyu farms cheaply from the kikuyu who had left the commission also received video coverage of demonstra tion on 16th january 2008 in kimalang village keri nget division of kuresoi where some kalenjin youths armed with bows and rrows were secretly filmed while they 56 cw 80 89smeared mud on their faces to camouflage themselves as the prepared for attacks when the witness was spotted by the youths he almost lost his life but for the intervention of member of parliament total of 150 people were killed in the district anot her 170 injured 1564 houses burnt and 66000 people displaced by the conflict57 response by police and provincial administration allegations of partisanship among the po lice and provincial administration in responding to the violence were made before the commission in sachangwany for example police shot in the air on 6th january 2008 to disperse group of kikuyu who tried to put out fire that was consuming janet mulingas nursery school which had been set ablaze by kalenjin youth58 in other instances the commission established that police were simply overwhelmed by the numbers of kalenjin attackers in one such instance there were only 5 police officers confronting mob of kalenjin attackers estimated at over 2000 in kuresoi allegations were made against the local ocs that he refused to intervene to stop kalenjin raiders dubbing him self odm damu an odm follower and that he in fact watched as houses wer burnt down at mwaragania next to his police station59 there is support for this allegation from the report pro duced by knchr which accused the police of complacency and at times complicity in the violence and that some police officers were not only seen in the company of kalenjin raiders but that some officers derided kisii and kikuyu victims that they were paying the price for voting kazi iendelee let the work continue which was the pnu slogan60 57 exhibit 56 58 statement taken by commission investigators from local traders 59 exhibit 125 paragraph 353 60 exhibit 125 the commission had access to the raw data which informed the knchr report 90further allegations of laxity and failur to apprehend attackers caught in the act were made which suggested to knchr that police were overw helmed did not want to stop the violence or were under orders not to do so the knchr report opines that the raiding gangs mu st also have had prior reassurance in this regard or having observed that the police were simply shooting in the air carried on their attacks undeterred we find these assertions credible on their own but they f ind further support from evidence produced by government officials from the ar ea the molo district security and intelligence committee meeting of 4th february 2008 noted that discipline of uniformed forces had deterior ated lot and cases of police officers drinking and fighting had been reported which prompte d the dsic to direct the area ocpd to ensure strict supervision so that all officers worked as required all the above supports the conclusion that police force was so suborned by external factors including lack of sufficient resources that it was incapable of enforcing the law effectively one recurring feature in the dsic minutes was the lamen tation that police boundaries in molo did not match the admi nistrative boundaries which in turn affected service delivery this had been noted as early as 22nd november 2007 when the dsic recommended the harmon ization of molo police divisions boundaries to coincide with the administra tive boundaries in order to centralize operations the same observation was repeated in the ds ic meeting of 20th december 2007 which was of the view that harmonization of the police boundaries was matter of high priority there had been response to this plea by the time intense violence broke ou t ten days later it begs the question whether the failure to implement the recommendation affect ed police response and service delivery to prevent the loss of life and pr operty that occurred the violence seriously affected government service delivery in the district headquarters of molo the post office wa s completely closed after five kalenjin members of staff ran away leaving only the kikuyu post mast er while in molo district hospital operations in some partments were stopped all together after 20 kalenjin members of staff fled similarly the molo law courts and the 91district commissioners office were also affected with t he olenguruonemolo njoro road blocked kalenjin from olenguruone could not access vital services like medication access to markets and sh ops especially in molo and elburgon and conversely the kikuyu could not access their farms in muc horwe store m b i l i k i b u n j m t u m i n i k u r s i b r k f r m s i r i k w t m b n g n i kiambiriria and gacharage61 further the molo dsic meeting on 11th february 2008 alluded to the fact that intelligence had been received of some chiefs having been responsible for incitement and recommended th eir investigation the same minutes also indicate that the dsic would seek the help of the army in restoring law and order further conf irmation that the police were incapable of doing so on their own koibatek district attempted ethnic cleansing koibatek district was carved out from baringo district and comprises of two electoral constituencies eldama ravine and mogotio we r eceived evidence on violence in koibatek through district gove rnment officials who testified in eldoret as well as through statements by victims and eye witnesses wh talked with commission investigators the pattern if violence in koibatek is distinguishable from that in other parts of the central rift valley pr ovince in that it is the only district in which violence was committed mostly by members of the kalenjin community against members of the ki kuyu and kisii communities without much retaliation the dc for koibatek mr stephen ikua stated that the po st election violence in the district claimed the lives of 31 peop left 1215 houses burnt and around 45000 people displaced from their hom he traced the causes to the 2005 referendum that widened the political gu lf between the majority kalenjin and minority kikuyu communities living in th area in his view the divisions were exacerbated during the political campaign period by the debate on majimbo with 61 the molo dsic in its meeting of 25th january 2008 observed the need to protect salgaa market along the nakuru ͳ molo highway and was apprehensive that the calm in kamara and keringet areas could have been an indication that something was being planned 92some politicians not only declaring the area an odm zone but also asking residents to vote as block for odm statement recorded by commission investigators from joseph macharia ny aga pnu organizing secretary for koibatek district alleged that on 6th august 2007 odm held meeting which the witness attended in eldama ravine town during which raila odinga william ruto otieno kajwang martin shik uku and najib balala spoke in favour of majimbo he claimed that one of the speakers asked t he tugen community to remove all madoadoa from rift valley and to be committed in voting so as to remove kibaki from power and kikuyus from rift valley the same witness claimed that chiefs from the area had organized meetings after the referendum during which sentiments were expressed t the effect that kikuyus would have to leave and go back to central province this statement suggests that local administration in koibatek was not ab to maintain level of political neutrality during the campaign period proposition similarly observed by district administration and record ed in the minutes of the dsic on 19 february 2008 which noted that some chiefs were partisan mr nyagas statement further alleged that as early as 6th august 2007 there was already talk by politicians on the campaign trail of b loodshed and dispossession of land from kikuyu whic h would be given to the young kalenjin men if the election was rigged credence to such allegation ap peared to be given in the dsic minutes of 13th february 2008 stating that kalenjin in eldama ravine had allegedly vowed not to low displaced kikuyu back but would instead buy their land at ceiling price of kshs 10000 per acre and warned that if any kalenjin paid price beyond this sum their houses would be burnt the pattern of violence in the district mirr ored that experienced in other areas of the rift valley populated by the kalenjin where immediat ely after announcement of the election results on 30th december 2007 kalenjin youth especially within the market centers star ted burning properties owned by kikuyu 93and kisii blocked roads and issued thre ats to any kalenjin deemed to have supported pnu62 the commission was told during its public hearings in eldor et that the fact that former president moi declared support fo r incumbent president mwai kibaki did not go down well with the kalenjin and moi paid the pr ice for this stand as his property was one of those that were burned during the violence we were provided with evidence that kalenjins in koibatek were forced by their kinsmen to join in the attacks against kikuyu and that those who did not or were perceived to be sympathetic to pnu or to kikuyu were attacked by their fellow kalenjins moreover the koibatek di strict commissioner told us that government officials were similarly not sp ared of chief from maji mazuri who was viewed as pnu sympathizer was killed and in another incident police officer was seriously injured when responding to distress call one incident in the district involved the killing of pol ice officer on escort duty the commission heard that the officer who was kalenji n was among security officers who were taking charge of the equipment of the china road and bridges construction company ltd which was reconstructing the eldoretnakuru road on the material day while escorting lorry to the site they met some kalenjin youths who were about to burn lorry the fficer alighted from the vehicle and tried to dissuade them in kalenjin language but they would not listen to him instead the youth beat him up cut him up with machetes and took his gun which they broke they also took the magazine f rom his gun with 20 rounds of ammunition the officer according to the evidence never even shot in the air the incident in our view highlights the helplessness of ordinary civilians facing marauding gangs when armed security forces themselves were defenseless 62 minutes of the rift valley psic meeting held on 3rd january 2008 record threats to evict kikuyu from timboroa and makutano 94most of the violence in koibatek was concentrated on the border with uasin gishu kericho kipkelion and molo where non kalenjins we re attacked and killed their properties burned and or they were forcefu lly evicted on 26th january 2008 catholic priest father peter kamau kikluyu who was coming from nandi going to nakuru was stopped at muserechi trading centre where gang of youth killed him in an incident th at was widely reported by the mainstream media she is raped while husband is being killed on 1 january 2008 36 years old elizabeth w and her hu sband were attacked in their house in eldama ravine by group of kalenjin some of w hom she knew she was gang raped while her husband was being hacked to death and h er shop looted following is an extract of her testimony on 1 january 2008 we were still fearful we didnt open our business i worked at the eldama ravine shopping centre at mama faiths sh op we owned the shop it was just next to my house they are joined together but i stayed at home that day because i was scared we left the shop locked up at about 3pm that day people came to my home at t he time there was only my husband and at home my children had gone to visit their grandparents in nyandarua there were more than ten people who came th ey were all men they were dressed in coats and they had smeared mud on their faces so you could not recognize them the mud was different colors on their faces white back and red in spots patches all over their faces they were armed they had arrows pangas and rungus the first i knew they were there was when i heard talking and noises outside they were speaking in kalenjin they said we have come to f inish you the door was not locked so they just came inside my husband and i were i n the sitting room we were sitting down but stood up when the men came in when they came in i started pleading with them because f what i had heard them saying outside i told them why were they doing this when we had lived with them they ordered to shut up and said that the kikuyu had migrated to the area and taken up their the kalenjins property they said i sho uld keep quiet or they were going to kill so i just kept quiet then 95that is when they started attacking my husband they were cut ting him with pangas and piercing him with arrows they were struggling with my husband and trying to get him to the ground the men were crowdi ng on him it might have been most of them attacking my husband i was scared they cut my husban d on the neck with panga and that made him fall to the ground it was serious blow after that they were cutting every part of his body after my husband was cut but before he died one of t he men came towards and asked what i wanted to be done to i asked them not to kill one said we need to know what she is like now that she never talks to us there was another group of men who were looting my shop i could see them from the door it was still open they were going pas t carrying property from my shop such as sugar cooking fat and other goods i was wearing trousers with buttons at the waist the m tore at my trousers trying to get them open and the buttons came off there were about four of them there doing this to at that time they lifted up and put on the ground they were arguing among themselves who was going to be first then ne said that if i escaped from the knife and arrows i would die of aids some f them held my legs and some held my hands while they raped when this was happening my husband and i were both still in the sitting room but by now i was not watching my husband but pleading my own case the last time i had looked it was like he was dead he wasnt moving one man raped and then the second one and the third th ey put their penises in my vagina it was either the second or the third m an who said they were not able to get in properly so they cut i think it was the panga they were carrying that they used they cut my vagina when i had my children th doctor told i had narrow opening both my children were born by caesarean they continued raping it was when the fourth man was raping that i went unconsciousi next remember and it is vague that kalenjin friend of ours called joseph was there and he was pleading with the men h was asking them for him to be allowed to take the body of my husb and and take to hospital the men started quarrelling with him and told him that he wa s in partnership with us they threatened to kill him response by police and provincial administration the nsis had in their election security situation pap er noted that the ratio of the police officers to the population which was already in adequate nationally 96would pose potential problems since th police would be overstretched by election related duties such as escort and guarding of polling stations with such demands being exerted on the police nsis was of the v iew that if there were to be an outbreak of violence such as had been witnessed in 1992 and 1997 the police would be unable to cope in responding to such emer gencies63 it is therefore not surprising that violence continued in the district until around 15th f b r u r 2 0 0 8 b f r t h p r v i n c i l d m i n i s t r t i n w s b l t s s m b l some of the area leaders to discuss with them the need fo r the violence to stop this finding is supported by the dsic minutes dated 9th february 2008 which noted that violence was far from ending and that 2 people were killed with arrows at makutano the dsic observed that the kalenjin appeared determined to displace the kikuyu from their farms and that both communities reportedly were arming quietly notwithstanding that the psic had mobi lized all serviceable public vehicles which were handed over to the ocpd to facilitate deploym ent of security officers to the affected areas and also along the highway to ensure th smooth flow of traffic we found the acknowledgement by the dsic that some chiefs security personnel and other public servants were biased to be matter of serious concern kikuyu lady recorded stat ement with the commission stating that she was assaulted by two kalenjin attackers on 31st december 2007 in timboroa trading center sustaining serious head in juries from which she fell unconscious and was taken by good samaritans to timboroa dispensary sh was then referred to eldama ravine hospital on account of the seri ousness of those injuries but she says the kalenjin staff at ravine hospit refused to attend to her because she was kikuyu and she had to be taken to the n akuru provincial general hospital in critical condition where she was operated on and remained in hospital for 3 months 63 exhibit 19a 97similarly statement by mr nyaga stated that he repo rted the theft of goods from his house to eldama ravine police station but the officers refused to help him in tracing his property he further stated without providing the source of his information that out of 126 administration police of ficers only 3 were kikuyu further evidence of partisanship and criminal conduct by the police was provided by john mwangi who testified in naivasha stati ng that he and his family had been displaced from timboroa after being att acked by group of about 600 kalenjin warriorswho had sm eared their faces with mud and were armed with bows arrows spears and pangas the attackers ap peared coordinated and communicated through si gnals sent by blowing horn and carried petrol in small bottles which they used to torc h houses belonging to kikuyu families he alleged that they were assisted by police officer who was in charge of timboroa police station whose name the witness wa s unable to provide thus it would appear that partisanship on the part of public service and law enforcement agencies strained coordination efforts64 indeed the provincial administration recommended an effort to balance the ethnic composition of security personnel nakuru district organized attacks and counterattacks introduction nakuru district is an agri cultural region best known for lake nakuru famous for millions of flamingoes that nest ong its shores before the larger nakuru district was split it was one of th biggest districts in kenya with six constituenciesnakuru town naivasha molo kuresoi ronga i and subukia nakuru district has been synonymous wi th ethnic and political conflict and was affected in 1992 and 1997 prior to the ge neral elections held in those years 64 koibatek dsic minutes dated 19th february 2008 98the akiwumi report noted that the gene sis of the ethnic violence revolved around the reintroduction of multi party politics in 1991 nonkalenjin communities especially the kikuyu kisii luhya and luo supported the return of plural politics but the kale njin and maasai communities then supporters of the ruling kenya african national union kan u were opposed to any challenge on kanus monopoly of kenya politics the purpose of the clashes in 1992 and 1997 was to evict the s called non indigenous communities who were perceived to be unsupportive of kanu the district however still remains one of ke nyas most cosmopolitan where most of kenyas ethnic communities are found though the domina nt ones are the kikuyu and kalenjin with substantial numbers of kisii luo and luhya election related violence as was the case in other sites of vi olence visited by the commission the prevailing atmosphere in nakuru district prior to the eruption of violence was described differently by different witn esses who appeared before us even government officers who testified gave diffe rent versions on almost every aspect of the violence including the date the violence actuall erupted in nakuru district the prevailing atmosphere in the preceding wee ks and the causes of violence according to rift valley provincial commissioner hassan noor hassan who testified before us violence in nakuru did not erupt unt il thursday 24 january 2008 and was caused by the arrival of thousands of idps i n nakuru which elicited strong emotions and heightened tension in an othe rwise peaceful and cosmopolitan town and by tensions susp icions and acts of self preservations fuelled by rumours of planned and impe nding attacks and evictions of members of some communities on the other hand wilson wanya nga the nakuru district commissioner told us that it was the releas of the presidential election results on 30th december 2007 that marked turning point in terms of security in parts of the district and that clashes erupted on the evening of 30th 99december 2007 in areas of nakuru bord ering koibatek district he further testified that the clashes could be attrib uted to existing ethnic tensions and repeated allegations of rigging by politici ans as well as coverage by the media the commission established that violence in nakuru district occurred in two phases the first wave of violence star ted on 30 december 2007 following the announcement of the results of the pr esidential election and was largely triggered by spontaneous election relate d incidents the second wave of violence started on 24 january 2008 and took more planned an d systematic nature pitting well organized ethnic based criminal gangs against each other the commission was able to establish that much of the v iolence in nakuru in late december 2007 and early january 2008 was the culmination of ethnic t n s i n s b u i l t u p d u r i n g t h l c t r l c m p i g n n d r c t i n t p r c i v d attempts to rig elections commission witnesses were unanimous in acknowledging that tension st arted building up in nakuru town well before the elections and that the announcement of the results for the presidential elections was preceded by lot of anxiety among members of the publ ic succession of isolated criminal incidences before and after the electio ns and the inadequate police response to these incidents contri buted to the increasing tension within the district in one such incident on 28th november 2007 provincial security agencies were alerted by members of the public that two individuals suspected to be administration police officers we re on board vehicle heading towards eldoret from kabarnet carry ing and distributing antiodm leaflets the vehicle was followed by anxious mbers of the public and was intercepted in keiyo where the two officers were confronted by mob who were about to burn the vehicle when the keiyo district criminal investigation officer dcio appeared and saved their lives from the mob the two officers were later brought to the provincial police headquarters in nakuru where they were released in mysterious circumstances without being charged65 65 everett wasike ppo now retired of rift valley cw47 lsk chairman of rift valley chapter gordon ogola cw 57 100 as consequence of these incidents and the perceived unw illingness of the police properly to respond to them tension was height ened in nakuru district among odm supporters largely consisting of members of the kal enjin luo and luhya communities as well as among members of the kikuyu comm unity believed to be largely sympathetic to pnu odm supporters and members of ethnic groups sympathetic to odm felt that elections were being rigged in favour of the incumbent president kibaki66 within the kikuyu community rumours started circulating that armed pokot warriors and trained kalenjin youth planned to flush out the idps from na kuru and push them beyond naivasha since nakuru was deemed to be kalenjin territory all tribes who had not supported odm would also be pushed to wards naivasha fears of kalenjin attack on kikuyus intensified on 31 december 2007 when k ikuyu idps started arriving in large numbers in nakuru from eldoret burnt forest kericho western kenya and nyanza67 at the same time rumours were rife that kikuyus were recruiting youths in naivasha laikipia and dandora to come and protect nakuru town it is worth noting that to contrary to previous election related ethnic clashes which were mainly confined rural areas the december 2007 violence affected urban as well as rural areas of nakuru district the dc wilson wanyanga told the commission that on 28 december 2007 day after the elections incidents of violence involving eviction of kikuyu and kisii farmers were reported from the rongai division particularly in the area s of kambi moto and rongai location prompting the dsic to call an emergency meeting on 29 dece mber 2007 on the evening of 29 december 2007 kalenjins started burning houses belonging to 66 cw 47 67 the commission heard from representative of the idps in nakuru mr peter kariuki who was displaced from chepsion in kipkelion district that the idp camp at the nakuru show ground had processed over 100000 idps who passed through the camp on their way to other camps or other places to stay with relatives in other parts of the country at the time the commission visited the camp on 30th july 2008 there were 10200 idps 101kikuyus and kisiis and chasing away members of the two communities some kikuyus and kisiis left their houses out of fear before they were burnt 68 in urban areas meanwhile the comm ission was told th at odm supporters stormed the nakuru town hall on 28th december 2007 demanding the release of presidential results and on 29th december luo youths took to the streets of pondamali estate where they were joined by losing parliamentary candidate who lent his support to the protests bu sinesses and vehicles owned by kikuyu were attacked prompting violent resp onse by the kikuyu from langa langa estate the police had to intervene and create buffer zone between the two estates on 30th december violence erupted again in th town resulting in the deaths of 7 persons club lules restaurant along kanu street owned by nahashon lule luo and former professional football player was burn t by some kikuyu arsonists and the fire spread to th adjoining summerland club another restaurant this precipitated the kalenj in to burn houses and businesses owned by the kikuyu in kaptembwa69 on january 4th

community were enraged by stories of fleeing kikuyu idps and influential kikuyu busi ness people allegedly held meetings to raise funds for attacks against the lu luhya and kalenjin communities during this period of tense and easy calm member of the kalenjin community was killed and to avenge his ath kalenjin youths from kaptembwa and kwa ronda areas attacked githima estatemainly inh abited by

petrol bombs were assembled and deployed to various tateskaptembwa kwarhoda mwariki free area and kiti to flush out enemy communities they rounded up luo men who were forcefully circumcised using pa

men who had been forcefully circumcised while another l uo man had his penis amputated by his attackers on 25 january 2008 the kal enjin community living around nakuru who had already be mobilized and reportedly paid to fight the kikuyu70 retaliated immediately by at tacking the kikuyu dominated areas of kaptembwa mwariki and githim where they burnt houses business premises and also killed number of people according to commission witnesses the estates of kaptembwa free area kiti and githima were the hardest hit by this violence which lasted from the 24th to 27th january 2008 while kiamunyi middle and upper inco neighbourhood was unaffected the commission heard that in one night alon the 26 january 2008 48 people were killed in the aforementioned estates of nakuru 70 exhibit 125 103 planning of the violence in nakuru according to provincial and district gove rnment officials the january attacks in nakuru were neither organized nor pl anned the rift valley provincial commissioner hassan noor hassan was of the view that since 1992 elections were the excuse rather than the cause of ethnic fighting nd that simple incident such as fight in bar between members of different communities could spark serious violence the retired ri ft valley ppo was of the opinion that the violence was not entirely unforeseeable emotions d been raised by the high numbers of fleeing idps arriving in the town and this made it logical that retaliatory violence was bound to occur however the commission was able to determine from compelling testimonies and evidence that the january 2008 violence in nakuru was well planned and organized by both kikuyu gangs believed to be mungiki members and kale njin and luo gangs and that security agencies knew in advance about the planning and organiz ers of the attacks the commission established that planning for and anticipation f violence in nakuru by both sides of the ethnic and political divide began in t he weeks leading to the elections and intensified immediately after elections in the first week of january 2008 this view has ample support from evidence produced by nsis and by other witnesses who testified before the commission nsis evidence evidence presented to the commission by nsis indicated that days and weeks prior to these attacks this security agen cy had been closely monitoring details of planning for and organization of attacks in nakuru by gangs affiliated to both sides of the ethnic and political divide with regard to the mungikikikuyu side an nsis report dated 18 december 2007 noted that two mungiki leaders of the nakuru chapter were engaging in recr uitment drive aiming at recruiting 300 new members from the nakuru area71 it was further nsis evidence that in 71 the two leaders were cited by nsis 104sachangwan trading center along the stretch of highway betwe nakuru and molo kikuyu and kalenjin communities were planning to attack each other on 9 january 2008 nsis noted heightening of tension among the kalenjin luhya and luo communities residing in shabab and langalanga estat in nakuru following speculations that mungiki mbers would attack them between the 9th and the 11th january 2008 on 15 january 2008 week before the most brutal attacks erupted in nakuru nsis was able to establish that some mungiki members wer planning to discredit the government by instigating chaos in nakuru amon g other places after noting the heightening of tension in the bahati division of nakuru between the luo and kalenjin on one side and the kikuyu on the other following the eviction of 50 luos from rental houses belonging to the kikuyu nsis concluded on 18 january 2008 that confrontation s are likely finally on 23 january 2008 nsis had information that form er nakuru mp was organizing mungiki members to attack nonkikuyu people resi ding within nakuru town and that the intended targets of the mungiki included former nakuru pa rliamentary candidate and other odm provincial and dist

testimony that corroborated nsis information on planning of violence in nakuru the chairman of the law society of kenya rift valley chapter told th commission that sometime before the 24th january

established by the min istry of health to respond to the emergency such high number of casualties in district such as nakuru stretched medical facilities and especially the ri ft valley provincial and

nakuru including the deployment of clini cal officers to these camps and establishment of mobile clinics to serve the idp camps where those displaced were unable to reach available health care facil ities we further commend the sterling efforts of armed fo rces health personnel who had to come in to help in managing the victims since health workers were overwhelmed despite working overtime as with other hospitals in conflict zones the rift valley provincial general hospital was faced with an overwhelming number of 78 nakuru moh exhibit 46 79 nakuru moh exhibits 46 46a 46b 80 dr hezron nyangito permanent secretary ministry of medical services 108survivors which was further exacerbated by displacement of staff members and requests for transfers by staff who had received threats n the basis of their tribe leading to shortage of staff the commissi on further heard that the blockage of roads in many places in the interior hindered survivors from accessing the facility after being referred from the health centers of first call finally problem that was not unique to the rift valley provincial gener hospital was the inadequate mortuary capacity which made it difficult to preser ve bodies in some areas the kenya red cross came in handy and provided refr igerated containers but in nakuru the unclaimed bodies were disposed of response by police and provincial administration the commission established that police and government autho rities at provincial and district levels were info rmed of the planned attacks in nakuru sufficiently in advance to be able to plan for adequate response the rift valley provincial police officer everett wasike admitted having received information of planned attacks by kikuyu gangs before they were committed and as discussed earlier nsis had similar information wh ich would ordinarily be passed on to police and the district authorities th commission therefore found testimonies by police officials and district authorities to the effect that the violence in nakuru in january took them by surprise unconvincing the commission was given evidence that th police were very slow to respond and some simply refused to enforce the law although tension had accumulated and intelligence reports were clearly indicating build up to attacks by both sides it was not until violence broke out and needlessly l ed to the deaths of 48 innocent people on 26th of january 2008 that the provincial security and intelligence committee through the rift valley pc imposed restriction of movement curfew in nakuru and gilgil the following d ay 27th january it was clear to the commission that by this time the situation had gone completely out of control and perhaps if the socalled curfew had been imposed before the volatile state of affairs unravelled more lives would have been saved there were 109complaints from members of the nakuru business community that the restriction of movement had severely affe cted businesses within the town leading to huge losses but preserving life was ce rtainly much higher priority and from uncontroverted commission testimonies the curfew seems to have saved lives in nakuru81 yet even before the curfew impo sition the authorities were already aware that tribal gangs had been mobili zed to attack certain farms residents and travellers were already being killed by rival gangs on an ethnic basis we were also told that in many cases police officers were deliberately refusing to intervene and their enforcement of the law was unbalanced an d ethnically biased82 failure to plan for adequate deployment of personnel r esulted in poor police response to the violence in nakuru district immediately following the announcement of the presidential elections results it was obvious to rift valley provincial security agents that police of ficers on the ground were overwhelmed by the violence that erupted across the province ps ic meeting held on 31 december 2007 decided to call for support from the military in nakuru district according to then ppo wasike the sheer numbers of the mar auding gangs heavily outnumbered the police and the army was called in to assist in policing the commission heard that there were very few police fficers in the troubled areas of kambarari kaptembwa milima and kiti and that those who sought help from police stations were told to resort to self help the commission was further told that there were more than 100 idle police officers in their residential houses within the town at kasarani and thereafter they would be hired privately at going rate of between ksh 1000 to ksh 2000 per officer to assist with the rescue of besieged people to safer areas the inadequate number of police officers resulted in individuals engaged in criminal activities not fearing to be caught by police or even disobeying police orders to stop those criminal activities in salgaa area 10 armed thugs set house on fire and refused to stop 81 asked to discuss the legality and effect of the curfew mr ogolla chairman of the law society rift valley chapter stated had that curfew not been imposed i think nakuru would be more 82 cipev investigators job sheet 110when confronted by security personnel wh opened fire resulting in 5 of the thugs being arrested and the rest escaping with bullet wound s83 we were told that in view of the failure of police n umber of private institutions including the law society of kenya rift v l l c h p t r w r b l t m u n t commendable and risky operations to resc ue individuals and families who were at risk of being attacked between the 25th 26th and 27th january the law society rift valley chapter rescued approximately 300 to 4 00 people from ponda mali kaptembwa githima and mwariki areas who were t aken to afraha stadium and to the naku ru ask show ground the chairman of the law society rift valley chapter mr ogolla who extensively interacted with the police during the attacks in nakuru testified that the police were divided along ethnic lines with each group helping their own and at that these divisions escalated to the point where the officers were on the ver ge of turning against one another he further stated that he had learnt that senior officer who was in charge of operations at the kenya police provincial headqu arters was only deploying kikuyu officers which left huge number of police officers idle within their residential dwelling place of kasarani in many instances the police and provincial and district authorities let criminal or potential criminal activities go unpunished thinking that dealing promptly with them would worsen the volatile situation the comm ission heard that on 24th or 25th january 2008 motor vehicle carr ying four civilians armed with ak47 rifles was cited in kanu street and the police were alerted the police gave chase and managed to stop this vehicle in langa langa estate u pon which it was impounded but released after two days on instructions of the same high ranking police officer further the commission heard from the pcio mohamed amin that while on patrol within mahiga area on 28 ja nuary 2008 administration police officers spotted some people burn ing houses and managed to arrest one arsonist whom they were escorting to kampi moto chiefs camp when they met eight men among them the area chief the chief ordered the 83 special psic meeting 4 feb 2008 111officers to release the suspects otherwise he would incite h is people to attack them with bows and arrows as they were harassing his commun ity members the officers arrested the chief and his n and escorted them to nakuru police station where they were placed in cells for interrogation the commission heard that the following day the chief was released under inst ruction of the then ocs nakuru mohamed bakuli with consideration to the n ature and gravity of the offence committed by the suspect the ocs was himself later placed in cells for interrogation only to be released the following da 30 january 2008 with further explanation84 it is the commissions view that the poor handling of these criminal activities by the police contributed to reinforcing th atmosphere of lawlessness in nakuru district failure to properly investigate an d prosecute police officers and political leaders involved in these incidents widened the gap betwee n law enforcement agencies and members of the public and promoted impunity those who espoused odms assertion that elections were rigged with the help of kenyan security agencies and local administration authorities were quick to identify the mishandling of enforcement of justice as evidence of politically biased state security machinery on the other hand the state inability or unwillingness to promptly deal with post election crimin activities resona ted with the appeals for revenge attacks from kikuyus and othe r pnu affiliated sections of the public as incidents of mishandling of post election offences accumulated the consequent widening gap between law enforcement agencies and m embers of the public became an increasing security co ncern prompting psic meeting on 4 february 2008 to issue st rong disapproval of the wa the nakuru dsio office handled the case of the suspect in the sh ooting of the late mp for ainamoi in the psic words the fact that the attorney general s office nakuru delayed the case from being taken to court under flimsy reasons leaves t to be desired85 84 exhibit 80 page 59 mr wasike stated that the arrested mr bakuli had called him informing he had been placed under arrest and was seeking wasikes intervention on his behalf 85 minutes of special psic meeting held on 4th february 2008 112in addition the commission received evidence that police and other security personnel were involved with the very criminal gangs who were the authors of violence in nakuru some police office rs actively sided with kikuyumungiki gangs while other officers were aiding an d abetting kalenjin attackers evidence presented to the commission by nsis was that during the attacks armed mungiki sect members wearing administra tion police uniforms were moving from house to house in nakuru posing as police officers in search of members of nonkikuyu communities to attack and kill them86 allegations were also made to the commission that an officer in ch arge of special operations at police provincial headquarters was in fact the secretary of mungiki in nakuru87 nsis also learned that security personnel depl oyed within rongai were supporting kalenjin raiders and that weapons used by the raiders were being kept at local councillors homestead with their security personne ls knowledge88 findings and recommendations from the available evidence placed before us we are convinced that information on the impending wave of violence was av ailable to the relevant authorities early enough to prevent the fighting that followed furthermore the fact that the violence erupted in the manner predicte d especially by the nsis discloses failure on the part of the police and provincial admini stration who showed signs of being proactive instead they chose to fire fi ght when the prudent action dictated preemptive measures against the organizers planne rs and instigators who as we have seen were implicated and sufficiently identif ied 86 exhibit 19b 87 cw 47 88 exhibit 19b 113naivasha district planned crim inal attacks by mungiki and kikuyu politicians introduction naivasha is sprawling town in rift valley province locate d on the shores of lake naivasha that is home to variety of wildlife and sizeable population of hippos the lakes name derives from the maasai name naiposha rough water because of the sudden storms which can arise over the lake between 1937 and 1950 the lake was used as landing place for flying boats on the imperial airways passenger and mail route from so uthampton in britain to south africa the area is well known for its population of european immigrants and settlers and is popular tourist resort and also weekend haunt for nairobi residents due to its proximity to hells gate national park l ongonot national park and the nearby mount longonot the main industry is agriculture especially floriculture around the lake providing source of employment and inco for the local population and cw 33 told us that there were about fifty two flower fa rms in naivasha area which accounted for almost 74 of all the flower farms in the country naivasha district further hosts kenyas geothermal plant at nearby olkaria and is therefore of strategic national impo rtance since significant component of kenyas electricity generation is located here and the rea thus represents the future of the geothermal industry in ke nya the majority of the population is kikuyu with substantial immigrant worker s on the flower farms who are mainly luo and luhya formerly part of nakuru district before it was hived off as separate district the area experienced some ethnic violence in 1992 pitting the kikuyu on one hand and maasai on the other as explained in page 127 of the akiwumi report the commission heard from several witne sses that there was major violence in naivasha before and immediately after the 2007 genera l elections according to the district commissioner katee lucas mwanza the distri ct has history of 114ethnic violence with the exception of the mahi mahiu ar ea bordering narok district where there had been ethnic and land related conf licts between members of the maasai and kikuyu communities89 naivasha district security and intelligence committee dsic meeting held on 6 decem ber 2007 to review security plan ahead of the general elections noted that in the past parts of the district that had experienced clashes during general elec tions included the areas of maella mai mahiu oljarai longonot and moi ndabi naivasha town was not mentioned indeed several witnesses who appeared before th commission highlighted the history of peaceful coexi stence between ethnic groups living in naivasha town peter otieno resident of naivasha for 18 years and leader of the kenya plantation and agricultural workers union repres enting flower plantation workers told us that naivasha had been peaceful until the 2007 general elections with the many tribes in naivasha they had been coexisting nd doing business together and they had been coexisting without any problem90 another witness who gave her testimony in private described her relations with her luo luhya and kikuyu neighbors as follows q how were you living with your neighbours before you voted witness we used to live very well with my neighbours we even used to borrow sic and help each other91 the commission was told that incidents of violence registered before the elections were of political rather than ethnic nature and they occurred in the context of highly charged political rivalry during the campaign period appearing before us in private form er naivasha councillor who worked as 89 cw 33 90 sworn testimony of peter otieno ombunde cw 40 91 cw 36 115election monitor for the 2007 elections answered as follo ws to question about political tension during the electoral campaign q i asked you what your assessment was overall in terms of were there political tensions there or was there an environment whic h was suitable for such tensions witness yes there was clear difference between odm supporters nd also pnu supporters but there was actual violence but on 22nd of december odm people were attacked on their way to s uswa they were attacked in mai mahiu and some of the people in the team were badly beaten up and one eventually succumbed to the injuries 92 as was the case in the rest of the countr however the political rivalry during the campaign soon took clear ethnic di mension and tension started to build up in naivasha between members of the majority kikuyu community and those from the luo kalenjin and luhya communities most of whom worked as wage earners in the local flower farms according to witness we were divided the kikuyus were in pnu and with my other luo colleagues were in odm93 this politicoethnic tensio n heightened immediately after the results of the presidential election were announced on 30 december 2007 as members of the public mostly from the kikuyu community were celebrating t he kibaki win they were also threatening members of othe r communities the luos in particular were threatened with eviction following stories about th preelection expectation of luo tenants not to pay anymore rent if ra ila odinga had won the elections according to union leader peter otieno on 30th when the results were announced many people poured on the streets celebrating the results and the celebration contin ued up to late in the night as people were celebrating mong them they 92 cw 39 93 cw 36 116were uttering words against other tribes which was scaring other tribes away from celebrating some were uttering that the luos should be circumcised my lords those were the words coming from the crowd other sworn evidence from luo resident was as follows after kibaki was declared winner people in my area s tarted cheering and saying that those luos who thought they wo uld not pay house rent once raila was declared winner should be prepar ed to leave wajaluo wajipange there was tension soon after the announcement our landlord used agents in the house wher we used to live to collect rent she ordered the agents to evict l luos from her property because there were rumours that houses hosting luos would be burnt down94 kabati estate in naivasha town was most affected by the eviction of luo tenants some of whom started seeking refuge in the compound of the naivasha maximum security prison duncan ogore then officer in charge of the prison told the commission that the first group of mostly women nd children from the nearby kabati estate arrived to the prison in the eveni ng of 30 december 2007 and by 3 january 2008 the number of di splaced persons in the naivasha prison had reached 112 including 68 children and 44 adults95 the eruption of violence by early january 2008 the majority of districts in the r ift valley province were theatres of large scale violence naivas district however did not experience violence of similar magnitude until the end of january 2 008 the commission was told that the violence that broke out on 27 january 2 008 in naivasha was as result of growing bitterness caused by the massive infl ux of idps from other districts of the north rift provin ce the district commissioner informed 94 exhibit 36 95 exhibits 32a and 32b 117the commission that naivasha town had started receiving kikuyu idps from other parts of the rift valley after anno uncement of the election results and that at its peakthe town accommodated upwa rds of 22000 idps displaced from eldoret kisumu kericho kipkelion kitale trans nzoia district narok and molo district the idps who were main ly kikuyus brought painful personal stories of ordeals experienced in places from where they h ad fled and pointed accusing finger at members of such communities as the kalenji n luo and luhya this combined with the accumu lation of minor incidents throughout december 2007 and the first half of janu ary 2008 led to an extremely volatile situation and laid the ground for the revenge attacks on nonkikuyus in naivasha between 27 and 30 january 2008 consistent witness testimony and evidence tendered to the c ommission suggest that the attacks on members of the luo kalenjin and luhya communities that started on 27 january 2008 were execut ed in an orderly and well planned manner by coordinated group the commission was able to reconstruct the events of 27 january 2008 as follows96 in the morning of sunday 27 january 2008 large groups of demonstrators started congregating in different places in naivasha ostensib ly to protest the killing of kikuyus in other parts of the province demonstrate against the restriction of movement curfew earlie r imposed by the dsic and demand that prison warders be withdrawn from the jo int security patrols in the streets of naivasha the district commissioner acceded to the deman d for withdrawal of prison officers and group of prison warders who were proceed ing towards the ocpds office to commence security patrols was called back to the prison he told another group of cheering protesto rs that the curfew would be lifted and asked them to disband 96 this is summary of sworn evidence and other testimony from individuals and government officials most of it was taken in camera in naivasha 118main roads within and through naivasha were barricaded by the demonstrators including the nakurunairobi and the gilgilmai mahiu highways the demonstrations attracted big crowds and happened simultaneously in different places of the town which resulted in security forces nd local administration authorities spreading all over in atte mpts to respond to the situation by addressing the demonstrators dispersing the crowds and clearing roadblocks97 the same morning at around 1000am the kikuyu gangs attacked luo and other nonkikuyu families and burnt their houses in different estates of naivasha the hardest hit areas were the estates of kihot kabati site council kanjo estate and karagita it later became clear that the attackers were organized so tha t groups of demonstrators would keep police and ad ministration authorities busy on the streets while other groups were chasing luos and other nkikuyus in the estates killing them and burning their houses as the dc told us the time where we were trying to quell these clas hes we thought of using our normal method of addressing people in pub lic barazas and meeting and when we realized that there appeared to have been an organized gang as we addressed people here another gan g was somewhere committing more serious offence98 in at least one case the same crowd th at the dc was addressing at kariuki chotara road went on looting and burning rampage tar geting luo and kalenjin shops as soon as the dc and th police left to go and address another group the commission heard that in the ensuing violence the ki kuyu gangs killed forty people in one day this included nineteen members of one luo family who died 97 on that day the dc mr katee mwanza stated tht he addressed four riotous mobs in different parts of the town 3 of the groups were comprised of mainly kikuyu complaining that their people were being killed and displaced from elsewhere in the country while fourth group made up of mainly luo luhya and few kisii workers in the flower farms that dot the area complained that they were being attacked and were thus demanding safe passage from naivasha 98 cw

forcing other kikuyu to join them in search of luos luhyas and kalenjins the gangs blocked road s and public transport and searched vehicles forcing passengers forced to identify their ethnic groups catholic social volunteer who involved herself into rescue operations in the morning of 27 january said she saw young menflaggi ng down the vehicles and shouting kuna mjaluo kwa hii gari tunataka wajaluo 99 in the evening of 27 january one luo woman was nearly caught at one such road block while on her way back from the flower farm where she worked she told us i worked till 400pm when it was time to go home at the stage inside our place of work the company drivers informed us that they had just left town and there was chaos that road blocks wer being mounted the drivers advised luos against boarding the vehicles i deci ded to board i requested my friends to board with so t hat in case we are killed we could all die together on reaching sanctuary we found convoy of vehicles lined up the vehicles were not being allowed to pass we found armed kikuyus armed sic with pangas the company vehicles did not take us to the stage it dropped us at the field called kiwanja ndogo the kikuyus were waiting for luos to ali ght from the company vehicles so that they could run after them and kill them100 kikuyu woman who interacted with the attackers while rescuing her luo friends described the unfolding of violence as follows young men were walking in groups not only young men because it was everybody in the society they were all walking in groups shoving people up and down in fact they were chasing the nonk ikuyus like rabbits and then when one is captured just hacked to ath they were burning properties and the local women were following them looting101 the attacks were targeted against mainly members of the l uo community though luhyas and kalenjins were also targeted and among the forms of violence perpetrated by th mobs was forced circumcision on four members of the luo community 99 is there luo in this car we want the luos exhibit 38a p2 100 exhibit 36 p5 101 cw 39 120 the ministry of medical services through the district medical officer of health gave

members of the luo community were p articularly targeted the attacks resulted in serious humanitarian crisis when luo luhya and kalenjin residents of the town took refuge at the centr police stationnaivasha which was not equipped with sanitation fa cilities to handle such huge numbers estimated at 8000 idps further the number of nonkikuyu idps seeking refuge at the naivasha prison

chopping off your thing penis extracts from exhibit 36 statement by judith 29 years old taken by commission investigators on 25 july 2008 naivasha and submitted in evidence planning of violence in naivasha political leaders an d mungiki the commission received credible evidence to the effect th at the violence in naivasha between the 27th and the 30th january 2008 was preplanned and executed by mungiki members who received the support of na ivasha political and business leaders the commission s also evidence that government and political leaders in nairobi including key office holder s at the highest level of government may have directly participated in the preparation of the attacks central to that planning were two meetings held in stat house and nairobi 122safari club in the run up to the electio n with the involvement senior members of the government and other prominent kikuyu personalitie s evidence produced by nsis suggests that this agency was collecting information on the planning of violence in naivasha by mungiki member s and politicians at both local and national level102 as early as 3 january 2008 nsis had information that two former mps of the kikuyu commun ity were said to be negotiating with the outlawed mungiki with view to h ave sect members assist the community to counter their attackers and that mungik i members were meeting in an undisclosed location in na irobi with view to carrying revenge attacks on luoskalenjins travelling along nairobinaivasha highway on undisclosed date on 15 january nsis was informed that mungiki members were planning to discredit the government by instigatin g chaos in nairobi and nakuru while others would raid kamiti and naivasha prisons to rescue their colleagues held there among them maina njenga this supported informat ion presented to us in camera by senior police officer in naivasha who had learned on 9 january that there was likelihood of the socalled mungiki making way into prison with the intention of whisking away the chairman mr m aina njenga who is currently held in that particular prison103 following up on this information the naivasha district security and intelligence committee dsic chaired by the di strict commissioner decided on 9th january 2008 to increase patrols within the town and additional officers were sought from the naivasha prisons to assist the police the nai vasha prisons commandant duncan ogore confirmed having received such req uest for 102 all nsis evidence discussed here was produced as exhibits 19 and 19a 103 testimony produced in camera naivasha 29 july 2008 123assistance and having furnished some pr ison warders to the ocpd naivasha to help in patrolling the town up to 27th january 2008104 on 21 january nsis received precise information on part of the planned operation of violence in naivasha to the effect that kiku yu youth in naivasha plan to block nakurunaivasha and gilgil mai mahiu roads to blockintercept vehicles from western and nyanza regions to fish out the targeted communities which is exactly what happened on 27 january according to evidence presented by th knchr local politicians received support from kikuyu elite from outside naivasha to mo bilize local jobless youth who were bolstered by mungiki followers from nairobi and central province knchr had evidence of two planning meetings held on 23rd and 26th january at local hotel where influential naivasha business people plotted the violence and paid between kshs 100200 to the yout h who would participate in the attacks targeting mainly members of the luo community105 information of these planning meetings and participants wa s corroborated by in dividual witnesses including two naivasha social workers and activists according to witnesses evidence that mungiki were involved in violence in naivasha includes high level of coordination of the att ackers many of whom were not naivasha residents as well as inside intelligence btained from mungiki members involved in the violence kiku yu political activist who testified in camera told us that she learned from an aide to ndura w aruinge mungiki national coordinator that mungiki was not responsible for all the violence in naivasha and that one could differentiate the mungiki from the locals because where mungiki went they were not looting they were just destroying properties but with the locals they were looting she further stified that the attacks happened at the same time around 900am in the estates of kayole kabati 104 cw 32 105 exhibit 125 124kihooto and karagita and so she though t the attackers were dropped at those areas and they had orders to start at 900am which she characterized as having the mungiki type of organization c t i n g i t h r n n s i s r n i t s w n i n telligence the naivasha dsic gathered similar information with regard to number of politici ans and businessmen whom it suspected of financing and organizing the gangs t hey believed to be mungiki which were responsible for the naivasha violence those who the dsic recommended for arrest for financing an d organizing the violence included former mp of the kikuyu community and other prominent kikuyu personalities whose names were provided to the commission further information in possession of the dsic was that prior to the attacks number of meetings were held at hotel in naivasha whose owner was allegedly also involved in the planning and that former mp from the area the master mind the names of the individuals who not only purchased the pangas from local supermarket for use by the attackers who had been transported from outside naivasha but also directed the attacks on the ground were also made available to the commission response by police and provincial administration the commission established that response to the pev in naivasha by security agencies and district administration reflec ted the same poor planning and lack of professionalism and independence as wa s evident in other parts of the rift valley province the police were obviously overwhelmed by t he magnitude of the violence but breaks in the chain of command and parallel ethnic command structures within the police meant that even with the bes t of planning the police were too weak as an institution adequately to respond t the violence in naivasha the commission also received ample evidence to the effect that police and administration authorities were overwhelmed by the magnit ude of the violence the naivasha dc and ocpd testified that in the morning of 27 january they had to deal with 2 to 3 groups of demo nstrators each and that they spent too 125much time and energy in addressing each group at time whi trying to disperse the crowds and clear road blocs before moving to the next group of demonstrators community leader who appeared before us in camera and had been personally involved with the police in helping rescue p ersons in danger testified as follows q now may be you need to go back to the date of 27th what can you recall about that date that is significant for commissi oners witness there was lot of violence and i can say it is like t he police were overwhelmed and there was law in naivasha on that day and also on 29th the police were just overwhelmed like when i went to t he police station trying to get any police officer even to talk when i got there i talked to the ocpd and then he started getting calls i tried to organize the people somehow and we tried to call others i told them to c all their friends to know if they were all safe so we started making calls and w found people who were trapped in their houses they couldnt come to the poli ce station or go to the gk prison i started coordinating with the police on how to go and evacuate those people who were trapped and sometimes it w as just difficult because the police vehicles were not enough it was just chaotic sometimes we were getting very desperate among the causes of police failure to adequately respond t the violence was the breach in the chain of command within the force the commission was provided w i t h b u n d n t x m p l s f j u n i r f f i c r s refusing to take orders from their superiors and placing ethnic loyalty before professional thical conduct the community leader involved in the police operations at t he time testified as follows q did you get the sense the police who were doing the best they could but were overwhelmed or was there incompetence amongst the po lice officers or other security agencies witness on the first day that was on 27th i thought that the police were being overwhelmed but during that week when we stayed at the 126police station camp because the last person we evacuated was on thursday and i could tell that there was some defiance th junior officers particularly from the kikuyu tribe were t ready to take instructions from their superiors and i can say for example there is time we went to evacuate terminally ill lady who wa s trapped inside an estate and getting the officers to come they were just defiant they were just running and saying that it is the deputy oc pd because it was the deputy ocpd grace kakai who was giving them those instructions they were saying that she is just being bossy we were presented with ample evidence suggesting that th same ethnic fault line that divided the community in naivasha also aff ected security agencies whether for legitimate reasons or not106 members of the kikuyu community were generally deeply distrustful of officers of the kenya p rison department whose commanders were believed to be kalenjin and luo dm supporters on their part luo victims told stories about th indifference of kikuyu police officers to their suffering luo woman told us th at police failed to collect the body of her relative and that she was not able to have the body br ought to the mortuary until kalenjin officer came to her rescue two days later 107 in perhaps the most serious security laps police and administration authorities were too preoccupied with false notion of peace and tranquillity that they completely failed to promptly deal with the real threat s to security it is the commissions view that on 27 january too much focus was on clearing roads and dispersing crowds which left the police and admini stration officials spread too thin to deploy in estates where persons lives were be ing put in danger and where police presence was most needed in his desire to simply quell the demonstrations and clear road blocks the dc unduly gave in to demands of the 106 the commission was not able to categorically establish whether complaints from members of the public particularly kikuyus against prison officers were genuine and resulted from abuses by prison officers or were mere reflection of the perception that the majority of prison officers were from the luo and kalenjin communities 107 see extract of her testimony in box above 127mainly kikuyu crowd that prison warders be called off the street on the very day they were most needed in the ocpds estimation for the s ame reason and on his own admission he also agreed to lift the partial ban on movement curfew gesture immediately perceived by the demonstrators as an ncouragement to carry on with their planned attacks an eye witness recoun ted the immediate consequence of the lift as follows q you said the meeting was being petitioned by these peop so that he could lift the ban witness yes on the curfew q the curfew needs to be lifted what was the dcs react ion witness he agreed to lift the ban and people clapped and people dispersed and when they dispersed he went with his officers and immediately the police left that kariuki chotara road that is when one of the chemists it is in the centre of the town it belongs to kalenjin was looted and what they could not loot was burned outs ide the shop immediately the dc left with the police q about what time of the day was this witness it was between 1030 and 1100 am my lords108 despite the general chaotic response to pev individual police officers were able to heroically rise to the occasion and save lives peter otieno luo and union leader told us how one mutuku police of ficer came to his familys rescue by firing in the air to scare off group of kikuyus who were about to break into his house and kill him and his family109 the commission also heard that the security forces the kenya police the administration police and the antistock th eft unit received considerable help from the military who not only cleared the roads allowing police officers free movement to handle the actual crowds but on 28th january 2008 over flew 108 cw 39 109 cw 40 128karagita township in helicopter gunship firing from the air and in the air to demonstrate power which helped to clear the gathered mo bs narok district background narok district has been split into two narok north and naro k south districts the administrative divisions are central loita mara mau mulot olkurto ololungua and osupuko according to th akiwumi report the area experienced ethnic fighting in 1992 between the maasai and kikuyu wher the maasai complained that the kikuyu living upstre am of areas such as the enoosupukia water catchment area were diverting water preventing it from reaching downstream to the maasai110 the area has experienced ethnic related violence in the past particularly between the kikuyu and the maasai the ak iwumi report notes at page 167 that william ole ntimama the area mp since 1988 at that time warned nonmaasais that they would be evicted from enoosupukia since they w ere residing in water catchment area and the interests of so called nonindigenous communities mainly kikuyu were subordinate to thos of the indigenous maasai community at the time ntimama was powerful government minister in the ruling party kanu and the akiwumi report went on to note that in october 1993 maasais armed with bows and arrows had starte d attacks upon kikuyu and that there was interference from the police and the provincial administration and neither did the police make arrests nor disable the maasa i from attacking the kikuyu even when they d opportunities to do so the major causes of previous violence in the area were claims of kikuyu encroachment of maasai land kikuyu domination of retai l and transport business in the area as well as the choice by kikuyu not to support the political 110 akiwumi report 129parties enjoying support from the indi genous communities but evidence was given by knchr that the post election violence of 2007 was unlike previous episodes of violence where the maasai ganged up with kale njin to attack kikuyu this time round violence fizzled out quic kly after maasai elders prevailed on the youth to stop the violence in spite of incitement by poli ticians and local elites the preelection environment the nsis had indicated in security briefing dated 27th september 2007 that narok was one of the places it considered potential flash point likely to witness election related violence due to incitement by politicians it did not name further testimony was provided by naivasha dc mr katee lucas mwanza later transferred to molo that trouble was ex pected between the maasai and kikuyu community on the border of narok and naivasha district s over the disputed ngati farmers cooperative society and the same evidence was corroborated by the nsis at the narok south district security and int elligence committee dsic meeting held on 21 december 2007 it was noted that political temperature in the district was high and that politicians had resorted to holding night meetings contrary to the electoral code of conduct while also engaging in door to door campaigns evidence was provided by the knchr that immediately prior to the elections and more specifically on 24 december 2007 local politician had held meeting in narok town during which he threatened the kikuyu and kisi i communities that they would be evicted if they did not vote for him remi nding them that narok was not their home the post election violence in narok serious violence pitting the maasai on one side and kikuyu and kisii on the other erupted on 3 january 2008 in sogoo tendwet kimogor nkopen olmekenyu center oleshapani meleleo and ololungua di vision while tension 130was reported by the dsic to be high in mara division and n goswani in osupuko between maasai and nonmaasai witness isaac moipeli testified in naivasha that he was displaced from narok town he informed the commission that he had witnessed an occasion where prominent politician had addressed pu blic meeting about month before the elections and incited the maasai by as k i n g t h m t u p r t m m b r s f t h kikuyu community from the area this is corroborated in evidence by knchr according to which allegedly the politician organized and paid maasai youths to unleash violence in narok town and its environs111 after announcement of the results of the presidential election the witness says the politician went around narok town and asked that members of the kikuyu communit be evicted further the commission was informed by former rift va lley ppo everett wasike that the politicians name was one of those repeatedly given to police as being behind the violence and we heard that file was opened against him on charges of political incitement and warrant of arrest was procured but he was not taken to court the dsic noted that over 1000 houses belonging to kisiis and kikuyus were torched 2 persons killed 60 others seriously injured and about 3000 displaced during the violence on 4 january at olerai area of mulo t division franklin bett the newly elected odm mp for buret and isaac ru to odm mp for chepalungu addressed about 100 kipsigis asking them to open the road and coexist with the kisii who had supported odm but to keep pressuring for president kibakis removal and calling for retallyin g and or recount of the votes alleging that odm d been robbed of victory evidence was received from the narok south dsic that on 5 january 2008 at mulot police station the late richard kipkalya kones odm mp for bomet otieno kajwang odm mp for mbita and omingo magara odm mp for west mugirango asked the local community not to attack the kisii but they called on 111 exhibit 125a 131residents close to the kenyatanzania and kenyauganda borders to close the roads so that tanzania and uganda would respectively complain of lack of fuel supply through kenya thus bringing pres sure to bear on president kibaki to resign on 8 january 2008 both the dsic and nsis reported that handwritten leaflets had been found by members of the public at ololulunga trading center narok south warning pnu friendly communi ties operating businesses along the narokolulunga road to close their businesses and vacat the area the nsis reported that on 16 february 2008 more leaflets aimed at whipping up anti kikuyu sentiments were dropped in narok reading we cannot share the same space any longer with thieves who stole our votes and rights we shall fight for our rights to the last peace from the evidence made available by nsis it would appear that in narok south the conflict between the kipsigis and kisii from neighbo uring sotik spilled over into the area for instance on 16 februa ry 2008 the narok south dsic reported that there had been burning of kisii houses by the kipsigis nd that the kipsigis also started grazing their livestock on kisi i farms according to nsis the kipsigis stated they were unwilling to let any of the kisii retur n to their farms and would continue to cause havoc if they attempted to return fur ther the conflict in neighbouring transmara distri ct kilgoris constituency112 between the maasai and kipsigis threatened to spill over into narok south district where kipsigis youths on 17 february 2008 at njipship fo rcefully grazed their cattle on land owned by the maasai on 21st february 2008 hand written leaflets were circulated at meleleo warning maasai of re venge attacks by kipsigis to avenge the killing of kipsigis in transmara 112 the nsis had reported on tension between the moitanik and uasin gishu clans in olalui location of transmara as early as 22nd june 2007 pitting the maasais against the kipsigis following declaration by johana ngeno kipsigis that he would seek the kilgoris parliamentary seat the maasai were of the view that the kipsigis were outsiders who should not seek leadership positions in maasai territory according to the report 132police and provincial administration response the narok south dsic acknowledged that there was an ac ute shortage of administration and regular police and that this was comp ounded by shortage of firearms and ammunition further the dsic obser ved the need for replenishment to enable security officers effectively restor law and order and protect the lives of displaced persons whil it is conceivable that the police and provincial administration had to make di fficult strategic choices to contain much more serious situations that were underw ay in other places one cannot help but wonder what would have happened if the situation in nar ok had got out of control further evidence was received that in order to appease gangs that were bent on violating the law the authorities succum bed to public pressure and blackmail where the dsic unanimously strongly re commended that the ocs for mulot be transferred for his personal safety after he received deat h threats from the maasai community for causing the death of person the south rift an d kisii region introduction significant amount of the post election violence took place within the larger kericho district one strand of the vi olence in this area involved the neighbouring communities of the kipsigis who live in south rift valley and the kisii people also known as abagusii who live in south nya nza the traditional homeland of the kipsigis people the largest subtribe f the kalenjin community is the original kericho district subdiv ision of the district has yielded five smaller districts sotik buret kipkelion bomet and kericho the ancestral homeland for the kisii people is kisii district which forms part of nyanza province the original kisii district after subdivision yielded south kisii central kisii north kisii bo rabu and masaba districts 133following the subdivisions sotik district created out of the original kericho district borders buret district to the north bomet to the east borabu to the south and transmara to the west borabu on the other hand borders masaba nyamira sotik buret and trans mara districts another dimension of the violence in the larger kerich district took place within and around kipkelion area which is now di strict on its own kipkelion district is largely settlement scheme comprising members from the ethnic communities of the kipsigis who are the majority kikuyu kisii l uo kamba and luhya the kipsigis occupy three administrative divi sions chilchila formerly fort ternan londiani and kipkelion the discussion of the post election violence in the sout h rift relates to the events that occurred in the kericho area which in this case use d to encompass the original kericho district unless the intent ion to the contrary is clearly stated as the ancestral homes of the kipsigis and the kisii are contigu ous and as the violence in this region also invol ved the two communities both along the borabusotik common border as well as wi thin kericho district it is convenient to discuss the violence as systemic whole the build up towards violence at the sotikborabu border according to several witnesses an importan t explanation for the post election conflict between the kipsigis and kisii co mmunities lies in an incident that had occurred at nyamarambe area within the or iginal kisii district on 22 september 2007 barely three months before the gene ral elections the incident involved wellpublicized assault on leading personalities in the m ain opposition party the orange democratic movement the assault was alleged to have been orchestrated by simeon nyachae pr ominent kisii politician who was at the time cabinet minister in the kibaki go vernment and who was viewed as one of the presidents close confidantes 134during the incident william ruto kalenjin omingo ma gara kisii both national office holders in odm as well as chris bichage kisii parliamentary candidate in the odm party were attacked physically by uths attending public rally which nyachae had convened in nyamarambe bichage who was severely beaten needed hospitalization according to grace k aindi who was the provincial police officer fo r nyanza at the time of incident the attack on the three was captured on television and became the subject of c onsiderable national outrage another witness samuel omweri inform ed the commission that the attack on ruto viewed as an affront by the kisii on the kalenjin people triggered revenge attacks by members of the kipsigis comm unity on kisii people who had bought land in the sondu area which forms part of the kip sigis homeland this evidence was confirmed by the kericho district commissio ner wilson njenga who informed the commission that the violence in sondu led to the death of three people and the injury and displace ment of several others according to omweri members of the kisii community who had bought lan d in kipsigis territory in sondu area where they had li ved for up to 30 years were forcibly evicted by their kipsigis hosts angry over the attack on rut at the time the commission heard this evidence these pe ople had not returned as yet to where they were displaced from the commission sought to know from kaindi what action if any had been taken over the wellpublicized incident in nyamarambe she in formed the commission that all the persons who participated in the attack had been identified and arrested and were then placed in custody at kisii police station for two or three days as the police finalized arrangements to charge them in court however on the orders of the commissioner of police th ey were released unconditionally on this incident kaindi testified as follows you find that i get calls from nairobi my boss says did you arrest these people i say yes for this and that then h says well warn them and let them go home i comply 135 other than the nyamarambe incident the electioneering pr ocess also provided opportunity for the building of tensions in the south ri ft area according to the information presented to the commission several indiv idual occurrences contributed to the escalation towards event ual violence between the kipsigis and kisii people one of them was the appearance in kericho town area of inflammatory leaflets against members of the kisii and kikuyu communities both perceived to be supporters of pnu according to the kericho dc the leaflets contained such messages as choma kikuyu choma shamba mpya itapatikana and notice factory remain ashes several witnesses informed the commissi on that there was much incendiary speech by political leaders in the cont ext of campaigns for the presidential and parliamentary elections eye witnesses who attended number of rallies appeared before the commission and gave an account of some of the inciting statements that formed part of these campaigns for examp witness testified that he attended rally at uhuru garden in kericho in august 2007 addressed by two leading odm politicians the witness cla imed that the politicians exhorted kipsigis people not to sell land to t he kisii people whose number he complained was already too large in the town according to the witness the politician said that at the end of the da the town will remain owned by only two tribes kisiis and kikuyus another w itness testified that although some of the speeches in rallies that took place in cosmopolitan areas were delivered in kiswahili language understandable to most of the audience the delivery of incendiary messages would often be done in ki psigis to cut off other communities present at such rallies however political incitement was not confined to rallie s held in the kericho area at an odm rally held on 6 december 2 007 at manga in borabu district kisii people were informed that the land constituting borabu district was originally 136part of the homeland of the kalenjin113 according to omweri the common understanding by people within the bora bu area was that kisii people were expected to vote in particular manner for the tinued favour of being allowed to occupy borabu district which might otherwise have to be given up for the kipsigis at another rally in november in kericho kipsigis politicians again complained that you cannot even speak because kisiis bought the land and built114 at yet another rally at kapkatet which witness115 claimed was addressed by other prominent odm politicians the commission heard that the leaders rhetorically asked whether any kipsigis owned land in kisii area to which the crowd answered they then wondered why kisii people shoul d be allowed to own land among the kipsigis according to witnesses there was an expe ctation of the eviction of nonkalenjin people from south rift long before the ections were held and this added to the tension in the area the evidence on this is provided by information gathered by witnesses in the course of daily interactions with ordinar kipsigis people before the elections for example kisii woman who has been ma rried to kalenjin man for more than 20 years and whose marriage survived s evere pressure imposed by the post election violence informed the commission that through everyday interaction with kalenjin people it became clear to her that they expected that as result of the enforcement of majimbo other communities would have to leave the rift valley and that this incl uded people like her who were nonkipsigis married to the kipsigis according to the witness they were saying nobody should be left there who is not born into the kalenjin this was also testified to by another witness kisii woman who h ad settled on the sotik side of the border for more than 30 ye ars she said we saw houses burning 113 cw 116 114 exhibit 122 115 cw 118 137and people had been saying you know th neighbours you dont belong here this is our farm the following account by witness lends further cr edence to the view that there was widespread expectation on the part of ordinary people that majimbo would result in the permanent eviction of certain peopl from the rift valley meanwhile the kalenjin were outside the house they ta unted us and told us goodbye they told us that our magnificent house was theirs now as it stands on their soil i recognized some of them as the sons of our neighbour116 the final period before the outbreak of violence was marked by tension over the outcome of the election results the commission heard th at there were rumours of the planned rigging of the elections in favour of pn us kibaki in kericho the rumours were strong enough to cause cr owd of local people to march onto the premises of local church abundant grace church which they suspected was holding stuffed ballot papers for the pnu presidential ca ndidate this compelled police search on the premises the search however yielde d nothing117 the commission was informed that the theft of livestock fr om the borabu area into the sotik district in the height of the tension between the communities exacerbated the tension and according to borabu district commissioner asha kiva was the effective trigger for the violence the dc t estified that cross border theft of livestock was common occurrence in the area bu t because of the prevailing tension this particular in cident was considered more aggravating than would have usually been the case 116 exhibit 119 117 statement by wg njega district commissioner kericho 138build up towards violence in kipkelion kipkelion district borders the districts of molo at ku resoi koibatek nandi south and uasin gishu this is volatile region which has borne the brunt of clashes in recent times the district co mmissioner for kipkelion aden gedow commission witness 68 testified that although the area was largely peaceful in the run up to the 2007 ge neral elections there was considerable tension resulting from the spillover effects of the border ing kuresoi which experienced considerable violence before the elections f urther the events in the neighbouring molo district where displa ced persons and victims of land clashes had sought refuge had spillover ffect and elicited ethnic passion in kipkelion and the desire to retaliate adding to the nsion dsic reports indicate that prior to the elections l eaflets warning kikuyus and kisiis to vacate kipkelion were circulated at fort ternan within chilchila division and kasheen when leaflets appeared the dos of the areas in which these were found held peace meetings involving all the communities i n their areas however according to gedow politician had made inflammatory sp eeches during the campaign period fact he attributed to the homogeneo us nature of the ethnicity of the candidates that were contesting elective office nsis evidence on the build up towards violence the hotspotflashpoint report issued by the nsis for the week ending 28 september 2007 predicted that election related violence m ight exacerbate misunderstanding between the traditiona l hotspot areas in among other places the rift valley specifically it was repo rted that the area bordering the kisii districts and rongo rachuonyo bomet kericho and trans mara would continue experiencing hosti lities following the recent nyamarambe skirmishes the reports of the nsis for the week ending 19th october 2007 reported an escalation of the situation noted in the previous repor t when it noted that along the kericho nyando border tension pe rsists between kipsigis and abagusii communities within sondu area that has led to several house s being set ablaze by marauding kipsigis youth armed with bows and arrows this follows political 139incitement by some kipsigis leaders coup led with the perception by members of the same community that the kisii were not reciprocating to their hospitality despite settling in their area the suing clashes have left several people injured seen an exodus of luo and kisii kinsmen from th area for fear of further kipsigis raiders the nsis fortnightly intelligence report for the period ending 30th october 2007 narrated that the kipsigiskisii acrimony remains explos ive following utterances by some political leaders in sigowet divi sion of kericho district that gusii be rooted out of the division the report for the week ending on 23rd november 2008 the last before the elections spoke of further increase in tension in th sondu area as result of threats of attacks by kipsigis people on kisii people who d returned to sondu following the earlier eviction territorial disputes as cause of the tension and ultimately the violence the commission learnt that the postele ction violence at the borabusotik border was in part the result of conflict ing territorial claims by the kipsigis and the kisiis witnesses testified that the kipsigis consider the land comprising borabu district to be part of their ancestral land and th correct boundary between their district and kisii to be so way into the kisii side at place called metamaywa we heard from samuel omweri community leader and former member of parliament that the kisii people refute the claim by th eir kipsigis neighbours and have territorial claim of their ow n against the kipsigis according to mr omweri the kisii claim that they occupied not only bor abu but also all the area up to place called kabianga which is w part of kericho district they claim that kabianga is in fact kisii name an d that the name is evidence of the fact 140that the kisii were the first occupants of the area118 the kisii assert that they lived on the land up to the rivers sond u and oyani to the south and that they were evicted from these areas in 1946 to make room for the settlement of soldiers returning from the second worl d war in ethiopia and the uasin gishu maasai who had been moved from trans nzoia119 as result of being pushed out of their homelands the kisii found th emselves being administered as part of what was called sotik west during the co lonial period during all this time the kipsigis and the kisii were part of ny anza province however the boundary delimitation commission acceded to re quest by the kipsigis to join with nandis to form the kalenjin alliance in the rift vall ey the areas covered by sotik west kipkelion and londiani while the kisii rem ained with the luos as constituent ethnic communities forming nyanza province120 the former dc for borabu asha kather i kiva told the commission that the kipsigis hoped that through the post election violence they would drive their kisii neighbours out of borabu and establish what they co nsider to be the correct boundary between the two communi ties the commission heard that this was not the first time that the kipsigis had violently sserted their territorial claim against the kisii they did so throughout the early years following the establishment of the settlement schemes for the kisii i n the 1960s and that as part of this there was fighting between the two commun ities in 1964 and again in 1969 more recently there was electio nrelated violence in 1992 1997 and 2002 also provided occasion for the violen t assertion of this territorial claim the commission was further informed by ms kiva that rivalry which from time to time broke into war between the kipsigis and the ki sii is an ancient phenomenon predating the establishment of the colonial state that on both sides this rivalry has been passed down through folklore from generation to generation on both sides 118 exhibit 116 119 above 120 above 141the kiliku committee traced the conflict between the kipsi gis the maasai and the kisii to the post colonial arrangements in relation to land the splitting of the country into white highlands and native reserves wa s one of the practices of the colonial state at independence the white highlands partly forming the present border area between the kipsigis and kisii were apportioned between the maasai kipsigis and kisii communities and under the facil itation of the settlement fund trustees members of the three communities bought land that was formerly owned by the departing settlers members of the k isii community who had higher population density settled in larger num bers in the area than the kipsigis and the maasai the committee noted that t he kisii had initially moved into the area through settlement schemes but lately they had done so through direct purchases and leases these factors explain t he significant presence of the kisii in bomet and narok districts121 in kipkelion according to the kipkelion dsic kipkelio n district security and intelligence appreciation 12008 held on 18th january 2008 reports the clashes underlie history of ethnic anim osity and hatred caused by disputes over land which the kipsigis claim to be their ancestral land but which was appropriated by the european settlers in the preindepen dence times and later sold to members of other ethnic groups the nandis also cl aim that river kipchorian which traverses the district is their true boundary with the kipsigis and is part of tinderet the problem manifests itself i n an ethnically polarized environment and the land issue having been politicized this explains why heightened clashes have almost always coincided with electioneering periods with the question of displacement of the indigenous kip sigis being the reason for much political agitation 121kiliku report at p55 paras 524 and 525 142execution of the violence in sotikborabu the sotik district commissioner humphrey nakitare inf ormed the commission that violence in his district began on 28 december 2007 at this point the violence was confined to the district and had not sprea d to the border area it took the form of blockage of roads and according to nakitare sporadic rioting all over the district it was the opinion of the distr ict commissioner that the cause of the violence was delay in announcing the president ial elections results the evidence of nakitare was that the actors in these sk irmishes were armed youth from the kipsigis community conflict started on th 28th of december 2007 with marauding youth barricadin g roads using stones and trees and lighting bonfires on the following

now involved members of the kipsigis and kisii communities f ighting at various points on different days on the long common border the sotik dc was asked the question as to who between the two communities started t he interethnic fighting and he answered that it was the kipsigis who first attacked the kisii according to asha kiva the borabu dc the first house was burnt by kipsigis raiders at place called esise in ekerubo location wi thin her district this was on 8th january before then there had been violence on the borabu side although the kisiikericho road which passes through sotik had remained barricaded kiva and members of her dsic visited the place where the house had been burnt and convened meeting in the affected area where she said there was lot of tension even as the meeting went on more houses were being burnt thereafter the violence took the form of spot t orching of houses of kisiis 143living on the rift valley side of the border as we ll as sporadic fighting between youths on the border the commission was informed by witness number 123 that in the course of the violence peace meeting was held in sotik area and addressed by the leading members of the odm

violence in kericho was n 30th and 31st december 2007 and 1st january 2008 thereafter the violence changed form whereas in the first three days or so rioters confronted t he police openly in kericho town the violence later moved away into the t ea estates and the rural areas further some of the violence wa s now carried out at night dc jenga 144estimated that the violence lasted from 30th december 2007 and for the next two weeks or so there was intermittent fighting although according to him this had been contained according to aliwa whereas the initial violence was committed by armed youth in the immediacy of their neighbourhoods the subsequent violence began to display trends of raiders travelling long distances to commit acts of violence outside their home areas for example the attacks in ki pkelion were carried out by raiders coming from other districts the attack in mutaragon and munistry were carried out by raiders from outside these areas in the particular case of mutaragon the raiders came from nandi district in the case of the attacks in kericho some were carried out by people from the neighbouri ng buret district further attackers also came from bome t to attack tea estates which neighbour the district the sotik dc nakitare confirmed the existence of this trend when he told the commission that in the case of sotik ttackers came from as far as pokot the evidence of coordination of the violence is furthe r supported by the report of the kenya national commission on human rights wh ich related the organized manner in which they were carried out according to that report in areas like kipkelion in advance of contemplated attacks kalenjin attackers would place distinctive marks in front of all dwellings that belonged to members of their community as sign to the raiders as to which houses t pass over when they carried out the attacks traditional calabashes were ntioned as one form of such distinctive marks the report furthe r stated that in the subsequent days attacks on settlements were done from l directions and at the same time with clear direction in manner indicative of planning another round of serious violence broke out on 31st january 2008 triggered by the killing in eldoret of the member of parliament for ainamoi david too one of the outstanding incidents in this violence was the attack by mob on the ainamoi dos office during which an ad ministration police constable omar 145ahmed dado was killed by the mob and his colleague sustained an arrow shot wound aliwa described the incident as follows when the message was received group of youths attacked ainamoi dos office where pc omar dado was stationed he had fi rearm he tried his best to shoot in the air to scare them but they chased him where he went to hide they burned that house until he was dragged out killed and burned on the road they went further and shot another administration police officer with an arrow on the head they snatched his firearm and they robbed all the buildings thereaf ter the criminals who stole the firearms sneaked them in the church where they were recovered tea picker is violently attacked by kipsigis one of the saddest personal stories that came out of the sot ikborabu violence is that of simeon atandi monyancha who spoke to the commission in borabu monyancha was working for the sotik tea highland company as tea picker on 1 february while picking tea he was attacked and both his hands were amp utated his story as given to the commission is told below i used to be tea picker at sotik tea until 1st february 2008 when i was attacked by kipsigis raiders who were attacking and burning property belongi ng to the kisiis on this day i was in the tea estate pickin g tea at around 900 am the head boy mr daniel kimetto told us that there was violence all over and advised us to go to our houses to hide i went to my house i lived in camp five wh ich consisted of many kipsigis i heard them saying that kisiis must move out of camp five and join fellow kisiis at camp majengo after securing house at camp majengo i packed my household items together with my clothes and began to go to the camp majengo i saw six armed young men with pangas bows and arrows they aimed at wi th the arrows i pleaded with them not to shoot they put the arrows down and star ted assaulting with the pangas i tried to block the pangas using both my hands to protect my hea d i saw my left hand being cut three times then they cut my head on the left han d side blood spilt all over my face and i could not see what was happening i lost consci ousness when i gained consciousness i found myself in litein hospi tal feeling lot of pain and both my hand had been amputated it is during the second wave of violence that chebilat border shopping centre between sotik and borabu was burnt extensively kisii wom an whose life time 146investments in school located on the sotik side was exten sively looted testified that there were requests by he r kipsigis neighbours that she should reconsider her decision to flee to the kisi i side just before he r school was burnt as they feared that her flight would insight the kisii community and attract retaliatory attacks on them in the end however she had to move to the kisii side because of fear for her safety when gang of attackers arrived in her school and the local people were unable to give her protection in her view some of the attacks were carried out by people from the inland and w ithout regard to the views of the local residents at the border area the att ackers on her school left for her message on one of the writing boards in the classrooms which well sums up the feelings that drove the violence on the boar d they wrote kisiis and kalenjins will never live together b in kipkelion according to gedow the kipkelion dc violence erupted on 30th december 2007 with the announcement of the final tally in the president ial election results the announcement was immediately followed by widespread incidents of arson some areas within the district in pa rticular the areas of molo soget and kamatins had intense skirmishes initially there was n ethnic angle to the arson attacks but this later spilt over to all communities living in the district illegal roadblocks were mounted by yout h at various spots along the highway notably at kapsoit the violence also targeted various govern ment installations and resulted in the burning of and vandalism on some buildi ngs and vehicles the offices of three chiefs 80 schools 2 zonal offices and 7 dispensaries were vand alized one forest guard was killed and there was illegal logging of forests the commission conducted an extensive tour of the south rif t valley area and was struck by the widespread nature of arson on homes of persons not considered to be indigenous to the area 147there was evidence of some level of trai ning in preparation to commit violence the commission received evidence in the form of digita l video disk dvd recording that was captured in kureso i which borders kipkelion the video showed attackers being trained at kimaranya village in keringet the evidence as to training is supported by the evidence of the kenya nat ional commission on human rights which asserted that trai ning and oathtaking took place in camps in preparation for the attacks the report said the training reportedly took place in the farms of sen ior leaders in the area or in the regions forests one police constable report edly trained attackers in kericho town the attackers were well equippe d with weapons and materials that they would need to conduct som of their activities such as power saws used in cutting down hug trees that were used to block the roads according to the knhcr report the attack ers in kericho bureti and londiani the latter of which is in kipkelion reportedly sent wa rnings to their victims of the impending attack before the attack s were actually carried out such warnings were delivered by telephone the report concludes th at on that premise there was premeditated intent to forcibly evic t the victims from the region further claims regarding the violence was provided by the testimony of kipsigis farmer at sachangwan location molo di strict the farmer testified regarding review meeting to asses whether the violence had met its ob jects held in his area at the end of the fighting the witness informed the c ommission that on 28th february 2008 meeting was convened by the kalenjins t baharini to discuss the aftermath of the post electio n violence the meeting was chaired by retired assistant chief and attended by among other local leaders according to the witness the background to this meeting was that nonkal enjin homes had been burnt down and the owners having fled the area the eting sought to discuss measures for ensuring the ritual cleansing of th area youth who had participated in the burning of nonkalenjin homes durin g the post election 148violence as the burning of residences is considered an abomi nation under kalenjin values he testified that in order to achieve th cleansing of local youths who had participated in the burning of homes the meetin g agreed that goat would be slaughtered for use in conducting the cleansing seco ndly the meeting was the occasion for discussing how farm s formerly occupied by those who had fled would be purchased or hired out affordably t the meeting the witness said he disagreed with the idea of sharing out the proper ty of neighbours who had fled from the area to escape the violence as resul t of his opposition he was viewed as traitor and on 17th march 2008 his house was razed down by fellow kalenjins most of whom he identified following the killing of the area legislator too there w as an escalation in the level of violence in the area according to police report s tendered by gedow 47 people died 27 of them of arrow shots 7 of injuries usi ng crude weapons 11 of gun shot wounds and two of burning property was lso destroyed with 3568 buildings totally razed down 23 buildi ngs partially burnt and 1542 buildings vandalized according to gedow large nu mber of persons participated in acts of arson and almost each of them carried container of petrol for use in the burning the commission heard that the main method of b urning was by placing accelerants on sticks which woul d then be propelled by hand onto the targeted buildings others would just torch the houses d irectly police and provincial administration response all the district commissioners and mbers of the police force that the commission interviewed pronounced themse lves satisfied with their response to the post election violence however the commission was concerned about number of specific issues raised by the evidence in relat ion to their response these are discussed below the account by government officials in kericho was they were unaware the there would be post election violence and therefore did to provi for it the worst case 149scenario for them was the possibility of violence in t he lead up to the elections especially in the areas that they consid ered to be prone to violence such as nyagacho and matobo in kericho town th ere were contingency arrangements in relation to the violence that ended up engulfing the multinational estates in kericho and therefore provision to deal with the v iolence the response by the authorities in kericho to the violen ce that they thought may happen was to mount peace committee meetin gs in their areas amid the hate messages that have been referred to in the evidence the l ocal administration carried on with the establishment of peace committees and the convening several meetings in the affected areas all the officials that the commission spoke to participated in or facilitated these meetings which were or ganized by the electoral commission of kenya this was its preferred i ntervention in dealing with the possibility of electoral violence the eck and other government offici als who came before the commission appeared to derive much satisfaction from the fact that t hese peace meetings had taken place throughout the country be fore the elections they all seemed to regard the organization of such meetings as sufficient nd exonerated themselves from blame for lack of preparation in regard to the violence that eventually occurred in the country officials seemed to sk this question what else were we supposed to do if against our advice people chose to fight with the benefit of what is now known there must be asked serious questions as to the whether the peace meetings that were convened by the eck had enduring value or whether they provided the easy op tion for public officials faced with the hate messages that abounded in the peri od before the post elections and which in the view of the commission played big role in the post election violence when violence broke out in kericho town which was inva ded by multitudes of rioters the police were unprepared to deal with it th ey responded with extreme force killing six people who they claim were among the rioters that had invaded the cooperative and equity banks in the town the area ocpd walter aliwa attempted to justify the killing by asserti ng that the rioters attempted to shoot 150the police with arrows but there is evidence whatsoeve r to support this claim on the contrary aliwas evidence that the police shot the rioters because these were robbers who were breaking banks is not the real reason why police shot into the crowd in the view of the commission this sh ooting constitutes an unwarranted use of force by the police and must be in vestigated in borabu the commission was told that policeman in plainclothes shot man joshua nyarunda police later claimed that the shooting was accidental but action was taken against the police officer involved the sudden onset of riots in the south rift required police response to multiple situations at the same time at the beginning of the viole nce the strength of personnel in kipkelion and kericho distri cts was 350 of whom 100 were aps the ocpd had to request for additional personnel from utside the district these came from the administration po lice antistock theft unit and the general service unit and arrived on 1st january 2008 or soon thereafter in sotik the dcio sought fortification both from the rif t valley and nyanza provinces and in all an ad ditional 200 police officers came in as reinforcement had there been prior planning and appreciation of the possible eventualities the reinforcement would have been available much earlier and might have prevented much of the initial violence an example of the inabili ty by the security agencies to make contingency arrangements was provided by aliwa himself when he testified that he refused to even contemplate that odm d chance of winning the elections and therefore did not provide for the poss ible consequences of such an outcome other than the excessive use of force by police as exempl ified by the kericho town incident the commission received information tha t police response to rescue people under attack was slow or altogether absent although in some instances they faced real obstacles in one incident in soti k area the house of retired couple was surrounded by raiders for nine hours before they were rescued the wife recounted to the commission their ordeal as follows 151on 5th february early in the morning my husband woke up an d went to till the farm shortly after he went out he ca running back to the house he ordered us to close all the doors and windows he told us that he saw group of kalenjin outh coming towards our house few minutes later we heard thei r voices outside they were calling us by our names and they ask ed us to come out we recognized their voices one of them was our neighbour at around 900 am they star ted breaking the doors and the windows of the house they could not break into the house b ecause of the grill reinforcement i called the chief to come an d help us he sent vehicle and administration policemen they could n ot reach us immediately because all the roads leading to chepilat w ere barricaded by kalenjin warriors they came to us aroun d 6 pm and they escorted us out of the house another witness who sustained an injury when his home was surrounded and attacked by raiders recounted the following when i turned i found that i had been speared on the l eft where i am showing you at that point i called the chief the chief told that there is way he could assist the chief advi sed to look for other means of assisting myself fortunately for this witness police on patrol arrived w here he had been attacked and took him to hospital police response to people in distress was hindered not only by the inadequacy of personnel on the part of the security forces who were simply overwhelmed by the demands on them and were unable to cope with th situations created by the violence but also because those under attack were spr ead over long distances in rural setting moreover the electoral p rocess to which the police 152had provided vital support had hardly be concluded by the time they were called upon to deal with the post elec tion violence large number of police officers were still on the way back to their duty stations when the violence erupted further and as the police and other witnesses told the commission the emergence of illegal roadblocks hindered police moveme nt or altogether blocked off access to some of those in need to deal with the problem of blocked roads the dsic p ut in place plan to clear the highway the police deployed person nel on the major highways to monitor spots on the highway prone to blockages and generally cond uct mobile patrols in the potentially volatile areas further the commission received evidence that police s ometimes stood passively as property was damaged and di d nothing to restrain the violence or arrest the perpetrators for example th commission heard that chebilat was not burnt in one day it was burnt for almost three weeks there were destructions in front of the officers the commission received reports that due to bias based on ethnicity some officers were reluctant to prevent the violence or to p rovide protection to the affected persons as part of such bias th ere were reports that luo police officer was accused of blocking the kipsigis from reaching the road in their bid to escape and instead redirecting them to their homes only for t hem to be attacked by the kikuyus further kikuyu officers stood aside as kalenjins faced violence and vice versa in some situations police failed to resp ond to situations of distress even where early warning and pleas had been communicated to them th knchr report states that house was burnt few metres from the londiani police station in spite of prior notification of the police of an impen ding attack where there was police intervention dispro portionate force was someti mes applied for instance the knchr report implicates senior po lice officer in the killing of several civilians in situations that amounted to excessive use of fo rce the report 153further states that an ocs accompanied by other officers shot about 17 civilians in londiani and kericho during riot after the death of mp too which led to an upsurge i n violence the dsic reinforced the available secu rity personnel with additi onal officers drawn from the general service unit regular police administration police and the criminal investigations department further 30 members of the rapid deployment unit of the administration police department we re sent in to reinforce operations at the kipkelion dsic meeting held on 12th february 2008 the dcio told the meeting that he had instructed personne l to search various premises which he believed were where the hate leaflets were being printed response to idps one of the issues authorities in the south rift had t deal with as result of the post election violence was the emergence of internally displaced persons kisii town became one of the largest reception centres for idps in the western part of kenya according to local dc augustine nthiga the district received idps from upper migori rachuonyo kericho siaya homa bay bondo nandi bureti and kakamega at one point there we re 23 000 idps in kisii town in sotik the dc said there were 8500 peop displaced from th district most of these were kisii and kikuyu the kipsigis returnees were absorbed by the local community and did not go to displa cement camps temporary camp was established at the sotik police station these idps were thereafter taken to places of safety the kikuyu were ta ken to nakuru and molo and places in central province the kisiis were taken to ekerenyo c amp established in north kisii district although kiva the dc in borabu told the commission that those displaced by the fighting along the border were abs orbed inland and that as result camps were set up in her district the c ommission received evidence that idps displaced from along the border were facing life of neglect from the authorities including the dc herself who had refused to even acknowledge the existence of the idps 154 the kericho ocpd told the commission that that the num ber of idps from among tea plantation workers stood at 9 000 of these 6808 had been returned to their places of work by the time he testified before the commission 2000 business people had been displaced as result of the violence ut of whom 1269 had returned to their businesses at the time of his tes timony the last category of idps were persons who owned land in kericho before t he violence the number stood at 250 of whom only 50 had returned to t heir land in relation to kipkelion the commission received eviden ce that the district received idps as early as november 2007 who had escaped th fighting in molo and kuresoi these were received in chepsion and londia the district commissioner arranged for meetings with them and they were returned to where they had fled from the conflict in kipkelion led to the establishment of 17 idp camps with one hosting those of kalenjin descent and the other of mixed ethnic composition there were also heightened relocations of people moving to thnically homogeneous locations which they considered safe there were convoys to siaya kisii nyamira nakuru molo nyahururu nyeri an d thika gedow admitted that initially the government did not f acilitate these movements ostensibly because it was not the intention of the government to move people from their homes he told the commissio n that what they put in place were measures to protect li fe and property and not more report of the law society of kenya south rift valle branch on police misconduct in kericho district the understanding by the commission of the nature of violenc that took place in kericho district was greatly enhanced by the submission by the law society of kenya south rift branch for which the commission is grateful through its secretary gideon mutai the societ submitted to the commission the depositions made under oath of forty tw different witnesses testifying to 155incidents of violence in the district which either involved them personally members of their families persons known to them or oc currences which they had personally witnessed the first issue to be address ed is the credibility of the information provided by the law society out of the 39 cases of shooting that the evidence dealt with it indicated that 23 people wer shot dead while the rest sustained severe injuries whose consequences varied grea tly the commission compared the list of the deceased persons provided by the l aw society and confirmed that these are already part of the list of deceased persons in kericho which was provided by the moh for the area dr ambros rotich the information provided by the law society is therefore h ighly credible as it materially corroborates the evidence from hospital sour ces which the commission generally considers to be credible number of broad matters are disclosed by the evidence collected by the law society south rift branch which greatly supplements for the inability of the commission to hol d hearings in the area these are discussed below out of the cases of 42 people covered by the evidence of the society it is indicated that police shot 36 of them two of the rema ining six persons were kalenjin men severely assaulted by police as two others were shot by dead by unknown assailants there is evidence that these wer the police the last one was kalenjin man shot with an arrow in chebilat by unknown people review of the cases covered by the evi dence of the law society indicates that the epicentres of the violence in kericho district includ ed kericho town ainamoi shopping centre the londiani junction and chebilat centre which between them accounted for 14 of all cases covered the rest of the cases were widely dispersed through the district and occurred in such places s chesinende centre kapsuser centre and chelimo estate in this r egard the evidence confirms other available evidence which indicates kericho t own and ainamoi to have experienced the greatest of the viol ence in kericho district the severest violence in ainamoi coincided with the ath of the local member of parliament which has variously been discussed 156 the evidence of the society brings new insights into what happened in ainamoi following the death of the mp it is alleged that the death of the mp resulted in large crowd of local residents marching on the ainamoi dos office apparently to express their anger it is indicated that these were met by police officers who shot in the air as way of dissuading them from coming near the office it is far from clear how many policemen were present but these could n ot have been many the evidence mentions the name of the illfated omar dado and another policeman paul chum as having been in volved in the unfolding standoff it is alleged that policeman shot person as he bent over the body of his brother who had just been killed by the police an d that dado then gave chase of the shot person who was later arrested an allegati on from the ainamoi incident is that five villagers who were admitted in hospit as result of gunshot wounds were subsequently charged in court with th unbailable offence of robbery with violence and were at the time that the law society rec orded their evidence still remanded in custody according to one of them francis kipngeno the sole means by which they were identified was the fact that th ey sustained gunshot wounds kipngeno said i know that th basis for my arrest is because i had gunshot wounds as all of us who were at ainamoi were arrested and charged further the facts constituting the offence that they face in court appear to revolve around the violence that took place in ainamoi wit hin the time available it was not made clear to th commission how an offence of robbery could be sustained against the two under the circumstances describ ed but the matter we are told is before the cour t the regrettable violence in ainamoi would need to be fully investigated and appropriate action as the evidence will warrant will then need to be taken the evidence of the law society adds to the already clear picture of arbitrary or highhanded conduct on the part of the police in one case man was beaten and injured seriously by po lice who invaded reconciliation meeting between the kisii and kipsigis at chebilat on 5 febr uary 2008 he was then arrested and abandoned on the roadside within kisi i area in what must have been an 157exposure to considerable risk given the existing ethnic animosity at the time his injuries must have been serous as he was hospitalized at kaplong mission hospital for four days the evidence also relates the sto ry of man from kapsoit centre who claims that his place of work butchery was i nvaded by policemen gsu who hacked and seriously injured him on the hand using the implements for cutting meat that were within the premi ses the policemen then robbed him of kshs51000 belonging to the business and shortly thereafter shot another man as he fled from th scene having witnessed the hacking incident the man who was shot corroborat ed the hacking incident as well as testifying to his being shot it appears that where police used mmunition on the crowd they did so indiscriminately and in many of the situ ations the shooting was not preceded by any form of warning this conclusion is supported by the evidence of significant number of the witnesses who recounted that suddenly the police started shooting at the crowd or polic suddenly arrived and started shooting at us the indiscriminate nature of the shooting is further demonstrated by the profile of the victims of the shooting and the circumstances surrounding the shooting one of these was teenaged girl shot while coming from the posho mill where she had gone to grind maize meal for the family two of the victims claim that they were shot in the vicinity of hospitals where they had gone to see patients and two others claim that they caught in cross fire between police and rioters in each of the cases provided by the law society very serious allegations are made against the police which if true would constitute grave offences on the part of the police these cases would need to be investiga ted independently as is discussed elsewhere in this report evidence of organization of the violence in kipkeli on the sotik dc in whose district violence began on 28th december informed the commission that the reason for the viol ence was the delay in the announcement 158of the election results the commission found this diff icult to believe as voting had taken place only the previous day the commencement of violence in sotik so early and at any rate before the disputed election re sults had become an issue is indicative of the fact that ther were reasons for the violence other than the delay in announcing the election results or the announcement of an outcome that many people in the south rift believed to be incorrect and unjust the commission considered the evidence which suggested that t he attacks in the kipkelion area were conducted in highly coordinate manner as part of this the question of the source of the petrol that was used to burn property in kipkelion was of some interest to the commission accordin g to gedow allegations that known person had tr ansported petrol that was used to conduct arson were discounted by the in vestigations carried out by the police he however admitted that petrol was used but could not tr ace the particular station where it was bought partly due to the large number of persons who participated in the burning the dc added that the possession of petrol at that time of the year december 10th 23rd would pass as normal as there was possibility of stocking of fuel by pe ople for fear of possible shortage however the commission finds it difficul t to believe that common people most of whom ordinarily have use for petrol would need to stockpile the commodity as contingency against possi ble shortages in the electioneering period the commission wonders whether th widespread availability of petrol which was then used in the burning of prop erty in the area could be pointer to prior preparation as to the possibility of the violence having been planned the dc denied knowledge by the district intelligence committee of impending violence and that in any event that was highly unlikely as it was largely ne ighbouragainst neighbour conflict according to gedow evidence had come to the knowledge of the dsic of any oathtaking before and after the elections however the position of the provincial 159administration that the violence was t planned must be considered in the context of number of other factors that came to the ttention of the commission first as discussed the testimony referred to earl ier that there was warning to victims by perpetrators of the violence be fore this was actually carried out this fact is inconsistent with spontaneous violence and consistent with planning second large number of people would appear to have k nown that there would be violence long before this happened as the commission was told by borabu residents third it is the view of the commission that the scale and extent of the violence is itself suggestive of planning fo urth there is evidence of some form of training having taken place in preparation for violence f ifth although the commission was not able to establish the validity of the claim there were allegations that some form of oathtakin g also took place in preparation for the violence sixth there is evidence of at least one meetin g to review the situation after the violence had subsided conclusions it is the view of the commission the kipsigis were unh appy with the presence of the kikuyu and the kisii in their homeland in large num bers the tensions between the kipsigis on the one hand and the kisiis and kikuyu s on the other during the electioneering period resulted from this it is the view of the commission that an aspect of the violence was spontane ous and that the disaffection with the election results or the perceived illegitimacy of the process could have been as the cause of the violence the targetin g of the kikuyu and the kisii during this initial violence was not only backlash by the kipsigis for the unjustified loss that they felt had been inflicted on them but also an attempt to exact retribution against those in their neighbourhoo d who they felt contributed to that loss by voting in manner incon sistent with their own voting patterns further the violence was fo rm of vicarious vengeance against those presiding over political system felt to have robbed the ki psigis of an electoral 160victory as supporters of political system that they believ ed had deeply wronged them the kisii and kikuyu were targeted in the vi olence that the kipsigis unleashed following the announcement of the electi on results the targeting of government property and bu sinesses owned by ki kuyu and kisii was consistent with this feeling this phase of the violence was spontaneous broke out immediately after the announcement of the results wa s mainly opportunistic in nature and found its gr eatest expression in urban areas however it would be an oversimplificati on of the problem to say that the post election violence in the south rift was so lely caused by dissatisfaction over the presidential results much as this wa s an important problem clearly other factors were at work as well as indica ted by discussion of the evidence the violence initially spontaneous increasi ngly showed signs of organisation the longer it went on further in parts of the rift valley violence began on 29th december before the election results were announced the commission cannot therefore rule out that some of the violence was planned the reasons for this would not have been dissatisfaction over the election results it had to do w ith the interpretation of the majimbo system that some members of the kalenjin community the host community to large number of other ethnic communities had which was that these other communities would be made to leave the rift v alley once the majimbo system was put in place rising up in arms i n the context of the post election violence therefore was selfdriven imposition of this version of majimbo through the forceful removal of people from pla ces that were not considered to be their homeland as discussed elsewhere in this report the commission finds that there was deplorable behaviour on the part of the police in the country including in the rift valley but the problems of the kale njindominated parts of the rift valley were not limited to police misconduct these extended to citizenoncitizen 161violence which accounted for the bulk of the killings that happened in that part of the country one of the explanations to the conflict in the south rift is the competing claims over ethnic territory between the kipsigis and kisii the coincidence of this conflict with the electioneering process however sugg ests that whatever the merits of the dispute it is manipulated into becoming an electoral issue and an excuse for violence the commission did not receive sufficient information to determine the relative merits of these historical claims however the commission was struck by the lack of formalised articu lation of this dispute in any form other than through violence for example the com mission did not receive evidence that there has been process of political engagement by the leaders of the two communities that was aimed at discus sing the existence of border dispute and its possible resolution in the circum stances the border dispute is an occasional problem mani festing itself when the two communities have different points of view on matter that is impo rtant to them like elections and then vanishing until the next season of disagreement the commission does not have the confidence to make finding that legitima border grievance exists between the two communities 162chapter four violence in western and nyanza provinces western province introduction western province borders uganda to the west nyanza province to the south and rift valley to the east the province is home to the lu hya ethnic group who are divided into various subgroups th ough the rural parts are largely homogeneous there are parts of the province which have sett lement schemes inhabited by people from diverse ethni c origins the urban centres are also ethnically mixed the province comprises 19 districts namely bungoma east b ungoma west bungoma north bungoma south busia samia bunyala butere mumias kakamega south kakamega north kaka mega east kakamega central lugari mt elgon teso vihiga hamisi and emuhaya western province is home to the mounta inous and agriculturallyrich mt elgon district which is at the centre of long standing dispute over land and cattle rustling between the sabaot and other ethnic communities bukusu ndorobo teso kikuyu and the luo the dispute has pitted securit forces of the government of kenya against proscrib ed militia group the sabaot land defence force sldf because the problems associated with violence in mt elgon predated the elections the commission was unable to establish any l ink with the 2007 pev and therefore did not integrate it into in vestigation of pev in the region it was the evidence of general mutinda kianga the chief of gen eral staff of the kenya armed forces that the conflict in mt gon started long before the elections and continued even after the postelection violence we were of the view that the issues concerning mt elgon were of ch magnitude that the commission could not delve into them given its limi ted mandate time and resources 163 western province has not been spared of the scourge of previ ous incidents of tribal clashes occurring particularly in 1992 and 1997 th kiliku report and akiwumi report identified some of the areas that were the subject of pr evious clashes in the province in the kiliku report the then mt elgon subdistri ct in bungoma was cited as having been rocked by ethnic clashes the report attributed the clashes to number of factors including hunger for land by the sabao t who felt neglected by the government in that they had not as tribe been c onsidered for settlement schemes like other communities the region affected by the cla shes during the period covered by the report now lies in mt elgon dis trict which for the reasons stated above is not within the ambit of this repo rt122 the akiwumi report indicated that the clashes in western province occurred in the old bungoma district and to very large extent in the old kakamega district along the nandi escarpment wh ich constitutes the boundary between kakamega and nandi districts the ca uses comprised the incessant disputes over land which was then exploited by politicians at the introduction of multiparty politics in kenya there was also violence as result of the spillover effects of the neighbouring conflictpro ne trans nzoia dist rict in the rift valley123 information presented to the commission revealed long standing history of resentment against the kikuyu ostensibly because of their perceived hegemony in political and economic areas at the expense of the indigenous communities124 when heavy deployment of security office rs who were perceived to be agents of the pnu party was noticed in the province ahead of th elections it only served to accentuate the rumours that the pnu party was planning to rig the elections with the help of the state apparatus the delayed relea of the presidential 122 kiliku report chapter 3 pages 22 to 40 123 akiwumi report chapter 2 pages 191 199 124 see the evidence of cw 120 discussed elsewhere in this section

heighten tensions patterns of postelection violence in western province the period before the elections was generally considered peac eful apart from incidences relating to political ri valry between candidates and their supporters125from the evidence presented these incidents were within t he competence of the security forces to co ntrol and were dealt with accordingly evidence was submitted to

supporters from travelling from bungoma to webuye this prompted intervention by police officers and running battles ensued post election violence in western provin ce was characterised by burning looting and vandalising of property belonging to the kikuyu community and by those 125 one such incident was in khwisero constituency where supporters of mr bulimo of odm party and hon julius akaranga

his evidence that during preelection planning his team was mainly concerned about the violence erupting in the urban centres of busia mumias and ka kamega as there had been preelection tension the pc testified that postelection viol ence started in mumias district on 27th december 2008 following suspicion of ba llot boxes having been hidden in the house of joseph mbacio thiru businessman in mumias town129 members of the public proceeded to his premises searched the house but found nothing the public composed of rowdy stone wielding youths chant ing anti pnu slogans began looting the house and in time the rioters damaged his pickup car and burnt down another one and set ablaze his house af ter emptying it of its contents130 according to the pc the police managed to quell the di sorder tension and anxiety grew as the election results continue d to trickle in the provincial criminal investigatio ns officer patrick mugo muhuni131 told the commission that on 28 december 2007 youths assembled into groups and run along the streets of kakamega town sh outing odm party slogans and praising the odm party presidential candidate every time the televi sion stations announced results in which their party or candidate had emer ged victorious the commission was told that the violen ce in budalangi busia district erupted on 29 december 2007 where it is alleged that ar med supporters of the pnu candidate raphael wanjala shot one civilian in the area dead this was followed by retaliatory attack by pporters of the rival candidate ababu namwamba but police managed to contro l the latters supporters and restore order however the patterns shifted on 30th december when it became obvious that the violence now targeted the property of the kiku yu population leading to 128 cw 87 129

looted on 31st december 2007 when his property was being consumed in fl ames the police just stood by and watched as the arsonists went on the violence in lugari took different ch aracter in its organisation and target lugari is generally settled area occupi ed by several ethnic groups among them the luhya kalenjin and kikuyu violence in lugari was affected by events in the neighbouring uasin gishu district where the attackers ta rgeted and burnt property of persons belonging to the ki kuyu community it is alleged that the attackers were armed with pangas and ar rows and used matches to burn grass thatched house according to the pc the violence that engulfed western province started on 27th december 2007 in mumias and then reached its climax on 31st december 2007 and that was the end of our violence the climax of this violence spread all over the province most parts of the province except bungoma north bungoma west and bungoma east the commission received evidence of op portunistic attacks by the youth who engaged in wanton looting and destruction of property one victim told us that youths took advantage of the situation she testified th at before the elections she together with her parents used to live in kefinco estat in kakamega town they had received eviction notices through anonymous call s and reported the incidents to the police however she was told that due to insufficiency of personnel she could not get any protection and was advised to seek refuge at the premises near mama watoto superm arket owned by mr tharao on 28 december 2007 at around 6 pm group of young men numbering about twenty forced themselves into their compound and demande d keys to the house claiming to have taken possession of it she was ordered t leave as others shouted her fathers name she ran and took refuge at house where local brew was being sold and overheard group of patrons plotting raid on their house 168ostensibly on the pretext that kikuyus had unfairly acq

identified by two men they managed to get into the hou but soon thereafter jeremiahs house was also the subject of attack for the reason that he had hosted unwanted people additionally the commission was told that the violence i n other parts of the country had direct impact on the entire region on 31 january 2008 group of youths blockaded the highway between timboroa and turbo trading centre general shortage of commodities was felt in the province as supply lines had been cut136 internally displaced persons most of the idps were members of the kikuyu community an d those sympathetic to

refuge in uganda 500 of whom were children as at the time of rece iving his testimony 342 refugees who had been camping at mulanda and kiryandogo had come back to ken displacement of persons ty pically flowed as consequence of the postelection violence and was characterised by movement of people to ethnically homogeneous areas to which they were linked either because f their community lineage or their ancestral homelands th region also witnessed the influx of returnees from other parts of the countr most notably kericho nakuru and naivasha most of these returnees were absorbed back into th families of the locals or their kin apart from facilitation of their t ransport to their ancestral homes we were not informed of any intervention from the government or from any of the agencies that were concerned with the welfare of the returnees save for the testimony of pc who informed us that the government had been distributing relief supplies to those idps who had assembled at the idp camps response by police and provincial administration the provincial commissioner testified th at the security agents responded against charged mobs with restraint in bid to reduce the number of casualties he recounted how at sigalagala in kakamega south and lutonyi in kakamega central the security officers used civili an vehicles to arrest youths who were harassing motorists on the highway however there was ample evidence from the data gathered t hospitals and from the police to suggest that the police us ed excessive force and in particular firearms in dealing with the demonstrations to control crowds which in some cases had turned violent information on casualties and aths submitted by dr caleb olango onudi the provincial medical officer provides sufficient ground for an inference that deaths in kakamega busia and mumias occurred 170as result of injuries secondary to guns hots or those as result of assault by the police the records which were collected and co llated from 9 major hospitals in the province and harmonized with the figur from the police indicated that there were 98 died as result of pev in the province as follows kakamega 31 deaths webuye 21 vihiga 18 mumias 12 busia 9 bungoma 7 postmortems carried out on the 98 bodies revealed that 74 of them died of gunshots thus gunshot comprised 73 of all fatalit ies in the province we were informed that inquest files in these matters have been opened but further steps have been taken to investigate the killings we find thi s state of affairs wholly unsatisfactory according to the western pcio patrick mu go muhuni as early as october 2007 provincial police headquarters had formed committee to monitor all election related events the committee was expected to collect information from the eight police divisions and report to the provincial police officer and other senior police officials who would then evaluate and analyse the information before directing on the right cause of action the security officers in t he province had been instructed to be on high alert for any possible disorde r during the electioneering period all the eight office rs commanding police divisions in the province were to conduct rehearsals on control of riots and generally i n maintaining law and order during the period while the content of this train ing was not revealed to the commission the expectation was that it ought to ve reflected in the manner in which the police handled the rioters 171the totality of evidence suggests that the police were verwhelmed and unreasonably resorted to the use of fi rearms it further reveals insufficient manpower and facilities available to th police to counter the magnitude of demonstrations witnessed in the period af ter the elections information from the minutes of butere district security and intelligence committee summary 072007 for the period between 14 november and 24 decemb er 2007 indicated that adequate security measures had been put in place and the polling stations sufficiently policed however of concern was that with only few days to the elections and in the light of the anxiety that had gripped the region concrete plans were yet to be finalized with regard to fuelling and servicing of the vehicles to be used this pointed to the insufficiency of vehicles to respond to any distress call during that period hence making it easy to conduct demonstrations looting and destruction of property the pc testified that the peace building and reconciliat ion campaigns spearheaded by the provincial administ ration in the province yielded quick results as result of the reconciliati on efforts of the psic and dsics 26861 households moved out of the temporary idp camps with some returning to their farms and others opting to stay with relatives and friends additionally peace and reconciliation co mmittees were set up in all districts comprising elders from the various co mmunities religious leaders and civil servants in vihiga busia teso and kakamega central districts workshops were also held on diverse dates to address the issues of ho stilities at the onset of the conflict the provincial administration also established six tempor ary ap posts in lugari to assist in the resettlement exercise planning and organisation from the evidence it appeared that the violence in western province was spontaneous save for lugari which bore the hallmark of planned and carefully organised onslaught against their victims and their property the commission received evidence to suggest prior prepara tion for the violence 172that rocked busia bungoma and mumias an d takes the view that the violence in these areas was direct result of di saffection with the final tally of the presidential election results in the case of lugari an inference of pl anning is buttressed by the evidence that the attackers were under central command additional ly the attacks came from one direction off the neighbouring uasin gishu district there was also some uniformity in the outfit of the attckers and the mode of attacks the youths were clad in black balaclavas and had their faces painted in white and divided themselves into smaller groups once they entered targeted area however beyond this we did not receive any credible eviden ce pointing to the culpability of any individual or group and we therefore recommend fur ther investigations be conducted to establish who the perpetrato rs and executors of the violence were conclusion the commission established that the viol ence experienced in western province was distinct from that experienced in other parts of the co untry in the sense that it was direct consequence of political di fferences these differences led to riots which were quelled by the law enforcemen t agencies thus resulting in high number of deaths from the totality of the evidence received by the commission the wave of violence apart from lugari was spontaneous and directly flowed from disaffection with the final tally of the president ial results the evidence the commission received re asonably supports an inference of planning in the case of lugari however the plotters financ iers and individuals engaged in whatever stage of the planning and execution pr ocess and where the attackers were trained could not be identified from it and remain obscure hence the need for further investigation 173 nyanza province introduction luo nyanza as it is popularly known neighbours lake victoria one of the great lakes of africa the continents largest lake the l argest tropical lake in the world and the second widest fresh water ke in the world it is the source of the longest branch of the river nile and is biological hotspot with great biodiversity which plays vital role in supporting th millions of people living around its shores while nyanza province is inhabited predominant ly by the luo there are bantu speaking tribes including the kisii kuria and f ew luhya living in the province the province derives its name from the sukuma bantuspeaking tribe living on the tanzanian side to whom the word nyanza means large mass of water the provincial capital is kisu mu kenyas third largest city the climate in the area is tropical and humid nyanza province consists of 21 district s of which 11 are predominantly luo and which are the subject of this part of the report the ma in economic activities in the region are crop farming focusing mainly on sugarcane coffee and bananas animal husbandry and fishing luo nyanza has been politically active since preindependence times and tends to vote as block for its candidate of choice especially since th reintroduction of multiparty politics in 1991 raila odinga presidential candidate during the 2007 lection though parliamentarian representing nairobis langata constituen cy has his roots in bondo district and is the of the late jaramogi oginga odinga the fact that raila odinga was the preferred candidate in the region an d that the voters in the region believed that the results of the presidential elect ions had been rigged against him also contributed greatly to the wave of violen ce in luo nyanza that we shall shortly explore as we shall luo nyanza rose up to protest what was seen as rigged presidential election protestors th us suffered the brunt of police killings unlike in other parts of the country that were ravaged by violence 174in the post election period the majority of the deaths r ecorded in luo nyanza were as result of shooti ngs attributed to police immediate preelection and election period nyanza province had been generally peaceful during the electoral period although the odm nominations were characterized by wi despread violence the commission was informed by grace kain di former nyanza provincial police officer that as early as august 2007 reports of ethnic t ension between the mainly luo residents who unani mously supported odm and non luo residents who were perceived to be sympathetic to pnu had b egan filtering in to t h u t h r i t i s t h w r s p r k d b n i n c i d n t i n k r t i n i n c n t r l province where the odm presidential candidate raila odin ga and his entourage had been unceremoniously thrown out of the karatina t ourist lodge an establishment owned and run by an inlaw of president kibaki in an incident that was widely reported in the medi in response intelligence sources indicated that tension was building up in rangwe siaya and migori where odm s u p p r t r s v w d t h t p l i t i c i n s f f i l i t d t n r c k p n u w s t t b formed or any other party aligned to incumbent presiden t mwai kibaki would face hostilities if they dared campaign in the odm strongholds of luo nyanza one such report indicated that local odm official had threatened to mobilize homa bay residents to evict the kikuyu from the area shoul d such an incident recur137 the nyanza provincial commissioner informed the commiss ion that campaigns in luo nyanza were intense and the dominant odm party was not keen to allow members from other political parties to campaign in the region the commission was told that from the month of october 2007 tension was heightened due to smear campaigns undertaken by rival politicians and that for instance in rang 137 exhibit 97a 175march along the kisiirongo border some youth torched several sugarcane plantations belonging to both kisii and luo farmers accord ing to mskaindi as the polling day approached we continued to rece ive intelligence reports to the effect that some luo youths in kisumu had threatened to take unspecified action against the kikuyu who had registered as voters in the area should they exhibit any form of suppor t for or attempt to vote against odm candidates on his part simon kiragu the kisumu oc pd stated that he did not notice any tension and therefore apparently made pr eparation in anticipa tion of violence we experienced problems during the campaigns we did n ot anticipate any problems after the general elections it t ook us by surprise when on 29th december 2007 riotous mob stormed the provincial works offices and burnt the main office block and nine government of kenya vehicles another riotous mob stormed the kbc office and burnt five motor vehicles by then the political temperatures were very high people demanding for immediate release of th presidential election results by the chairman of the eck138 the nyanza provincial comm issioner mr paul poland olando stated that the provincial administration had put in place mechanisms to ensure peaceful campaigns and through the police had made preparations for effective management of the camp aign calendar up to just before polling day and on 24th of dec 2007 the provincial security team met under my chairmanship to make sure that plans were complete for effective management of the polling day and thereafter the district commanders were equally instru cted to do the same we heard that the elections in the province including nnouncement of parliamentary results and presidential tallies were conducted in generally peaceful manner and that when the pr ovincial security and intelligence committee psic team met under the pcs chairmanship on 28 december 2007 they were satisfied that polling had been successful139 while voting was peaceful the pc stated that the psic received intellig ence from nsis on 28th december 2007 predicting that t h r c u l d b h i g h l v l s f x c i t m n t i f t h results were in favour of odm or protests if the resul ts were not favourable 138 exhibit 95a 139 cw90 176the nsis had forwarded the information to the authroties for information and necessary action and the psic accordingly inst ructed all provincial police officers to mobilize the police to be alert and also made arrangements to ensure law and order was maintained eruption of violence the commission heard diametrically opposing views as t the catalyst of the violence in luo nyanza the testimony of most government witnesses can be summed up thus that the authorities were suddenly confronted by of rampaging crowds and they had to restore law and order using all available means at their disposal on the other hand catholic pr iest who testified before us expressed the view that there were indications of vi olence as elections approached more police and security forces were deployed and that the general feeling among the residents was that they had cast their votes pe acefully and deserved an outcome amenable to their reasonable expectations namely raila odinga win the perceived delay to release the presidential resul ts was therefore interpreted as pointer towards riggin g and the luo community thus acted to preempt rigging but the police an d the state machinery moved with recklessness and disregard to their lives in suppressing thei r freedom of expression during which serious crimes were perpetrated against the people fighting for recognition of their democratic rights these two discordant views were repeatedly enunciated by the authorities on one hand and the citizenry on the other the priest told u s that in his view the demonstrations in nyanza were peaceful but the police disrupted them leading to unnecessary violence according to hi m people went to the streets to demonstrate without violence or stone throwing but that police shootings provoked the residents who then turned violent as way of expressing their displeasure with the police for using live ammunition throughout our hearings in kisumu we were confronted by these divergent views nd we shall endeavour to distil the truth from those two extreme versions of even ts 177the commission heard that the violence in nyanza occurred in 3 distinct phases the first was directly related to the context of elections and took place between 29 and 31 december 2007 it was characterized by demonstra tions riots acrimony and discon tent the second phase occurred in the new year and was reactionary apparently in protest against what was viewed as excessive use of force by police and also in response to calls for mass action by the odm leadership which lasted until mid january 2008 the th ird phase was associated with two unrelated events first the targeting of lu by kikuyu gangs in nakuru and naivasha leading to an influx of luo idps from outsi nyanza and the murders towards the end of january 2008 of two odm poli ticians mr mugabe were mp for embakasi and mr david kimu tai too similar evidence was in fact tendered by the knchr in their report the provincial commissioner stated that while violence be gan on 29 december in kisumu town reports of violence were also received b the psic from rachuonyo migori siaya and nyando dist ricts he informed us that most of this violence was particularly urban ba sed and also concentrated along the highways in the province the pc added that there was per ception among the luo community that the announcement of the presidential results had been delayed which raised suspicion that th delay could lead to mixing up and rigging of the results the psic therefore instructed the provin cial police officers to mobilize the security personnel to be on the ready to ensure th at officers who had been used on the polling day were available and that those who had been on leave were recalled pertinently the pc stated that it was not possible to engage political leaders since at the time they were not on the ground b 30 december 2007 we heard that many business people and families had moved out of nyanza and virtually the whole of luo nyanza was engulfed in violence nd security personnel had been deployed everywhere mr olando further told us all government offices were closed communication chann els were not functioning roads were blocked telephone lines l and lines were 178dismantled it was just practically impossible to ass emble any people for any kind of discussion and as security committee we w ere concerned with bringing down the situation because you need to bring down the situation before you can go into discussions one of the main targets of the violence was the governme nt on the perception that the polls had been rigged by government agents and t he feeling against the institution of government government fa cilities and government personnel was extremely intense and hostile accordin g to the pc it became difficult for government officials to discharge their duty my lord at that time it was practically difficult to engage the people in this province about their perception because first of all accessibility was difficult our main mode of conduct with the people which is public barazas was not possible was not functioning the people could not turn up and so it would have been difficult at that point my lord the results have just been announced people are tak ing great exceptionthe leaders are not there you want to bring the m together and according to them you are the personification of the government in the area my lord it was difficult while the pc regretted the loss of life and property especial ly in kisumu we were surprised when he told us that there had been indication there would be violence of the magnitude that arose after 29 december 20 07 there was intelligence which he acknowledged to ve received from the nsis had already been made available to him indicating the possibility of an ex plosion of violence evidence was received that the nyanza psic sought rein forcements because the magnitude of the violence and the time it was taking to suppress it had exerted fatigue on police officers further as result of the violence many idle youth resorted to criminal activities and at one point in tim the rioters and hooligans overwhelmed the security officers in spite of the security forces being stre tched the pc emphatically stated that there were foreign soldiers called in to assist and t hat indeed there never was need to bring in foreign assistance to nyanza this was confirme d by the kisumu ocpd mr simon kiragu the perception of there being foreign soldiers according to the pc and ocpd resulted from the deployment of the rapid deployment unit rdu unit within the administration police whose unique 179uniforms and gear red helmets with an upper green coats both back and front the area residents were not accustomed to doubting ins tead that these were indeed kenyan police officers we established that th rumours about the presence of foreign soldiers in the country were unfounded instead it was the appearance of the rapid deployment unit of the ap who uniform the local population had not hitherto seen and thus wrongly tional ly assumed to be detachments of ugandas people defense force updf the pc was of the view that the magnitude of violence that erupted after the disputed elections pointed to the need for government t consider preparedness for large disasters that may occur in future kisumu mr simon kiragu the kisumu ocpd told the commission th at on 29 december 2007 mob stormed the public works offi ce burning the main block and nine gk vehicles another group attacked th kenya broadcasting cooperation kbc office and burnt five motor vehicles as tensions rose over awaited presidential election results prompting the police to move in and disperse the crowds using teargas in the course of this violence the grand kimwa hotel was attacked the next day on december 30th violence erupted again in the entire city of kisumu more than 4000 people converged at kondele market as early as 800 am demanding the immediate release of national presidential results while disturbances also erupted in other parts of the town w ith riotous mobs vandalizing and looting from shops perceive d to belong to people who were non indigenous mr kiragu informed the commission that riots then spread to kondele nyalenda otongolo nyamasaria and manyatta th rioters were initially dispersed but they regrouped an d violently stormed into the center of the city where they engaged in vandalism and looting of pr operty on the same day 7 people were burnt to death inside minoki buildi ng when there was massive looting within the town 180mr kiragus evidence concurs with the pcs testimony that f rom 30 december 2007 violence would start during the da and the rioting mobs would retreat at night and assemble the following day to start again accord ing to the pc kisumu city was targeted from three directions where the r ioting mobs blocked the main entry points to the city kisu munairobi highway at karoki kisumu kakamega at kondele and kisumubusia at the railway junct ion violence was then directed to kondele area and the other outskirts of kisumu the violence then assumed an ethnic dimension where it was targeted at residential buildings commercial buildi ngs business centres and enterprises particularly belonging to the kikuyu and meru and later the kamba and kisii communities similar evidence was also given by knchr the b urning and looting of business premises belonging to some nonluo individuals and also companies that were deemed as foreig n affected crater auto motors minoki house ramgharia singh rabha

floor of swan center140 by 30 december 2007 with presidenti results yet to be announced the government according to father charles oloo k ochiel of the catholic peace and justice commission became target for ventilation of public anger since the people felt that the only language that they could s peak was by acting against the system that did not address their pli ght their kind of suffering their kind of pain and i would say that it is not that the people were prepared to destroy any government institutions but i think they were reacting to the excessive force used by th police and the gsu 140 exhibit 95b 181there were attempts to immobilize government operations t hrough the digging of trenches and barricading of roads burning and overturning of government vehicles the commission heard that riot ers invaded the water companys offices where they looted set ablaze the main office and burnt 17 motor vehicles and one motor cycle police managed to disperse the rioters before they could set the entire building on fire the commission heard that the police kept chasing the cr owds and using tear gas until they eventually realized they could not contain t hem without using live fire and mr kiragu took the decision that live ammun ition was to be used this is the time we now decided to use live fire to ensure t hat buildings do not continue being burnt and by so doing w managed to chase the rioters out of the town and they retre ated to the estates the pc stated that instructions to the administration p olice were channelled from nairobi through him and in the course of 30 decemb er gsu platoon 50 regular police and 50 offi cers from the rapid deployment unit rdu of the administration police were jointly deployed under the command of the ocpd mr simon kiragu bringing his total manpower to more than 300 security personnel supported by ten vehicles the rdu and gsu were assigned speci fic sectors to cover and worked independently while th administration police officers were put together with the regular police af ter the lessons of the previous days running battles and the difficulty of controlling the huge crowds the ocpd embarked on deployment pattern which would lock the pe ople from entering the main city and containing them within the slum tes of nyalenda manyatta nyamasaria kondele mambol eo otongolo bandani and kanyakuor in order to ensure that the crowds did not enter the central business district the ocpd placed lockups to prevent people from passi ng and going on into the town center at various entry points in cluding obunga next to kenya breweries depot busia road at the railway crossi ng to contain the people from bandani and otongolo and at the railway station other lockups were placed at swan 182centre which was targeted and burnt by rioting mobs on d ecember 29th kamasi makasembo road meru the main bus stop kashok junction tuskys supermarket kibuye and at kondele city clock according to the ocpd ten vehicles supported the lockups and patr olled the roads within the estates to monitor the situation in the meantime the roads heading to kakamega busia and nairobi were heavily barricaded by rioters who used bi g rocks posts and burning tyres which made it difficult for anybody to pass through unless under police escort mr kiragu stated that the orders on the use of lethal force r emained applicable on 30 december mr kiragu informed th commission that over 1000 rioters armed with pangas and rungus forced their way into the ke basin authority offices within migosi area near kondele where they stole unkn own quantities of rice beans and maize police were forced to use live ammu nition so that these stores could be protected from being burn ed and 3 rioters were shot dead later more than 3000 rioters attempted to storm m ega city supermarket where they burnt kenol petrol station located along nairob i road while also attempting to storm the offices of the water company but were dispersed by officers under the ocpds command using live ammunition and though none died at the scene several were believed to have been wounded by the bullets mr kiragu further stated that some vict ims of the above shootings were shot accidentally by stray bullets and killed while in the safet of their houses kisumu central police station recorded 38 cases of shooting kondele police station 20 while 6 cases were from outsid kisumu municipality several of the victims had multiple gunshot wounds th appropriateness or otherwise of the police tactics are dealt with at length in volume 2 of thi s report according to mr kiragu kisumu experien ced the worst violence on 31 december 2007 which was of extremely high magnitude and 25 rioter s were consequently shot dead by police the witness described the mobs as being very aggressive charging towards police officers and ston ing police vehicles and police officers 183this he said prompted the police to use live ammunitio n to disperse the rioters and to make sure that the roads were passable this included ensuring that the fuel meant for ugandah ad to pass through the busia road which was heavily barricaded with burning tyres posts and even sometimes shells of motor vehicles t he government of kenya was also under pressure to ensure that fuel meant for uganda reaches the destination safelyit was very difficult for us part of the kenya uganda railway within the town was also up rooted mr kiragu stated that at the time and while th police had anticipa ted scenario of celebration which could have turned violent the crowds whi ch engaged the police in running battles from street to street were so h uge such that the police were overwhelmed it was the ocpds stimony that the situation did not ease and riots continued on da ily basis from 31 december with mobs retreating each evening and reconverging on th following day which became daily routine only ebbing on 21 january 2008 when an ecumenic prayer meeting was held in kisumu city stadium where religious and political leaders appealed for peace with the mediation talks proceeding in nairobi calm was slowly returning to kisumu and the situation only subsided after the national accord was signed in total police acknowledged having shot dead 48 people in kisumu though father k ochiel took the view that the number of alleged police shootings were underreported we agree with that assessment since the commission received reports and post mortems confirming that at least 69 p p l w r s h t d d i n k i s u m u i n t h i s p r i d m r k i r g u i n f r m d t h commission that police had arrested and charged total f 98 suspects homa bay mr jimmy munene senior superintendent f p l i c i n c h r g f h m b divisional police headquarters stated th at prior to elections he had received total of 50 new officers from total of 78 he stat ed that violence in homa bay commenced on 29th december 2007 at 600 pm and took the police by surprise the confrontation between the rioters and the police which marked the 184o ns et f c n fl i c t t t w as t r c k t h i s p r t f lu n an z l s t ed m r t h n month on this day the protesters we re dispersed using tear gas though the ocpd admitted receiving information th at one person samuel otieno okungu was shot dead by police at shauri moyo estate141 the ocpd stated that on 30th december 2007 he deployed all his available officers to all vital places the bank ho spitals cereal board water sections petrol stations and two supermarkets within the tow n that notwithstanding violence erupted in all corners of the town with crowd of more than 5000 people barricading roads looting and vandalizing business premises owned by kikuyu kisii and kamba after announcement of the presidential election result rioters stormed the divisional offi ces and burned the main office block 3 gk vehicles and motor cycle another mo b stormed the fisheries offices where they burned three vehicles and the main office and one perso n was reportedly killed all available 300 regular police officers also drawn from the rural areas and prison warders from homa bay prison were deployed withi n the town centre where violence was concentrated with view to securing the main town from total destruction the commi ssion was told that violence continued in the town virtually each and every day until the national accord wa s signed in late february 2008 the witness further stated that he had instructed all th officers not to use live ammunition and at first only tear gas was used but once the situation deteriorated police were forced to use live ammunition to scare the mobs though the instructions remained that the officers were not to sh oot at people but in the 141 on the same day the ocpd acknowledged having received similar reports that one kennedy otieno odoyo had also been shot at the pelvic area and had died at shauri yako estate while wycliffe ochieng olela was found lying dead along the rangwe oyugis road with gun shot wounds in the abdomen 185air in spite of these instructions 3 deaths were reported as result of gunshot wounds and mr munene agreed that his orders were disobeyed migori rongo on his part mr edward mwamburi the senior superin tendent of police in charge of migori rongo police division s stated that he was involved in pre election security arrangements from augu st 2007 he said he was required to provide 2 police officers each to total of some 1238 polling stations within his division for the polling day on 27th d c m b r 2 0 0 7 s i n c h n l h d t h i s disposal 174 police officers he reques ted for additional reinforcements and received some 400 national youth serv ice men and women from nairobi 204 administration policemen from migori an d rongo districts 122 prison warders from migori gk prison and 8 forest guar ds from the district forest office who were all appointed special police officers in accordance with the powers conferred on the commissioner of police which gave him total of 1274 police officers it was his testimony that he had prepar ed an operation order with regard to some precautionary measures in anticipa tion of what could happen after the elections mainly involving guarding of vital installations such as hospitals banks and commercial undertakings with in migori district after peaceful polling and receipt of results he stated that the 29th of december 2007 brought rude shock with huge crowd of pe ople descending first on the migori isebaniakisii highway and then on gori township chanting odm slogans the commission heard that this crowd sw elled within short time and started looting within the shopping center the po lice tried to use teargas but the crowds would not relent and that around the same time simila r events were taking place in awendo and rongo districts since tear gas was not effective mr mwamburi stated that he issued an order for the officers to use firearms142 142 the operation order directed that first officers were to use teargas and if that was not effective then they were to switch on to the rubber balls and later on if there was real danger to loss of property and life then would proceed to use firearms 186 while the ocpd had anticipated dealing with lawful demonstrations he was shocked once the initially peaceful demonstrators numbering about 4000 attempted to move to the migori prison some in the crowd were carrying sticks pangas and stones and mr mwamburi cided he would not let them reach the gk prison in migori upon which he inte rvened as the violence progressed he stated that he found it absolutely necessary to use live am munition to fire in the air if only to scare the demonstrators whose magnitud threatened to overwhelm the 300 officers at his disposal in his view the situation was so unusual that baton charge was inapplicable since th crowd was almost overwhelming the police and some fatalities eventually resulted when live fire was used the commission heard that this first demonstration triggere d off series of demonstrations from 29 december onwa rds including the barricading of the migoriawendorongo kisii highway which is major gateway to the tanzanian border town of isebania according to the ocpd my lords they kept on going every day and barricading t he road everyday and whenever we made some moves to remove the sto nes the place that we had cleared when we go to the ot her direction on coming back those stones were back in place if not more tha n the initial ones that were placed on the roads mr mwamburi informed the commission that 11 people were killed143 in the process of quelling these riots total of 612 idps majority of them business people in the area camping in police statio ns were threatened with attack by the locals and decision to move them to nakuru was taken after mobs attempted to invade kamagambo police station with this intention th commission heard that police officer was killed at sori in karongo divi sion by mobs who perceived 143 according to mr mwamburi some of the bodies were collected from the hospital and buried by relatives secretly without notice 187him to be from particular tribe total of 62 peo ple mainly youth were arrested but most were released except for 18 who were arraigned in court on 3 january 2008 at st camillas patr ol base demonstrators attacked police officers and snatched g3 rifle from one of the office rs who was injured the firearm was recovered 5 days afterwards without the ammunit ion further four police officers were injured during the pe riod of the violence mr mwamburi told us that he was transferred to another station on 4th february 2008 impact of the violence we heard from the nyanza pc that by 11th february 2008 102 people were reported dead and 685 people injured in the province while 40000 nonluos had exited the province 9 government offices 73 business pr emises and 415 residential houses were looted or burnt across the prov ince 50 government vehicles were destroyed 16 public serv ice vehicles damaged mainly on the roads or where they had been parked and another 16 vehicles wer damaged144 2886 people sought refuge as idps within the town the commissio n heard that the province received 126821 returnees from outside nyanza because they had been ejected from other provinces or they feared continuing to stay in those places most of who were taken in by friends and relatives or hir ed places to stay within the province the pc did not dispute the fact that large percentage f the people who lost their lives did so through gun shots and or bullet woun ds which was confirmed by the provincial medical officer of health dr jackson ki oko who gave evidence that 90 of the deaths in new nyanza general hospital were from gun shots we further heard that thre security personnel were killed in the course of suppressing the violence 144 the majority of these vehicles were destroyed in kisumu rachuonyo migori and homa bay districts 188 dr jackson kioko stated that though th province had put in place systems in the health facilities for disaster preparedness they d not anticipated violence of the magnitude that occurred in the po stelection period he also provided breakdown of casualties from the various districts145 according to him the total number of deaths recorded at the new nyanza provincial gen eral hospital was 64 while another 53 bodies were brought in from outside the hospital he further stated that 129 people bearing gunshot wo unds were brought in however in the masaba borabu area he stated that most of the casualties received bore lodged arrow heads and were referred to kisii doctor kioko t herefore acknowledged that medical facilities in nyanza were overstretched nd overwhelmed during this period and the number of cases that needed attention was such that there was not sufficient human resources to atte nd to the cases forcing surgeons to spend hours on end in theatres because in some situations we had only one theatre and one operation was taking close to twelve hours he further presented statistics contai ning data from 33 public health institutions in the province but did not in clude data from over 200 private health facilities in the province clarifying th at his records may not have been very reliable during the period of post electi on violence as record keeping in public health institutions was not conclusive and as such statistics given to the commission may not represent the complete picture we can never theless summarize his presentation as follows district hospital casualties received gunshot injuries of deaths gucha 7 2 homa bay 27 35 6 rongo 21 3 nyamira 29 nyando 55 30 3 145 the doctor stated that kisii general hospital treated patients brought in from neighbouring districts while migori district hospital recorded total of 19 deaths and 28 gun shot victims 189district hospital casualties received gunshot injuries of deaths kisumu 47 siaya 6 10 rachuonyo 18 3 kisii 58 12 6 bondo 12 9 masababorabu 63 6 suba 6 6 1 provincial gen hospitalkisumu 256 71 64 migori 47 28 1 the commission was told by dr margaret oduor patholo gist based at the kisumu provincial and general hospital that 56 bodies and 8 body parts were taken to the nyanza provincial general hospital out of which 50 bodies had indications on the cause of death as gu nshot wounds 53 out of the 56 bodies were male 3 were female while 3 were of children aged ss than 14 years out of the 56 bodies 50 were luo according to dr oduor 53 6 of the gunshot casualties had been shot from the back po inting to the inference that police shot people who were already in flight and not with an aim to immobilize but for purposes of killing and maiming after examining the bodies she was able to recover 5 bullets mr isaac okero representative of the west kenya law so ciety stated that his organisation was galvanized into action sometime in mid january 2008 following the killing of one george william onyango whose shooting w as broadcast on the ktn news following that event and the police reacti on through police spokesman eric kiraithe suggesting that this incident was concoction they contacted the deceased family members and facilitated media access to highlight that this incident was not movie as alleged by police the society furnished evidence comprising of depositions fro m affected members and informed us that there was mark ed reluctance from victims to come forward and tell their stories they attributed this to very strong suspicion against law enforcement agencies and the justice system the society further 190noted apathy from many victims who did not feel confident that recording statements would result in any justice further victims specially of sexual violence were too fearful to seek the help of the police because not only were the police otherwise engaged but also due to feeling of discomf ort filing complaints with the institutions that they felt were associated wit h the perpetrators of the violence among the depositions presented by th society were some highlighting the crimes perpetrated by gangs of youths who were taking advantage of the lawlessness that prevailed other depositi ons related to attacks characterized by ethnic identification of the victims in various locales in cent ral and rift valley provinces mr okero indicted government institutions charged with maintaining internal security for the failure to contai n the postelection violence in kisumu well more i think could have been done to arrest the escalation of violence at that time there seemed to have been other priorities th at they seemed keen to be engaged rather than to stop the viol ence and to protect those who are exposed to violence notwithstanding the police version of events that they were confronted by violent mobs prompting them to use live fire gregory onyuro ngoch testified that he was shot outside his home and that when he went to re port the issue the police officer on duty declined to record th incident at first on account of the complaint being gunshot wound senior police office r however intervened and authorized the officer on duty at the report desk to take and record that information similarly alice atieno fo rmer security guard was shot in the head after arriving home from her place of work she had as result lost hearing and sight on the left side and was unable to eat save for l iquids146 146 in spite of pledge by government that all post election violence related cases would receive free medical attention this witness stated that she had been unable to access treatment at kenyatta national hospital due to the cost involved and which she was not able to afford 191it would appear to us that the indiscriminate use of l ive ammunition by police by design or default targeted vital organs for instance john opiyo ondiek security officer with the kisumu municipal council at kib uye market informed the commission that he was shot by poli ce from behind at his place of work sustaining injuries on his private parts i t w u l d l s p p r t h t l i t t l r n effort was made at all to use non lethal means in riot co ntrol live ammunition was used indiscriminately to disperse peaceful crowds and or demonstrators armed only with crude weapons as described by father kochiel the situation was terrible whichever place i passed th rough there were bodies and you could see the police everywhere and lot of people and chasing of people by police shooting there was looting going on147 ms grace kaindi the former nyanza ppo stated that the security forces were overwhelmed and that is why they sought reinforcements t hough many government witnesses did not mention the use of live ammun ition and where they did they pointed out that gunfire was used with the intention of scaring rowdy mobs bent on looting the catastroph ic humanitarian effects of this type of crowd dispersal tactics speaks volumes for itself and is pointer to the dysfunction within the police response by police and provincial administration the nyanza pc informed us that once the violence erupted the psic issued instructions to district commanders to stop the violenc but the guidelines on how this was to be achieved was left to the individual co mmanders to manage the security situation to sum up the view of the police and provincial administration they were under duty to maintain law and order and to protect life and property and as such the riotin g mobs had to be kept at bay and the vandalism they orchestrated from the 29th december 2007 had to be contained using all legal means available 147 exhibit 101 192when the kisumu ocpd was asked whet her he had issued warnings before using live ammunition he answered that the situation was so chaotic and the circumstances could not allow such pr ocedure and further the situation was neither conducive to issuing any warnings neither would anybo dy in his view have abided by such proclamations in such circumstances he considered that the law allowed police to obviate the need for issuing p roclamation and proceed to use lethal force without even attempting baton charge which he deemed to be impossible people in thousands trooped in the town in the morning engaged in looting breaking peoples premiseswe were trying to chase them using tear gas until when they became chaotic and starte d burning buildings that is the time we decided that we shou ld use any lethal fire allegations were made before the co mmission that the police had been responsible for burning some of the buildings recorded to have been burnt through the indiscriminate use of live ammunition and tea r gas that could have come into contact with inflammable material in some f these buildings but this was denied by the ocpd kisumu who was categorical that neither the use of tear gas nor live ammunition could have been possible cause of fire in the event that they landed on inflammable matter he did h owever concede that there were inflammable substances in ukwala supermarket which were exploding when the building was burning the commission noted that most police offi cers had to work 1012hour shifts in particularly very difficult circumstances which tested their quality training discipline experience and ability in what were clearly very di fficult operations though mr kiragu agreed that where there was thr eat to lifeeither of citizens or police officers by rioting mobsor threat to pr operty then there was justification for using firearms it is difficult to expl ain why over half of the gunshot casualties had wounds from the back which suggests to us that they were in flight and could not in such ci rcumstances be construed as presenting any tangible threat 193chapter five violence in nairobi central and coast provinces nairobi introduction the city of nairobi has through the years provided the barometer for kenyas volatile politics from colonial times to th present it began as temporary camp at the turn of the twentieth century upon chance decisio n by george whitehouse the engineer in charge of construction of the uganda railway who chose this location as the springboard for embarking on the challenging phase of laying the railway tracks across the rift valley this temporary campthe most unlikely of locations by default became kenyas capital city and commercial hub for the east and horn of africa region the city which currently covers 684 squa re kilometres is divided into four districts nairobi north nairobi west nairobi south nd nairobi east with the main administrative divisions being ce ntral dagoretti embakasi kasarani kibera makadara pumwani and westlands nearly 2 mill ion of nairobis residents estimates put nairobis population at somewher between 46 million148 live in low income residential neighbourhoods and inform settlements like kibera mathare dand ora huruma korogocho kariobangi kangemi and mukuru where crime and da ily violence incl uding extortion murder illegal taxation and rape has become something that ordinary citizens living here have had to live with 148 the total number of registered voters in nairobis 8 constituencies during the 2007 elections was 1275021 source is electoral commission of kenya voter registration figures 194the above areas which feature extremely high population d ensities and yet occupy less than one fifth of nairobis geographic area are of great significance to the citys politics and as we shall see the ethnic differentiation in various quarters would become defining feature of the character of violence in the post election period due to the neglect of most of these areas by the central government and the nairobi city council organized criminal gangs have come in to fill the void left by the absence of the state and attendant services election contests are to large extent influenced by these outfits whose members are available for hire by powerful political actors as instruments of intimidation against opponents it is not surprising therefore that the nsis in its security briefing of 24th december 2007 noted that all of nairobis 8 constituenci were potential flashpoints due to the fact that the stakes in the 2007 general elections were extremely high and some politicians had sequently enlisted the support of multiple gangs like mungiki to intimidate opponents149 mungiki largely kikuyu gang active in almost all of nairo bis informal settlements siafu bukhungu and jeshi darajani act ive in various neighbourhoods of kibera and the taleba n luo gang based in mathare had before the elections gradually taken over and were admin istering parts of the citys informal settlements where they created extreme fe ar they argue that they maintain security where the state has failed and in thi s way levy fees thus dominating the population through the intentional u of terror as means and strategy to instill fear in the society control matatu public transport routes changaa an illicit alcoholic beverage brewing sanita tion facilities water and electricity supply extract protection money from business and other extortionist activities150 149 for example in briefing dated 5th february 2008 nsis had observed that some parliamentary losers in nairobi had allegedly funded mungiki to eliminate parliamentarians 150 who are the mungiki presentation to the commission exhibit 27a 195as noted in evidence produced by the knchr the above dy namics tribal loyalties and the ethnic mix of politics in the citys poor neighbourhoods strongly contributed to the pattern of vi olence that nairobi witnessed the rent disputes between mostly kiku yu landlords and largely nonkikuyu tenants are among the most serious underl ying causes of ethnic conflicts in the poor neighbourhoods of nairobi the immediate preelection environment the situation report dated 19th october 2007 showed that kikuyu landlords in mathare and kayole had issued eviction tices to luo tenants under the pretext of renovating their houses according to nsis the landlords feared that the tenants could become uncooperative if the odm presidential aspirant raila odinga won since he had reportedly pr omised that an odm government would regulate house rents nsis correctly pointed out that thi s issue was likely to foment ethnic tension in the area and undermine security in the postelection period this alone should have forewa rned police to make arrangements to prevent commission of crimes and maintain law and orde r in mathare which as we shall see later was never done similar suspicion and acrimony among ki kuyu landlords on the one hand and luo and luhya tenants on the other was also reported in kibera kawangware dandora and pipeline estate in embakasi where tenants were likewise issued with quit notices out of fear from the landlords that the tenants would gang up and refuse to pay rent151 further talks of possible plans to rig the outcome of the election in langata constituency against raila odinga the area mp had created anxiety and nsis advised that th slightest suspicion towards that end would trigger unparalleled violence 151 nsis security briefing for the week ending 3rd december 2007 196the post election violence in nairobi witnesses who spoke to commission inve stigators narrated how the violence started in kibera mathare dandora kariobangi and kawangware upon announcement of the presidential result s and the subsequent swearing in of president kibaki on 30th december 2007 from information gathered violence in nairobi occurred in 3 major phases the first immediat ely after the announcement of the presidential election results on 30th december which continued into the new year as police prevented odm suppor ters from holding million people march to uhuru park wi thin nairobis central business district to protest what odm and its supporters believed was stolen election victory the second wave of violence followed the announcement of p artial cabinet by president kibaki and appointment of the odmkenya presid ential candidate hon kalonzo musyoka as vice president on 9 january 2008 and the third phase occurred upon the killing of the late embakasi mphon melitus mugabe were on 29th january 2008 in nairobis woodley estate the commission received evidence from many witnesses who suffered terribly during the violence both in terms of their own ordeals and in dealing with the devastating consequences especially the deaths of family members trauma and stress for families displacement from their homes the loss of income businesses and property as well as coming to terms with l iving within idp camps sexual and other forms of genderbased violence sgb v encompassing wide range of human rights violations in the chaos of t he post election period reached epidemic proportions in nair obi and this area proved the most problematic in terms of determining the extent of violations these issues are discussed at length elsewhere in this report it is enough for now to note here that the sexual violence experienced demands immediate responses through the provision of more effective physical protection especially in the poorer environs of nairobi where women and children were and continue to be most at risk 197a common thread in many of the accounts of the post election violence that we heard is the wanton destruction of property and the sev ere effect arson has had on peoples lives for instance witness narrated to the commission investigators how she was forced to move from her house in mathare 4a by gang of luo men who were evicting kikuyu on the night of 30th december 2007 and she was forced to take refuge at the matharehurumas chiefs camp when she went to check on her property the next day she foun d that all her belongings had been stolen and another person had alread occupied her house which she had obtained through the amani housing trust ma thare 4a development program another witness informed the commission investigators that on 29th december 2007 gangs of luo youth went around the mathare 4a area yelling that kikuyu must leave and fearing for her own and her familys safety they fled the next morning leav ing all possessions behind during which many houses were set ablaze she sought refuge at the eas tleigh air force base and when she went back to her house on 3rd january 2008 she found that it had been razed to the ground yong man from mathare 4a told our inve stigators how two of his relatives were killed on 30th december 2007 in dandora by gangs of kikuyu mungiki youth who were moving from door to door fl ushing out and killing nonkikuyu he stated that in huruma where he moved to rival zones were created where one zone dubbed othaya had propnu kikuyu s while two other zones housed pro odm luo and luhyas with each area being go zone for the opposing tribes information made available to the commission indicates th at initial violence in nairobi appeared to target the kikuyu in areas where they were minority and they in turn organized attacks in area s where they were majority we noted one insidious form of violence that was visited on members of the luo community the forced circumcision repo rtedly attributed to members of the mungiki sect dr jotham micheni confirmed that kenyatta national hospital attended to 2 such cases of forced or traumatic circumcision evidence was received from luo lady who was raped in huruma by ga ng of 10 men on 29 december 2007 who told her they were looking for odm peo ple who were giving 198the government trouble and that they wanted to circumcis them after being violated she was forced to watch as the hooded men cut off her husbands penis with panga see chapter 6 on gender and sexual violence according to evidence from knchr on 1 january 200 8 15 year old luo boy was forcibly circumcised during fighting at kiamai ko on 21 january 2008 eight luo men had their genitals chopped off and even young boys some as young as 11 and 5 years had their genitalia cut with blunt objects such as broken glass152 as we have seen at the beginning of this chapter nairobis in formal settlement areas are balkanized largely along trib lines and specific ethnic groups are dominant in specific areas within the slums we received information from knchr that in kibera for instance the luo are the maj ority in kianda raila village gatwikira and kisumu ndogo areas makina is mai nly populated by nubians while laini saba and soweto are dominated by kikuyus luhyas dominate in mashimoni and lindi areas we were able to establish some of these facts during our site visit to kibera on 11th july 2008 once the violence broke out looting destruction of prope rty and arson became rampant forcing people to move to the ethnic encla ves they perceived as safe as tribally aligned gangs took over and exercised total cont rol toi market in makina area which prior to elections had housed over 3000 tra ders was burnt down during our site visit to kibera we were informed by loca l residents and community organizers that this market provided employment to perhaps similar number of people while thousands of suppliers depen ded on it for livelihood not to mention the tens of thousand of custom ers it served the violence was also characterized by fo rceful displacement and evictions while areas such as dandora and mathare north saw deep seated rent disputes escalating to violence as earlier explained there was perception that landlords mainly kikuyu overcharged in rent an d discriminated tenancy on ethnic lines which brought an expectation among odm supporters of rent reduction if odm 152 exhibit 125 paragraph 128 199won some tenants therefore took the opportunity provi ded by the catechism of post election chaos to evict landlords an d started charging reduced rents while new round of violence ensued when the owners hired gangs to reclaim their property153 information was provided by the nsis security briefing dated 21st february 2008 that tension was high between the kikuyu and the luo resi ding in mathare following police operation to evict people who had il legally occupied other peoples houses the briefing went on to state that lu youth were preparing to resist future attempts to evict them and threatened to bl ow up such buildings in this state of affairs the nsis noted that the mungiki h ad taken advantage to settle their differences with the taliban largely compo sed of luo and thus violent confrontations were predicted to continue with devastating effects nsis further noted that mungiki adherents were assembling at lucky summ er quarry gituamba gitare marigo and dandora dumpsite in prepar ation to attack residents of babadogo glue collar kariadudu mugure an d kasabuni areas154 other areas that nsis received intelligence as being targets f or mungiki attacks were mathare north kariadudu and ngomongo where the ob jective was to evict those who had forcefully occupied houses and refused to p ay rent incidentally an nsis briefing after the violence broke out points out that jailed mungiki sect leader maina njenga warned mungiki members against being misu sed by politicians in response to their being hi red in mathare kariobangi kibera and huruma to cause terror155 n t i n g t h t n s i s h d f r w r n d n t h potential conflict that was set to be sparked by the rent disputes prior to elect ions we fail to see why the police did not take measures to prevent this from happening the cha in these informal settlements could have been avoided if the police had taken contingency m s u r s s d v i s d b n s i s n d t h i s t t i t u d f i n d i f f r n c t t h p l i g h t f 153 exhibit 125 154 nsis security briefing for 22nd february 2008 155 nsis security briefing dated 25th january 2008 200those the police were meant to protect depicts fo rce that was perhaps incognisant that their motto is utumishi kwa wote ser vice to all instead the police chose to deploy massively not where they were mos t needed but concentrated at uhuru park to prevent the odm rallies in this respect we agree with the conclusion by the kenya huma n rights commission khrc executive director ms muthoni wanyeki who told us that its our summation that prioritization should have been more in line to the responsibility to protect issues related to policing priorities and st rategy during the post election violence are discussed in more details elsewhere in this report i t will be enough to observe here that it would appear that based on available intelligence which was already in possession of the commissioner of police the obvious choice ought to have been quick containment of the violence in the slums for protection of life and limb and freeing more police officers for deploymen t to the rift valley where carnage of extreme cruelty was unfoldin g with the police numbers unable to contain the situation in mid january 2008 nsis reported th at nonkikuyu residents of mathare slums were alarmed by the migration of the kikuyu community from the area which made them apprehensive that this movement out of mathare could be precursor of attack by mungiki members156 in the meantime as the kenya national dialogue and reconciliation pr ocess went on tension remained high and nsis noted that odm councillors were mobilizing for m ass action in case the kofi annan led talks collapsed157 dr jotham micheni the director of kenyatta national hosp ital told the commission that they had not anticipated the kind of violence that gripped nairobi and the country though they were prepared for some element of violence the scale and form it took wa s unexpected which was compounded by the fact that good number of staff d travelled upcountry to vote and those who had travelled to the western part of the country we re unable to come back 156 nsis briefing dated 15th january 2008 157 nsis security briefing for 26th february 2008 201for whole month due to blockage of roads moreover som staff members became idps and in general the hospital staff was not immun from what was happening to other members of public while it was the police commissioners testimony that 28 people died in nairobi from election related violence the statis tics the commission was able to compile tell different story it is incomprehensible that the c ommissioner of police should state with finality that the police were the on ly source of facts in terms of accurate figures when he produced statistics that pu rported to be the definitive figures of deaths the figures were dicted by other figures obtained from government sources for example dr da niel mulwa nguku head of the nairobi city mortuary158 provided information showing that between 30 december 2007 and 30 january 2008 total of 111 bodies were booked i n by police who categorised them as post election violence bodies as w discuss elsewhere in this report we find it problematic that it is the pol ice themselves who determined that some deaths were due to the election violen ce without formal announcement to this effect other than th advice from the officer who booked in body incidentally body br ought in by the police after 30th january was designated as having died from post ection violence and reason was given response by police with odm calling for countrywide mass action to protest wha t they deemed as theft of their election victory police were deployed to cordon off uhuru park to prevent the odm and its leader raila odinga from holdin g its meeting there this effort to prevent odms meeting t ook severe toll on the police and had devastating consequences on law enforcement and maintenan ce of law and order elsewhere in the city the nsis reported that police of ficers deployed on security 158 the facility has capacity to store 250 bodies though most time it holds more than three times this number in the words of dr nguku ours is facility whichcannot afford to say it is full 202duties at uhuru park complained of being overworked delay in payment of allowances and being unable to bathe or change uniforms and thus nsis recommended that police welfare be addres sed in appreciation of their role in maintaining law and order we received evidence that police action in various locales appeared uneven and disjointed as early as 13th december 2007 nsis had warned that police officer s planned go slow on voting day to protest the govern ments failure to award them salary and allowances increments this security briefing fu rther noted that police planned to report to assigned polling stations and do nothing more and thus the nsis warned that such action was likely to comp romise security during the election period it is not understandable why this information was not acted upon and it is not surprising therefore that number of victims perceived the police as either indifferent or missing in action when they were most needed for instance businessman in huruma told our investigators th at there was police presence in the estatesthe kikuyu tribe most of whom owned businesses started organizing themselves to defend their businesses there were kikuyu zones and luo zones and one was allowed to venture into others territorythe kikuy u eventually vacated their premises and left the houses to the luo who started renting out the houses for as little as kshs 500 som of them are still occupying the houses to date most of those who p erpetrated the violence were gangs who took advantage of the situation on the other hand where the police were present we rec eived evidence that citizens going about their business suffered just as much at the hands of police pastor in kibera darajanimakina stated how on 17th january 2007 within kibera he had witnessed police officer kicking some good s left behind by some women one of whom was arguing with the officer asking him to stop destroying her wares he explained as the argument ensued i saw the policeman beating th woman with the butt of his gun the woman fell down and the p oliceman stepped on her neck and started firing his gun upwards since i knew her i rushed out towards them when he tried to intervene the police officer asked wh ether i was the messiah who came to save and the pastor was warned that he would be shot the pastor 203tried to help the fallen woman but all of sudden f ell down and woke up to find himself in hospital where he was told he has been shot and had been in coma for 2 days this story was corroborated by the victim who narrated how this particular police officer hit her with the butt of his gun when she went to ask him not to destroy her goods it was very hard blow it made fall downi was v ery frightened and shocked when i was on the ground this p oliceman stepped on my neck he was wearing boots he had his weig ht down on mei saw the pastor coming towards i know this maneven though i was yelling and begging the policeman not to kill he didnt stop with the boot hard on my necki could hear hi m pastor calling out as he cameasking the policeman why he was d estroying my things i lost consciousness then next i remember woman was trying to pick off the groundi looked and saw the pa stor lying on the groundthe woman told the pastor had been shot likewise resident of kibera stated that she was in h er house in kibera laini saba on monday 31st of december 2007 when she felt something hit her on th left breast and she fell down bleeding it was only then that she realized she had been shot she stated that good samaritans were unable to take her to hospital immediately since there were gunshots everywhere but she wa s eventually taken to mbagathi hospital and referred to kenyatta national hospital where she remained for week after having been operated on to re move the bullet lodged in her breast upon discharge from hospital she found her house had been looted the director of kenyatta national hospital told the commission that 61 people were treated for gun shot wounds at the facility addin g what i can say is that lot of gunshot wounds came f rom kibera mathare kariobangi and dandora those are the areas th at had great number of patients but as i said 61 patients ou t of 462 contributed to percentage that was 13 we therefore find that during the post election violence the brunt of the suffering in nairobi was borne by poor people living in w income neighbourhoods it is the obligation of the state to ensure t hat all its citizens irrespective of social status have righ t to live in wholesome environment free 204from the fear of crime and it is the duty of the gove rnment to ensure that this right is not infringed by state neglect or acts of extreme cr uelty perpetrated by its agents on segment of society the citizens of some of nairobis poorest neighbourhoods found themselves in quandary since those who w ere entrusted to protect them were either not present did not seem to car and in the cases where they were present they were just as brutal as the mara uding gangs causing the violence this is particularly worrying since the police commissioner when asked if with wisdom of hindsigh t there was anything he would have handled differently he retorted without he sitation or any iota of embarrassment or regret that if similar situations occurred today i would do exactly wh at i did i would not change thing my lords that is the honest t ruth because in the enforcement of law and ensuring that law and order is brought about in the protection of lives and pr operties there is nothing that we shouldnt do to ensure that our p eople are safe that is the incidences as to why there is police in the first place and in doing so my lord we take pride in ensurin g that we have protected lives and taken all measures necessary to ensure that people are safe if anything was to happen like it did last time we would do it exactly the same way luo man who ran an electronic business in kijiji cha ch ewa predominantly kikuyu settlement told us that on 29th december 2007 the ocs muthaiga had posted 2 lorry loads of police to guard the area but the youth were so many they overpowered the police who ran away from the scene after the election was announced odm youth overpowered pnu youth and the policethey came with par affin and set fire to the whole estatethe estate was burnt by i dle youth in the estatei was targeted by the youth because i was tryi ng to restrain them from doing bad things like looting and st ripping women nakedi lost business worth ksh 70000i reported everyt hing to the police at muthaiga police station after recognizing the youth but nothing was done the police said they were busy with post ection work and to date nothing has been done not only did the police appear overwhelmed but we were given evidence that police were divided along ethnic lines an d victims confessed to having received assistance from police officers from th eir ethnic groups while facing hostility from officers who were not from thei r tribe according to the knchr 205some officers from the kalenjin and luo communities when asked to stop the looting are reported to have told the victims w acha kazi iendelee let work go on drawing from the pnu slogan so police officers also took advantage of the situation to ch arge victims for safe passage this was fairly widespread in dandora phase 4 mathare and ghetto police officers demanded money from people who wanted to escape hostile environments or who had fled and were returning to retrieve property in hearings before the commission th police adopted an unduly defensive attitude which in our view clouded any objectivity expected f them in assisting the commission in its investigating public inquiry from the totality of the evidence tendered before us we find on balance of pro bability that the institution of the police failed the citizens of nairobi at large and the residents of the less privileged neighbourhoods in particular while there will be doubt protests that we had right to condemn the police without conducting trials during which the police could defend themselves in detail against all charges made it is our considered v iew that full due process protections of the type that are required in criminal t rials were not necessary for the purpose of stating whether or not the police as public institution performed to the expectation of kenyans in their hour of need in na irobi it is our view that they did not central province introduction central province is located in central kenya bordering rif t valley province to the north west nairobi province to the south and ea

general elections159 build up to the violence information submitted by the provin cial commissioner japheth rugut160 reveals that the period leading to the ections was peaceful but highly charged both at parliamentary and civic levels with the majority overtly in support of the pnu and its affiliate parties candidates from the other parties conducted their campaigns in nonconfrontationa l and peaceful environment there were incidents of violence reported to have taken place in period leading to the elections one such case is an incident took place on 24th november 2007 at around 600pm when

commissioner gave evidence to the effect that the news of the final tally of the presidential results which declared pnu candidate mwai kibaki the winner was received with jubilation and fanfare however soon thereafter this was replaced with gloom as informatio n started trickling in to the effect that violence had erupted in other parts of the country and mem bers of the kikuyu community had been targeted this news was given human face w hen the province started receiving idps from other parts of the c ountry and from within thirty people majority of whom were of luhya and luo descent had

and worry in the entire province this state of affairs had been caused by reports that things were moving from bad to worse 164 the pc recounted how around 18th january 2008 rumours started circulating that by monday 21st january 2008 members of other communities resident in central province would be attacked to avenge the atrocities meted out on kikuyus in nyanza ri ft valley and western provinces 165 these rumours were exacerbated by the harrowing tales 162 above 163 exhibit 125 164 presentation by mr japheth k rugut the provincial commissioner central province to the

under investigation at the time of the testimony and an inquest file has since been opened inquest 22008 210to budge the intervention of the mpelect did not bear fruits as the youths armed with crude weapons and numbering about 2000 po sitioned themselves on flyover on top of buildings and in the area out side the factory about 60 security officers established buffer zone between the comp anys premises and the youths at some point the surging youths set ablaze the security guar ds office and broke into the bata shoe factory shop oting the shoes inside scuffle ensued and seven police

the knchr repo rt produced to the commission as evidence there were threats and actual evictions of nonkikuyu people in nyeri in early february the report states that unsigned notices were circulated in nyeri town in estates occupied by nonkikuyu ch as majengo ordering nonkikuyu people to leave this led to the exodus of nonkikuyu people out of nyeri especially when more leaflets started circulating one of the leaflets read more clashes but war luo luhya nandi we give you 24 hrs you pack and go failure to that we need 200 heads before peace holds once more internally displaced persons the commission was informed that the in flow of the idps was received with mixed reactions with some resident s empathising with the incomers and providing food and shelter in areas ch as kikuyu township the incoming persons would be absorbed into the societ by the local residents this explains the absence of major camps in the kikuyu township area nd other areas of the province such as muranga north in other places t hey would be left to fend for themselves or settle in the camps for example in rur ingu nyeri yet still there were individuals who hosted them in one such case widely reported in the 212media woman hosted around 90 idps in her twobedroom ed house in othaya174 further there were instances when youths within central p rovince took advantage of the unrest to engage in unlawful activities there were instances when nonkikuyu employees working in various companies were targeted for attacks and eviction so as to create employment opportunit ies for themselves in those companies such companies includ ed universal corporation limited ucl and steel rolling mills both in kiku yu kari and kefri and other research institutions also situate in kikuyu tea estates and bata

were facilitated by the kenya red cross to their ancestral homes which they considered safer although many others were lef t to fend for themselves and received assistance or other support meanwhile the number of idps ejected from rift valley ny anza provinces increased with the figure of 18406 recorded on january 31st 2008 rising to 86314 by the 5th day of march 2998 the pc so tendered figures

around february 29 2008 174 exhibit 125 paras 492 and 501 175 above 213 response by police and provincial administration the heightened tensions at the time and episodic violenc before the elections reported pointed to the potential eruption of violence in isolated parts of the province the expectation therefore was that the police and provincial authorities would put in place adequate security measures to preemp t any breach of peace and order however it is our assessment that they were i ll prepared to satisfactorily handle the overwhelming influx of idps the security arrangements seemed to be trained on elections and mor the pc told the commission that in the light of the rising tensions in the p rovince and in view of the need to prevent the eruption of violence he mobilised all security agencies and local leaders in the district to be on high alert from the security intelligence reports the dsic had planned coverage of election campaigns as early as september and attended each and every political rally wit hin the district the pc testified that he also convened sev eral meetings in the districts with the members of the public with view to promoting peaceful coexistence and appealing against retaliation he held meetings on 25th january 2008 in nyandarua north ol kalou ngorika and limuru on 1st february 2008 he attended peace meeting in nyeri south and on 5th february he convened similar meeting in kiambu west there were peace meetings convened by the dsic on 1st february 2008 in limuru town and wangige town of kikuyu division and attended by several mps including fred gumo westlands uhuru kenyatta gat undu south lewis nguyai kikuyu peter mwathi limur u elias mbau maragwa johnstone muthama kangundo eugene wamalwa saboti and momo ima onyonka kitutu chache this may have pacified the situation in total the pc said 37 peace and reconciliation meetings were held across the province according to him these meetings down scaled the hostilities towards other communities as result significant nu mber of them were able to report to their places of work in the day and get back to the camp s in the evening 214 incitement witnesses informed the commission that there had been veral planning meetings that had been convened in the kikuyudominated parts of the central provincerift valley province border th meetings had been used to recruit fighters to coordinate communal violence and to organize funding there have been reports that pastor former mp and sitting one urged people to take up arms in selfdefense in the limuru area176the allegation is corroborated by the intelligence reports covering the period between 15th january to 15th february 2008 in mammoth rally attended by so kikuyu mps and politicians they blamed the killing of youths on police officers hailing fr om rift valley and nyanza and called for their transfer from the area the r eport states thus one politician called on the kikuyu community to be ready to defend themselves and urged the rich to contribute money toward s the cause another politician alleged that odm was being backed by western countries to destabilize the government177 there were claims of prior planning of the violence in s ome parts of central province the commission received reports alleging th at group of business persons met on 26th january 2008 at kikuyu country club to fundraise for th eviction of nonkikuyu residents weapon s to be used in raids were supplied by persons whose names were made availabl to the commission small businesses all in kikuyu supplied weapons such as machetes178 the reaction from the security agencies to the crisis d been ad hoc and lacking in direction from the reports it coul d be discerned that the dsic did not see any need to follow up on what appeared to be an overt ca ll to arms and instead subjectively dismissed them as outbursts of anger the report says thus the 176 exhibit 21j special brief civil society responses to the kenyan crisis kenya human rights institute p4 177 central province security intelligence committee report for the period between 15th january to 14th february 2008 p3 178 exhibit 125 215leaders were reacting out of anger following the killing of three youths who were protesting the displacement of their kinsmen from rift valley 179 the central province security and inte lligence committee appreciation for the period between 15th january to 14th february 2008 report s that there was hate mail circulated by unknown persons on the kenya power and li ghting company limited web mail in nyeri calling upon the kalenjins to rise and defend their ancestral land and to deliver them from the kikuyu dominance the resurgence of mungiki the resurgence of the mungiki could be seen as form f encouragement to retaliatory attacks or in the alternative response to the call to arms by the politicians to defend the kikuyu commun ity against aggression by nonkikuyus further despite noting the resurgence of the outlawed militia grouping mungiki there is little else in the appreciation by the central p rovince security and intelligence committee indicating decisi ve response to the threat to security posed by the proscribed sect180 the kikuyu community seems to be slowly accepting the mungik i sect following aspersions that the government was unable to protect them against hostile communities during the post election vi olence this could pose challenge to security agencies hence calls for concerted efforts to stem the same181 the resurgence is consistent with the claim as to the politi cization of militia as vehicle through which ethnic hatred and animosity could be d riven many of the acts of violence perpetrated by this militia outfit at the time may be explained as retributive violence that was specifically targeted at mem bers of ethnic 179 above p4 180 central province security and intelligence committee appreciation for the period between 15th january 2008 to 14th february 2008 181 central province and intelligence committee appreciation upsurge of mungiki activities noted min 222008 the report proceeds to identify specific areas of increased activity for example it says in nyandarua the mungiki spiritual leader has directed sect members to recruit ten thousand 10000 new members to defend kikuyu in the rift valley consequently thesect recruitment officer has recruited one hundred and thirty 130 youths from dundori and ol kalou 216communities perceived to be supportive of the odm party and against whom accusations had been made for targeting members of the kikuyu community in other parts of the country some of the encouragement to attacks so had coercive aspect to them report titled special brief on civil society response and submitted to the commission as exhibit 21j cites witness as saying that there sic have also been reports of intraethnic violen ce in the wangige area of kiambu district where kikuyu men have bee n attacked by gangs for failing to defend their own community from aggressors local human rights defenders are being screened and the security and safety of those of kikuyu origin are at risk182 there were reports that landlords also became targets of t he attackers they were forced to give notices to their nonkikuyu tenants to v acate183 hate speech there were reports of the circulation of malicious cellphone text messages that propagated hate speech and alarming rumo urs this had the effect of poisoning an already tense political environment the statements revolv ed around the denigration of individual po litical actors and their af filiate political parties examples are the hate leaflets on raila odinga found at ndaragua nyandarua north district the leaflets read raila is planning revolution christened december 28 orange revolution with the assistance of dick morris and prof george ayittey of ghana similar leaflets found at kahu ro in muranga accused raila of being terrorist devil worshipper communist expert in overthrowing governments tribalist and deceptive dishonest pra ctising witchcraft to win presidency184 182 exhibit 21j p4 183exhibit 125 184 dsic reports min 942008 217additionally there were also reports of demeaning references by the kikuyus to persons of other tribes as nduriri an imperious reference within the context of the speech to people of nonkikuyu descent and specific references to the odm presidential candidate and the luos as kihii loosely translated as an uncircumcised man in the kikuyu langua ge the knchr reports one prominent kikuyu politician and former mp as having said that the kikuyus cannot be led by kihii185 the commission also received information to the effect that religious leaders in areas such as limuru and nyeri used the pulpit to convey messages amounting to hate speech against nonkikuyu communities odm and genera lly whipping up kikuyu ethnonationalist passion the leaders utte red phrases such as ciaigana ciaigana enough is enough suggesting that the kikuyu community should longer simply stand by while attacks against them continued the report continues in kirathimo idp camp in limuru which hosted returnees from other provinces one religious leader urged the people that the kikuyu should be armed the way i am armed with the bible gospel artistes performed in limuru at rallies attended by t he local community where hate messages were disseminated186 knhcr reported as follows on hate speech local language media also disseminated hate speech to kik uyu audiences in central province and in the diaspora calli n shows on radio stations enabled individuals to make unregulated teful statements inooro fm put on air highly emotional and di straught victims of violence factor that tended to whip up t he emotions of its audience music in the kikuyu language played on ka meme and inooro radio stations also engendered or raised ethnic tensio ns one such song variously played by inooro fm lyricised about raila odinga and the luo community in very negative terms187 185 exhibit 125 502 186 exhibit 125 512 187 above 513 218findings the totality of evidence received by the commission sugg ests that the violence in central province was mainly targeted against persons perceived to be unsympathetic to the pnu presidential ca ndidate mwai kibaki and therefore responsible for the evictions of nonkiku yu from conflictstricken areas across the country the reemergence of mungiki and associated criminal gang s followed the killings and evictions kikuyus in odm party st rongholds in western kenya the turbulence in our view provided perfect opportunity for these proscribed militia to reinvent and package themse lves as instruments for the advancement of political and ethnica lly motivated violence the commission also notes the distinct nature of the postelection violence with respect to central province in the past ethnic clashes the major protagonists were the kikuyus and other the other tribes on the one sid and the kalenjin on the other this was reflection of the political alignm ents of the day when the kalenjin who enjoyed the patronage of the regime of the subsequent political events saw the kikuyu community isolated by t he other ethnic groups hence when post 2007 elections violence erupted in centr province the communities from other parts of the coun try bore the brunt of violence in the province coast province introduction coast province consists of 13 districts and 21 constituencies with population of slightly over 3 million people according to the kenya bureau of statistics projections of 2007 the main ethnic grou ps are the mijikenda comprised of nine culturally and linguistically inter related sub groups mong them the rabai chonyi giriama mjibana kauma kamb digo and duruma most of them profess the christian faith save for the digo who are mainly muslims the non 219mijikenda in the province are the tait taveta orma pokomo munyoyaya malokote bajuni swahili and people of arab descent th last 3 of whom mainly inhabit the coastal towns in total there are 15 coastal ethnic groups and members of caucasian communiti living in the province however over the years there has been significant migration of kenyan citizens from upcountry regions drawn to the coast in search of bet ter economic prospects the region has therefore become mosaic of vari ous identities this has had profound bearing on the socioeconomic and po litical relations within the province some ethnic groups have been classified as insid ers or indigenous communities while other communities are ro utinely referred to as outsiders these are the kamba kikuyu luo and other upcountry peop resident at the coast mombasa town is the capital of the pr ovince whose mainstay is tourism and related activities fishing and agriculture also offer livelihoods to substantial part of the residents over the years th indigenous communities residing in the coast have consistently complained of exclusion from the hinterland and exploitation of their resources without reward which issu explain some of the political dynamics the persistent claims and allegations of exploitation and exclusion are blamed on the so called non indigenous communities commonly referred to in the province as watoka bara or wabara since the reintroduction of multi party politics in 1991 the poli tics in the region has become polarized along tribal lines and politicians have exploited the existin g latent tribal animosity to intimidate certain communitie s giving rise to violence against other communities depending on the prevailing political climate for example the likoni and kwale violence of 1997 was premised on the stereotyping of upcountry people as having appropriated to themselves l ocal resources and having benefited unfairly at the expense of the indigenous residents and they were thus targeted in the violence who sole aim was to drive them from the region and achieve an intended poll result188 the polarities and tensions created 188 for further reading see the akiwumi report at 233 278 220by this episode remain evident betwee n the so called local insiders and upcountry outsiders as we shall see these parameters surfaced in 2007 only that thi s time round the indigenous communities joined hand s with some upcountry communities like the luo themselves targets of the 1997 violence t target the socalled gema communities composed of the kikuyu embu meru the kamba who have significant presence in the province were also target ed many gema community members thus suffered double blow since they had been victims of election violence in 1997 and had barely recovered from their losses when they were again targeted and attacked in the 2007 local communities have for years decried the perceived mar ginalization and under development of the region without tangible act ion being taken by successive governments since independence to deal with these d eep rooted feelings the issue of land at the coas t has specially been problematic and has been described as ticking time bomb mo re recently other factors like perceived mistreatment of residents at the hands of police in the name of fighting terrorism poor education levels and bad infrastructure have all served to fuel feelings that successive governments do not care about the r egion while the perceived manipulation of the presidential re sults was the trigger for the 2007 violence in the province it is clear that there is deep underlying resentment which has never been addressed by the state over the years the situation is further complicated by economic competition f or resources with migrant upcountry communities seen as benefiting at the expense of the indigenous people and this background explains the sa lient issues causes and manifestation of the violence in the region as will be exp ounded in detail hereinafter as noted by kingori mwangi coast ppo my lords our assessment of the coast province was that there was potential violence much higher than any other part of th country because of the underlying issues of poverty their politic feeling of being excluded and lot of unemployment all these going b the 221history of the coast we felt the issues here the threa ts were higher than other parts of the country189 preelection period the commission heard from various witnesses that coast province was generally peaceful in the run up to the elections and residents ea gerly waited to cast their votes many arrived at their respective po lling stations as early as 400am on the morning of 27 december 2007 the only hitch reported by voters was the discovery at the last minute that voter re gisters had been spli t alphabetically and this unannounced change created lot of confusion and delays surprisingly and also commendably this did not lead to any violence in garsen constituency of tana river district th commission was told of some low level violence on 27th december after voting which was confirmed by mr wilfr ed mbithi acp in that incident police helicopter had brought in ballot papers for tallying purposes sparking rumours that the incumbent mp h on danson mungatana of pnu had flown in foreign ba llot boxes with marked ballot papers there was clear evidence of high level of competition be tween the two leading presidential candidates mwai kibaki and raila odinga and therefore palpable divide between pnu and odm supporters in the coast witness testified that the preelection period had been characterized by polit ical environment that was greatly polarized since the constitutional referendum f november 2005 we heard that the referendum had created very high expecta tions and the majority of the coastal people saw real hope for positiv change in the odm party and its presidential candidate raila odinga who was widely expected to win the presidential poll the common belief in the regio n was that raila could only lose if the poll was rigged in the meantime the nsis was apprehensive and viewed t he coastal area as potential flashpoint where political party supremacy religion and race had 189 cw 141 222ignited violence in the past190 another fear cited by nsis was the land problem between squatters and landlords where ntiments were high that the coastal people had been marginalized by outsiders tana river dist rict featured consistently in intelligence reports wher there was an ongoing conflict between the orma and wardei communities within bura and galole divisions and also between the pokomo and somali over disp uted 3mile strip along the banks of river tana finally intelligence was furnished by nsis r egarding the activities of an outfit by the name revolutionary republican council rr c that was reportedly training its militia within mw agulu forest of kwale district with the help of exmilitary servicemen allegedly with the aim to disenfranchise upcountry people and later reclaim land owned by percei ved outsiders it was noted in intelligence reports that the rrc had identified training ground for digo duruma taita and taveta communities in kili basi area of kinango division kwale district indeed the coast ppo did conf irm the existence of the rrc which he stated claims that they would like to have the coast prov ince declared as republic independent from the rest of ke nyawe did consider them to be threat to our security operation and we had taken measures to make sure that they did not disrupt the election or wage viol ence against other people after the election my lords accordingly the authorities had neutralized the group by the time of elections nsis also noted that there were threats of eviction of upcountry people especially kikuyu luo and kamba residing within kipini settlement scheme in malindi district nsis reported that the majimbo debate had elicited strong antikikuyu sentiment in coast province and that some unnamed polit icians planned to use majimboism as an excuse to mobilize loca l youth to attack perceived outsiders consequently the kikuyu community insi and outside the province robustly opposed the proposed majimbo system191 as the pc put it 190 nsis evidence exhibit 20 191 exhibit 20 223in the way it was being put was that majimbo would ensure that local people would benefit from the resources accrued from local enterprises the revenue generated in coast province would be for the benefit of coastals i think this is how they were oking at majimbo that key positions revenue accrued from tourism from the ports would be will remain at the coast here and benefit the coastal people given the intelligence that was available we discern t hat there was reason to prompt the authorities to make sufficient security arrangements early enough to address these security concerns and perhaps this was done whi ch is why the coastal region remained peaceful during the campaign perio d this was also alluded to by the coast provincial commi ssioner ernest munyi when he stated that due to the high level of competition during the ca mpaign period he had found it proper and imperative to put in plac precautionary measures just to ensure that his office could be in better control of the situation in the province in the event of any violence the pc further stated that in making these arrangements he had relied on nsis security reports which information was supported by the coast ppo kingori mwangi and wilfred mbi thi the mombasa urban ocpd after the completion of voting the commission heard that people in the province keenly followed the vote counting peacefully from various p laces through television and radio broadcasts ex hibit 149 was tendered containing information showing that initial tallies indicated rai odinga in clear and widening lead over mwai kibaki before 30 december 2007 it was expected therefore that this trend would continue and odm suppo rters who were the majority in the region started early celebration for t he expected victory of their candidate the election results trigger the commission was then told that tension anxiety and f ear started gripping the region and particularly mombasa on the 28th and 29th december 2007 when tallying of the final results had not been completed and when raila odingas 224margin over mwai kibaki was suddenly drastically reduced from the various witnesses we were able to establish that the trigger for the chaos that rocked the region was the declaration of president mw ai kibaki as the winner coupled with the suspicious manner in which th electoral commission handled the situation indeed there were early signs of trouble when on the 29th december 2007 groups of young men gathered from 300 pm along kenyatta avenue abdul nassir road and digo road roundabout s chanting slogans and expressing disquiet this early trouble appeared in tended to share their feelings on the prevailing political situation as it then was in the meantime there was lot of tensio n in many other places at the coast as people waited peacefully for the final pres idential tally results for instance in kisauni tension was reported to be very high with the youths contemplating to hold public protest on 29th december 2007 against the delay by eck in releasing the presidential poll result we heard that ma ny youth gathered in various spots eagerly awaiting the announ cement of the presidential results and some in their conversations tried to envisage what raila od inga win would portend and how his government would be hussein khalid programmes coordinator for mombasa based ngo muslims for human rights muhuri testified that violence in th region was triggered by the announcement of the presidential results against background of long standing underlying issues which had not been addressed over the years and by the conviction of many people at the coast who happened to be odm supporters that they had been robbed of victory after eck announced kibaki as the winner extremely disappointed angry and frustr ated youth were primed for violence since the general feeling was that raila odinga had been robbed of victory and this bitterness was expressed in slogans such as haiwezekani it is not possible haki yetu our right raila peace tutamaliza wacky we shall finish the kikuyus maisha bora better life wakikuyu waizi kikuyus are thieves as avenues to express anger while also singin g in praise of their favourite candidate raila odinga and odm 225a religious leader however told the commission that the violence appeared to have been planned prior to elections he gave reasons for his belief that member of parliament from the coast pr ovince was responsible for organization of the violence that rocked the area this sentiment was further echoed by other witnesses for instance witness told us i witnessed the violence that was going on at that tim within bokole at shop we call safaricom building owned by kamba k nown as philip kiluko i found group of youths trying to brea k in they were all former security guards for politician during the campaign period i talked to them i enquired from then why they were d oing that and one of them told that each of them had been paid kshs 300 to cause the mayhem to express disgust at the election results and that even if odm could have been declar ed the winner the violence would still have happenedi met friend of mine and he tol d that since he had seen during the odm nomination we should go t the politicians home with him at mikindani to get fund s for the violence another witness appeared to lend creden ce to those accusations he stated i was told that the mp funded the youth to loot and b urn all businesses belonging to non odm members so that they rem ain as poor as themselves one time during the violence i accompan ied some to the mps home he addressed us and told us that he is happy with our actions meaning the violence and further told us that it should continue until president kibaki relinquishes the presidency therefore i believe the mp fully supported the youths ction the foregoing are important leads to further investigatio ns into the role played by local politician in the postelectio n violence considering that there were intelligence reports from nsis about the potential of violence in the area according to hussein khalid some of th violence at the coast was actually caused by the police he produced exhibit 149 stating tha t there were instances where we felt some of the skirmish that were witnessed could have been avoided for instance had the police acted in more civil manner where they dispersed meetings or p rocessions that were legally organized where notices had been issued and they had to come in to disrupt peaceful processions we also felt that number of issues that came to the fore were ethnic in n ature there were people or certain community that were being targeted by others and that very little was done or they were disjoin ted efforts by 226the government the provincial administration was call ing meetings to discuss and deliberate issues with local leaders wo men leaders it was bit disappointing to actually note that the p olice were actually out shooting people killing sometimes injuring indivi duals to the extent of even having them admitted to the hospital his evidence was tested in cross examination and he m aintained that violence broke out on 30th december 2007 at various points in the province simultaneously and that particular community was ta rgeted though in his view there was planning people simply captured the moment and decided there and then what to do with absolutely prior ar rangements this contradicted what the pc earnest munyi told the commission that during the violence leaflets were circulated saying that the kikuyu community should leave their properties and their lands and go back to whe re they came from it was thus the pcs view that there was an element of feeling that this could have been planned because on 31st december 2007 at exactly 11 in the morning groups of people were converging simultaneously at that particular time in kisauni changamwe and were trying also to cross from t he likoni side of the ferry trying to come to island so that kind of situation one can conclude that there was some element of planning nature and extent of violence as we have seen the violence in mombasa town erupted on 3 0th december 2007 and continued unabated for 3 days we we re told that huge groups of youth armed with crude weapons engaged the police in running ba ttles including stoning police in mishomoroni and chan gamwes bangladesh area the main highway to nairobi was blocked at mikind ani and the ocpd reported that riots also broke out in chaani bokole magongo mwisho and ritini in the meantime the whole of likoni was engulfed in violence according to the police 25 deaths occurred though dr anderso n kahindi the provincial director of medical services gave figure of 32 people as having been 227killed192 of these one died of arrow wounds 5 from gunshots 11 died in house fire another 11 had multiple injuries 2 were indi cated to have been lynched by mob while it was not possibl to ascertain the cause of death in 2 cases further we heard from the ocpd that 24 vehicles were burnt 29 residential houses destroyed and 240 commercial bu ildings including kiosks and other temporary structures were destroyed the youth targeted p roperty belonging to the kikuyu community as an expression of anger against t hem for allegedly supporting mwai kibaki in order to esca pe the onslaught many residents found it prudent to paint the letters odm on their proper ty and motor vehicles as measure to avoid being attacked193 we were informed by several witnesses that most of the yout hs appeared to be intoxicated194 the pc observed that the coast had drug problem especi ally among the youth and it was probable therefore that d rugs were bought for the youth to engage in violence the further presumption is that the youth had the benefit of leadership and coordination the commission was told that demonstr ators first vented their anger pulling down unoccupied structures then lit bo nfires and tyres and then barricaded roads thereby paralyzing transport and ading to most people staying indoors what had started as protest demonstratio ns over the presidential outcome took an ethnic twist with demonstrators targeting for destructio n property belonging to the gema communities especially the kikuyus whom they felt had contributed to their marginalization by monday 31st december 2007 about 20 shops had been broken into and 4 houses had been burnt in changamwe most of them belonged to members of the kikuyu and the meru communities who by this time wer fleeing to safety and seeking refuge at the moi international airport m ombasa this gave an 192 exhibit 143 193 exhibit 150 194 testimony of pc ernest munyi cw 140 228opportunity to criminals to engage in an orgy of looting an d destruction we heard that crowds shouting slogans of maisha bora better life and raila peace invaded business premises belonging the kikuyu and ru communities where they looted all the stock the extent of the violence was also felt as far as the mombasa mainland sh opping centre and soweto where 4 public motor vehicles were burnt and bars were looted the orgy of looting was dubbed odm shopping likoni largely periurban area bo rdering kwale district and inhabited predominantly by the digo and othe r mijikenda communities and small number of upcountry gema residents wa s not spared testimony was furnished that 2 petrol stations were burnt down while mt sinai primary school and some businesses owned by kikuyu were destroyed in this area th ngombeni chiefs camp was attacked and razed down on 5 january 2008 evoki ng memories of the 1997 preelection violence where the li koni police station had similarly been invaded195 the kenya ferry services business stalls were vandalized and looted and for 3 days the south coast was cut off from mombasa town which is linked by the ferry service that was rendered unoperational due t the prevailing mayhem in kisauni the commission heard that there was low lev violence on 30th december 2007 where youths burnt tyres at the roadside at mlaleo and gema community members started to move out we were further told that the police did absolutely nothing to contain the situation and thes protests continued in mlaleo mtopanga and in bamburi mwisho between 30th and 31st december 2007 mshomoroni kadogo mtopanga bombolulu mwandoni kiembeni bamburi mtongwe shikaadabu miritini bomu and migadini areas remained go zones on 31st december 2007 and subsequent days there was massive destruction of property especially those belonging to members of the kikuyu community furniture shops supermarkets and select bars were attacked and looted with the violence spreading to mshomoroni and ven nyali west on 1st 195 see the akiwumi report as above note 188 229january 2008 in mshomoroni changamw likoni and kisauni there was massive destruction of property looting and burning of houses and kiosks 20 shops were reported looted in changamwe four houses burn t and young boy reportedly shot by stray bullet similarly some violence was experienced in taita and taveta districts where on 2nd january 2008 odm youths angered by th presidential poll result went on rampage in taveta mwatate and voi town s in taveta 15 shops were broken into goods stolen and or looted and so of these shops burnt amongst them popular establishment known as makuti several people were injured in the skirmishes and one person was killed some coastal areas did not experience any level of viol ence in spite of earlier nsis fears for instance though malindi district rema ined tense following announcement of the president ial poll result incidents of violence were reported at all in lamu district we received evidence that people merely expressed their anger and disappointment through discussions and violence was experienced while government witnesses stated that violence had been brou ght under control by 1 january 2008 we did hear testimony that the situation only became controlled someti in mid january 2008196 for instance we heard that on 3 january 2008 violence was reported in kisauni maweni bombolulu and changamwe areas where kiosks were destroyed and used to block roads the demonstrators were dispersed by police using tear gas nd shooting in the air in this incident one man was reportedly shot in the head and many others were seriously injured on 5 january 2008 youth leaders in mvita organized demonstration which disrupted shops markets and matatu transport the commission further heard that in ukunda shops were burnt while others were marked with an x as sign that they would be attacked and 2 german tourists were killed in diani 196 exhibit 149 230on 10th january 2008 in mvita demonstrations were called after the friday prayers leading to the closure of shops as police disp ersed the demonstrators who then resorted to running battles with the police this was repeated again on 18th january 2008 and we heard that orga nized demonstrations by youth and some civil society organizations became the order of the day one youth was reported to have been shot dead in this mayhem and many people were injured shops remained closed while police fire d in the air and employed tear gas to disperse the demonstrators overall we heard that measure of calm returned to mombasa by 25th january 2008 as the koffi annan mediation process gave many people hope of lasting peace the post election violence left 303 fami lies homeless in kisauni changamwe and likoni 6 people were burnt to death in house in miritini and dr anderson kahindi cw 143 informed us that the co ast provincial genera l hospital handled 109 casualties while jocham hospital attended to 16 case s 5 people died of the bullet wounds in the province response by police and provincial administration the pc stated that security forces who were deployed to quell the skirmishes did their level best and that he was satisfied because the violence was quite intense in the two days and especially the second day and were it not because of the presence of security personnel then the violence could not have been controlled within that limited period of time while we shall shortly revert to this issue we commend the pcs decision to call meet ing of local leaders who appealed to the public through the 5 fm stations in mombasa to help bri ng peace back to mombasa and kilindini this action made big contribution in bringing peace in mombasa and coast province in general this was confirmed by the ppo who 231added that the voice of bishop and particularly that of the chief kadhi197 was very important in appealing to people to maintain peace the ppo felt that the police had dealt with the situat ion to his satisfaction and that by 1st january 2008 the violence had rgely been contained he also acknowledged that he had received lot of complaints from citizens lamenting that our officers were not protecting their premises adequate ly enough he explained that in response to the looting the police h ad resorted to the use of albadiri which in local terms is giving people number of days to return what they had taken and they will not be prosecuted lot of p roperty was returned we heard that almost 10000 people were displaced on the first night of violence and sought refuge in various police stat ions not surprisingly the police through the ppo and the ocpd wilson mbithi told us that though they expected election related problems at the coast they had not imagined vio lence of the magnitude that occurred it is our fi nding that serious efforts were put to securing vital public installations such as the kenya pipeline depots the port of mombasa the kenya petroleum refinery and fuel depots in shimanzi which meant that with the available security personnel it was not possible to provide reasonable protection to others property this is borne by crossexam ination of the ocpd q bwana ocpd youre almost telling this commission that t he police will be there to protect the bigger assets the bigg er installations and that is why the pipeline nobody i mean the oil depots the ports the banks were not touched but mwananchis kiosk their shops were broken into and you explain the logic behind guarding that and not the mwananchis kiosk witness my lords without giving any other details it was not possible for the police to provide security to every ind ividuals business premises while obviously appreciating that police could not be ev erywhere all the time we were repeatedly told that police took too long to come to the rescue of citizens 197 the ppo further stated that on night when people had come out with pangas he had talked to the chief kadhi who went on air on the radio station radio rahma and by talking to the people he was able to cool down the situation without any violence 232and property under threat an d sometimes did not appear at all in spite of giving assurances that everything was under co ntrol for example witness testified that the same day on the 31st december in the evening around 6 pm i was called again by neighbours in likoni who told t hat shops of kikuyus were being broken into and things were being loo ted i also called the police there and they assured things are okay there are problems but within short while i was told th shop was broken into but they were even unable to open the doors so they had to break the concrete the steel door they were unable to open it so they broke the walls when he received news that another of his shops was under ttack he called the nyali police station and they told everything was kay but within minutes the shop was broken into and everything taken awa he lost property and goods estimated at kshs 3 million the witness furnish ed the commission with video footage capturing the looting of one of his shops which evidence he also stated he had put in the hands of the police tog ether with posters which clearly depicted the faces of people who were looting his sho ps198 by the time he appeared before us on 1 september 2008 he said action had been taken by police against the perpetrators some of whom could c learly be identified from the footage and posters the lethargy and incompetence experience d by the witness and others depict another hallmark of poor policing in addition to other negative allegations including taking part in the violence and even worse of having taken sides the evidence points to serious degree of inefficiency and dysfunction within the police and we cannot therefore in such circumstances help but come to the conclusion that either the police did not bother to prevent the commission of crimes in this region or if they were willing to then they were obviously overwhelmed by the magnitude of the unfo lding chaos surprisingly there was concession by the police that there were any lapses in their policing duties 198 exhibit 144 233further we heard from two witnesses that prior to ections it was openly discussed amongst the coastal people that they would attack kikuyu and kamba business premises if the election results were flawed one would therefore have expected that the administrative arm of t he government in collaboration with the police and other curity agencies would have verified such warning signs and moved very swif tly to put in place some measures to ensure that such eventuality did not occur of course pr ecautionary measures were put in place despite the acknowledgement that some areas were dubbed as hot spots the information produced in exhibit 150 is therefore credible that security forces did not make any preparations to address the anticipated violence to forestall looting destruction and other forms of chaos we were concerned by evidence tendered before us that ther was big presence of gsu officers in likoni but that they were only vi sible and not active this gave the impression to the residents that thes particular officers were there with specific instructions to protect tourists along the main routes but had brief to quell the violence and so they just watched as the traged unfolded however as stated by hussein khalid the provincial administration led by the pc ernest munyi made an effort at some point to meet the local lea ders with view to finding solution to the situation if only to avoid the escalation of violence that aside given the attitude of the security forces at th is point in time we are not surprised that fairly manageable situ ation escalated into full blown violence that took an ethnic angle and that not only were securi ty forces caught unawares but they were completely overwhelmed furthe r it emerged that the riot drill pamphlet providing guidelines to the suppre ssion of riots was last issued in october 1962 and if there is any one that came aft er this one i may not be aware about it my lord199 the ocpd said it was just show of force meaning that your presence at sce ne of disturbance is assumed to be enough to make the rioter s disperse that is the first one number two if they dont disperse fter show of 199 testimony of cw 143 234force then you are required to use the teargas the thi rd one if they would not disperse after you throw teargas to them then the pamphlet allows the use of the button the truncheon now and fina lly if they do not oblige and the situation is so bad that is the only time you can resort to the use of firearms my lord another troubling aspect regards the evidence we received th at in numerous instances where the police arrived on time they allowed these people to loot items but implored them not to caus any bodily harm to other persons200 the pc the ppo and the mombasa urban ocpd categorically den ied being aware of loot but not kill order they also rejected the ggestion that they were overwhelmed for lack of adequate preparation which wou ld justify them seeking to appease the mobs by allegedly telling them to loot but t to kill however testimony was consistent from numb er of witnesses that police who were patrolling in land rovers gave the protes ting crowds go ahead to loot but not to harm or kill anyone 200 testimony of hussein khalid cw 149 235 236part iii extent and impact of po st election violence this part of the report deal s with cross cutting issues arising out of the violence which the commission came across in the co urse of its investigations these are sexual violence internally displaced persons the media and the post election violence extent and consequences of pev figures on deaths injuri and damage to property 237 chapter six sexual violence introduction one of the well known and regrettabl tragedies of major conflicts and breakdowns of law and order is sexual violence this has ppened around the world sadly enough it also was co nsequence of the 2007 post election violence in kenya like others who either lived thr ough or followed this terrible period of kenyas history the commission heard anecdotally and from the media about sexual violence against both women and men these r eports admittedly informal included heart wrenching tales of rape gang rape sexual mutilation loss of body parts and hideous deat hs in addition the commission also gradually learned that the various forms of genital violence against innocent victims were not just oneoff tragedies but major lifech anging events among others the commission heard tales of family members being f orced to stand by and witness their mothers fathers sisters brothers an d little children being raped killed and maimed innocent victims contracting hi v aids after being sexually assaulted because the breakdown of law and order nd the deteriorating security situation kept them from accessing m edical care soon enough to prevent it husbands abandoning their wives wh had been defiled and the inevitable psychological burden of powerlessness and ho pelessness that left individuals who had experienced sexu violence feeling alone isolated and unable to cope not just for one moment in time but possibly forever worse still the commission also heard that some individuals who had lost family members and property and who had been chased away from the only homes they had ever known also had experienced multiple forms of viol ence that included sexual violence hearing bits and pieces of these lif shattering experiences alerted the commission to the need to make its in quiries into the sexual violence that occurred following the 2007 election centra l focus of its investigation into post 238election violence at the very least the commission thoug ht it would be appropriate to look in depth into the sexual violence that had occurred its reasoning was twofold first sexual viol n c i s f r m f violence and as the commission was about violence it felt strongly that ther should be focus on it in the commissions investigations secondly being ordinary l ay people from various walks of life the members of the commission also were personally horrified by the stories of sexual violence that ca to our attention like others members of the commission too felt compassion for the victims of post election sexual violence and wanted to learn and expose what had happened the commission also felt that it should do something to mak sure that the scourge of sexual violence that happened after the election did n ot become an endemic in kenyan life that could be one day coul d recur in the lives of ordinary people the commission felt it needed to explore the situation given that like others it only heard isolated stories and did not kn ow anything concrete about the sexual violence that happened the commission so ught to the best of its ability to answer four basic questions to fulfil its mandate to ex plore the full extent of violence that kenya had experienced including sexual viol ence first the commission wanted to know whether sexua l violence actually had taken place secondly the commission wanted to know exactly what had occurred how it manifested and its extent third the commission wanted to understand how and why it happened and fourth what ev idence there was for all of the above being lay people rather than specialists in the subject of sexual violence members of the commission understood that not only did they not have the answers to the above questions but that they also did not know how to go about getting them the commission realized that while armed with reasonable questions and good intentions it could not embark on t his inquiry alone the commission needed assistance from sp ecialists who knew kenyas social and political landscape were familiar with the history causes and nature of sexual violence in general and who had worked with victims of such violence the commission knew that while women norm ally are the main victims of sexual 239violence when order breaks down men too had experience d horrid types of sexual violence after the kenyan elec tion these included sodomy forced circumcision and even mutilation of their penises betwee n hearing of women who had been gang raped and mutilated the accounts of ethnically driven sexual violence against certain men wa s also horrifying furthermore the commission also understood that any inquiries it might mak into sexual violence would also involve intera cting with victims the commission appreciated all the sensitivities associat ed with doing so including the usual problem of finding victims who would ag ree to discuss what had happened to them the commission wanted to make its inquiries into sexu violence part and parcel of all of its investigations into the post election violence that engulfed kenya after the 2007 election the commission knew how ever that to do so it would need the help of experts fortunately there are n umber of groups in kenya who work around the theme of sexua l violence these agreed to assist in all parts of the commissions work both before the commission took evidence in nairobi and while gathering testimony in the countryside i n nairobi the commission held three planning meetings with civil society organizations that address sexual violence including those who had worked on these matters after the elections in kenya in the middle of the crisis fort organizations in kenya came together to reach out to women and others who had xperienced sexual violence following the 2007 elections they gathered unde r the auspices of the interagency gender base d violence subcluster cochaired by the united nations fund for population activities unfpa and the national commission on gender and development this umbrella group included variety of different groups from departments in the ministries of gender and health and the judiciary various agencies eg unfpa the united nations development fund for women unifem the red cross and red crescent movement and from various local and international nongovernmental organizations ngos even before the commission began its sessions the subcluster had responded to the postelection sexua l violence particularly against women including 240providing victims with medical psychosocial and other counsell ing services hence the subcluster was in unique po sition to help the commission with its work and did so during consultations with the sgbv bcluster the commission was able to ask them questions about how sexual violence manifest ed where the commission might find evidence of it and how it should go about collecting this evidence the commission also decided intern ally that matters relating to sexual violence would be an integral part of it s inquiry into the postelection violence as justice philip waki the chairman of the commissi on noted on the first day of the commissions hearings sexual violen ce is silent and preying because it is underreported underinvestigated and insuffic iently addressed also adding that the commission would focus on it in all parts of our investigation declaring ourselves open to receive any credible informa tion and evidence from survivors201 the commission realized that it probably would be easier t find out what had happened in nairobi than in the countryside where lack f anonymity and fear of speaking to the commissi on might be greater problem the commission also understood that if all testimony from vi ctims of postelectoral sexual violence was taken in private rather than in public the issue f sexual violence against women in the postelection period might get lost and never be discussed or flagged to the general public to preem pt these and other potential problems the commission took five major steps firs t to help locate and speak to victims of postelection sexual violence in va rious parts of kenya the commission enlisted assistance from unfpa and unifem as well as from four subcluster members they included care kenya fida kenya the kenya women empowerment link and the catholic diocese of nakuru as part of this effort care did study in the slums of kibera and mathare wh ile the centre for rights education and awareness creaw did another and also produced 201 cipev hansard vol 1 pp 1 238 241documentary about sexual violence in th rift valley care kenya also held workshop for victims of sexual violen ce to explain what the commission was doing and to find out who among them might be willin g to testify before further they provided counselling services to women and prepared the m to testify before the commission in addition to giving the commission some recommendations to be followed when victims most of wh om were women appeared before the commission secondly to ensure that the work on sexual violence was culturally sensitive and to allow the commission to contact specialists as needed the sub cluster set up committee including resident gender expert from unifem to work with the commissions investigators and to identify and prepare victims who wanted to testify to the commission thirdly to encourage victims of sexual vi olence to come befo re the commission and to make it less painful for them to speak to investi gators and to the commission the commission hired two female investigators w ho had experience in dealing with sexual violence against women in particular they included one international police investigator and one kenyan lawyer fourthly the commission made it point to allow two wyers to take part in its proceedings who had experience in dealing with gender issues the feder ation of women lawyers fida and the centre for advancement of women and children202 they had opportunity to examine every witn ess appearing before the commission including government officials the police victims and other interested parties throughout our meetings all over the country their qu estions added another dimension to the commissions understand ing of what had happened to women and other victims of sexual violence an d the extent to which the government and others had assisted or failed to assist th ose in need fifthly fully cognizant of the potential challenge of asking someone who had experienced sexual violence to relive it by testifying before the co mmission decided to hire full time 202 the commission granted fida limited standing as an intervener on 15 july 2008 and the centre for the advancement of women and children on 29 july 2008 their terms are discussed in cipev hansard vol 1 9ͳ25 july 2008 p228 and vol 2 naivasha 28 ͳ29 july 2008 p1128 242psychologist to interact with and assist victims both before during and after they testified to the commission collecting evidence this commission is the first investigation of electoral violence to focus on sexual violence this contrasts with the ki liku and akiwumi commissions which did not address it as such the commission wa s in uncharted territory not only did it seek advice as noted above but also tried to take account of the difficulty victims faced in coming forward some told the cluster group or investigators that they were ashamed of what had happened to them and did not want to discuss their experiences in public fear ing further humiliatio n others worried that if they testified in the open their attackers migh t retaliate against them as this increased the possibility of them being identified understanding that potential witnesses had suffered incalcula ble physical and psychological horrors from which they might never recover the commission arranged for private hearings which also allowed victims to describe what had happened to them and enabled them to open up in some cases to the point of naming their attackers in short th commission and the kenyan victims of sexual violence encountered issues similar to those faced sewhere in the world when dealing with its aftermath even then with all of the efforts to sensitize members of the commission and provide safe environment in which victims could testify it was still difficult for vi ctims to steel themselves and come forth to meet with the commission this accounts for the relatively small number of victims 31 in all who testified before the commission or submitted statements something the commission understood and appreciated but nevertheless regret given the strong belief by the commission that the proble m of sexual and gender based violence in the post election period merited mor time in the commission hearings this not so unusual problem may also ve been accentuated by the sad history of kenyas past electoral vio lence and the reality that perpetrators have not only gone punished but have continued afterwards as powerful political figure s that sobering reality as well as the relative 243powerlessness of kenyan women in many areas of life may h ave made potential witnesses shy away after considering that the potential cost of their testimony far outweighed any perceived expectations that they may h ave had for obtaining justice furthermore some cases of sexual violence against men that took place after the 2007 elections were hitherto unheard of and new to the co mmission and to kenya the tragic novelty of this experi ence meant that there were even fewer support groups available to men than to women that added to the humiliation f t h v i l t i n s m n t t h t n m l victims came forward to testify to the commission something the commission understood but neverthe less found regrettable the commission heard from witnesses some of whom were specialists or had treated victims of sexual violence and others who were victims the former testified in public about the character magnitude and extent of the violence this permitted the commission to learn much about what d happened approximately how many people were af fected and how various organizations had responded in the face of this crisis others mainly vict ims testified mostly in private the private hearings began in nairobi afte r which the commission heard from victims of sexual violence in naivasha nakuru ldoret kisumu and mombasa but not in kisii where victims came forth public testimony by expert witnesses the commission received testimony from three specialists n sexually based violence most of whose work has been with female victims t hese were millicent

discussed the post election sexual viol ence in kenya between december 2007 and march 2008 and their encounters with it they told the commission that sexual violence was rampant during this period consisting mainly of rape and gang rape defileme nt genital mutilation sodomy forced circumcision and sexual exploitation millicent obasos testimony discussed th horrific experiences of women in kibera and mathare where her organization had worked th ere her organization collected information from 40 victims and analysed in depth the cases of 13 of these victims she the commission that most victims were poor women who had been raped in their own homes by youth gangs of up to 20 men gsu personnel and some police officers the victims ranged in age from 2568 with over 62 being married widowed or divorced and 38 single sl ightly over 61 had attended primary school 15 secondary school and 23 had never been to school at all most were still homeless or living in idp camps having lost their possessions livelihoods and homes ms obaso recounted several terrible tales from victims of sexual violence which not only hit women worst but which she told the commission was the direct consequence of existi ng inequalities between men and women in kenya and something that aff ected the way in which husbands responded to the rap of their wives and daughters she explained that over 75 of the individu als her group interviewed said they had been raped at home in front of their spouses and children causing great deal f s t r s s t h t r s u l t d i n t h i r b i n g abandoned by their husbands as she explained the man came the father of the house and when he fou nd that his wife had been raped and the same man raped his daughter and rapes his daughterin law he said i am finished with this i c annot deal with this i am going to find myself another woman because this is the biggest taboo in my home and i cannot even be cleansed and who are the perpetra tors204 204 cw 10 with the remainder of this witnesses discussion and quotations drawn from pp 233 ͳ42 245the witness told the commission that abandonment after b eing raped sometimes by up to 20 men was just th beginning of the horror visited on these women most who were left had place to go the majority did not report what had happened with the police or their chiefs and when t hey did many were received with hostility or turned away some contracted hiv aids because they could not get to hospital in time to r eceive postexposure prophylaxis pep drug which the commission was informed pr events hiv infection if administered in time while others who were already infected with hiv aids were unable to get their daily doses of antiretroviral drugs arvs to manage the disease others became pregnant as result of the violations furthermore the witness told the commission that some women were disabled and when they were being interviewed they could not walk properly while others who did not receive proper treatment still had blood streaming down their legs which was visible to their children ms obaso told the commission that she felt these terrible violations against women needed to be taken very seriously and made recommend ations including implementing the sexual offences act developing guideli nes for police compensating women providing psychosoci support to them and their families looking at these women as human beings whilefinding their perpetrat ors and passing on the experiences of what happened to women to the truth and reconciliation commission jane onyango205 testified about the work of fida in idp camps in nairo bi nakuru eldoret mombasa and kisumu kenya that included legal aid counselling and humanitarian services which they provided to women and children living in very poor congeste d and insecure conditions she told the commission that these conditions couraged further sexual violence she reiterated similar experiences as those recounted by ms obaso gang rapes fear of reporting to the commission either in private or public inability to access 205 cw 11 246police stations loss of property home s legal documents and possessions and abandonment by their husbands one woma n in mathare who was already hiv positive who had returned home to stay safe after bein g chased by gang she experienced the terror of her house being knocked down by another mob who proceeded to gang raped her before she passed out in anoth er case luhya woman married to kikuyu was abando ned by her husband on 30 december he returned two days later and threatened to kill her and sodomize her saying he regretted marrying luhya he threw her belongings out of their house and refused to let her see her children ms onyango also told the commission that women are traditionally seen as lesser human beings something that propels sexual violence and the insensitive response of the police w hich leads to victims fears of reporting believing they could be turned away or even killed for doing so the commission also received testimony from dr regin karega206 the chairwoman of kenyas national commission on gender and development which came into existence in 2004 she made number of suggestions about measures which she felt would increase th likelihood of perpetrators of sexual violence being charged these included ving mobile courts and increasing the number of centres for victims of conflict both to assist an d protect them michael gachanja wachira207 program officer with the centre for rights educatio n and awareness creaw presented dvd of women in the rif t valley who voiced their experiences concerning sexual violence after the 2007 election he also gave the commission presentati on based on an in depth study undertaken in nairobi nakuru burnt forest and eldoret from the end of january through 25 april 2008 the commission was intere sted to learn that 82 of the victims did not formally report their experiences of sexual violence especially to the police the commission was told that the reasons for non reporting ranged from having been attacked by the police 32 fear of being attacked again 24 thinking nothing wo uld be done 45 and not being able 206 cw12 207 cw13 247to identify the rapist 31 others the commission was told did not know where to report the incident had been as ked not to report the matter 34 or did not know how to do so 27 the witness told the commission that some respondents especially those raped by powerful figures in authority including police who had sexually assaulted women were effectively untouchable this finding mirrored other testimony given to the commission co ncerning the response both by government and security personnel to other types of post election violence the very individuals who might have h elped them were people to whom they could not go for help pe rpetrators at the worse and otherwise often indifferent bystanders to the plight of ordinar citizens whom they should have assisted the witness also testified that some women in i dp camps in naivasha were reduced to trading sex for money to buy food for their families while others were raped by individual s who invaded idp camps as was the case in nakuru or did not have access to medical services208 dr sam thenya209 the ceo of the nairobi womens hospital which provid free services to female and male victims of sexual violence explained to the commission that his hospital offers co mprehensive treatment to survivors of sexual violence including administer ing drug known as post exposure prophylaxes pep medication which if give n within 72 hours of rape reduces the chances of the victim being infected with hivaids and othe r sexually transmitted diseases stds he also re layed to the commission the other types of services offered by his hospital including psychological and mental health and other services dr sam thenya told the commission that his hospital was inundated with patients during the post election period it treated 653 individuals to whom it was able to offer comprehensive services including the dministration of pep this number excludes others who came to the hospital after the 72 hour period when pep is in effective as the hospitals statistics in clude only those who 208 exhibit 12 b 209 cw 14 248receive its comprehensive services therefore to some exten t not fully taking account of the total number of individuals who came to the hospital to be treated for sexual violence adding in those treated at other hosp itals in other parts of the country with whom he partners dr thenya testified t us that at least 900 individuals were treated noting this was the just the tip of the iceberg many more victims of sexual violence could not get to his or other hospitals to obtain treatment given the lack of security and means of transport w hen law and order broke down this was an additional tragedy dr thenya relayed to the commission adding to the commissions understanding of the ways in which sexual violence and the results of post election violenc intersected for those on whom dr thenya had collected data 524 or 80 suffered fro m rape and defilement 65 or 10 from domestic vi olence with the remaining 10 from other types of physical and sexual assault the majority of the patients were women even though the hospital treated small number of males who had been sodomized and subjected to other form of sexual brutalization about half of the 524 were adults and the other half we re children with 207 knowing their attackers the majority of the attackers were known but n ot named followed by neighbors relatives and friends of the patients coming to the nairobi womens hospital 58 were from nairobi with the rest coming fr om kiambu nakuru naivasha eldoret makueni machakos and ongata rongai210 dr margaret makanyengo consulta nt psychiatrist and head of the department of mental health services and the gender ba sed violence recovery centre gbvrc 211also testified and said that their gbvrc acted as on stop shop offering psychological and mental health services to victims of sexual violence from december 2007 to june 2 008 they recorded 184 cases of sexual violence 80 of which stemmed from the post election si tuation ironically the commission heard that in january and february at the h eight of the violence the numbers of patients they saw actually dipped somet hing the witness 210 the figures come from dr thenyas testimony and from exhibits 14 aͳc 211 cw 23 249attributed to the lack of transport and th general level of insecurity in the city here she echoed the statements of other witnesses notwithstanding the abundance of info rmation the commission received about the nature numbers and manifestations of post election sexual violence from the above organizations and from other witnesses the commissioner of police major general hassan ali212 had told the commissi on the police had not collected any information or statistics on crimes such as rapes213 given the evidence adduced by the witnesses above and the victims of sexual violence against the police the commission was concerned over the apparent lack of interest of the police in sexual violence in general and p articularly in not taking action against their ow n officers who perpetrated the crimes testimony from victims the commission received testimony from vi ctims of sexual violence in public in private from statements collected by in vestigators including those from victims who did not wish to appear before the commission but nevertheless wanted their stories heard the commission also obtained records of intervie ws given to other organizations including those headed by the specialists abo ve who testified before the commission this included evid ence from women men girls and boys who were raped sodomized and had their genitals mutilated it is noted that women and girls were the majority of those affected the commission and its investigators collected testimonies nd statements from many different parts of kenya even though was difficult to access victims in idp camps particularly once the government began its program of to resettle idps operation rudi nyumbani which made it more difficult for the commission to trace reach or obtain information from victims 212 cw 1 213 cw 1 250the people whom the commission heard from in direct evi dence and from statements to investigators are real people with real lives the combined horror of post election and sexual violence they experience has destroyed their lives what began as one horror and one ss was quickly compounded into many these experiences continue to overwhelm those who heard t hem including the commission mass violence can easily be reduced to anomic numbers while numbers are necessary to profile the sexual violence t hat occurred after the 2007 election they also can turn tragic histories of rmal people into sea of faceless anonymity if viewed in isolation to avoid this and to retain the human face of the post election sexual violence experienced b its victims the commisison did its best to encourage victim s of sexual violence to come and tell about their experiences hence following the presentation of figures compiled by th commission to help in synthesizing what happened the rest of this chapter tells the story of post election violence through the eyes of the victims who testified to the commission mostly in camera the chapte r consists in either summarizing what they told the commission or using direct quotes from th eir testimonies and statements to the commission to illustrate broader point s who were the victims of sexual violence the demographic characteristics of the vi ctims of postelection sexual violence who testified and whom the commissio ns investigators interviewed are as follows214 the commission received statements from total of 31 women ranging in age from 1755 years old some of whom testified in private and others of whom just gave statements th commissions investigators but did not appear before the commission many we re victims of other aspects of post election violence including being forced to flee from their homes having their 214 the figures here were compiled from data collected by commission investigator working on sexual and gender based violence 251property destroyed losing their family members and suffering from other types of violence twelve of the thirty came from nairobi tw from naivasha six from nakuru four from eldoret six from ki sumu one from mombasa but none from kisii even though sexual violence oc curred there too while the commission feels that much of what it heard was br oadly indicative of what happened its assessment comes from small group of people who do not co nstitute statistically representative sample for reasons noted ear lier victims of sexual violence are often reluctant to testify the commission was able to find thirty women who agreed to testify however while men and male children were also targets of sexual vi olence none were willing to be interviewed by the commissi ons investigators or to testify before the commission this was the situation in naivasha whe re there were many forced male circumcisions including on teenaged boy who was near where the commissions investigators were taking statements but was too traumatized to record his story of those testifying to the commission or whose statements were recorded the majority were not well off if not poor before the po st election violence many were engaged in small business activities these included sell ing cereals vegetables and secondhand clothes working in beauty shops and bars engaging in subsistence farming and wo rking as casual labourers on farms or as house maids in nairobi all those in terviewed lived in the slums of mathare and kibera while the victims in nakuru naivasha eldore t kisumu and mombasa lived on the outskirts of the towns or in the ru ral areas eighteen of the women interviewed were attacked in their homes seven while fleeing from violence three while looking for food or chil dren lost as result of the prevailing mayhem in their neighbourhoods one while being dragged out of her house by someone she knew with the remaining suffering other expe riences twenty four of the thirty victims who gave stat ements to the commission or to its investigators were gang raped seventee n rapes were committed by civilians involving 2 to 12 individuals while 7 we re committed by state security agents 252involving the 4 by the gsu 2 by admi nistrative police and one by the kenya police the gang rapes perpetrated by the gsu involved 2 to 4 officers 3 to 7 in the case of the administrative police p and 2 in the cases of the kenya police six other cases of rape were committed by individuals rather than gangs with four cases involving civilians and anothe r two officers from the gsu and one who was an ap only one case involved forced circumcision in nairobi six of the twelve cases of sexual violence were hi v positive before being attacked two were infected after being raped one was infected with an std during the attack while the remaining three had not been tested and did not know their status seven of these same individuals had been gang raped five of which were committed by gsu officers as mentioned earlier the commission also hea rd from kenyan experts that the majority of the victims of sexual violence were either unable to or did not seek out medical care who were the perpetrators from testimony witnesses gave to the commission and that rece ived from specialists who worked with victims of sexual violence the commission learned that the perpetrators of the post election sexual violence included the following state security agents eg administrative police regular police and members of the general service unit gsu member s of organized gangs eg mungiki kalenjin warriors and others neighb ors relatives supposed friends and individuals working in idp camps it is always impossible to get into th minds of perpetrators of violence particularly those engaged in sexual violence however the testimony given to the commission suggests certain underlying themes howev er irrational they may seem to outsiders or to victims themselves it appears to the commission different perpetrators acted for different reasons in some areas sexual violence was means used to pressure people to leave their homes t retaliate against them for having voted for the wrong candidate tribe or party and in tandem with that to dominate humiliate and degrade them and their communities into pit of powerlessness here it dovetailed wi th the overall postelectoral violence in 253other areas sexual violence was an opportunistic act played out against background of lawlessness and vacuum of power that created disorder bordering on anarchy in other cases xual violence was used to coerce and control helpless idps who traded sex unwillingly for basic n eeds with the perpetrators being individuals in th camp individuals from surrounding communities eg when women went out to collect food and water or security personnel and humanitarian workers in the camps each of whom preyed upon helpless women in different macabre ways security forces in discussing their attackers victims of sexual violence singled out members of various security forces who were meant to have protected them two victims 50 year old widow215 resident of kibera who had lived there for ten years an d who had children and 216a 46 year old married woma n with ten children who ran shop selling vegetables and charcoal described their exp eriences of being gang raped by gsu officers to the co mmission they told the commission the officers entered their houses under the pretext of lookin g for the weapons and young men that were barricading roads an d the railway line in kibera another 55 year old woman from kibera laini saba interviewed by investigators recalled similar horrendous experience in her statement she to ld of looking outside seeing that there were security officers and therefore not bothering to lock her house worse still as they were security officers she let them in after which they ransacked her house while pretending to look for t he members of the illegal group mungiki and gang raped her when they could not find the group they were working for she narrated her life altering story as follows i went to my house the gsu followed and said they w ere looking for young men who were involved in the violence they were 3three gsu men who got into my house i had not locked my hous and when they came in i did not bother to lock because they were security men who were supposed to care for us one of the gsu off icers stood 215 cw 17 216 cw 18 254at the door the other two got in they told they w ere going door to door looking for the young men who were involved in

raped me217 another 34 year old woman also from kibera laini sab had similar experience which was captured in statement she gave to t he commissions investigators she described the horrors visited upon her s follows the army men started running after the young men w ho were said to be mungiki and had killed other people along the ra ilway line having seen that they were army men i just went to

ransacking the house was the second one to rape and t he army man guarding the door was the third to rape me218 50 year old woman and resident of kibera testified in camera to the commission recounting to the commission what had happened to her in the following statement at around 630 pm two 2 motor vehicles came with gsu policemen in uniform green with patches and they had cap the same colour thinking that they were coming to assi st us we were very happy but that was not the case they hit ji ko that had fire and it fell on my daughter juliana and she got burnt on her feetone policeman hit my eyes i fell down and my blood pressur rose he tore my clothes he raped i got unconscious as the other ransacked the house the same man raped my daughter j s he became pregnant though on 5708 she had miscarriage219 in some cases the security agents attack ed individuals including teenagers during flight according to the statemen t of 17 years old girl from eldoret currently living in childrens home in nakuru she was attacked by 7 administrative police officers who gang raped her at th time of the attack she was running away from her sisters ho use which had been attacked by some raiders during the post election violence220 not only did the commission hear of commissions by securit officers who should have helped to prevent sexual violence rather than engaging in it 218 cipev investigators jobsheet nairobi 10 july 2008 219 cw 17 statement exhibit 17a 220 cipev investigators jobsheet nakuru 30 july 2008 256themselves but also of deliberate omissions on their part the commission received information that some security fficers refused to record cases having to do with sexual violence according to married woman l iving in mathare 221who was able to identify some of her attackers by name she went to pangani police station and the police told that they do not want to listen to cases about rape if it is about robbery i should report and i r eported and they gave an ob number in addition when married female resident of k ibera who had been gang raped cw 18 went to report at the kilimani police station she was told to choose between the two either the issue of the house being burned or being raped222 the woman explained to the commission that although sh had identified the men who gang d raped her and looted he r property the police at the pangani police station released the perpetrators without offering her an explanation the police only said that this was about politics and that she should leave mr magara police officer at the pangani police station eve n went to the extent of asking for bribe he asked the woman to pay him shs6000 before he takes up the case and she told him shecould not afford that although security agents are expected to be neutral in the course of their work the commission received information from witnesses that some of security agents were ethnically biased if not hostile to indivi duals not from their own et hn i c g r u p s r t h er s t h t t he p er c eived to belong to political parties that they themselves did not support according to 29 year ld married mother of two luo from naivasha who worked for flower comp any223the police officers who were from another ethnic group failed to he lp her take her injured brother to hospital and when he died they refused to collect his body and take it to the mortuary kikuyu gang had be looking for the womans husband and when they could not find him they set up on her brother cutting off his testicles 221 cw 15 222 from testimony and exhibits 15 and 18 223 cw 36 257and his penis not only did they refuse but they warned his wife that if she insisted she would end up like her brother and that it was not the ir work the body thus remained uncollected for two days started rotting and was eaten by dogs it was only later that she got help from other poli ce officers who were kalenjin it is the commissions view that the invo lvement of state security agents in the perpetration of sexual violence and the fear of incrim inating themselves may partly explain why the police omitted data on sexual violence in the reports they presented to the commission the commissio n also felt that it was unfortunate that the commissioner of police testified that he could n ot determine whether sexual violence was fit to be reported and was unaware that anyone had been arrested and charged for commission of such crimes224 furthermore the horrendous experiences of the women who testified befor the commission illustrated the same broad concerns wi th the security forces the commission also learnt about this from other witnesses speaking abo ut the post election violence in kenya these included those who were supposed to be keeping order and protecting citizens but were rather perpetrators themselves refusal to h l p c i t i z n s w h c m d i r c t l t f f i cers for help or to report crimes breakdown along ethnic lines mirroring th way in which violence as whole manifested after the election and callous indifference if not outright hostility to victims who often had experienced multiple tragedies and d their lives turned upside down sometimes in minutes and sometimes in days furthermore what the commission heard from these witn esses once again reminded the commission about the preca riousness of both state and society in kenya the testimony the commission re ceived brought the realization once again that if the current state of impunity and the bel ief that individuals in authority and their followers have licens to maim and kill without being held accountable continues both sexual viol ence and other forms of post election 224 cw 1 see hansard vol 1 p 47 258violence would easily happen again in short while different in some respects in others the sexual violence after the election also mirr ored many facets of the post election violence in general organized gangs according to statements received by the commission the victims of sexual violence from some areas told us that they were attack ed by members of organized gangs in nairobi naivasha and nakuru there we re claims that mungiki was involved with their member s targeting men as opposed to women this might explain why there were repo rted cases of rape and defilement in naivasha but instead there were cases of men being targ eted and being forcibly circumcised dr kariuki gichuki the current medical officer of hea lth for nakuru225confirmed having received 6 cases of forced circumcision whi ch he described as traumatic circumcisionbecause usually circumcision either ou are in the hospital or in traditional setting that is clean and boundary kind of surgical procedure but this one was bit crude and not orderly the doctor further referred to the cases as ones of pilary amputation and explained that usually circumcision is the surgical removal of fore skin but in particular case 22 year old male had his whole penis actually cut in addition to destroying property killing and maiming the members of the mungiki gang were said to target men fr om specific communities believed not to practice circumcision and also believed to be in support of particular political party with view to circumcising them the cruelty of what transpired differed from victim to victim married luo wo man with two children originally from huruma estate in nairobi but displaced to an idp camp226 testified in camera as follows 225 cw 46 226 cw 16 259i heard many people outside saying that even here th ere are some odm people we want to circumcise they were many and were making lot of noise they pushed the door saying th at kihiikikuyu for uncircumcised man you are the ones troubling usi saw my husband lying down they opened his zip lifted his pen is and cut it with panga i managed to slip away and one alert ed them and they said it is okay i would go away and that it is m husband they wanted to teach lesson and circumcise227 as result of this attack her husband di ed due to the injuries sustained during this hideous incident in explaining the extent to which some victims suffered in the hands of such gangs woman whose testimony has been referred to prev iously in camera that i found that his my brothers penis had been cut and p laced on his mouth his testis were chopped off and placed on his hand i found that blood was still pouring out of his body and he w as kicking as he was dyingthe following day another workmate of mine informed that his my brothers head had been chopped of and th at dogs were eating his private parts my brother was clobbered bef ore he was mutilated the people who did that to him were usin g spiked clubs they had fixed nails on the club and as they hit his face the nails would pluck flesh from his body228 neighbours and others individual criminals the commission also heard from witnesses that in some areas the victims of sexual violence were attacked by their own neighbours or by individuals from neighbouring villages hence most of th victims were able to identify their assailants in the cases where sexual violence was perpetr ated by civilians this was often accompanied by other crimes ch as theft arson and other types of 227 cw 16 exhibit 16 b 228 cw 16 exhibit 16b statement 260violence as 40 year old married kikuyu woman from m ombasa229 told the commission she was able to identify on of her assailants while being gang raped because he had worked at the sa place among her attackers who screamed odm odm as they stoned and entered the couple s house she was able to identify some individuals who so stole both her ho usehold and business properties torched sitting shade bu rnt beddings and slaughtered her three goats she subsequently made police re port none of the looters were arrested and the rapist was set free shortly thereafter230 humanitarian workers and idp service providers the commission was told by experts that some women were exposed to sexual exploitation during their stay at idp camps desperate and vulnerable women were forced into prostitution to fulfil the need to feed their children doing whatever was necessary to do so the testimony of millicent obaso mentioned earlier told the commission that that some women were subjected to sexual exploitation by some persons managing the idp camps in order to access basic commodities such as food tents medicines and beddings she testified commission that sexual exploitation is really using power and author ity over vulnerable people for sexual favours in exchange for servi ces here in kenya we saw lot of that in terms of food distri bution it is form of forced prostitution of course when women are vulnerabl when they have to feed their children so if man asks them to have sex even though they may not want to they will say yes to get the money and feed their children231 it is unfortunate that the commission did not hear testimonies of the victims of such types of sexual violence this could be explained by various factors there is possibility that such witnesses feared that providing such evidence to the 229 cw 153 230 cw 153 231 cw 10 261commission would jeopardize their situatio n further in addition by the time the commission was at the heart of its hearin gs many of the victims residing at the camps and who would have had evidence to that effect ma have been relocated to other areas under the government programme operatio n rudi nyumbani unintended sexual consequences of general violence the commission obtained evidence from two men both residents of kisumu who were victims of police shooting although these did not present themselves as victims of sexual violence the general violence of whi ch they were victims had incidental sexual effects in one case gregory ngoche232 testified that he was shot by the police while resting in his home with members of his family in kisumu he sustained injuries on his leg and was hospitalized for several days as result of the shooting he suffered sexual dysfunction another witness john apiyo233 testified that he worked as an askari in kisumu and was shot from behind by stray police bullet as they tried to deal with riot within his place of work he sustained an injury on his testicles from the shooting and now has sexual dysfunction impact of the victims health and socioeconomic conditions victims of the post election sexual viol ence experienced number of unintended consequences in the aftermath of bein g attacked which the commission heard about from witnesses who testified and fr om those who did t but nevertheless gave statements to its investigators the consequences included infection with hivaids physical injury and psycholo gical trauma desertion by their spouses unwanted pregnancy and loss of trust that they m ight have had previously in state security agencies some victims of sexual violence already had hiv aids and others contracted it as result of being raped and being unable to access medical s ervices in time to reduce the chances of or prevent infection in additio n witnesses told the commission that even when they advised their perpetrators of their hiv aids 232 cw 104 233 cw 93 262status and showed them their medication their attackers went on to rape or gang rape them thereby perversely ch oosing to risk becoming infected themselves as millicent obaso of care kenya explained some of the women declared to the perpetrators that they were hiv positive but the men ignored and went ahead and raped them my lord this is very dangerous because most of the perpetra tors the youth gang were between 20 and 25 years they have spouses or they are planning to marry or have wives and they may b spreading this virus but who knows maybe some of these perpetrators themselves were hiv and they also infected the women they raped who were not hiv i would urge my lord that you monit or the hivaids prevalence in mathare and kibera over the next one year or two years to see to what extent the prevalence is g oing up 234 this same point was reinforced by dr samuel thenya who xplained that there are those who are on hiv treatment or who were hiv positive nd they were sexually assaulted now call it poetic just ice or what you may but it means that the person who assaulted them then has also been exposed to hivaids and of course the perpetrators did not come to us so you have group of people out there who assaulted others who are hiv positive and therefore have been infec ted with hivaids235 many victims of sexual violence were injured extensively and suffered enormous psychological trauma mathare reside nt told the commission that those who circumcised her also cut her vagina to th extent that the attending doctors told her it was impossible to stitch her and instead gave her drug 36 year old woman from eldama ravine told the commission that when she was gang raped it was either the second or the third man who said tha t he was not able to get into properly so they cut i think i t was the panga 234 cw 10 235 cw 142 263they were carrying that they used they cut my vagina 236in explaining the extent of the injuri she sustained after being gang raped by gsu officers told the commission237 these people hurt because at my age i had stopped getting monthly pe riods these days i bleed lot i have smelly watery discharge nd i have heavy bleeding and have sores around my private partsi feel lot of pain in my private parts especially when i am havin g periods and i stopped having periods this was caused by the men who attacked me238 in describing the psychological r effect s of sexual violence ms obaso explained the encounters of other women who did not appear befor the commission because of fear and humiliation as follows this sexual violence happened to many some women we re seriously violated they had bottles pushed up their priv ate parts and others had sticks pushed up into their private parts239 after witnessing the extent of the injury that her brother sustained his subsequent death and the fact that his remains had been eat by dogs 240told the commission i am traumatised i usually have bad dreams i keep seeing how my brother died in my dreams even as i speak i fear getting nightmares i get them every tim i narrate the story the day my brother was killed i wished i could d ie i walked on the road and i was almost knocked by car the witness also indicated that her neph ew the late brothers one ochieng was present when his father was being clobbered and mutilat ed he has since gone mad he keeps on saying dad they are chopping off ur thing to mean 236 cw 37 237 cw 17 238 cw 17 239 cw 17 240 cw 36 264penis 241some victims of sexual violence were raped in the prese nce of their family members situation that trauma tised them as well as the members of their families present during the ordeal after both she and her daughter were gang raped with her daughter beco ming pregnant and later having miscarriage witness told the commission that her children were traumatized something which the commission reviewed as huge understatement given the depth of the mu ltiple tragedies visited on victims of kenyas post election sexual violence another horror awaiting victims was the fe ar of and actual abandonment of rape victims by their husbands and even other family members which occasioned breakdown of families at time when the very least v ictim needed from those close to her was comfort instead of cast igation and additional loss witness from eldoret who recorded statement wi th investigators in eldoret on 6 august 2008 did not report or seek medical at tention after being gang raped for fear that her husband would beat and aban don her which he did anyway other witnesses who testified reported being kicked out of t heir homes or abandoned when their spouses heard they had been raped242 furthermore when the parents of 36 year old married kikuyu woman originally from eldama ravine with four children who had been raped by the kalenjin men who also killed her husband heard she had been gang raped and had contracted hiv aids she told the commission in testimony and in her statement that her imm ediate family started separating themselves from kujitenga m parents would not even use the same utensils that i used they extended t he same sort of treatment to my childrenmy brother name withheld even sharpened knife and threatened to kill and my children because we my childr and i were suffering from aids after i got separated from my family members i had been very lonely i decided to get myself partner person of similar hiv status so that we could help each other 243 241 cw 36 statement exhibit 36 242 as the commission was told by cw 15 and17 243 cw 37 statement exhibit 37 265in addition the commission heard from other witnesses about unwanted pregnancies including the cases of two 14 and 16 year old girls who had been raped after which they found themselves doubly burdened244 these are just few examples of the unbearable and li ngering consequences of the post election sexual violence that witnesses were courageous enough to recount and explain to the commission these same victims of gang rapes mutilation hivaids abandonment psychological trauma homelessness loss of property and violenceinduced poverty are in state of utter misery feeling isolated and lonely some still are in constant contact with this commissions psychological counsellor who assisted them when they spoke to its investigators and testified before the commission furthe rmore culture of distrust in state security agencies has been heightened now that their role s perpetrators is more widely known this also has contributed to the bro ader culture of impunity surrounding election related violence in kenya since the 1990s furthermore it means that victims of sexual violence are now probably even less likely to report the crimes against them given the response they received fro m some of the security agencies which were supposed to help them rather than attack or abuse them institutional and legal challenges to responding to sexual violence other matters affected the proliferation of sexual viol ence after the 2007 election coupled with the seemingly endless spread of post election violence in general thereby contributing to large and unne cessary number of deaths and injuries including injuries resulting from sexual violence as mentioned elsewhere in the commissions report the delay by government in responding to the violence when it be gan the failure to anticipate it the admission by officers in the public admi nistration and security forces of being overwhelmed and their lack of coordination in dealing with the violence all 244 see the testimonies and statements of cw 10 cw 17 and the statement taken by the cipev investigators on 30 july 2008 who decided she did not want to be part of the hearings 266meant that law and order increasingly broke down thereby inviting further spread of violence including sexual violen ce as the proprietor of the pepper tree restaurant in naivasha noted violence might have been controlled if security had been enhanced as it was in gilgil town where there w as heavy army presence this contrasted with neighbouring naivasha and nakuru where there was intervention of security agents leading to resultin g freeforall of uncontrolled violence the consequent spillo ver of the lack of government control manifested in roadblocks lack of securi ty and lack of transport all of which kept victims of sexual violence from ge tting timely medical care furthermore this had spillover effect in that many medical staff per sonnel were unable to get to work there were not enough trai ned individuals to assist victims and drugs often were in short supply in addition the lack of coordinated government pol icy whether agreeing to keep systematic figures concerning casual ties and incidences of sexual violence rather than ignoring it as well as not communicating instructions to hospitals and citizens that medical fees had been waived meant that some victims of sexual violence who could have received medical attention did not do so because they thought they would have to pay with money they did not have in spite of the above many institutions who had off icial responsibility to assist victims of postelection sexual vi olence offered invaluable humanitarian assistance the commission received evid ence of the remark able work of the kenya red cross society médecins sans frontières the nairob i womens hospital number of churches organizations who came to testify and others about which the commission still may be unaware some of these groups such as the kenya red cross provided first ai d tents food clothing and helped survivors reunite with their families while others suc h as the nairobi womens hospital served as front line facility which gave medical care and psychological support to victims of sexual violence an d engaged in fundraising so that they could offer their services to victims for free 267aside from the above and the commissions desire to dig d eep into the horrifying and life altering sexual violence that ffected kenyan women as well as some men the commission itself was challenged stymied by number of factors by definition its work depended on the in formation that victims and institutions were willing to share however for the reasons mentioned arlier many women and men did not want to speak about what had happened to them either in public or private whether because of shame fear distrust of authorities including us their inability to identify perpetrators or in contrast because of possible retaliation by th ose who had attacked them including people whom they knew others who had never received medical treatmen t or counselling worried about being traumatized again if they spoke of what had happened to them even some individuals who were courageous enough t come forth sometimes broke down in the course of stifying still others did not want to give evidence because of cultural sensit ivities that included discussing rape in public case in point is mombasa wh ere victims feared that they could be shunned and ostracized by their communi ties for having lost their virginity b f r m r r i g t h c m m i s s i n l s f c d l g i s t i c l p r b l m s i n f i n d i n g victims especially those who had fled to other areas or had left for unknown places after some idp camps were closed when government bega n its operation rudi nyumbani resettlement program fu rthermore given the limited time we had to collect evidence about sexual viol ence from victims the commission did not have enough time to verify whether some of what was h eard was specifically related to postelection violence or part of other crimes outside the commissions mandate an issue that was compounded because most victims did not report about the sexual violations that they suffered and most di d not receive medical treatment reports would have been means of verifyi ng their evidence further issue was that most women had little or inf ormation about what to do or where to go to report violations ag ainst them something compounded by the response of the police and indifference if not hostility to victims by communities themselves 268legal issues arising from sexual violence in conflict situations also present another set of challenges in terms of appropriate responses by government and others there is general agreement that sexual violence h as been used as weapon of war in most conflict situatio ns while kenya has ratified number of treaties prohibiting violence against women it either s not incorporated them into its laws or acted on those parts of the law tha t reflect them including chapter v of the constitution or the sexual offences act of 2006 others speak about other areas where there is an alleged legal lacun concerning aids and family protection areas where bills pe nding before parliament may assist however the commission is not of the opinion that sexual violence stemming from the post election breakdown occurred because of unresolved legal matters rather it is the result in part of the failure to enfo rce laws that have already been passed by parliament recommendations as result of the commissions focus on the sexual violence stemming from the post electoral violence following the 2007 election it r ecommends the following in the course of its inquiries the commission found that although the government hospitals had established gender violence recove ry centers gvrcs offering free medical services to victims of sexual violence victims of sexual violence mostly did not know they existed hence t the minimum the commission takes the view that citizens s h u l d b i n f r m d b u t t h m i n awareness campaigns something that is going on already in place s like mombasa and which will need to be replic ated in other parts of the country the commission also believes there need to establish gvr cs as departments in every public hospital with their own st aff facilities and budget currently the gvrcs fall under other depa r t m n t s n d r l n t h m f r f u n d i n g s w l l s personnel something that has reduced their prominence and bility to provide services 269in addition with some reservations the commission pro poses the creation of gender unitsections within every police station where victims of sexual violence can be treated with sensitivity and where their cases will b properly recorded and investigated currently the existing units are limited and do not entail any more than having female officer availabl to deal with female victims however for any such unit to be effective would require complete change in attitude within the security forces themselves including the police training the police how to handle cases of sexual violence and in first aid wou ld be of use only if mechanisms for accountability within the security forces th emselves are established and acted upon at the very least this would include police and other security person nel being severely punished for perpetrating crimes of sexual violence and being dismissed if they mishandled vict ims of sexual violence in short new units without new patterns of be haviour and new sanctions would be utterly useless the commission also encourage non governmental organizations ngos working in the health sector to partne r with medical institutions and share information to ensure swifter and im proved response to sexual violence the commission considers there is low level of awareness about the possibility of help that victims of sexual violence can receive further there pressure on the part of law enforcement to do the right thing whe n dealing with cases of sexual violence the commission therefore recommends th establishment under kenyan law of the office of rapporteur on sexual violence the responsibility of the rapporteur will be to highlig ht on continuous basis the fact that sexual violence is seriou s crime and needs an equally serious response on the part of law enforcement authorities the rapportuer should have an appropriate staff to assi st in the discharge of the functions of the office the rapportuer should be required and empowered to work wi th existing government institutions that address sexual violence including the courts the police and the national commission on gender the rapporteur should be required to present on an annual basis report to the national assembly outlining view on how during the year cases of sexual violence were handled 270that said in all societies sexual violence and how it is handled is reflective of the broader social and political culture in kenya the issue has been magnified because of the diffusion of electoral violence since the 1990s hence ordinary citizens including women but also men have been victims of the cannon fodder of violence perpetrated by politicians violence as whole consequently has grown unchecked has become increasing ly dispersed and is product of larger breakdown of order and lawlessne ss that came to head after the 2007 election in this context the commission was dismayed and shocked to hear in graphic detail about the unspeakable horr ors of sexual violence visited on the witnesses who spoke to it as well as the many women and gi rls and the men and boys who did not but in the end the commission was also not surprised as the sexual violence after the election was ju st one more unspeakable aspect of the violence that engulfed kenya following the 2007 election an d could do so again unless checked immediately 271chapter seven internally displaced persons introduction the point of discussing the plight of internally displ aced persons idps here is to make recommendations to promote and enhance their future protection idps have been defined as persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or leave their homes or places of habitual residence in particular as result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict situations of generalised violence violation of human rights or natura l or humanmade disaster and who have not crossed an internationally recognised state border245 idps are the human face of the problem caused by pev th extent to which the problem is or is not addressed will be the barometer by wh ich the government will be judged in addressing problems and effects of pev hence where possible the commission visited idp camps an d talked to idps specifically about their problems and experiences moreover most of th witnesses who interacted with the commission had some experience with some form or other of displacement hence the importance of ddressing the issue the commission went out of its way to hear the evidence from residents of idp camps and others who were displaced however given th mandate of the commission its scope was limited to idps from the pev the commission was made aware of the fact that internal displacement has been permanent feature of kenya hist ory from colonial times onwards starting with the eviction of natives from their ancestral land to make way for settlers in colonial kenya to recent violent evictions accompanying the 1992 1997 and 2002 election idps have been constant feature of the countrys political landscape even before the 2007 general elec tions there was already problem of population displacement as result of the f ollowing factors amongst others 245 francis deng the guiding principles on internal displacements ecn4199853add 1 february 11 new york ny united nations new york united nations 272a preelection violence in molo district246 b border and land disputes in pla ces like the sondu which is the confluence of three districts nyamira nyando and kericho occupied by the kisii lu and kipsigis respectively247 c cattle rustling and banditry in the pokottransnzoia transnzoiamarakwet district border d natural disasters such as drought in large parts of northern kenya that often lead to conflicts over natural resources like w ater leading to displacement248 these multiple causes of displacement make it very diffic ult to come up with accurate statistics concerning causs of displacement gender age social and economic standing this makes it diffic ult for both the government to devise comprehensive policies and intervention s to deal effectively with idps according to the government there were 35 0000 persons displaced as result of pev after the 2007 elections249 some of these already existing caus of population displacement were exacerbated by the pev particularly disturbing feature of the pev brought to our attention is that some of the idps have suffered succe ssive displacements as result of previous election related violence several wi tnesses testified that they had suffered multiple evictions in 1992 1997 2002 and 2007 extent of displacement resulting from the 2007 election related violence the commission toured various hotspots of violence and idp camps to get firsthand view of the extent of displace m n t s w l l t h r f r m t h i d p s themselves we heard testimony of aspects of flight and depar ture and the 246 evidence of rift valley pc mohammed noor there were skirmished reported in kuresoi division of molo district in august 2007 247 wilson njega dc kericho 248 testimony of mohammed noor 249 francis kimemia permanent secretary in charge of provincial administration and internal security office of the president exhibit 4a 273struggles endured at the camps it was sadly clear to the commission that internal displacement as form of viol ence has been permanent feature of the conflicts in kenya that have accompanied the transition from single party to multi party system the election related 1992 and 1997 ethnic clashes resulted in displacement of thousands of people according to the k iliku report an estimated 54000 people were displaced in the 1992 clashes250 the justice akiwumi led commission which was appointed in 1998 to inquire into the tribal clashes that rocked the country since 1991 did not make any fi ndings as to the number of persons displaced as result of the clashes either in 1992 or 1997251 the internal displacements following th widespread violence that hit the country after the announcement of the 2007 presidentia l election results were however unprecedented in terms of the number of victim s and the widespread nature of the phenomenon while previous conflicts led to in ternal displacements concentrated in the multi ethnic regions of we stern rift valley and coast the 2007 pev resulted in massi ve country wide forced displacements which were urban as well as rural in contrast to the past violent and sudden displacement from place one consid ers their home is often the worst form of loss entailing as it does sense of loss of self most of the idps the commissioners interacted with had other home apart from the place they were evicted displacement meant not only the loss of home but loss of friendships and other relationships eco nomic and personal built over many years dispersal of relatives loss of memories that constituted ones being that most of the displacement was violent in nature aggra vated the loss whatever interventions this commission pu rposes to alleviate the suffering of idps it regrettably cannot make up for the mental and p sychological trauma associated with displacement 250kiliku report exhibit 136a this figure did not include all the districts that were affected by the violence 251akiwumi report exhibit 134a 274 the sudden departure and flight by idps was necessary to pr otect lives in very exceptional but isolated cases idps succee ded in salvaging pr operty or other valuable possessions idps were subjected to violence and in ext reme cases members of families were split up and even mother lost her child during flight ab was 46 year old married woman with 9 children th ey were aged 19 years old to 2 ½ years old she origina lly lived in kipkaren and was businesswoman in eldoret town w hile her husband was in the matatu business in 1992 as result of the clashes her house was burnt and she lost all her merchandise and belongings despite this she managed to recover form the ordeal and rebuilt her life once again in 2002 she was attacked again and unfortunately her right hand and breast were burnt in 2007 her family wa s once again attacked her husband and older children managed to flee once the violence began on 28th december 2007 she stayed behind with her six younger children at night s ome men broke into her house rape d her and beat her she was once again burnt when the raiders poured on her the food she was cooking the following day she left her house with her six children but one got lost in the ordeal she had to walk up eldoret town where she was reunited with her three elder children she is now residing at the eldoret showground id p camp when asked what recommendations she had for the government ab said we would plead to the government to assist us because right now we have nowhere else to go w have nothing i dont have land i dont have any money to start business i cannot support myself in any way i have direction sometimes i wish i could just die but i r emember that i have children and if i die i do not know who i would leave my children with my children are the one who give 275strength they are the one who make live in this ear th if i was alone right now i would be dead by now in some other cases the departure of in dividuals stemmed from threats or the anticipation of violence however in mo st cases idps were forcefully evicted physically through violence against them and the destru ction of their property most idps left their homes under emerge ncy conditions not knowing where to go or their ultimate destination in certai n circumstances the idps left while under attack from marauding gangs of youth the most common destination was police station or administrati on police or chiefs camp church or trading centre which were considered secure other persons in distress h id in the bushes and forests until they felt it was safe to proceed to place of relative safety the commission was also told of instances where the general p ublic and the police were fully involved in the evacuati on and protection of idps individuals and institutions involved in protecting idps should to be co mmended since this was fraught with risk particularly during the time of intense violence according to bishop cornelius korir the cath olic bishop of eldoret diocese i asked the watchman of the church compound to open the door in case somebody needs to be rescued so we opened the do or and the people started coming in i did not know th ere was fire all over the place so by evening there was space here the chu rch was packed they slept inside we had the closing prayer n 31st evening which is 10 oclock to midnight there was spac for us but we said the prayers inside there was fighting ou tside by 1st january more people were coming 2nd there was space here even outside even where we were passing there was space people kept on coming and it was tough but it is now odm and pnu we were getting information people had been trapped so we did lot of evacuation we were evacuating people using ur lorries the goodness is that the elders were looking after the peopl 276especially after this church was burnt with people inside so of the people had gone in our churches in the interior parts and the elders could look after them feed them and there was fight b etween the youths and elders the youth want to finish the other group so the kalenjin elders had to look after them they were really harsh so we h d t d v c u t i n s f r s p l t u f r i n n d w w r u s i n g ourselves and the kenya red cross and the government duncan okore who was the officer in charge of the naivash maximum prison instructed his officers to open the doors of the prison c ompound on 31st december 2007 to women and children from naivasha town who came as result of threats of violence received it is important to note that at this stage incidents of violence had been reported in naivasha town according to the witness there were arrangements made to receive idps but despite this the original 40 to 50 idps mostly women and children were duly accommodated within the prison staff canteen and church from the 27th january 2008 the prison began to receive more idps who number peaked to about 10000 on 2nd february 2008 subsequently the kenya red cross society t he catholic church medicin sans frontiers world vision came to make n assessment and provided humanitarian assistance idps had to find safe means of transport as well as sa fe passage to the camps once again ordinary individuals and public officers acted admirably in providing safe passage for idps of special mention is the role of the kenya armed forces who in their statutory duty of aid to civilian authority252 provided safe passage by clearing roads providing security and ferrying idps to safe and secure places settlement conditions in idp camps the idps fled to the nearest places which they considered safe these were mainly located in churches trading centre s chiefs camps administration police 252 testimony of general kianga chief of general staff kenya armed forces cw 7 277camps and police stations in many areas the camps in which the idps initially settled were the subject of attack or threats of attack by criminal gangs and marauding youth this phenomenon was pa rticularly evident in the north rift valley and in nakuru further characteristic of these camps was that they wer ethnically divided reflecting the ethnic divisions at the time in nakuru w hen the violence erupted the idps were initially taken to the police quarters at k asarani and the central police station and thereafter relocated to one of two camps the dc testified that when the non kikuyu idps were taken to the nakuru ask s howground camp they were rejected by the idps there and had to be moved depending on their ethnicity idps opted to go to one of two camps the luos luhyas kisiis and few kalenjin were accommodated at th afraha stadium idp camp while the mostly kikuyu idps chose to proceed to the nakuru ask grounds only kisiis n d d u p i n b t h c m p s t h f r m r c m p c m p r i s d m i n l n k u r u t w n residents while in the latter idps came in from other parts of the rift valley coincidentally this situation mirrored the prevailing po litical situation253 in naivasha the two main camps established were also ethn ically divided the kedong camp consisted mainly of luos luhyas and kalenji ns who were mainly displaced flower farm workers working in naivasha while the naivasha stadium camp consisted of kikuyus displaced from other parts of rif t valley254 security initially idp camps were set up on an ad hoc basis without any planning the first port of call was in areas which were considered sec ure for settlement these included police stations admini stration camps trading centres and churches however because these camps were set up in an ad hoc fashion 253 testimony of gordon ogolla chairman law society nakuru commission witness 47 also testimony of wilson wanyanga dc nakuru cw 44 254evidence of lukas m katee cw 33 and also willy lugusa ocpd naivasha cw 34 278security soon became major concern with numerous threa ts of attack coming from the outside255 illustrative of this situation is the testimony of angelu s karuru the officer commanding police division ocpd of eldoret during the skirmishes we were ferrying people f rom the interior to various police stations and churches there were various idp camps at the time we had one at the divisional headquart ers which is at the police station holy family catholic church we had an other one soi police station there was also another one kipkabus there w as another one and also at iten police station when we realized that these people were almost being attacked in these camps t hey requested to be moved to safer place and that is wh we started moving them to one central place for ease of protection the former rift valley provincial poli ce officer told us the locals around kaptagat wanted to attack the idps who had sought safety at kaptagat police station the ocs broke all protocol an d called the ppo directly and told him afande send reinforcement these people are going to ki ll us here the ocs managed to negotiate with the gangs surrounding the statio n who allowed the ocs to give safe passage to the idps camped at the station idps in most camps organised themselves into representati ve committees to access services security and other matters young n were mobilised in what is commonly referred to as vigilante groups to provide security within the camps256 another security problem was that individuals who had to seek food water or other services outside the camps here we received reports that some women were victims of violence when they sought food or wat er outside the camp257 255 for example threat of attacks by gangs of youth to idps at mogotio police station as per testimony of mr stephen ikua dc mogotio 256 the commission visited the nakuru ask ground camp and the naivasha town idp camp which had constituted committees 257 george wachira commission witness 13 exhibit 23b titled women paying the price sexual and gender based violence during the 2007 post ͳelection conflict in kenya 279survival and sustenance as stated earlier most idps had to leave their home w ith nothing except the clothes on their back the situation wa s aggravated during the height of the violence when basic services were not available and the pply lines were blocked the idps depended mainly on relief food and basically had way of earning living during the initial stages of the violence there were conc erted efforts by both local and international ngos and well wishers to provi food water and other basic needs to the residents in idp camp s however as the violence subsided the burden of providing sustenance to the idps was left m ainly to the government and the red cross the idps complained that the food rations were drastically reduced258 access to other facilities evidence presented indicated that access to basic facilitie s such as medicalhealth services education soci and economic services was generally more difficult for idps and their families than it was in general due to the violence being experienced at the time lot of rape vi ctims and those who were hiv did not have access to essential medical services initially idps had to settle at police stations dos offices and administration police and chiefs camps which while secure were ill suit ed in other ways witness described the situation at the naivasha police sta tion on 29th january 2008 in the following terms when we arrived at the police station what i saw was sea of people it was packed with so many people on arrival every body was calling sister we are here we have been here for the last two days without food the children are cold can you get us help there 258 testimony of peter kariuki chair of the nakuru idp committee 280was cry from all over you can imagine the crowd and ever ybody is trying to state their needs i also decided to also talk to the deputy ocs and the first thing which i saw was children wh were so dehydrated and i learnt that there was water bec ause the tank which was there was empty i dont know when water had been brought to the camp so the first thing was to try to find out who owned tha t so that we can mobilize to get water i was told it belonged to erian flower farm which is around the lake and i got some contac ts to call later i got driver and the police promised security so that we can b able to get water so i asked the parish whether they c an allow us to draw water from the borehole to bring to the police station because what i saw was so pathetic so that is what we did i got security to escort the truck and then the driver arrived to go and bri ng us water i also called the dc that same morning and asked for meeting with him because i wanted to find out who were the actors on the ground trying to bring humanitarian services and how can we come in and if there was anything we could do to ease the suffering of th ose people so when we met with him he said that the red cross were already on the ground we told him that we were concerned about the women and children and we have hall in the parish and i f we could evacuate the women and children to the catholic parish h all where there is water and sanitation because the situation at the poli ce station was deplorable at that point there were toilet s and you can imagine with so many people at the camp centres ad hoc schools were set up for displaced children but they were hardly equipped to handle students most camps had education facilities for young children but the older pr imary and secondary school children presented greater challenge259 due to the existence of free primary school 259 testimony of peter kariuki cw 49 281education it was easier to have children admitted to t he nearest primary schools hence for example children fr om the nakuru ask grounds were readily admitted to the neighbouring lena na moi and prison primary schools260 police response as the influx of idps was neither anticipated nor for eseen there were very few officers police or administrative to guar d the idps hence decisions had to be made to move the idps to larger more secure camps in urban areas in any event it is understandable that during the time most s ecurity officers had been involved in election and related duties as one witness st ates our officers were bit tired because the campaign period h ad been long and they were covering and again there was holida in between which they were alert especially the christmas and boxi ng day and they were also covering the election day at polli ng stations they were there at the counting and tallying of parlia mentary and presidential votes in all polling stations within the district and their efforts were mainly diverted towards evacuation and saving lived immediately after the incident261 quite apart from the lack of security to protect convoys of idps the initial movement of idps was hindered by blockage of roads by mena cing gangs and lack of adequate means transport as we have noted earlier initial idp ca mps were set up with in police stations which were wholly unsuited for holding large groups of pe ople262 subsequently more formal camps were set up as the vi olence stabilised perimeter fences and security lights were provided in most of the camps with number of police officers also patrolling the camps espe cially at night however the general 260 exhibit 49a 261 adan gedow dc kipkelion district cw 68 262 see also the evidence augustine nthiga ocpd kisii central cw 110 there wasnt enough space at kisii police station to accommodate arriving idps 282complaint was that there were an inadequa number of police officers to provide sufficient security to the idps in camps263 government organisation on 4th february 2008 the kenya national di alogue and reconcil iation mediated by h kofi annan with the panel of eminent african p ersonalities issued statement which

to information regarding the assistance that is avai lable to them and how to access it for example support for reconstruction of livelihoods or tracing of family members operationalise the humanitarian fund for mitigatio n of effects and resettlement of victims of post 2007 election violence expeditiously by establishing bipartisan multisectoral board with streamlined procedures to disburse funds rapidly f the fund is open to public contributions and all cit izens and friendly countries governments and international institu tions to donate generously g ensure close linkages with the ongoing national and international assistance to enhanc the effectiveness of delivery h ensure that victims of violence in urban areas are not neglected in the implementation of the above i in order to promote food security displaced farmer s should be assisted to return to their farms all farmers affected by the crisis should be assisted and encouraged to safely resume thei r farming activities the coordinating agency for matters concer ning idps in kenya is the ministry of state for provincial administration and internal security through the disaster and emergency response coordination partment there is also the ministry of state for special programmes msp264 while kenya has specific policies and interventions to deal with the problems of idps it lack s legal framework 264 report on the role of the ministry in relation to the post election violence forwarded to the commission letter dated 20th august 2008ref opsp3552a 284governing the issue of idps hence number of issues re dealt with in an ad hoc manner in january 2008 the ministry for special programmes established the mitigations and resettlement department the department assists idps in resettling and return to their former li velihoods this involves amongst others the following activities reconstructions and rehabi litation of destroyed homes profiling provision of transportation construction f social amenities and provision of food the humanitarian fund for mitigation of effects and resettlement of victims of post2007 election violence265 is also managed by the msp the government formed the advisory board for the na tional humanitarian fund for the mitigation of effects and resettlement of victims of post 2007 election violence266 the government injected an initial amount of kshs 1 bil lion in to the fund and is expected to raise money from other donors the purpose of the fund is to among other things provide exgratia funding for 1 as part of its work the resettlement of persons displace d as result of post2007 election violence 2 the replacement of basic household effects destroyed as result of 2007 pev 3 enabling the victims of the post 2007 election violence restart their basic livelihood 4 the reconstruction of basic housing re habilitation of communities utilities and institutions destroyed as result of the 2007 pev msp drafted the national disaster manage ment policy in april 2007 the policy deals with myriad of disasters and is not specifically focused on the problems of idps there is currently national disaster operations ce ntre whose role is to coordinate disaster management267 265 legal notice 11 of 2008 dated 30th january 2008 266 gazette notice 1038 of 15th february 2008 267 testimony of dr hezron nyangito ps ministry of medical services cw 28 285 dr sam thenya the director of nairob i womens hospital speaking of his interaction with the centre stated as follows without giving excuses the post election violence caught us ll unawares but the general response was that when we call ed on the national disaster management committee or whatever they are called they asked us what did we expect them to do and my understanding would be they would be telling us what to do the obvious conclusion from that interact ion is that there exists gap in the level of response to disasters including one that makes specific reference to problems related to idps at the district level we found that most areas had di saster management committee constituted to deal with the humanitarian issu related to pev while initial arrangements were usually made by the dc an d the dsci they also set up committees to deal with idps but the membership f those committees was fluid and varied from district to district augustine kimantirie nthiga the ocpd kisii central district gave an ccount of how arrangements were made when we started receiving idps the dsic met and we d iscovered we needed to have the people close ranks in kisii so we calle d the businessmen the medical practitioners and the disaste r management committee we also called church elders for those who could have knowledge of counselling because those who were arriving were giving different stories and we felt that they required couns elling so we called and formed lots of committees also subcommittees to feed idps who were arriving with nothing in nakuru the district commissioner gave evidence that t he disaster committee was composed of government officials the nakuru business asso ciation membership local and international ngos led by the kenya red cross society and the churches 286 special mention must be made of the kenya red cross soci ety the kenya red cross society was the lead coordinatin g agency for relief and humanitarian efforts throughout the pev period t up by an act of parliament it nevertheless operates independently and in conformity with the principles of the red cross movement268 their efforts and those of their volunteers must be recognised and commended we also wish to commend the eff orts of various international and local ngos who stepped up to the call to assist kenyans in distress government response to idp crisis the intensity of the pev confronted the government with rare dilemma about how to approach the displacements that were occurring the re were reports exhibits and testimonies from authorities on the governm ents lack of preparedness to deal with the initial idp crisis the gene ral consensus among government officials was that whereas vi olence after the general election was anticipated the magnitude of the violen ce was not and was overwhelming this problem notwithstanding the government success or failure to deal with the pev crisis will be judged by the number of idp camps standi ng during the commissio ns consultations and hearings two groups of idps with competing or divergent interests emerged those in camps and t hose who had been reintegrated within various communi ties because of their visibility the problems of those in camps could easily be identified and dealt with further mobilisation among those in camps was mu ch easier as evidenced by the fact that most camps we visited had constituted representative groups on the other hand the reintegrated idps were dispersed not easily identifiable and because of their dispersal they could not easily be found to present their grievances 268 chapter 256 of the laws of kenya during the pev period the kenya red cross society issued periodical bulletins on the prevailing humanitarian situation these are available at wwwkenyaredcrossorg 287 the government asserted the constitutional right of every k enyan to acquire property and live in any part of the coun try hence its policy on resettlement was largely governed by this principle for example the dc of kipkelion testified that it was not the intention of the government to move people from their homes or from their farms269 clearer statement of the government policy came from the dc of naivasha mr katee in the following verbatim exchange mr david majanja there was information that it is government policy to transport people back to their an cestral homes is that the position mr katee mwanza yes my lord at least at the time although the transport was not there we were saying that as governme nt we will look like we have been defeated by the situation by saying says move out then we assist person b to move out we are sayin g as government we are agreeing with what the says so in this we would have looked very bad and we start now transportin g people from outside naivasha while these people my lord you know some of them have been here for more than 20 30 years they have been w orking here they earn their livelihood to kick these people out to take them to rural area where there is source of livelihood then you are pushing them into grave without any alternative mr david majanja so it is the government policy to take them back where they were removed mr katee mwanza it is the government policy to take them back where they were removed indeed that is why my lord i requested kedong ranch which is private organisation to give us pa rt of their land so that we could construct the tents for our people we knew 269 adan gedow dc kipkelion 288these people provided labour for the flower farms they so earn some revenue now to take them to kisumu would mean th end of the road the general perception amongst the idps was that the g overnment was keen to resettle those who had land hence there was great expect ation that idps would be resettled by being given land this is captured by the sen timents of the nakuru ask idps who recommended that the government firstly relocates the idps to some safe area until lasting solution is fo und the government should use the ksh 10000 it is offering to idps to purchase piece of land for them as stop gap measure270 the main challenge for resettlement is to guarantee secur ity in areas from which idps were displaced and help them reconstruct of their lives one witness stated that that the reasons idps do not want to go back is that if they went back their neighbours are the same people who killed t hem they cannot go and stay in tent because an arrow can penetrate the t ent271 the success of this effort would largely depend on peac and reconciliation efforts for the idps who remain in camps the problem of reset tlement continues even upto now according to witness mr peter kariuki who was at the material time the chairman of ask ground nakuru idp camp the camp had about 10200 people comprising the following 10 were land owners 60 were tenant farmers 25 businessmen and women and 5 squatters272 obviously it would be easy to identify and assist indi viduals needing to be resettled on their own property once level of security was guaranteed however finding solutions for the remaining 90 is more difficult other than paying them outright the government would need to find ways to assist t hem including providing start up capital on concessionary terms 270 exhibit 49a 271 john mwangi cw 41 272 exhibit 49a 289the reintegrated idps also face problems as illustrate d by the evidence of ms asha katheri kiva273 who was the borabu district commissioner just after the election she testified her district situated along the v olatile kisiisotik border received few idps who went to camps in keroka however it was clear from subsequent witnesses that most idps from the sotik side f the border who were predominantly kisii were easily accommodated by family and friends274 they were initially given food rations by the government wh the violence started but further interventions were made despite various entreaties to the government to look into their plight similarly the mo st of the kipsigis displaced during the skirmishes along the sotikbo rabu border did not proceed to camps but were housed by their neighbours and relatives275 at the peak of the pev nyanza province received 129821 idps the provincial commissioner told the us that they were popularly known as returnees that is people from nyanza province who were coming back to nyanza presumably because they had been ejected from other provinces or th ey feared to continue staying in other provinces they are not in camps they are living with their relatives and friends some have hired places to stay in the province the pc gave testimony that to assist these returnees he had to give blanke t orders that their children be admitted to school immediately in april 2008 the government engaged in operation rudi nyumbani operation return home the aim of the operation was to encourage the idps to return to their homes as part of operation rudi nyumbani the following interventions were made276 payment of kshs 1000000 to persons leaving the camp provision of transport to home areas 273 commission witness 113 274 private witness commission witness 122 according to the witness these idps numbering about 400 in nyansiongo had formed an association to pursue their interests 275 mr humphrey nakitare commission witness 112 276 exhibit 4a 290 relocation to transitional camps near er farms and areas of displacement while awaiting provision of proper housing provision of building materials provision of seed fertilizer and ploughing services the commissioners visited rth kisii farm in geta sub sublocation of cherengany division of trans nzoia east district277 according to evidence received on 2nd january 2008 hundreds of armed youth invaded the farm an d burnt over 100 houses two people were so shot dead with poisoned arrows the farm residents abandoned their homes for temporary campment at the neighbouring trading centre278 by the time the commissioners visited the farm most of the residents had been resettled by the governmen t which provided construction materials ploughing facilities fertilizers and seed they residents were expecting the sum of kshs 1000000 to be paid s hortly thereafter the residents of that farm were on the wholly satisfied with the measures taken by the government to deal with their plight according to the government as at 8th july 2008 210594 idps had been resettled leaving 21431 in camps the resettlement progr amme cost the government an estimated kshs 30 billion because of time limitations we were unable to assess the verall success efficacy and other matters related to operation rudi nyumbani however certain complaints stand out firstly the sum of kshs 10000 given per family is too little given the losses suffered by the idps we also rece ived reports from idps that they had choice but accept the resettlement th ey also indicated that this was used as means of getting the idps to leave the cam ps this took the form of coincidence between the launch of the program and shortage in basic 277 the commissioners visited geta farm on 9th august 2008 the commissioners also visited endebess idp camp 278 exhibit 73 291amenities such as water and the intention and scheduled cl osure of camps have left idps choice but accept the government handouts279 conclusion and recommendations as we have stated previously the subject of idps is t new phenomenon in kenya it is not one that neither cks political recognition nor prescribed solutions indeed the african peer review mechanism aprm country report of the republic of kenya280 prepared in may 2006 recognised the problem we quote the relevant paragraphs of the report aprm country review report of the republic of kenya 319 objective 9 to promote and protect the righ ts of vulnerable groups including internally displaced persons refugees and disabled persons i summary of the country selfassessment report csar internally displaced persons regarding the internally displaced persons who are forced to migrate from their natural locations due to clashes the report reveals that in contrast to refugees they lack adequate relief support nd security and only receive occasional food and blankets fro m politicians without any follow up in addition there is resettlement or economic programmes to aid them vulnerable groups in the report were characterized as tho groups marginalised from the mainstream society and due to years of neglect do not fit into society at political economic or social level the report asserts that this grou p is numerically minority and identifies the yaaku galjeel ogiek and endoris in thi s regard the yakus were evicted from the forest where they had been be tter protected during the screening of somalis the galjeel had t heir identity cards confiscated were asked by police to leave fo r somalia and as the report indicates were also attacked by security forces in august 2005 the ogiek have lodged lawsuit to resist th governments decision to evict them from their ancestral homes the 279 visit to naivasha show ground idp camp and nakuru ask idp camp testimony of peter kariuki commission witness 49 also testimony of commission witness 152 280 at page 111 ͳ117 also available at httpwwwnepadorg2005filesaprmaprmkenyareportpdf 292report states that little protecti on or special polices have been designed to address the needs of these vulnerable groups ii findings of the country review mechanism crm internally displaced persons idps the crm visit to nyeri provincial headquarters confirmed tha t idps were scattered in the rift valley districts of kirinyaga t hika and muranga and resided in the slums government resettlement policy or development programmes had been put in place at provincial level and after the clashes the district leade rs had encouraged the idps in the absence of any resettlement measu res to go back to their former dwellings the inaction di splayed by the district leadership in integrating the idps into the mainstr eam society has implications for longterm reconciliation of ethnic groups in kenya and poses challenge fo r unity and nation building the lack of concerted central government policies and interven tions to alleviate the plight of certain segmen ts of society following conflict is likely to be taken advantage of at the local level to the detriment of vulnerable groups like idps iii recommendations the panel recommends the following the government of kenya to enact and implement clear p olicy on refugees and internally displaced persons government of kenya further review of the implementation of the aprm for the period june 2006 june 2008281 in respect of promotion and protec tion of the rights of vulnerable groups including internally displace persons and refugees add ressed the issue as follows 310 objective nine promotion and protection of the rights of vulnerable groups including internally displaced persons and refugees the government through various poverty reduction progra mmes such as hivaids asal programmes and educational bursary funds has focused n mainstreaming the vulnerable groups including orphans of hivaids the youth women the physically challenged older persons and the ageing to participate fully in nation development agenda 281 kenya progress report on the implementation of the african peer review mechanism aprm national programmed of action june 2006 june 2008 293this objective called for mechanisms to protect the right s of the vulnerable groups through i enactment and implementation of policies and programmes imed at empowering and protecting the rights of vulnerable grou ps ii stepping up security and strengthening response capaci ty of law enforcement agencies in conflict prone areas iii streamlining immigration screening procedures and elimin ating discriminatory screening practises the government has also achieved the following it has introduced development interventions programme in t he north rift districts to compliment the disarmament programme during the year 2006 07 it has promulgated the refugees act 2006 into law on 30th december 2006 this provides for the recognition protection and management of r efugees within the country it has given the concern about the problem of squatters and internally displaced persons and as followup of the planning in the period 2 00607 ksh 13 billion has been set aside in the 200708 fiscal year to acquir land for settling them with allocation of land parcels those affected are expected to improve their living standards increase food safety and be able to share in t he growth of the country following the post election crisis kenya found itself with an unprecedented number of idps including children women and people with disabilities t he government in response to this established 181 idp camps located in various parts of t he country to accommodate the 350000 displaced persons the following measures have been undertaken in respect to the postelection idps with the help of the red cross the government provided fo od drugs including arvs clothing blankets and other requirements to t he idps the president the prime minister and members of the cab inet visited the idps restoration of security in the affected areas resettlement of 106651 of idps by mid may 2008 the government has raised kshs 457 million out of the req uired ksh 31 billion for the resettlement of idps as proposed in the national recon ciliation and emergency social and economic recovery nreser plan the government has urged members of parliament and local l eaders to preach and promote peace among affected communities from the evidence we have gathered so far there exists suff icient basis for enacting clear policy and legal framework for dealing wi th the idps282 moreover the guiding principles on idps provide the n ecessary parameters for such policy and legislative intervention s the guidelines oblige state parties to ensure protection of and assistance to id ps in all phases of displacement while there are coordinating organs for dealing with emergency situations it is now 282 report from office of the high commissioner for human rights fact finding mission to kenya 6 ͳ28 2008 recommendation 7 at p18 exhibit 21n 294imperative to put the problem of idps on sound statutory footing where lines of authority and responsibilities are assigned there is reason why such an enactment cannot be put in place within the next fo ur months and we so recommend secondly we think that the statemen t issued by the kenya dialogue and reconciliation on 4th april 2008 provides sufficient basis for providing benchmark for the needs of those displace d by pev an urgent evaluation needs to be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the current programs in place to address the plight of idps such proces s needs to be carried out in an open and transparent manner involving all the stakeholders w recommend the process commences immediately as the problem of idps has been with us for ages and is not going to be wiped out with magic wand we recommend that the issue be subm itted to the justice and reconciliation commission for follow up lastly we conclude that the successful return of idps will be based on three outcomes namely the safety of returnees restitution and return of property to the displaced and the creation of an eco nomic social and po litical environment that sustains them there is clearly consensus that unl ess the root causes that led to internal displacement are reso lved the problem of displacement will continue to haunt us for long time and that is the d uty of every kenyan 295chapter eight the media and the post election violence before during and after the elections politicians government ngos members of the media itself and parts of the pu blic all had views about whether and how the spread of information through the print and broadca st media had contributed to the 2007 po st election violence the commission asked number of individuals to testify before it concer ning the role of the media in the post election violence the commission therefore invited the permanent secretary f rom the ministry of information and communications the atto rney general and the chair of the editors guild who also is the managing editor of the nation group to testify before it to solicit their views furthermore numb er of members of the public who were victims or witnesses to the postelection violence outlined their experiences to the commission both in fo rmal testimony and in other statements to its investigators many recalled with horror fear and disgust the negative nd inflammatory role of vernacular radio stations in th eir testimony and statements to the commission in particular th ey singled out kass fm as having contributed to climate of hate negative ethnicity and havi ng incited violence in the rift valley however there were also similar complain ts in other parts of the country even though they did not come directly to the attention of the commission these included the vernacular music and negati ve ethnicity allege dly coming from kikuyu fm stations including kameme inooro coro and others in other different parts of the country this was ntioned critically in various sections of exhibit 125 the knchrs report on kenyas post 2007 election violence dr bitange ndemo the permanent secretary of the ministry of information and communications testified before us he told the commissio n that the media had been controlled by the state formally from the 1930s until the mid 1990s he explained that as kanu still was in power up to 2002 the expanding media 296continued to be subject to harassment torture imprisonm ent and fines for expressing their views censorship and lf censorship also ensued stemming from fear of reprisals by the state dr ndemo told us that various media outlets continued to voice the views of the ruling party kanu as late as the 1990s even following the 1991 repeal of section 2a of the constitution and the return to multi party democracy in kenya the wi tness noted that only after the 2002 election did the government engage in process of liberaliza tion this included licensing many new stations something he told us that posit ively affected all parts of the media however the witness mentioned that these changes took pl ace in the absence of new regulatory and legislative framework leading to so mething of an uncontrolled free for all in dr ndemos vi ew some media took advantage of this lacuna and began to operate freely an d sometimes recklessly and irresponsibly including using individuals who were not trained journalists who were partisan and sometimes were politically biased in his statement to us he argued that media houses took sides in the run up to the 2007 elect ion that there were complaints that most editors had been compromised and that some media houses became sensational and unnece ssarily alarmed their audiences and inflamed their passions he told the commission that the live broadcast of vote tallying of the 2007 election results at the kicc and the visible acrimony of political leaders inflamed tensions bringing the cou ntry to the brink faced with an unprecedented outbreak of violence following the announcement of the presidential results and threats of more violence the witness said the ministry asked the media houses to desist from li ve broadcasts concerning politics even though the ministry itself had way of fully enforcing its demand legally instead in the end it was the ministry of internal security which told the ministry of information it wanted to invoke section 88 of the kenyan communications act to which the latter complied in h is testimony to the commission amos wako kenyas attorney general stated emphatically that the ban was not proper was unconsti tutional and definitely illegal an opinion he conveyed in writing to the above ministries 297the commission also heard from the ps of the ministry of information and communications that it found itself cons trained to control fm media content at the height of the postelection violence as reputable media outlets around the world used headlines like hate radio sp reads new wave of violence in kenya after banning live political broadcasts by the media on 31 december 2007 the ps told the commission they were criticiz ed and resisted by the newspapers the witness explained to the commission that th ministry felt it was being criticized unfairly on all sides initially for not having done anyth ing to curb all the hate radio later admitting the ministry has the power to license and cancel them even though the ministry had reprimanded some of the wors t offenders and then later for banning live political broadcasts which t he ministry also felt was fuelling violence dr ndemo told the commission that he believed the action s taken by his ministry were in good faith and with the overriding national interest in mind he also said that there was need for legislative fr amework governing the mediaunderscored by media misconduct during the postelectio n violence nevertheless he noted that the ministry has continued to work with the existing media council established under the dia act and also has variety of informal forums through which it interacts with the media in addition the commission heard testimony from machari gaitho chairman of the kenya editors guild he told us that while the media had been accused of playing part in fanning the post ection violence the accusations were not specific and in his opinion came from va rious sides of the political spectrum which were aggrieved because they felt th ey were not supported by the media he disagreed with dr ndemo concerning the alleged partisanshi p of the media claiming it was very diverse also statin g that there was nothing wrong in taking sides or positions as long as that was ma clear to the reader contrary to the ps he thought the media had played very critical ro in lessening tensions in fact he told us that in his opinio n the media had acted very responsibly by not airing the many inflammatory statements made by politicians designed to incite people later he expl ained that it might have been better if the media d 298aired more rather than fewer inflammato ry statements by politicians who then would have been exposed to the public for who they were mr gaitho also reminded us that the media had used discretion in what it printed and also noted that the ban ad vocated by the ps of information and communications against the media was ev entually declared illegal noting people were talking about going to war people were ta lking opening about resisting and civil war and all those kinds of things some of those statements from very senior political leaders may h ave slipped thought but i would say 90 of them were caught bef ore they were aired or publishedwe are seeing situation where politi cians create problem politicians promote violence politician s incite the people and then when things do not go their way the start to blame the media that ban as we all know was unconstitution it was illegal the editors guild joined up with the media i nstitute and went to court and just before the hearing the attorney general the government revoked the ban and we went back to live br oadcasting and what was not acknowledged during that period is the role very positive role the media played in calming tensions in contrast to the ps of information and communications mr gaitho argued that cutting off live broadcasts from the kicc concernin g the results of the election contributed much more to raising tension than continuing those broadcasts because then people starte d wondering what is happening the witness explained to the commission that the editors gu ild also supported legislation against hate speech although he was not in favor of clamping down totally against fm stations the commission received testimony and other statements from number of individuals who included government fficials victims of the violence and witnesses to it in particular they singled out kass fm kalenjin language fm station for escalating the climate of and inciting violence phenomenon that apparently occurred on other fm stat ions in other parts of the country too witnesses made specific reference to kass fm they claimed kass fm in conjunction with politicians used deroga tory language against kikuyus mouthed 299hate speech and routinely called for thei r eviction thereby helping to build up tensions that eventually exploded in violence dr bitange ndemo submitted to the commission of letters and internal memos his ministry had received from two past ors one voicing concern about the kass fm breakfast show lee nee emeet on 19 february 2007and another on 29 november 2007 complaining about variou s aspects of kiss fm classic fm and easy fm including their promotion of ethnic tension n 26 november 2007 dr ndemo wrote back to the first letter writer with c c to the media council of kenya stating that we are equally appalled by the presentations in various fm stations and as per the law we can only complain to th media council we have therefore forwarded your letter to the media council later on 12 february 2008 the media monitoring unit in the ministry alerted him that some individuals are circulating mail messages which are threat to law an d order as well as peaceful coexistence between kalenjins and kikuyus the email of 18 january 2008 attached to the memo called the law which allows all kenyans to live in any part of the country legal error in our the kalenjins history it also argued that kalenjin have been systematically ma rginalized in terms of education the distribution of social serv ices and infrastructure unemployment and called for the community to defend ourselves to the bitter end urging our people t ensure that every family is fully equipped with our norm tools if we can afford ferry two warriors from upcountry fully armed and house them until we have this thing sorted out correspondence submitted to the commission by the ministry of information and broadcasting from mayaugust 2008 containing few letters between the ministry and the media council internal memos within th ministry and between the ministry and the national peace forum princip ally focuses on kass fm but also mention luo station named nam lol we and kikuyu fm vernacular radio station inooro fm which the ministry thought could entice more youth to join the sect mungiki that continue s to pose security challenges to the country with respect to kass fm the ministry found the intern ational transcript from 2 may 2008 was inci ting the public to violence and 300communicated its views to the media coun cil in august after having used firm also hired by undp earlier to monitor kass fm in the run up to the december 27 2007 election the medi council decided that kass fm was innocent of the charges of airing and in citing and inflammatory live broadcasts on 31 may and 16 june 2008 but was fo und to be negligent in the way it handled its discussions with its callers the attorney general wrote to the ps in the ministry of information and planning on 17 july saying that it believed kass fm had breached the provisions of the media act 2007 and specifically clause ii section of the second schedule at the local level the district commissi oner for koibatek in the central rift valley testified to the commission that t he vernacular radio stations did not do service to this country and said i have not heard any vernacular station condemning the violence we had in this country h t l d u s h k n w t h message was not very good but admitted not having monitored the radio stations to find out what they were actu ally saying since he did not understand kalenjin he admitted that he did not ve specific examples of what actually was said either by kass fm or by chan gey fm the two vernacular stations in his area nevertheless adding that it is common knowledge that this is what happened referring to the hate and inciteme nt allegedly propagated by kass fm in our view the dcs failure to monitor the stati ons and obtain transcripts from them to substantiate allegations made concerning what they said and what activities they were engaged in meant that we were ble to substantiate his views bernard kinyua the dc for uasin gishu in the north rift described similar scenario when asked under cross examination whether any inci ters were arrested any complaints were made or any action taken nce he became aware of the problem he told us i think the inciters were many we had the media radios and such are not institutions that we were in posi tion to deal with adding we did not complain about the media we did not complain about the 301general incitement that was there because it was obvious it was very clear that there were outbursts by politicians during campaigns to compensate for the above lack of hard data the comm ission itself attempted to obtain tapes of some fm radio stations from vari ety of sources beginning with the ministry of information and co mmunications in his testimony to the commission dr ndemo said he would pr ovide the commission with tapes from the ministrys monitoring from kass fm from october 2007 until march 2008 the commission did receive some selected tapes from the nistry but only starting from 18 february 2008 our vari ous attempts to obtain tapes from other sources were also unsuccessful these included unmet reques ts for tapes or transcripts from fm vernacular stations to strategic relations and research limited firm contracted by the undp to monitor the media during the 2007 election the communications council of kenya cck and the knchr the result is that the commission was unable to acquire any ta pes or transcripts by kass fm or other fm vernacular stations from before during or immediately after the 2007 election hence to some extent the commis sions situation is not dissimilar to that of the dc for koibatek it heard m any allegations of what was said but it does not have the actual transcripts of who said exactly what during this very critical period beyond this one transcript the commission received from t he ministry of information and communication kass fm s broadcast on 18 february 2008 said various organizations were already conducting investigations into the post election violence it exhorted listeners to be cautious to whom they spoke about these matters it suggested that just speaking to anyone wit hout knowing who they are might cause them problems or be incriminating an d that it might be better for them to tell those who wanted information t see the chief or some other opinion leader rather than answering questions th emselves as it noted you may answer question whose answer will in future spell doom for you be very careful and refer the investigators to political leaders chiefs or church leaders to answer the questions also it told his listeners you may be asked to 302explain how neighbour of yours left his farm or proper ty and then you answer in manner that will later place you in an awkward position i am not saying you conceal the truth but tell the truth if you have been appointed to undertake that particular duty because not everybody should talk some of you may be offered money for information and then tomorrow you are in very difficult situation it added that given the way the country is now nobody lik you pleading with listeners to be careful noting that t everybody who is investigating is doing so in good faith some will be doing so to incriminate some particular people or co mmunity in theviolence the media monitoring unit in the minist ry of information and communication in memo it passed on to the commission recommended that kass fm should be held to explain why they are barring members of the commun ity from disclosing whatever they know about the post election violence they also noted that the truth and reconciliation commission and other agencies interested in knowing the truth on what happened in the runup to the decembe r general election and the resultant post elections violence will not receive co operation of the members of the community at all adding so what is the station hiding some few exceptions to the above generali zation of concrete information are two examples of fm hate speech the commission received ne from bahasha f m i n n k u r u r c r d d t 8 m n 3 0 j n u r 2 0 0 8 n d r c i v d b t h knchr notes kikuyu are like mongoose which is ready to eat chickens

caller our peo ple are dying in naivasha and nakuru and some other trib are living with us they should be flashed sic out those who dont belong to this town the commission would have liked to have thoroughly analy zed full body of transcripts from kenyas vernacular fm stations given the allegations against them made by number of the commissions witnesses 303in his testimony to the commission kenyas attorney genera l amos wako stated that in his opinion the recent po st election violence wascoming very close tocrimes against huma n i t p i n t h t l d u s h m d l s w h r s early as 3 january 2008 the knchr goes one step further t han the attorney general arguing that the violence following the 2007 ge neral election meets the criteria of crimes against humanity under customary international law in so far as it involved conduct including the multiple commission of acts of inhumanity against civilian populations pursuant to or i n furtherance of an organizational policy to commit such attacks in the theatres of violence 283 that said and with the full recognitio n of how close to the edge kenya came during the 2007 post ection violence the commission would not recommend free for all monitoring of the press and other media th is would have the negative potential of taking the country back to the draconian days of state controlled media from which it has so recently just b arely escaped however the commission does believe that speech in the media including in vernacular fm radio stations aiming to foment ethnic tred andor incite organize or plan for violence should be investigated thorou ghly in timely fashion when it occurs 283 exhibit 125 p 149 and pp 144 ͳ50 304chapter nine extent and consequences of the postelection violence deaths injuries and destruction of property deaths and injuries loss of life through conflict is measure of the scale of conflict hence the need to ascertain the number and causes of death further it is recognition that conflict is basically about human life an d all else is secondary the commission also understood its terms of reference as requiring it to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding the post electi on violence this means that we had to establish the number of persons who died and those who were injured as result of the post election violence the akiwumi commission which investigat ed the tribal clashes occurring in country since 1991 did not aggregate data in respect of the clashes the kiliku report which also investigated ethnic clashes in 1992 documented 779 deaths and 654 injuries in the districts that were the subject f the inquiry284 dr hezron nyangito permanent secretary of the ministry of medical services gave evidence to the effect that his mini stry established several committees to deal with among other issues the preservation and disposal of bodies and to ensure that that post mortems were carried out he emphasi zed that in the case of post election violence we gave instructions that we have to record it this is becaus we appreciated the fact that the violence of this nature and therefore we had to do all we could to document those whose indications were victims of post election violence most of the medical officers who testified confirmed that this was the position moreover we were the commission was informed that it 284 exhibit 136a at page 78 305was normal practice to take the history of the victim his or her relatives to determine the circumstances of death and therefore determi ne whether the death or injury was as result of pev the multiplecauseofdeath information fr om 1133 deaths was in respect of the period between 27th december 2007 and 29th february 2008 which is the period that the commission has considered coverin g

analyzing the deaths the commissio n relied on specific sources of data including medical and postmortem reports subm itted to the commission by various medical officers and government do ctors and the ministry of medical services various police returns reports and statements submitted by officers commanding police divisions ocpds reports received from private hospitals and institutions various witness statements depositions and oral testimon in order to compile this report multiplecause records ci ted above were reviewed and then linked with various other re cords on the corres ponding individual death records thus data on age at death sex and other variables where available were added to each record on the multiplecause file 306the police according to commissioner of police maj gen hussein ali documented 616 deaths as having occurred during post election violence period at the date of his evidence285 the commissioner of police was emphatic that only the police could give authoritative figu res for those who died as result of pev286 while commission has tried to establish the true extent of deaths and injuries we recognize that for various reasons not l deaths that occurred as result of the post election violence may have been captured for vari ous reasons some of the these reasons include the following some deaths may not have been reported to the hospitals or to police stations due to the prevailing security concerns situation at the time b in many cases those who were injured di d not report to hospital or health centres for fear of their safety or because in the ordina ry scheme of things the injuries were considered minor compared to other pr oblems being experienced at the time c in some cases injuries were not proper ly documented due to the fact that hospitals were understaffed and pply of drugs and other medical supplies were disrupted287 d in some instances patient referrals were problematic as som roads were blocked paralyzing efficiency in docu mentation of injuries and violence 288 injured persons may have sought alternative medical attentio n for example through traditional healer s or unlicensed practitioners after considering all the available evidence before us as whole the commission concludes that it is unlikely that there would be ny more or less deaths than those reported to the commission it is likely that given the publicity given to this commission existing evidence and information of undocumented deaths would not have been brought to our attention 285 cw 1 exhibit 1 288 cw 63 statement exhibit 63 307because of the lack of uniform reporting requirements so of the documentation the commission examined cked all the details relating to the person injured or deceased for exampl the age of the person would be missing or because of the situation prevai ling at the time the precise date or time or place of death could not be ascertained in some cases only preliminary cause of death could only be determined without t he confirmation of properly conducted post mortem for ex ample in migori relatives of persons who were shot during the skirmishes did not want post mortems carried out289 289

rift valley province accoun ted for 744 deaths that is 66 of all the deaths that occurred during the post ection violence period the commissions conclusion is that rift valley was the epicentre of the post election violence nyanza with 134 aths constituted 12 of the deaths experienced while nairobi with 125 deaths constituted 11 of all the deaths the third largest number of deaths 342the causes of death in the provinces lead to number of broad conclusions in western province gunshots accounted for 74 deaths out of t otal of 98 representing 725 of all the deaths in th at province in nyanza 107 deaths out of 134 or 799 were the result of gun shots in nairobi 23 out of 125 deaths or 184 were the result of gun shots and in rift valley gun shots accounted for 194 out of 744 or 26 of those killed coast province recorded 4 out of 27 deaths or 14 as result of gun shooting and in central 3 out of 5 deaths were reported representing 60 of the total gunshot deaths summary of deaths from gunshots province of deaths percentage western 74 725 nyanza 107 799 rift valley 194 26 nairobi 23 184 coast 4 14 central 3 60 total 405 summary of deaths as of deaths in provinces 725799 26 1841460 020406080100 western nyanza rift valley nairobi coast central provincepercentage it is the view of the commission that sinc evidence to the contrary was ever shown police were responsible for l cases of shooting the commission 343concludes that the disparity in percentage terms of th number of those shot as fraction of the total deaths in each province may have correlation with the preparedness the police had to use ammuniti on on people evidently this varied from province to province with western province exhibiting t he most robust use of ammunition followed by nyanza it ap pears that police in different provinces did not respond uniformly with regard to the use of force even when faced with similar situations f u r t h r i t i s t h v i w f t h c m m i s s i n t h t l l d t h s t h r t h n t h s b gunshot were caused by civilians the number of dea ths in the rift valley as result of arrow shots and sharp objects is very high the picture that emerges from these figures is that the rift valley faced an extr aordinary amount of violence between ordinary citizens bows and arrows as well as machetes played defining role in that violence for these improvised weapons to have achieved such large number of fatalities demonstr ates the concentration of the violence and is consistent with the testimonies received by the commi ssion the evidence received by the commission was that in nya nza and western provinces there were relatively low levels of fatality resulting from citizenon citizen violence if it is assumed that gunshot deaths in these provinces were caused by police and that nongunshot deaths represent civilianoncivilian violence the relatively low figures of 27 deaths represen ting 20 of the total deaths in nyanza province while in western 24 deaths representing 245 of the 98 deaths corroborate the test imony it follows then that police shot and killed large number of people in these two prov inces if so this is inexcusable and highly regrettable the commission also examined the ethnicity of those who died where such information was available from the evid ence presented the commission decided to disaggregate information on the ethnic identities of those killed in the post election violence for the reason that it demonstrates th at all ethnic communities that were involved in the violence sustained losses of l ife this conclusion counteracts the notion which all the ethni c communities that were involved in the post election violence were found to harbour that members of their particular 344community were the sole victims the in formation shows that all sides sustained significant losses number of deaths during pev distributed per tribe tribe number kalenjin 158 kamba 11 kikuyu 268 kisii 57 kuria 2 luhya 163 luo 278 maasai

oral and documentary evid ence submitted before the commission there are 4773 pages of recorded swor n testimony from 156 witnesses and 144 other witnesses who submitted depositions and recorded statements there are nine volumes of exhibits running into mo re than 3500 pages and we had at our disposal in terms of our terms of refe rence official reports of previous investigations investigations from othe r institutions or organizations and research material from our own researcher s and investigators it must be said that the commission had only limited period to carry out exhaustive investigations and we do not doubt theref ore that there may be information out there which did not reach the commission we were never theless encouraged by the enthusiastic support and response we received from members of the public and we believe the information gathered enables us to st ate with confidence that our findings are made fairly and fully the preceding chapters make various findin gs in relation to the topics discussed and those findings remain valid what follows is summa ry of the broad findings as distilled by the commission on the basis of those findings the commission has made its recommendati ons as required in the terms of reference findings in relation to the extent of violence 6 total of 1133 people died as sequence of the postelection violence the geographical distribution of the deaths was unequa l with most of the postelection violence related deaths concentrated in the provinces of rift valley 744 nyanza 134 and nairobi 125 the district s of uasin gishu 230 nakuru 213 and trans nzoia 104 in the rift valley province registered the highest number of deaths related to postelect ion violence 346 7 total of 3561 people suffered injuries inflicted by or resulting from sharp pointed objects 1229 blunt objects 6 04 soft tissue injury 360 gunshot 557 arrow shots 267 burn s 164 assault 196 etc 8 total of 117216 private properties including residential houses commercial premises vehicles farm produce were destroyed while 491 government owned properties offices vehicles health centres schools and trees were destroyed 9 gunshots accounted for 962 casualties out of whom 405 died this represented 357 of the total deaths making gunshot the single most frequent cause of deaths during poste lection violence it was followed by deaths caused through injuries sustained as result of sharp pointed objects at 282 the commission has re ceived evidence to suggest that where gunshot was recorded as the cause of death or injur it was from source other than the police this calls into question the contention that postelection violence was citizentocitizen violence nd it validates the view that police action accounted for good part of the postelection violence findings in relation to the causes and patterns of the post election violence 1 in contrast to the preelection violence which was main ly between candidates and their supporters the poste lection violence had distinct ethnic dimension 2 initially the violence witnessed was spontaneous an d was in part reaction to the perceived rigging of elections in areas li ke the rift valley and the coast it targeted members of the kikuyu and kisii comm unities perceived to be 347associated with the pnu party and with president kibaki who were seen as the beneficiaries of the rigged election while in nyanz and western the spontaneous violence was mostly directed towards government fa cilities and gradually took the form of looting and destruction and w hile it also targeted kikuyus and kisiis the intention appeared to be not to kill them but rather to be expel them and destroy their property 3 subsequently the pattern of violence showed planning an d organization by politicians businessmen and others who enlisted criminal gangs to execute the violence that was the case particularly in rift valley and nairobi in places like naivasha nakuru and the slum areas of nairobi kikuyu gan gs were mobilised and used to unleash violence against luos luhyas and kalenjin s and to expel them from their rented residences and similarly organised kalenjin youth particularly in the north rift attacked and drove out kikuyus living there 4 some of the pointers to the organisation include the fact that in instances warnings were issued to the victims before the attacks the violence involved large numbers of attackers often mo bilized from areas outside the location of the violence petrol and weapons were used in various places to carry ou t the attacks and destruction which required arrangements as regards acq uisition concealment and transport and sometimes the attacks specifically ta rgeted only members of given ethnic groups to the exclusion of others 5 s m r s p n s i b i l i t f r t h v i l n c m u s t l s b l i d t t h f t f t h countrys politicians who precipitated the violence by among other actions and omissions i conducting the election camp aigns in strident and confrontational manner thereby creating an atmosphere of tension 348ii for party political ends casting the majimbo debate in ethnically divisive terms and iii failing to create confidence among voters around the ectoral processes and institutions 6 the administrative authorities in cluding the police the security forces and the provincial administration must also take responsibility for various omissions and commissions in regard to the violence arising from failure to act on intelligence regardin g the possibility of violence following the elections failure properly to respond appropriat ely and adequately to the violence and its effects thereby aggravatin g the suffering of the victims in the case of the security agents and the police resor ting to an unjustified use of force and causing death and injury unnece ssarily and failure to act with discipl ine and impartiality and at times descending into acts of serious crime against civilians findings in relation to sexual violence general 7 because of the context in which it took place the s exual violence experienced took the form of gang and individual rapes many of which were ethnically driven as well as horrendous female and male gen ital mutilation women and childrens labia and vagina s were cut using sharp objects and bottles were stuffed into them men and boys in turn h ad their penises cut off and were traumatically circumcised in some cases using cut glass furthermore entire families including ch ildren often were forced to watch their parents brothers and sisters being sexually violated 8 aside from the above life shattering events many vic tims of sexual violence experienced other injuries lost family members thei r houses property 349had place to go or to turn for help and have ended up alone or in idp camps without means of earning living perpetrators 9 the commission found that perpetrato rs of sexual violence were not just ordinary citizens neighbours and gang members but also significant numbers of security forces these included members of the general service unit gsu as well as regular and administration polic many victims let members of the security forces into their houses assuming they would he lp them instead they found themselves being attacked by those they thought would help them this entailed gross betrayal of trust 10 members of the security forces also participated in gang rapes in addition they colluded with each other includ ing having some of their own standing guard outside victims houses while they raped and mutilate d inside victims dwellings 11 even when victims told perpetrators whether members f the security forces gangs or individuals that they were hiv positive perpetrators chose to rape this is likely to result in an increase in hiv aids in kenya 12 perpetrators often told victims the xual violence inflicted upon them was punishment for belonging to specific ethnic group or purportedly having supported particular political party victims 13 for variety of reasons many vi ctims were not able to access timely medical care including obtaining the drug pep which if tak within 72 hours prevents hiv aids and sexually transmitted infections t he reasons for not obtaining medical care included the following breakdown in security and the fear of leaving home lack of transport ignorance about p ep and not knowing they would not have to pay and could receive free medica l care fear of being stigmatized if it were known they had be raped and an overriding concern to 350protect feed and shelter their children and family mbers at their own expense response by authorities 14 authorities in general were totally unprepared to respond to sexual violence although the police took many vi ctims of sexual violence to hospitals the commission also received evidence that in other inst ances they were unprepared either to record or investigat criminal complaints of sexual violence this was exemplified by the commissioner of police hussein lis testimony to the commission where he stated we will determine whether those crimes are fit and whether the people have been arrested and charged 15 the void created by the lack of of ficial response to sexual violence was partly filled by private hospitals including the nairobi womens hospital some government facilities and number of ngos including t he kenya red cross effects 16 other than the extraordinary physical and psychological trauma stemming from being victim of sexual violence victims also suffer ed acute injuries permanent disabilities contracting incurable diseases like h iv aids and hepatitis b ostracism abandonment by their husbands and p arents loss of abode and income as well as ex treme feelings of humiliation 17 the commission learned from its ow n psychologist that many female victims still are alone unable to cope with the above traumas and in need of help which is not available to them number of victims who had not received medical attention by the time they came before the commis sion only managed to do so as result of the commissions intervention 351findings in relation to internally displaced persons 18 as result of the pev approximately 350000 persons were displaced from their normal abodes of residence and or business idps were concentrated in western nyanza rift valley central nairobi and coast province about 1916 kenyans sought refuge in uganda 19 people were displaced as result of violence and threats of violence they moved from their places of residence and business to plac considered safe like police stations administrative posts churches and trading centres 20 thereafter they moved to formal camps or were integrated w ith their relatives and friends in urban centres or their ancestral homes 21 conditions in the idp camps were less than satisfactor we found that security was wanting as idps were always subjected to threats by criminal gangs we also found complaints abou t the inadequacy of food shelter and sanitation most of the inhabitants of idp camps were women and children 22 government and admini strative response to the problems of idps was initially slow and ad hoc the kenya red cross society local and international ngos and csos faith based groups an d individual volunteers played an important role in alleviating the suffering of idps by off ering refuge food shelter security education medicine counselling and other needs 23 the government initiated operation rudi nyumbani in april 2008 aimed at removing idps from camps and where possible resettling t hem back to their homes due to constraints of time and resources the commission could not fully make an assessment of the efficacy of this programme but found the following inadequacies i the sum of kshs 1000000 was considered inadequate by th idps to meet their need once they left the camps ii the so called integrated idps ie returnees who went to live within the community felt neglected as the program centrated mostly on those who were settled in camps 352iii security for those who wish to re turn to their farms and homes particularly in the rift valley is not fully assured and is therefore hindrance to resettlement 24 the idp problem is likely to persist phenomenon til the government and people of kenya address the politica l problems that led to eviction of men women and children from their homes and businesses 353 354 part iv acts and omissions of stat security agencies and impunity 355chapter eleven state security agencies introduction the commission was given special role in relation to the state security agencies ssas and their involvement in the post election violence articulated clearly in the terms of reference tors it was mandated to investigate the actions or omissions of state security agencies during the course of the violence and make recommendations as necessary broad interpretation of this task was applied to include the actions of thes agencies in the lead up to polling day was necessary step to take in determining the level of pre paration and planning undertaken also individual members officers and employees of these agencies were considered to be within the scope of the inve stigation the investigation drew from range of reports from interna tional organisations and kenyan civil society independent witnesses and representatives of the agencies themselves in determining just what these entiti did or did not do in discharging their various mandates in the months precedin g the elections during the election process and of course during the tim of post election violence pev in discharging its mandate this commi ssion has been able to open doors previously closed and to hear from the most senior government officials both in public and in camera many kenyans were hearing from these office holders for the first time and the nature of their work would have been revelation to many key witnesses who appeared included the chief of general staff of the kenyan armed forces290 the commissioner of the kenya police service291 the 290 cw 07 general jeremiah mutinda kianga 291 cw 01 major general hussein ali 356commandant of the administration police292 the director general of the national security intelligence service293 the permanent secretary for the ministry of state for provincial ad ministration and internal security294 the commissioner of prisons295 number of provincial an d district administration officers and other police personnel the testimony of these witnesses has been complemented by that of independent ci tizens and civil society organisations this approach has enabled the commissi on to examine and make findings on many aspects of ssas work that will ef fectively carve out new territory for the republic indeed the finding relating to preparatory ar rangements was as insightful as those relating to the action and reaction of these agencies to the violence when it did occur this volume of the commissions report is divided into three chapters dealing with preparation responses and the aftermath and ra tionale for recommended action includi ng major recommendations identifying the key issues the investigation focused on three main timeframes the pr eelection period primarily looks at the preparedness of ssas the perio d of the post election violence itself to see just how agencies responded between 27th december 2007 when the presidential results were anno unced and the 29th of february 2008 and the time since then in terms of how they have dealt w ith the aftermath the examination of these matters was guided by number of key elements regarded as being minimum requirements for dealing with ev ents of this type and magnitude these include 292 cw 08 kinuthia mbugua 293 cw 19 major general michael gichangi 294 cw 04 francis t kimemia 295 cw 09 gilbert mithune omondi 357 information and intelligence the methodology of inform ation gathering analysis and disseminat ion within agencies and across the security sector operational planning the comprehensiveness of preparation including the use of intelligence risk analysis scenario development desk top exercises co ntingency building the timing of overall preparation and communicati on the execution of planning arrangements including specialist training and drills and orders groups command and control structures the development of specif ic arrangements to take account of the special nature of the 2007 elections operation and the clarity and decisiveness of li nes of command and communication suring officers and staff understand and acknowledge th eir roles in the exercise use of force the appropriateness of response tactics including the use of lethal force tear gas and other methods of dealing with crowds dealing with complaints including the systems utilised to recei ve and respond to calls for service and sensitivity in dealing with traumatised citizens investigations the capability of police investigations inclu ding issues of dealing with the behaviour of police officers resourcing the level of resources acquired and applied to th operation how resource management was handled during th crisis the utility of police statutes force standing orders standard operating procedures sops and other guidelines the review processes including debriefings and comprehensive written analysis and review of the overall operation 358how prepared were the agencies our assessment of this aspect of the state security agencies activities falls into two principal categories firstly the ac tivities services and outturn of the intelligence machinery were examined including national p rovincial and district components secondly the readiness of operational agencies was investigated in terms of their own state of preparedness kenya security intelligence machinery ksim296 the ksim consists of number of committees that are des igned to keep security issues in front of those who make the decisions at the top level through to frequent interaction between delivery agencies on the gro und at the provincial and district level the machinery is ma up of the cabinet security committee csc the national security advisory committee nsac the joint security intelligence secretariat jsis the provincial security an d intelligence committee psic and the district security and intelligence committee dsic the respective roles and accountabilities are reproduced in appendix b the ksim largely discharges its role in ensuring the dev elopment and delivery of intelligence to inform an appreciation and understandin g of the risks to internal security amongst other roles at the national level the key committee is the nsac consisting of senior officials from the security services and some ministries its main role is to advise the csc on internal security issues and to provide direction and intelligence to the provincial and d istrict intelligence committees 296 the director general nsis cw19 presentation in public 17 july 2008 organisation chart reproduced in appendix 359at the outset the commission learned that there is stablished national security policy to guide the development of operational stra tegies and tactics to prevent or at least prepare adequately for such events as the pev297 despite the lack of national policy base or high level strategic framework the commission heard evidence that the ks im especially the nsac had in its possession wealth of knowledge and inte lligence around the great potential for significant violence in and around the 2007 general elections and that through its role this knowledge was shared between security agencies the commission also received evidence as to the use ma of the material created and supplied to the members of the nsac it co uld not be established that this intelligence was shared in timely or appropriate way with the government through the csc or if it was whether it influenced decision making at that level nor could it be established whether the nsac disseminated the intelligence to the provincial and district committees whilst it is clear that the commissioner of police was pr ivy to this information it is less clear how full and detailed intellig ence reports were or should have been provided to the provincial and district committees the commission was able to establish that communications in the form of facsimiles wer forwarded from the police commissioners office to provincial police officers from time to time in the lead up to and after the general elections these communica tions sent between august 2007 and the end of january 2008 contained mix of information relating to potential security issues many provincial administration officers and police fficers however stated to the commission that they had not for example receive d special guidelines and directions on the pev scenarios drawn up by the nsis298 297 the development of national security policy is included in the agreed work programme as agreed through the kenya national dialogue and reconciliation 298 including cw 45 former ocpd nakuru 30 july 2008 360whilst the structure roles and mandate of the ksim is sound operationalising it in times of great need is the test of its robustness and in the case of the 2007 elections there was definite breakdown in its operation in terms of top down delivery of intelligence reports in the time it had the commission was able to review the discussions and minutes of some district security and intelligence comm ittees dsic and provincial security and intelligence co mmittees psic these quite clearly demonstrated knowledge and understandin g of the security situation that was developing in their areas of responsibility in trans nzoia east and west the committee meeting of the 30th december noted worrying security situation in the two districts where kikuyus were specifically being target ed and an observation that whichever way the presi dential results go kalenjins pokots nandis kipsigis and sabaots are planni ng to attack kikuyus and invade their farms the same committee communicated to the psic that due to the fact that security officers had been deployed from their area to support molo nairobi and elsewhere for security duties local security was sorely comp romised the molo dsic determined in its meetin g of the 22 november 2008 that due to glaring irregularities in the party nomination process and blatant rigging the political atmosphere became charged lead ing to defections and acrimony it commented that there was strong need to strengthen security operations preceding the elections and recommended th at five police posts be established and additional funding be allocated to support patrols and rapid deployment operations there is record of thes initiatives being followed through minutes of the 20th december meeting of the molo dsic recorded that following the period 22 november to 4 december when ethnic hostili ties reached fever pitch resulting in clashes causing death injuries and destruction of property the entire psic led by pc hassan noor hassan visited the rea to assess the security situation appealing for peacef ul coexistence between the communities meeting between religious leaders politicians and the pc was held on 5 december where peaceful resolutions were agreed upon and d ocument signed off the same minutes however recorded some weaknesse s in the existing 361security arrangements noting need to recruit credible and reliable informers more transport requirement to properly vet officers sent to the district to ensure reliability and strengthening of the operational command structure and communications arrangements there remains question then around the utility of the machinery in its mandated role in terms of planning an d preparing delivery agencies for key security tasks whilst there is evidence of good inform ation gathering intelligence preparation and understanding of the secur ity issues both nationally and at local level there is significant weakness in tr anslating this into clear demonstrable and useful operational interventions it appears that the entire security forc approach to dealing with security issues relies almost exclusively upon th ksim this simply will not achieve anything on its own this information and intelligence assuming the smooth operation of the machinery only serves to inform and ad vise on what delivery agencies need to do the commission re ceived evidence for example that there were any joint planning andor operational arrangements between agencies further evidence was provided regarding the use of desktop scenarios simulated emergencies and full joint exercises to ensure that each organ is able to play its role when real emergencies such as t he pev occur it would be expected that such arrangemen ts would be in place and form part of the usual business of ssas specific pla nning activities for the general elections would have been expected to commence some considerable t ime before they were to be held and at least one to two years in the case of t he largest known recurring security event in kenya national security intelligence service nsis of all the state security agencies the ns is was it seems with the possible exception of the military best prepared evidence was received to the effect that not only did the service gather information and data abo ut what could potentially occur around the 2007 elections in terms of vi olence but developed 362range of reports highlighting the issues and provided them to senior government officials as well as the police military prisons and oth er agencies the nsis produced both regular and sp ecial reports including hotspotsflash points updates situation reports week ly and fortnightly reports and briefs security briefs at provincial and district level as well as nsac reports regularly throughout the months leading up to the general elections299 as early as september 2007 these reports warned of impending election r elated violence in clearly specified areas and provided co ntinuing alert process through updated assessments of potential pev in many instances these documents identi fied various individuals suspected of being involved in such activities as in citing planning disr uption and violence threatening behaviour and other offences the service went as far as recommending that operation agencies prepare specific contingency plans take special and decisive action against inciters and financiers of criminal gangs and ensure staff refrained from exercising partisan behaviour the commission heard and was provided with supporting evidence that the service was in fact uncannily accurate in its forecasting of just what scenarios were likely to eventuate should either odinga or kibaki wi n the presidential elections the scenarios predicting possible 2007 elect ion outcomes and consequences sounded clear warning that security organs ma well be overwhelmed by the high intensity and widespread nature f ensuing lawlessness300 299 for example report entitled flashpointshotspots week ending 080607 was forwarded under letter to mr cyrus t gituai ps provincial administration and internal security and copied to maj gen mohammed hussein ali commissioner of police 300 director general nsis major general gichangi cw 19 nairobi 17 july 2008 see appendix c 363a special report entitled critical dates and events gener elections 2007 was forwarded on 6 december to mr samuel m kivuitu cha irman of eck the contents of which had been presented to the nsac it amongst other things warned of increased political activity and attendant lawlessn ess are likely to overwhelm the security organs 301 further report dated 7 december addressed to the same person and copied to amb francis k muthaura ps to the cabinet and head of the public service and the commissioner of police warned further of issues likely to inflame an already volatile situation in cluding persisting claims of election irregularitiesformation of antirigging sq uads by parties and hiring and use of criminal gangs against opponents and persist ing ethnic clashesanimosities in some parts of the country due to in flammatory political utterances 302 given the extensiveness of the intelligence developed and distri buted by the service it was disturbing to note that in the end there was an almost fatalistic realisation that or insufficient preventive action woul d be taken to ameliorate the mayhem in addition for many there is case for b elieving that even with an odinga win some areas of the country pecially north rift may well have still seen high levels of violence due to the alleged level of kalenj in organisation capability and ambitions to drive socalle d outsiders out of the area regardless of the results question remains about the utility of some of the ns iss systems many at the provincial district and division level were emphatic that they did not know of the likely magnitude of the violence that ultimately ensu ed this seems strange since it is those very areas within which the nsis operat ives work and therefore where knowledge of the impending crisis should have origina ted 301 director general nsis major general gichangi cw 19 nairobi 21 july 2008 302 director general nsis major general gichangi cw 19 nairobi 21 july 2008 364it can only be assumed that if this is the case the n the information obtained was not shared with the psics or dsics on the way up the chain perhaps the system that the service utilises does not allow for this nd insists that only well developed intelligence through the instru mentality of formal report will be shared with fellow ssas many districts reported that they had idea of the nature of the extent of violence to come and did not in fact receive full reports from their superiors if this is true then the failure to fully comprehend the situation could lie in both the failure to utilise key information at source and in failure of agencies especially the police to ensure that the formal intelli gence reports of what was happening on the ground reached those who could do somethin g about it the nsis also warned of emerging allegations that the government is planning to use some sections of government organs including the p rovincial administration and the administration police aps to rig the forthcom ing elections 303 particularly disturbing allegation consid ering that the same report dated 25 december 2007 identified indicators of the alleged rigging schemes including the revelation that aps are involved in marking ballot papers in advance and that some of them will be deployed in polling stations to d isrupt elections and introduce fake ballot papers particularly in langata further the intelligence agency in warning of the real pot ential for security organs to be overwhelmed by widespread lawlessness pointed to the following challenges an overstretched capacity and partly demoralised pol ice force lukewarm working relationships between the regular and administration police as result of perception that t he latter is politicised and favoured by the government partisan public service as well as the military provincial administration perceived to be involved in ca mpaigns304 303 cw19 exh produced 17th july 2008 304 cw19 exh brief dated 17 december 2007 produced on 17th july 2008 365the commission did however have grave reservations ab out the involvement and attempted involvement of the nsis in the elections p rocess this involvement was manifested in three speci fic instances the first concerned an attempt by the nsis regional intelligence coordinator ric nairobi region to secure eck accreditation badges the ric wrote to the ch airman of eck mr samuel kivuitu in letter dated 13 december 2007 req uesting the issuing of less than 50 accreditation badges to be issued to nsis officers for the elections305 mr kivuitu responded in writing the very ne xt day refusing the request outright in doing so he noted it is the first time such request was ever made by an intelligence agency he also pointed out the acceptance of your request would contravene all known and well established international nor ms on elections there can be basis for spying on its eck electoral duties for now your application is impossible to accept this issue also arose during th examination of the eck chairman306 when he responded to question about the matter harun ndubi i see now im asking that to reflect back on the question of nsis did they also ask you in any of those correspondences to allow their officers either to disguise or to receive badges as officers or observers of the eck samuel kivuitu they applied now this did not come from the headquarters this came from the nairobi office they app lied to become observers election observers and i wrote back and i s aid they are not qualified they cannot be election observers and if they were to be taken it would be one of the biggest blows to the adm inistration of elections second issue concerned what the nsis described as socioeconomic political barometer field study report december 2007 that it conducted or caused to be 305 only two pages of the three page letter were received by the commission 306 cw 135 25th september nairobi 366conducted between 26th november and 2nd december 2007307 in letter dated 24th december 2007 general gichangi provided survey results indicat ing the relative position of the 3 presidential cand idates in the polls he also included an assessment as to the final results on 27th december 2007 in addition correspondence about the survey appeared t be arranged outside the ksim framework the commission could find r eference to this work in any other document and the letter was addressed to amb muthaura in his role as secretary to the cabinet and head of pu blic service and not in his capacity as chair of the nsac the consistent message frequently communicated by the nsis around the need for state organs and their officers to be neutral duri ng the elections seemed farcical in the face of these revelations the third area of concern for the commission also related to written communication dated 6th december 2007 this letter from the director general to the chairman of the eck was headed critical dates and events general elections 2007 308 the letter purported to be on behalf of the nsac lthough it was not forwarded by the nsac ch air amongst other things the communication identified counting anno uncement and swearing in elements of the ecks work that the nsis felt necessary to comment u pon this advice included how certificates should be deal t with by agents and that eck should meet with media house owners and editors and the candidat with view to striking deal on the modalities of transmission and announcement of results the commission discovered that this type of advice had been provided by the nsis during the referendum of 2005 and was in fact welc omed by the eck then and during the 2007 elections despite th is the commission finds that specific advice of this nature emanating from an intelligence agency is unwise and likely to be outside its stated mandate 307 evidence supplied by the nsis in the form of letter from the director general to amb francis k muthaura ps secretary to the cabinet and head of public service 308 cw19 part of his presentation in public on 21 july 2008 nairobi 367 further this correspondence included caution on the conduct of law enforcement and other agencies in and around the election s processes the involvement of government officials and the use of public r esources for campaign purposes could lead to accusations of rigging and provide grounds for violence and subsequent petitions clearly the director general and his officers failed t heed their own warnings the military testimony was tendered by the chief of general staff of the kenya armed forces general jeremiah kianga309 to the effect that the military were well prepared for the pev by all accounts they not only took heed of the nsis reports but conducted their own assessments scanning and planning arran gements based upon their view that the 2007 elections wo uld see level of violence occur to at least levels seen at previous elections the military prepared contingency plans anticipatory orders trained troops and rehearsed in order to respond appropriately to likel scenarios conducted barazas with staff around their need to remain apolitical in accordance with military values and other work to ensure that should the need arise military support could be provided quickly and effectively the official mechanisms and formal proc edures utilised for calling for military assistance in aid of the civil power were however less cl ear section 3 2 of the armed forces act chapter 199 of the laws of kenya pr ovides the kenya army the kenya air force and the kenya navy are charged with the defence of the republic and the support of the civil power in the maintenance of order and with such other duties as may from time to 309 cw 05 nairobi 14 july 2008 368time be assigned to them by the minister after cons ultation with the defence council the police commissioner310 testified that in the context of the events after the 27th december 2007 elections military resources were deployed for the limited purpose of supporti ng police in the restoration of transport infrastructure the role f the military did not include quelling of riots this was acknowledged by general kianga the chief of gene ral staff of the kenya armed forces311 in his statement where he stated that the primary role of the armed forces is the defence of the republic of ken against any external threat and the secondary role is the support of civil power in maintenance of order312 it is notable that the police commissioner and the chief of general staff of the kenya armed forces did not refer to any other basis for military aid to civil authority or elaborate on just what processes were used the commission was provided with copy of government of kenya document entitled instructions on the use of arme d force in civil disturbances issued by the ministry of defence in 1962313 this was also referred to by senior police witness who referred to number of publications that guide policing arrangements314 this document spells out that such requests should emanate from the provincial commissioner or di strict commissioner in any sudden or urgent emergency after consultation wi th the local police commander some psic and dsic minutes refer to th requests having taken place 310 cw 01 311 cw 07 312 exhibit 7a 313 exhibit 97c 314 cw142 369the police the kenya police service and the administra tion police are generally referred to as the police in this discussion except where issues touch specifically upon their individual mandate an dor responsibility in terms of preparedness for dealing wi th the post election violence the police were simply too far off the mark there wa s and still is lack of understanding and reluctance to accept that comp rehensive exercise in planning and preparation for the elections were not only required but stitute basic responsibility for the police this was reflected early in the proceedings the commissioner of police hussein ali stated to the commission that the violence was unprecedented and indica ted that it could not have been foreseen315 the commissioner was asked by the commission to provide copies of documents prepared by the police fo r policing the 2007 general elections and u n d r t k t d s b t h t i m t h i s r p r t w s w r i t t n n l t w p l n n i n g documents were received the first was an operation plan from the coast province in the form of an undated presentation and the second was plan entitled operation uchaguzi from ss p mwamburi former ocpd migorirongo districts316 in assessing the police preparedness overall the commissi on determined that planning and preparation was scant commenced far to close to the event failed to take account of the intelligence r eceived and information available on the ground and did not encompass preventive activities designed to reduce andor ameliorate the impact of violence around the 2007 gener elections there was also evidence provided that indica ted the police were utilising their own intelligence sources and systems that shou ld have informed planning as well as responses these fundamental failures set the scene for po lice preparedness and response nationwide 315 cw 01 exhibit 1b produced 09 july 2008 nairobi 316 cw94 370the commission sensed that the police approach to its ta sk before during and after the 2007 elections reflected misplaced arrogance t hat they would always be able to control what came up as we will see t only does this approach fail to grasp the fundamental policing tenet that preventing vi olence and criminal activity is the best means of protecting citizens and proper ty but further underscores the grave underestimation of what was to ultimately occur evidence was tendered to the effect that indeed some planning did take place the commission was told that process wa s in place whereby provincial police officers ppos planned for service delivery in their province s for the elections and these plans were tested at national level reviewed nd ultimately implemented317 however little evidence of planning was heard from midlevel police commanders the commission heard from number of officials includin g the former ppo who was in charge of police operations for the entire rift va lley province until 27 january 2008318 he stated that due to his assessment of the issues he prepared detailed operation plans although the evidence suggests that in fact there were adequate security arrangements made through t he instrumentality of detailed operation orders these orders appear to co nsist merely of the application of officers to areas where more violence wa s expected than others319 there was indication of initiatives and strategies designed to reduce andor ameliorate the possibility of violence planning here also seems to be predicated on the need to supply at least two officers to each polling station during the election process in fact it could be said that the police planned for dealing with the electi ons process and little else it should be noted that the eck counse l made much of the significant increase in polling stations for the 2007 election s in the event some 27555 polling stations were utilised meaning the impact on policing was t least 55110 317 cw 57 nakuru 1 august 2008 318 cw 57 nakuru 1 august 2008 319 the witness told the commission that orders had been prepared complete with detailed resourcing requirements these had been put into presentation form and discussed in nairobi with the commissioner and other ppos with view to ensuring adequate policing overall during the elections 371officers assigned to these duties albeit many were seconded from other services at time when there was little violence ar ound the actual polling the impact of this and other requirements are discussed in detail in f ollowing section in fact one provincial cid officer patrick muhuni kakam ega320 western province was one of the few police officers to state that he actually had plan although not written the plan did consist of some activi ties designed to reduce the effect of preelection violence and deal with the lection process itself in addition the work involved focussed almo st exclusively upon preparations for dealing with violence with little emphasis on prevention he told the commission that in the month of october 2007 the provincial police headquarters directedadvised the eight divisional police off icers ocpds in the province to start preparing and curb any unlawful ctivities before and during the electioneering period that is the preelection and post election period he further said the preparation would involve the beefing up of security deployment of police on patrol and beat duties rehearsing police officers on the control of riot lectures on providing security to presiding of ficers and clerks manning of the polling centres stations and tallying centres 321 many however advised that their plans we re not written and many seemed to be in the nature of an action or reaction to events as th ey unfolded on the ground the pc coast province mr ernest g munyi told the commissi on that adequate measures were put in place during the political campai gns preceding the elections and during the election itself 322 the coast ppo deputy commissioner kingori mwangi said that in 2007 as part of my work i directed all ocpds in t he coast province to prepare operation plans covering the build up to th general elections 323 he also acknowledged that the general elections consti tuted one of 320 cw 89 kisumu 11 august 2008 321 cw 89 322 cw 140 mombasa 1 september 2008 323 cw 141 mombasa 1 september 2008 372the biggest security operations that the police deal with at any one time in kenya324 the former ocpd mombasa wilfred mbithi now assistant com missioner operations nairobi testified that before the elections we prepared adequatelyand to our capacity 325 he acknowledged that on the very first day violence erupted on the coast he called for reinforcements and also stated that review of the police 2007 elections operations had eve r been completed despite assurances around preparedne ss the police agencies have either not been able to provide copies of their planning documents326 state clearly when planning commenced or provide evidence that they conduc ted full debriefing and review process po st the 2007 operation327 these fundamental failures were indeed replicated all over kenya there were also significant variations in the understandin g of senior and mid range police as to their level of capability in dealing wi th the violence that occurred in some cases the commission was told that the ssas were quite simply overwhelmed even when heavily reinforced in others views were expressed that the police were always able to control events nd in fact did so despite the fact that many days and weeks were take n to reduce the violence and heavy tactics were used the commission takes the view that the po lice in fact were poorly prepared to deal with the pev even with the intelligence provided b the nsis and the historical nature of elections in this coun try police agencies quite simply failed and failed badly in this fundamental requirement of th eir mandate findings in relation to planning and preparing for the 2007 general elections 324 cw 141 mombasa 1 september 2008 325 cw 142 mombasa 1 september 2008 326 except for the coast ppo and former ocpd migorirongo districts 327 all police witnesses including commissioner ali stated that formal review process has been completed 373the commission could find little or evidence to indicat that the government either as an entity or through individual politicians m oved to prevent or ameliorate the tensions leading up to th elections in fact there is strong evidence that indeed the actions of some senior duty b earers exacerbated tensions and violence through the misuse of executive power and authority the decision to deploy hundreds of admini stration police officers in apparently clandestine circumstances to nyanza just before the polling day confirmed for many that the elections processes were indeed suspect there is clear evidence that kenya has strong collective approach to gathering processing and disseminating information an d intelligence dealing with security issues that is principally demonstrated through the kenya security intelligence machinery ksim the benefits of such system were dem onstrated through the preparedness of the nsis and military in understandi ng their roles planning for the 2007 elections and executing their mandates in t erms of preparedness and service delivery on the ground weaknesses exposed by the very nature of the post electio n violence however mitigated these positives key amongst th was the lack of leadership provided by the cabinet security committee and it s coopted members this committee is the highest level component of kenyas curity intelligence machinery yet the commission could find evidence that it operated at ll let alone effectively in the lead up to and during the elections it is expected th at these senior members of the government would demonstrate lead ership and decisiveness in addressing the issues they must have been aware of during the build up to the 2007 general elections the commission can only speculate that indi vidual members were more concerned about their personal political situation during the campaigning and polling periods the commission found number of examples of activities undertaken by the nsis as extraordinarily poor judgement constitute partisa nship on the part of state security organ and are examples of activities that clearly fall outside the 374mandate of the agency these included attempts to secur eck accreditation for nsis officers to be part of the election s process nsis sponsored survey of how the 3 presidential candidates were polling prior to the ections and communicating this information to the secretary to the cab inet and head of public service and advising the eck on electoral proces ses omissions were also found in suboptima l decision making the absence of joint operational arrangements and the failure to translate go od intelligence into demonstrable operational delivery in the event much of t he information and intelligence that the nsis developed and forwarded to the other agencies including police simply did not get to those who could have used it most the commission could find little evidence that delivery ag encies were involved in joint planning and preparation leading up to the 2007 elections this came as surprise given the history of elections violence in kenya and the weight of knowledge agencies had about the likeliho od of significant violence being feature in 20078 given that general elections constit ute the most serious known security and safety issue in kenya and that it recurs every five years operational planning needs to begin minimum of 18 mo nths ahead of any date set for the next general election there was also evidence that recogn ised preparatory arrangements such as the use of desk top scenarios simulated emergencies and full joint operational exercises are part of the ssas repertoire these activi ties are standard operating element of many similar jurisdic tions utilising peer review strategies where security specialists from similar agencies act as r eviewers and umpires to independently assess current strengths and weaknesses in the p reparedness and capability of ssas other issues that served to weaken the op portunity to reduce andor ameliorate the violence were the lack of national security policy and security plan the failure to recognise the importance of utilising emergency ma nagement 375components including national plan and full recogni tion of the role that the military can play in aling with these events one of the stronger findings of an omission on the part of state security agencies before the elections was the failure of the polic to engage in professional timely and quality planning and preparation for the elections event it was apparent to the commission that th ere was we will be all right on the day mentality emanating from the top to the bottom of t he organisation planning and preparation appeared to be something that is done close to the event and on this occasion focussed on the wrong things plan s seemed to consist of where there was evidence of something written simply an orders group focussing on the polling arrangements examples on the ground of the lack of planning and preparation by police abound this despite strong evidence suggesting there wa s at an element of planning and certainly organisation and facilitation in r elation to much of the violence experienced during the post election period pecially in the rift valley province many citizens seemed to have known at least few days i n advance that there would be targeting by tribal andor political affiliation although the police seemed either unaware or chose not to take the information seriously in any event the police were unprepared and faile d to take the necessary proactive steps to reduce the opportunity for violence to eventuate this approach fails to take account of one of the most important roles of the police and that is the protection of life and property t he prevention of offences and crimes and keeping the peace best practice in this area demands that quality extensive and specialised planning arrangements shoul d begin many months if not years before such an event senior personnel from the commissioner and his key advisers to provincial and district commanders must take full responsibility for this failure to perform in 376what is critical and fundamental elemen t of policing as result many more people lost their lives were injured were displaced their homes and personal property destroyed and ability to continue their livelihoods vered than would otherwise have been the case these factors combine to identify further omission on the part of the police little or evidence was adduced pporting the existence of police intelligence capability it is accepted that the intelligen ce committees provide useful mechanism to collectively assess intelligence and utilise i t for decision making however police organisations shou ld and must have their own highly developed information gathering and inte lligence systems had these systems been in place and operating effectively and the intelli gence gained been acted upon in timely and effective way then perhaps more preventive action would have been taken how did state security agencies ssas respond to the pev the operational delivery for ssas primarily rests with the po lice kenya police service and administration police the provincial and dist rict security and intelligence committees the kenya prisons service the provincial and district administration and from time to time ot her services including the kenya wildlife service the national youth service and the kenya forest g uards the national security intelligence serv ice nsis does not have mandated role to deliver services other than to advise security agencie s the military provides support to the civil authority when required to do so this chapter assesses the overall response by ssas with spec ific focus upon interventions including use of force the role played by various ssas the identification of some key incidents and issues arising from them and chronicles some good work completed by individu als and agencies that is worthy of particular mention 377responses by ssas to the post election viol ence proved to be inconsistent they varied considerably there were in stances where individuals and agencies performed well many doing their very best to provide safety and security services to citizens there were also many instances where agen cies could have done much better as well as clear cases of neglect of duty criminal offending and the use of overwhelming and lethal force on many defenceless citi zens ksim at national level and in the time available the commiss ion was unable to firmly establish just how well the csc and nsac operated it w ould be expected that it is around events such as the crisis that developed af ter the presidential election results were announced that these important high level co mponents of the security machinery should operate best it is understood that in fact the nsac did not actually meet during the crisis period and commun icated by other means and it can only be assumed that the csc was not functional during this important period special nyanza psic meeting held on the 4th february 2008 specifically referred to nsac directives that were issued and noted for necessary action328 the nsac documents were described at di rectives to the psic contained in two letters from the permanent secretary dated 7th and 28th january 2008 with directions that psic and dsic should rrest all criminals engaged in planning and execution of killings and destructio n of property psic and dsic should provide security to targeted individuals who supported the government and pnu psic and dsics should forthwith sure that all major feeder roads are free of illegal barriers the command and coordination relationships between security committees and security agents while on security operations should be streamlined the provincial commissi oner and district commissioners will exercise their functions of giving overall and general d irections as chairmen of 328 exhibit 97b 378the psic and dsics respectively while th provincial police officer and officer commanding police divisions remain operational commande rs to execute committee decisions the performance of the provincial and district intellig ence committees appeared mixed an examination of the rift valley psic minutes for example disclosed functioning group demonstrating some leadership and decision making throughout the crisis special meetin g held on 31 december 2007 reviewed the situation all over the province identified activities for priority action and agreed that officers should exercise restraint as killing was not the answer the committee resolved to meet frequently during this period meeting on four occasions during january 2008 and number of times in febru ary in contrast the nairobi provincial inte lligence committee appears to have met less frequently according to the minu tes provided and not at all during december 2007 janu ary or february 2008 the nairobi north district committee met three times during this period nairobi west not at all and nairobi east met on 13th december and not again until 13th february 2008 there was also evidence of clear and concise decision ma king by committees special psic meeting held at kakamega in western province on 22nd january 2008 reported an agreement to allow pl anned peaceful demonstrations by odm for 24th january 2008329 nsis 329 provincial commissioner abdul mwasera cw 87 379evidence received by the commission indi cated that the nsis did continue the process of information collection and intelligence gatherin g during the pev period daily situation reports330 were prepared outlining key areas of concern including in some cases the identification of specific peo ple and events of interest as stated earlier it is not cl ear however the extent to which these reports were disseminated to key enforcement agencies and ot her recipients although some of what might be scribed as standard reports were discontinued partly in december 2007 throughout january and parts of february 2008 this is not surprising give n the nature of the events confronting agencies throughout the republic unfortunately even t he daily situation reports were not produced duri ng the critical period of 24th december 2007 and 2nd january 2008 the commission believes however that in fact these events provided an opportunity for the service to develop and circulate special reports focussing on perpetrators planners an d organisers of violence and possible tactics and strategies to reduce their effect the nsis did not take this opportunity but should do so in the future military the commission has been unable to tablish the exact timing and mechanism that triggered the involvement of the military in the post election violence although for example the commission was informed that their support began on 27 december 2007 schedule of action taken covers the period 6 january to 28 february 2008331 in the event the military were involved in number of supporting activities right across the country 330 commission exhibit 2a 331 commission exhibit 07b 380these activities included332 transporting idps from flash points to safe areas guarding idp camps clearing and securing blocked roads securing the rail line distributing food and medical supplies to idps escorting trucks from mombasa stined for rift valley western kenya and neighbouring countries escorting passenger vehicles through unsafe insecure areas betw een nairobi and western kenya apart from demonstration of force both on the ground and from helicopter in naivasha there was never requirement fo r the military to use force and none was used my lords yes we fired in the air that is demonstration of force there were one or two occasions when we fired into the air to demonstrate force333 the commissions view is that the milita ry performed its duty well position that appeared to be shared with many commentators what is surprising is that more military support was not initiated as the circumstances of the situation dictated that more resources of this na ture applied quickly and judiciously may have reduced the impact extent and duration of the pev prison service 332 cw 07 14 august 2008 333 cw 07 14 august 2008 381the role of prison officers during the pev period basica lly fell into three categories firstly very many officers were designated as police officers principally for duties in and around the polling stations334 secondly number of officers were coopt ed to support the police in number of enforcement roles effectively as reinforcements and car ried out duties such as patrolling335 in some cases such as in naivasha the commission heard of allegations of improper conduct on the part of some officers in this particular case it is alleged that due to pressure from the public fficers were withdrawn from service on 27 january 2008 unfort unately this occurred at the very time police were under severe pressure due to the retaliatory attacks that occurred in the town on the same day curious coincidence further evidence was received by the co mmission to the effect that prison officers did contribute well to the provision of safe haven for idps in naivasha the assistant commissioner of prisons duncan okore336 allowed victims of the violence to stay in the outer area of the prison whilst more appropriate arrangements were made in the event

appeal to the psic to urgently facilitate reinforcem ents of two special detachments of rdu338 or gsu339 and two platoons of kenya army personnel it is difficult to see how the police could have coped without initiating and implementing preventive measures in the first place that m ay well have resulted in with more support from the mili tary far fewer deaths injuries and destruction of property simply put the in cidents police were called upon to deal with were all too much too often and too widespread these events sorely tested police operating arrangements systems the training ability and calibre of officers equipment and decision making the lack of planning resulted in effectively delimiting available tactical options much was found wanting policy issues there were number of nationally init iated decrees and orders that may have had an effect on the way in which oper ations were managed the commissioner ordered nationwide ban on politi cal gatherings of any description340 many felt this was violation of the constitution and contr ary to law others such as odm felt it was direct attack on them and their membe rs and supporters although there may have been some operat ional utility in the move in seeking to ensure the police could control large mobile populations it will always be linked 338 rapid deployment unit of the administration police 339 general service

witnesses342 testified that there was such policy and that there was basis in law for there to be one doubtless ma ny will find this position difficult to accept ban on live media broadcasts may well have had negative unintended results in terms of security issues343 many citizens determined this act amounted to further infringement of their rights indicated that the gov ernment had something to hide and as result height ened tensions that were already running at very high levels the attorney general in fact testified that in his view the ban was not legal 344 the operational environment the police faced extraordinary operatio nal issues across much of kenya ranging from individuals inciting and agit ating for violence to occur groups and gangs ravishing communities large nu mbers of youth and other citizens damaging property and in some cases ri oting to attempts at organising and conducting demonstrations these events sorely stretched and tested the police capability and responses ultimately 1133 people were k illed very many more injured thousands of private and public properties dest royed vehicles and equipment ruined and private possessions stolen 341 prof anyang

for example those issues facing state security agencies in the rift valley province were quite different from other areas in kenya violence started in different areas at different times kuresoi on 4th december eldoret on 30th december nakuru on 24th january and naivasha on 27th janu ary and violence continued in one form or another unti l the signing of the accord on 28th february 2008 there were also number of different aspects to the violence ranging from the aim of expelling certain communities from areas including uasin gishu to the socalled revenge attacks at nakuru and naivasha to even up the score it should be said on this point that these attacks were not only unlawful and criminal acts on defenceless men women and children but they did not in fact target the actual perpetrators of the original violence it should also be remembered that nu mber of police officers and provincial administrators lost their lives during this period some in the process of saving lives andor keeping the peace345 it is against this backdrop that the following analysis was made use of force overall the commission determined that total of 1133 people died during the pev period of whom 1048 were male 74 female 11 children 119 remain unidentified of these 405 died from gunshot wounds in addition 3561 citizens sought medical treatment many admitted to hospitals and of these 557 were treated for gunshot wounds 345 3 kenya police service officers 3 administration police officers and 1 district officer 385whilst the commission acknowledges the possibility that some of those killed and wounded by gunshots may have been the victims of people ot her than the police evidence to this effect was received it is also accepted that in fact these figures may not fully reflect totals of people killed some may have been buried with out the knowledge of officials and the commission heard from many witnesses th at due to the pev itself road blocks available transport and too dangerous that many people could not travel to medical facilities for treatment both peaceful demonstrations and unco ntrolled riots were significant events throughout the country and are relevant to the commission s work for number of reasons they address the issues of the lawful rights of individuals to protest and the police interaction with peaceful demonstrators and their use of force it also addresses the issue of police resources and their i nability to protect the public the commission investigations included an examination of several cases involving both police related shooting and ca ses involving citizen against citizen it also examined the issue of the in discriminate firing of live rounds of ammunition into peaceful crowds and in riot situations on many occasions when the police intervened they resorted to lobbing tear gas and shooting into the air police themselves must have obse rved that this use of force saw limited success many witnesses to these events have confirmed that the police actions only dispersed crowds momentarily the youth would simply regroup and attack others with impunity some witnesses described this police tactic as game of hide and seek between the police and the gangs the evidence received included cases where there were good w itness accounts and where police units or senior officers involved could be identified on many occasions however further investigations will be necessary to identify officers utilising excess force and deal with them appropriately 386of all the incidents of state agency resp onses none was more reported upon or roundly condemned by commentators an d observers alike than that which occurred in kisumu346 despite evidence being provided by the former ppo to the contrary347 the ocpd kisumu ssp kiragu stated that the violence sta rting on 28 december 2007 came as complete surprise to the police348 n t h i s occasion police used tear gas to disp erse large crowd who had stormed the provincial works offices destroying much property however after unsuccessfully attempting to disperse even larger crowds the following day in the process of more significant acts of oting and property destruction decision was taken to use live ammunitio n349 reinforced by both the gsu and administration police rapid deployment unit further police action aimed at protecting the cbd was taken on 30 december during that day 25 rioters were shot dead by police further violence continued throughout until early february 2008 and when the violence finally subsided police reported killing total f 48 people through the use of firearms this figure was revi sed by the hospital pathologist whose evidence was that there were in fact 50 people who died of gunshot wounds out of total of 56 bodies examined the commission was provided with armo ury records relating to the issue of firearms and ammunition to police office r s i n n n z d u r i n g t h i s p r i d n analysis of these records showed that significant amounts of ammunition and tear gas were expended some officers used far more ammunition than others only one set of records recorded the issue and use of bla nks although these particular records appeared to be reproduction where all entries were written by the same person and in very many cases there is record at all of 346 refer to hr watch icg and knchr reports on the election

further investigations into the use of force by ssas350 the commission heard from the ministry of medical service s that total of 111 people died in nyanza during the pev pe riod made up of 101 males 9 females and one unidentified person the telling factor in causes f death were the 89 80 who died from gunshot wounds in addition total of 214 people were admitted to various hospitals throughout the province of whom 48 had gunshot wounds one of the prime difficulties the police d in defending their use of lethal force in these circumstances became evident through questions asked by the commissioners in response to specif ic questions the ocpd kisumu clearly stated that unless there was clear and present danger to life andor property then the use of lethal force was not justified351 he further testified that police should not use teargas or firearms when citizens were running away from the police my lordship once they have run away we have achieved th objective of dispersing them this being the case it is difficult to rationalise the use of live bullets or tear gas on retreating crowds evidence from the pathologist dr odour352 revealed that of the 50 people shot by police in kisumu 30 were shot from behind and furth er 9 from the side in addition 3 of the deceased were under the age of 14 year s one 10 year old girl and 3 were female one of the children 12 year old boy was shot twice in the back further 45 year old woman was shot and killed w hilst in her home just outside the cbd the commission could find legal or operational basis for justifying the shooting of

shooting at people and briefed the staff on each occasion not to use live ammun ition to use tear gas the only 3 deaths recorded in the area died as result of gunshot wounds he also told the commission th at his staff were only issued with live rounds and not blanks or rubber bullets the former ocs of the combined migo rirongo police divisions edward maghanga mwamburi357 told the

the pev 54 year old apc was killed on duty and four others injured it is not known if post mortems were conducted on all the deceased as he in dicated that most of the bodies were collected from the mortuaries and buried without the k nowledge of the police the commission found that western province was virtually forgotten in terms of kenyans understanding of the level of vi olence that occurred although there were reports of rape sodomy or forced circumcision from the health facilities areas that bore the brunt of the violence included mumi as vihiga kakamega and webuye the commission learned that specific investi gations had been commenced into police action events unfolding in and around the general elections of 200 7 saw the majority of casualties caused by the police with pev

director of medical services and provincial medical officer western pr ovince provided data showing that in some facilities the dead were almost exclusively the result of gunshots358 in kakamega 26 of

cause in addition many victims of gunshots we re treated in medical facilities the pattern of injuries and their causes were similar in tha t virtually all injuries in kakamega mumias and vihiga were caused by gunshots whilst these post mortem results were not examined by com mission investigators to determine how these victims were shot it is inconceivable that there would be sufficient justification fo r police to shoot dead so many people the commission received aggregated data from the ps of th ministry of medical services dr hezron nyangito in mid august 2008 he stated that in the rift valley total of 779359 people died of which 170 were as result of gunshot wounds the gunshot deaths amounted to staggering 31 f the total deaths that occurred and careful analysis of the manner in w hich these people died needs to be undertaken the report also indicated that the leading causes of injury were gunshots in the rift valley this amounted to 189 of t otal of 1324 some 143 closer analysis of those admitted andor treated at medical facilities also needs to be unde rtaken so that complete picture of shooting victims is forthcoming 358 cw 88 kisumu 11 august 2008 359 it is interesting to note that of these 42 remain unidentified in fact commission analysis indicates that total of 119 bodies remain unidentified and this may account for some of the unsubstantiated rumours of many people being unaccounted for 391it is clear that not all deaths and injury patterns were the same across the province for example in trans nzoia westeast dr pk too 360 the district medical officer of health trans nzoia west district gave evid ence to the effect that total of 105 people were killed in the two d istricts of these total of 83 died of gunshot wounds almost 80 wh ilst these victims were located all over the area some places suffered much more than others in cluding matunda cherangany gitwamba kalaa and munyaka as with other areas where many people were shot to death closer and more exhaustive investigations are required to determine the reason and establish the operational utility of shooting victims by police andor culpability where this is established by the facts eldoret was also the site of the police gsu action at the moi teaching and referral hospital that resulted in inju ries to some hospital employees and medical staff this illustrates the way in which police used indiscriminate and excessive force against innocent citizens from the evidence of the chief security officer and one of his security supervisors361 it was reported that the police where chasing gang of youth through the streets who head ed in the general direction of the hospital despite assurances by hospital sec urity staff that none of the youths had entered the compound police resorte d to the use of live rounds and tear gas in what was heavily populated opera tional hospital environment this amounted to serious case of responding dangerously without sufficient consideration for the sa f t f h s p i t l s t f f p t i n t s n d others in the immediate area the violence in the coast erupted on the evening of 30th december 2007 and continued until the 1 january

of the 22 patients admitted to hosp ital during the period where pev was occurring 12 suffered gunshot wounds362 the commission heard from the police that in respect of these casualties inquest files were opened in respect of the five deaths as well as 20 others but there is apparent follow up action be ing taken in respect of those wounded by gunshots the commission heard from two further witn esses in respect of the shootings the first 56 year old rose gathoni mathenge told the commission that after the election results were announced on 30 december 2007 she and her husband were at home when they saw people pa ssing nearby with looted goods her husband left the house at about 8pm and when she could n ot raise him on the mobile phone short time later went out to look for him someone answered his phone when she called saying he had been shot by the pol ice he was lying dead short distance away with bullet wounds363 the witness told the commission that one else was shot during that period and the police admitted later that they shot him as he was looting 364 she said that this would not be possible due to the short time he was away and there was evidenc of looting near the body

book police actions in respect of the use of thal force in mombasa replicate those in other parts of the country similariti including victims shot from behind victims shot whilst in and around thei r own homes and the rationale for using lethal force at all in the circumstances require close and thorough investigation by specialists who are independent of the police in nairobi the commission learned that there were total of 125 who lost their lives during the clashes 23 of whom di ed from gunshot wounds further 342 victims were admitted to hospital duri ng the period 61 with gunshot wounds367 in addition many denigrated the apparent heavy handed pproach the police took to dealing with demonstrations and what the police cal led riots especially in the informal housing areas slums such as kibera and mat hare368 commission investigations identified the extensive use of t ear gas and firearms in support of what appeared to be tactic to keep citizens inside these informal

strong evidence identifying offenders witnesses told the commission that many complainants identified the looters by name and address and gave definitive information to the police about the whereabouts of their property in some cases po lice just told complainants that they should be grateful that they are alive and forget what happened369 these sentiments were repeated to the commission and its investigators all over the country even in accepting the pressures facing the police during this period the quality of investigative work as well as the quantity of it left much to be desired the commission heard on number of occa sions that investigation would be undertaken unless there was complaint th is is particularly true in relation to property offences and deaths by shooting even where t here was clear evidence that serious crime had taken place as in the case of building being burnt down or where the circumstances demand quality investigative effort as in the case of child being shot twice in the back little or fo llow up was evident an examination of some inquest files revealed that at best superficial investigative effort was undertaken370 standard investigative work such as timely scene examination gathering and submitting eviden ce secured during the examination interviewing potential witnesses from th area and pursuing lines of inquiry to identify some of the likely suspects maraudi ng youth were not completed371 on at least one occasion the inve stigation file was returned to the police from the office of the dpp for further work to be completed 369 cw150

strengthen investigat ions work were provided by victims themselves the two case studies reporte d in appendices c and d clearly indicate reluctance to fo llowup on high level criminal offending to the standard expected of functioning police agency the commission also learned that the inve stigation files relating to homicides double as an inquest file there is separation of role and accountability for dealing with what are quite different aspects of these incidents in dealing with arrangements relating to the actual death as well as hi gh level investigation and the need to work closely with the dpp in establ ishing evidential thresholds the police have found themselves managing challenging environment that may well have the effect of detracting from their main focus some of the issues relating to investig ative capability were highlighted by the attorney general mr amos wako372 who testified that on 21st june 2008 i appointed joint team of senior officers from the depar tment of public prosecutions in the state law office and the police department to rev iew all cases on case by case basis related to postelection violence including the following categories cases of persons charged and are in remand cases of persons cha rged but are out on bail cases pending arrest of known persons cas of persons in police custody but are not yet charged the joint team is to determine and make recommendations to the attorney general through the di rector of public prosecutions on the basis of sufficiency of evidence whether the case should proceed to full trial be withdrawn or otherwise termina ted the team is yet to complete its task the commission has since noted report s in the media that some alleged offenders were released as result of this examination and direction the attorney general also alluded to some issues facing inve stigators that mitigate quality investigative work he said in relation to the pev most of the wouldbe witnesses were displaced following the violence and cou ld not be easily 372 cw 134 25 august nairobi 396located for recording of their statements and that s ome of those located have been reluctant to record statements reluctant to p articipate in identification parades unwilling to appear in court and give evidence for fear of reprisals relating to investigations into former commissions recommendations373 he commented that there were genuine difficulties in investi gating and getting witnesses because of their fear of reprisals wi thin the context of the ethnic clashes lack of capacity and resources on the part of the investigating authorities and self censorships or fear on th part of the investigators who are susceptible to pressure and manipulatio n these issues were also raised independen tly by two other senior public officials especially in respect of investigatin g individuals who could influence an investigators work prospects or pose personal threat374 the attorney general also told the commission as of now we are awaiting investigations as of now we are awaiting the results of the commission of inquiry into all these issues because it comes within the manda of this commission of inquiry to identify the perpetrators but what you ca n rest assured that as the attorney general we shall take the recommendations of t his commission of inquiry together with any other investigations that have be carried out very seriously and if my position is that if the offences are disclosed against any person ill prosecute criminal conduct by police including killings and sgbv in addition to the instances of excessive force used by the police there was credible evidence of criminal behaviour instances ranged from murder to gang rape and looting 373 report of the judicial commission

officers expressed tribalpolitical motiva tion behind the attacks380 there was attempt by the officers to disguise the ir identities and their behaviour implied disturbi ng confidence in their impunity for these serious criminal acts perhaps this in part aros from the fact that these officers were not local men but it nevertheless portrays an alarming attitude on the part of these officers two female witnesses testified to vari ous incidents of being raped by police officers cws 98 and 99381 one 21 year old with 4 children reported being raped by up to 6 police officers at around 10am

police behaviour that fell into the general category of unprofessional behavi our or misconduct these ranged from dereliction of duty inconsistent or insensitive support ar rangements for victims to failing to prevent offending especially property offences sexual violence appeared not to be high priority for police during the pev and arguably this is also the case during more peaceful times the testimony of many senior police who gave evidence at the commissions hearings was as interesting in what was not said as to what was said some had not included figures relating to sexual violence in their statistics apparently not deeming it important many when asked indicat ed that they had not received any or many formal reports of sexual violence the provincial commissioner rift valley told the commission we have not received any cases of sexual assault throughout the one and half months of violence in rift valley 383 however it would have been known to anyone living in kenya at the time of the pev that there were many allegations of sexual violence t hroughout the country including allegations of police officers being offenders s to merely omit this category of offences or to claim form reports of such seems akin to burying ones head in the sand and does not speak to strong will to uphold the law as it relates to sexual offending it is universal trend that police figure s in respect of sexual violence are lower than hospital figures in some places the commission went police reported having received such cases and yet hospitals and ngos were busy attending to victims of

response when they reported to police some victims were met with what could be desc ribed as an ineffectualunresponsive policing effort mathare victim of rape who reported to police several weeks later did not have her complaint accepted with the officer telling her how was he to know if her allegation was tru given she had not attended hospital on account of her rape 385 still other responses could be characterize d as cruel and indicative of callous disregard for human safety mathare victim of gang rap who presented bleeding and requesting help for her cr itically injured husband was waved away by police who simply told her to run for her life386 from victims spoken to who had reported or attempted to report to police it was noted that many were arbitrarily discouraged or dismissed by police if the victim could not immediately identify by name the perpetrator in number of cases victims who had gone to police to m ake statements about serious crimes were turned away withou t so much as an ob occurrence book number the victims ability to name the offender should never be prerequisite to the reporting and recording of crime it calls int question many aspects of the police operation including the training of frontline officers the quality and capacity of criminal invest igation commitment to addressing sexual violence and the value that is placed on criminal intelligence 384 dr samuel thenya cw 14 15 july nairobi 385 statement of jw 100708 cipev investigator gladys mwariri 386 statement of ro 100708 cipev investigator melinda rix 401many of these responses were given in the midst of the worst of the chaos and occurred at time when police were stru ggling to control an anarchic situation with multiple threats to life and property however the c ommissions investigators are not aware of any sign ificant attempts by police in the intervening more peaceful period to follow up and investigate the serious offences which they must surely know took place and to w hich their initial response was inadequate it was predictable and borne out by the work of the commissions investigators that when women suffered sexual violence and brutality at the hands of police they were unlikely to go to that same institution to lay complaints however one did attempt to make report to kilimani police of being raped by an officer i told them that my house had been burned down and pol iceman had raped they asked whether i knew the police who had raped i told them i did not they told to choose betw een the two either the issue of my house being burned or being raped i went back home and later went back i reported and wrote statement that my house had been burned but i left out that i had b een raped they told i was to blame for the rape and i should look i nto the issue about house cw18 387 however formal firsthand complaints to police are not the only way in which the commission of crime comes to the notice of police wh police became aware of allegations of these crimes it would be expected that they would want to solicit these complaints and thoroughly investigate the m police would have been aware of the allegations at the time of the pev thr ough the work of ngos and media in the course of this comm ission the allegations were once again put before the public and police if police do not act decisively in the fa ce of allegations against their own then any progress or credibility they have mana ged to achieve in this area of sexual violence is greatly undermined furthermore there can be confidence 387 heard by the commission in camera 16 july nairobi 402developed in the police when their own pe ople stand accused of such things and the matters are not investigated comprehensively and transp arently there was report of women victims being taken into po lice station and cared for by the female police officers howeve r despite this compassionate response to the plight of the women statement was taken from th victims or investigation commenced388 there were indications that at least in some places improv ements had been made to the manner in which complaints of sexual violence were received some of this derived from those primary agencies often medical most often dealing with victims embarking on some liaison training with police nairobi womens hospital was one agency which reported such developments389 n n t h r positive note nairobi womens hospital ceo dr thenya poi nted out that many of the victims over 100 were actually brought to the hosp ital by police however it seemed that it was only in the week or two prior to dr thenyas testimony before the commission on 15th july 2008 that police had attended the hospital seeking medical records this raises questions in regard to the police response to the many cases of sexual violence which they knew from firsthand involvement had taken place and yet appear ed to take little interest in following up from evidence given at the public hearings the nu mber of active or completedsuccessful prosecutions in respect of sexual crimes is few some police stations have established gender desks at whic h sexual crimes can be reported while this is step in the right directi on the effort needs to be extended so that all police officers not just those manning the gender desk should be aware of the particular needs and rights of victims at the time they present to police and the presence of gender desk at poli ce station is in itself guarantee of an appropriate police response senior manager at gender violence recovery 388 statement of ea 110808 cipev investigator melinda rix 389 dr samuel thenya cw 14 403centre described incidences where women presented to poli ce stations with their medical report in order to make compla int only to have police officer peruse the report and pronounce that there was evidence of ra pe and thereby dismiss the complaints as baseless common themes seemed to be if the repo rt contained evidence that the sexual offence did not comprise the first sexual experience for the victim or if there were lacerations to the genital area or there was n evidence of presence of sperm reported from swabs taken from the victim390 clearly the medical report is but one piece of evidence to be considered and to dism iss victims in the way described represents poor police pr actice and is unacceptable also of course reporting of sexual violence is only one step of the process there needs to be strong investigative response which follows and there was little evidence of this approach being taken during the p ev one ngo assisting victims of sexual violence told the commission the survivors felt that the police officers abdicated their ro by taking sides during the post election violence and failed to protect them or record the ir statements when they reported the matters 391 it would have been ideal for the police to engage in som proactive strategies aimed at the awareness and prevention of sexual violence nd to increase the efficacy of their response to it to do this prior to the violence breaking out would have required degree of foresigh t receipt of criminal intelligence and planning however when the first violence broke out in some areas shortly after the elections there may have been the opportunity to be pr oactive in other areas with the thought that people in those areas may f ace similar risks it could also have been apprehended that as idp camps were established there would be risk of sgbv in those places and gendersens itive police posts and other strategies established there may have served both pr oactive and reactive functions for the idps 390 commission job sheet nairobi womens hospital 080708 investigator melinda rix 391 ms ellyjoy karimi kithare cw

decrease the higher the confidence the public has in the police the more likely it will be that these crimes will be re ported and dealt with effectively many of the issues identified above were not reported to the police and victims variously described their reasons as fear of the police especially as they were the perpetrators and sense that noth ing would be done in any event there appears to be good reasons for victims holding these fears police informed the commission that apart from the ubiquitous inquest files internal investigations into the conduct of police office rs were being undertaken or contemplated392 i n d d i t i n n c m p l i n t s f r p w r r c r d d b t h police during the period commission witnesses gave evidence to th effect that the police in and around mombasa did not take preventive or remedi action against thieves and looters one witness titus tommy gichangi lucas393 businessman told of his three businesses being looted between the 30th december 2007 and 1st of january 2008 informed by neighbours about th burglaries and looting the witness called changamwe nyali and likoni police respectively repor ting the crimes he was variously informed that the police already sent poli ce officers to the area and that there was nothing to worry about their officers were on the ground and that all officers were out quelling ri ots however all the witnesss property was looted and despite providing police with video and photographs clearly showing numerous offenders loot ing only one has been brought before the court 392 apart from the one murder investigation 393 cw 144 2 september 2008 mombasa 405commission witnesses heard in camera supported the premise that the police failed in their duty to protect property cw 150 cw 1 51394 they informed the commission that the police were indi fferent to the loss of property and wealthas they told looters to take what they wanted bu t not to harm anybody they said that this message was consistent theme all over mombasa to the extent that it must have been police strategy in deali ng with the violence unfortunately this approach had unintended consequences as the failure of police to take serious action only led to larger number s taking part in the looting word obviously spread that the police had taken an indiffe rent approach to the chaos we ourselves witnessed women stealing household goods from their neighbours homes in mikindani as the police stood by and j oked about it it was only on january 2nd with the arrival of the gsu that the looting subsi ded but by then all of the properties of kikuyus and kambas had been looted 395 communities used their own strategies to prevent further looting and violence including creating vigilante groups and spreading the rumour that mungiki had arrived in town on revenge mission outside influence on police decisions the commission received evidence that on number of occ asions the decision making and behaviour of seni or police officers was influenced by factors outside the formal operating arrangements chain of command and in direct conflict with mandated duties perhaps the most graphic example was depicted in evidence gained by commission investigations of actions ta ken by the administration police few days before polling day the evidence is that around the 23rd of december large number of officers about 1600 were assembled at the administration police training college at embakasi to undertake trainin g to act as agents for 394 heard by the commission in camera 2 september mombasa 395 cw 150 and cw 151 406political party during elections polling the training w as conducted by senior academic and high ranking government of ficials including the hierarchy of the administration police these officers were deployed on the 24th december 2008 to luonyanza ostensibly their role was to disrupt polling and where possible ensure that government supporters amongst the candidates and voters prevailed396 all officers deployed were dressed in plain clothes easily identified as they were not from the local community and travel l d i n l r g g r u p s b m r t h n 3 0 chartered buses397 in addition they received ks hs 21000 each for their duties the entire exercise was called off day or so later after some officers were killed and many more injured by citizens398 some senior officers from the districts called upon the senior command of ad ministration police to cancel the enterprise as they could see there being more serious loss of life if it was allowed to continue amb francis k muthaura ps secretary to the cabinet and head of the public service told the commission that th is deployment was approved by the government and was commissioned for security reasons399 he also stated that the reason for sending those people under plainclothes is th at the area was very unfriendly the explanation failed to reso nate with commissioners given that there was little or security issue in nyanza at the or certainly worse than anywhere else the exercise was clandestine in appea rance and execution and fell outside the overall elections security command and control arrangements led by the commissioner of police further concern to the commission were reports of instruc tions from as high an office as the commissioner of police relating to the release of prisoners cw 396 the commission noted that indeed this activity by the administration police was identified by the nsis and included in their 25th december 2007 briefing document 397 witness interviewed in camera during october the exercise was also captured by the media and broadcast at the time 398 the commission was unable to establish accurate numbers 399 interview conducted on the 9th october 2008 nairobi 40797400 these instructions arose on at leas t two occasions in nyanza province one related to the arrests of criminal gang members including chinkororo and sungusungu who were intimidating citizens who intended to vote for particular candidate or not to vote at all after some arrests the commissioner of police gave instructions for them to be released it is assumed that this directive was due to the fact that senior politici an was purported to be behind the chinkororo on another occasion just after the vi olence broke out in kisumu the hon shakeel shabir and the hon olago aluoch were leading procession around kondele without serving any notice to the authorities and they were arrested and taken to the central police station the commissioner f police was informed but after two hours he instructed the loca l police to release the politicians and the incident was not pursued further further examples of interference by seni or police were provided by witness cw 80 who provided written testimony describing two serious incidents401 incident 1 on 28th november 2007 the ocs tambach police station ci pa ul karani received information from members of the public that the re was motor vehicle reg

immediately transferred to his provincial headquarters nakuru for further investigations in response to request for information re lating to this incident the commission received written advice from ssp fm mwei of the administration police on 11 september 2008 saying the department is not aware of the aps arrested in connection with the alleged act said to have been committed i n november last year this response combined with the testimony received from further witness tended to confirm this interference402 this witness stated that these two incidents 1 and 2 were both reported to the commissioner and that even if the offenders were released at the time due to the volat ility of the situation investigations should still have continue d the commission was not provided with such information 402 cw 57 409incident 2 on the 22nd day of november 2008 police officers from naivasha police station were manning naivasha road block at karai wh they received information that there was motor vehicle reg gk a5 45h white in colour plying from nairobi to western kenya and suspected to b ferrying some crude weapons at around 615 am th said vehicle appeared from nairobi direction and was subsequently stopped by the officers th vehicle had three occupants who identified themselves as 1 dick nyaga k ivuti driver with the ministry of water and irrigation 2 living stone taabu were an official driver to former assistant minister of water nd irrigation hon raphael wanjala and 3 fredrick egesa wasike per sonal driver of the assistant minister the vehicle itself belonged to the min istry of water and irrigation and was the official vehicle for the assist ant minister the police officers conducted search in the motor vehicle and managed to recover the following crude weapons sixty 60 pieces of maasai rungus forty 40 pieces of arrows three 3 pieces of bows two 2 pieces of arrow sheath fifty nine 59 pieces of maasai swords eight 8 pieces of small maasai swords two hundred and seven 207 pieces of whips nyahunyo the vehicle and the exhibits together with the occupants were later escorted to naivasha police station for further investigations mr maurice amatta sacp of cid headquarters nairobi later took over the cond uct of matter further curious situation relating to the police an d the election process was discovered by the commission when it examined the coast pro vince plan for policing the elections entitled presentation on the 2007 general election operation within coast province the document included the following special tasking mr hillary birgen ag sp will deploy 1 ip 6 constables at provincial radio r oom 410 task to receive results of presidential parliamentary and ci vic candidates from all districts and compile them and forw ard them to police headquarters limit of exploitation within the area of deployment reorganization at provincial headquarters it is not clear to the commission why the police were receivi ng polling data relating to presidential parliamentary and civic result s on the face of it the material appears to disclose activity th at is clearly not within the role or responsibility of the police an d has disturbing connotations state security agencies and systems failures it should be said that accounting for the exact numbers of people who died and were injured during the pev has been problematic amongst the reasons for this include antiquated and paperbased systems of rec ording loose arrangements for the receipt recordin g and disposal of bodies methods of attributing cause of death to pev practi cal difficulties in getting to medical facilities during the hostilities and the at tempts of some to ensure that at least some confusion existed in the systems this is particularly true of the rift valley where violence occurred over greater area included th most significant incidence of citizen to citizen confrontat ion and where the facilities were not acting as coordinated whole examples of these issues abound but there was more glar ing instance than the issue of determining accurate figu res relating to deaths injuries and instances of sgbv resulting from pev the commissioner of police told the commission that the kenya police service were the custodian of the facts he further stated that other person or institution wou ld have the facts403 the 403 he was supported in this assertion by m francis kimemia cw 04 411efficacy of these statements has been soundly brought into questi on as for example the commission has established th at total of 1133 people were killed during the pev when the commissioner testified that there were 616404 the fact that the police could only establish that aroun d half of the actual number who were killed signifies major problem in how inciden ts are recorded and published further the commissioner provided ta ble depicting the number of crimes committed during the pev when pres sed under cross examination as to why there was heading depicting sexual violence he stated t hat such incident was reported to the police given the t estimony of many victims who stated that they in fact tried to report incidents but were discouraged and indications for medical facilities to the ffect that there were at least 800900 victims treated demonstrates complete lack of leadersh ip and interest in this insidious crime as well as very poor systems indeed the police were also asked on number of occasions by the commission to produce figures relating to the pev including annual crim statistics copies of planning documentation resource allo cation arrangements personnel records showing transfers and the reasons for them total establishm ent as well as actual numbers of police available for service virtu ally none of these records were produced the commission understands that the pol ice do not in fact develop some of these documents in the first place and there are systems in place to retrieve other data further example of the inadequacy of some systems relates to the reporting of sexual violence commission investigators learned that in nairobi there is only one police doctor who has the authority to sign the p3 form necessary for the reporting to police of sexual assault this part icular function is one of many which this doctor must perform and so it is simple matt er for victim to have the necessary paperwork completed even if she has the will to report and 404 he was supported by the ps ministry of state for provincial administration and internal security cw04 who said the exact numbers which can only be provided by the kenya police 412the ability to travel to the hospital she may be one of 50 victims waiting in line for the doctor to attend the location and sign her form only to find after waiting many hours that as the 49th victim has her form signed the doctors working day is over and she is turned away either to return and b egin the process again the next day or simply give up from enquiries performed at health faci lities across the country there did not seem to be consistent approach to the collection storage nd analysis of forensic samples from victims it is so not usual practice to take samples for dna analysis and dna analysis is expensive and its availabili ty in kenya is limited these matters obviously have the potential to i mpact on the success of any prosecution sometimes victims found there was fee charged in order to obtain completed p3 form which they needed to make complaint to poli ce405 in some cases this cost was prohibitive two of the poss ible conclusions which could be drawn from the fact that police appeared to take little or interest in sexual violence are that they did not regard it as serious crime and t hat they placed little importance on criminal intelligence decisionmaking and systems relating to the appointment and transfer of staff s p c i l l s n i r s t f f i n n d r u n d t h i s p r i d w r l s b r u g h t i n t question in the time available to it the commission learned that at least four senior police officers were transferred or retired from their area of responsibility during the violence and at the height of operations406 although there may well have been an operational or organisational imperative for these staff movements it is difficult to see their efficacy given the timing testimony was also received from professor anyang nyongo to the effect that there were massive transfers of police and aps to especia lly odm strongholds of select individuals or people from centra l kenya to assist in affecting the vote 405 cw 15 406 details are included in appendix g 413manipulations and to violently suppress and attendant prote sts407 t h commission was not howeve r provided with any supporting evidence by this witness nor did its own investigations reveal evidence of such transfers the pressure on police resources was not helped by the re quirement the commission was unable to establish by whom that at lea st two police officers be stationed at each polling station the commission learne d that indeed many more officers were so deployed placing even more pressure on t actical options available to the police during the pev408 while the duration of this deployment was unclear doubtl ess it contributed to difficulties in the quick transfer of st aff to pressure points especially in the absence of contingency plans with the result that many officers spent long hours on duty in some areas nsis reports indicated that in nairobi some officers were down on morale due to lack of replacements evidence was adduced to the effect that the kenya police service has the overall responsibility and accountability for aling with all deaths occurring from sudden violent or unnatural causes from start to fini sh the mortuaries pathologists the ministry of health services and ot her agencies merely provide assistance throughout the process the police determine interim cause of death delivery bodies to the mortuary sign the body in ini tiate the inquest process and investigate the circumstances of the death this process can be problematic for two main reasons first ly the absence of fully independent process impacts upon the transparency an d professionalism that is required in finding not only the causes of such deaths but also ways to reduce or ameliorate them second the establishment of an independent coronial service would free up police re sources and reduce the burden of an important area of accountability positive responses by state security agencies

valley psic meeting 20th november 2007 414with investigations of this nature wh ere reviewing activity and behaviours reveals weaknesses in many systems and personal culpability in some cases it is easy to overlook andor dismiss interventions that were positive the commission received evidence and heard of many inst ances where security agencies and individual officers responded well to citizens in need these responses included but were not restricted to perform ing rescue operations where families and individuals were in danger of personal harm providing temporary refuge innear police stations and administration premises providing security for idps and others demonstrat ing leadership in attempting to quell violence and in some cases giving their lives for others the commission received testimony409 that on the morning of the 30th december 2007 after three houses had been set ablaze at lelmolok f arm in the kesses division the district officer mr benedict odhiambo omol held meeting with local communities in effort to bring the ten sion down he proposed for the kikuyu community to elect 10 elders and the kalenjin comm unity to also elect the same number who would work together to help reconcile the communities the proposed meeting was to take place the following day at the kesses dos office this was never to be because at around 6pm on the 30th december 2007 kalenjin youths attacked kikuyu homesteads looted and burnt the houses following these attacks as many as 1200 people sought refuge at the do s office compound where security was provided unfortunately do omollo was killed on the afternoon of 1st january 2008 while on patrol with other officers410 t h i s occurred in the cheptiret area when the patrol came acros s an illegal roadblock

the dos compound who were continually threatened and often surrounded by kal enjin youth were afforded security and the numbers of officers were reinforced on the 9th january 2008 409 cw 85 415 the provincial commissioner coast province told the commission that leaders meeting was held at the provinci headquarters board room to design peace and reconciliation measures the attendees included th ppo chief kadhi bishop of the anglican church chairman of the hi ndu council and pc amongst other things they used five local fm radio stations appealing for calm and held series of peace meetings on many estates given that the meeting was only held on the 2nd january 2008 the commission considered that although this was good initiative ch interventions would have been more effective had they been

concert with police officers whether cases were reported directly to the hospital or ini tially to police she noted that when female police officers fr om the local station were not available to deal

medical and judicial services both on the ground and at the highest level to establish efficacious processes which are consistently applied across the country reviewing performance during the seven months since hostilities ceased ssas have in t he main been slow andor resistant to reviewing thei r performance the testimony of the commissioner of police413 for example clearly indicated that an operational review of the police had yet to be completed yes it is stil l going on my lord you must bear in mind that what occurred occurred recent ly few months ago and we as security services we are not t oo quick to close chapters further the 410 cw 75 411 cw 141 412 cipev job sheet pamela olilo 080808 investigator gladys mwariri 413 cw01 416evidence from the ps of the ministry of state for provincial administration and internal security414 was that he relied on his personal oversight saying i could see what was happening and i was able to make that observation the commission was also variously advised by many senior officers in the field that reviews were not formal or normal part of busi ness formal written briefing and operational reviews are critical part of overall performance management and developing new and improved ways of providing services these processes should be mandated part of every security agencys role especially following significant operational events such as the pev this mindset was evident in most officers within the ssas w ith the military and nsis being the exception doubtless this state of affair s underpins the reasons why many of the planning arrangements operating guidelines standard operating procedures and standing orders fall short of the st andard required for modern security organs findings on responses to the post election violence in determining its findings around the various responses by ss as the commission focussed primarily upon the delivery of services by the police given that it is this organ of the state that has prima cy over the delivery of security services within kenya it is not surp rising that it is here that much of the analysis and assessment is made findings relative to the pe rformance of other agencies are also included the police 414 cw04 417it is clear that the police in kenya face unique challenges in relation to policing large demonstrations and protests the post election per iod saw numerous instances of both spontaneous and orga nised protests which in some cases developed into riots some of these demonstrations and p rotests occurred in rural towns and villages while others occu rred in some of africas largest urban slums each situation was unique and re quired different policing response systems functionality operational an d tactical option taking command and control communications complaint taki ng processes invest igation capability and the quality of the officers and their trai ning are all sorely tested in situations like those facing the police betw een december 2007 and march 2008 during this time however it is clear that the police re sponse ranged across the full gamut from examples of heroism to abject failure in discharging even the most basic of its mandated roles findings on the use of force the commission determined that the police response in r elation to the management of protests and crowd contro l was inconsistent in its application jeopardized the lives of citizens and wa s in many cases grossly unjustified use of deadly force their actions resulted in the senseless deat h of scores of innocent citizens which is in direct co ntravention of the constitution of kenya and the mandate of the police service both of which clear ly requires the police to preserve the peace and protect life the commission found that there was heavyhanded police response whereby large numbers of citizens were shot 405 fatally415 by police in kisumu kakamega trans nzoia uasin gishu kericho nakuru nairobi and other places among the victims were some who were ostensibly goi ng about their 415 the commission received evidence that any fatality was due to being shot by persons other than the police 418lawful business when they were hit by bullets and many m ore whose wounds confirmed that they had been shot from behind commission investigations also determined that in all the circumstances it is highly likely that very many citizens were unlawfully killed by police officers an analysis of post mortem examinations provided to the com mission revealed too many instances of citizens being shot from behind number of instances of children being shot some also from behind and further number of citizens being shot while sheltering in and around their own homes416 the commission found that police used variety of tactical options during the pev tactical options included but were not limited to the use of tear gas the use of blank ammunition the use of rubber bullets and finally the use of live ammunition on many occasions police sh ot live ammunition into the air in an attempt to disperse protectors and thereby protect life and property in other cases police officers shot directly into gr oups of protestors and crowds of people thought to be involved in looting or property destruction and scores were seriously injured or killed as result in the vast majority of cases the force used by police occurred during lawful enforcement duties to protect life and property this do not however mean that the force used was lawful reasonable or desirable i n the absence of evidence to the contrary the commission determined that in all proba bility all persons killed by firearms during the post election viol ence were the victims of police shootings this complete lack of consistency in the way in which police officers use force constitutes an immediate need to establish reasonable ba lanced and consistent national use of force policy this lack of consistency and at times confusion on the part of police officers is not assisted by the fact that some of the standard operating procedures utilised and laws guidin g operations were 416 details from the analysis of post mortems and commission witnesses 419promulgated during the colonial times for example one of the guidelines is dated 1962 whilst another undated appears to emanate from the same era417 there is demonstrated need for police to evaluate l of their tactical options and the effectiveness of each option tactical options p olicy or framework would act as decision support tool to assist front line police members in making decisions relating to tactical options and use of force issues framework would clearly define the legal terms reasonable proportionate and necessary it would require officers to continuously assess situatio n and should force be required it would emphasize that the for ce should be reasonable and necessary in the circumstances the design and subsequent implement ation f n t i n l u s f f r c s t r t g w u l d h v t b i n c r p r t d i n t t h existing police training regime this can be achieved through the complete overhaul of po lice standing orders and manuals of best practice in relation to the policing of demonstrations and protests there are some basic principles to apply in the policing of demonstrations police must balance th need to maintain order against the rights of citizens among those rights are freedom of speech the right to peacefully demonstrate the right to li fe and property and the freedom from intimidation or interference these rights are expressly protected under the constitution the commission also found that the current constitution provides for the authorisation and justification for using arms against cit izens in circumstances other than when life is in jeopardy th provision for such force to be used in the defence of property has little application in contem porary society and such measures need to be addressed in the development of new c onstitution and review of the police act and the administration police act 417 exhibits 97c booklet of instructions of the use of armed force in civil disturbances and 97d riot drill training booklet for the police force 420 the commission determined that full professional and independent investigations into the use of force by police officers must be commenced immediately findings in relation to investigations the police service has fundamental problem with its invest igative capability and capacity the commissions own investigations found tha t there was an inability or reluctance to effectively investigate serious c rimes and their perpetrators even when strong evidence existed of to tal of 1133 deaths the police have initiated prosecutions for merely 19 homicide s418 the commission found that for many other crimes firs t hand evidence linking an offender or offenders to the crime ex isted and still exists however for reasons known only to them the police failed to fully disch arge their duties in this respect police appeared unwilling or incapable of investigating and arresting politically powerful indivi duals implicated in the pe v instead concentrating on the lower level perpetrators419 the commission also established that the police service has weak systems and approaches to investigating incidents wher police officers are involved ranging from the use of lethal force to the deliberate killing of innocent citizens literally hundreds of incidents are not being inve stigated with the thoroughness needed or to the standards required there is professional st andards capability within the police structure nor an inte rnal investigations group tasked with these roles 418 cw 01 presentation to the commission 419 position confirmed by two senior officials in camera and reflected in the akiwumi report page 43 421 findings relating to criminal offending by police officers credible evidence strongly linked nu mber of police officers with serious criminal offending the offending ranged from murder and rape to theft and bribery the extent of offending was worrisome especially considering the lack of reporting on the part of victims many determined that it would be waste of time considering police officers were the perpetrators the lack of recording on the part of the police even when victims did go to the police they were often actively discouraged and the apparent lack of concern on the part of senior officers to address issues of impunity bringing to justice perpetrato rs of violence and restoring confidence in the police th officers must be thoroughly and professionally invest igated and dealt with under the law findings relating to partiality much evidence was received by the commission relating t the activities of police officers being driven by their ethnicity political leanings r both in some areas especially in the ri ft valley province the commission saw evidence of an ethnic divide within the police who were reported to be primarily kalenjin some witnesses provided statem ents saying that police stood by and watched as homes of the nonkalenjin were being burned an d looted in some cases it would appear the police members watched as individuals were killed in their presence in naivasha one witness stated that th kikuyu members of police were reluctant to assist and there was evidence f open defiance by some officers in relation to their seniors 422findings relating to lack of independence instances of inappropriate decision making due to outs ide interference and influence were discovered by the commissi on these included instructions from the commissioner of police to release arre sted prisoners the failure to continue with and finalise cases of police officers and government employees who were discovered committing offences and the blatant use of administration police officers in electioneering activities the marshalling and deployment of up to 1600 administration po lice officers in plain clothes to act as agents of the go vernment in disrupting or otherwise being involved in the elections processes amou nts to gross abuse of power by those who initiated the exercise this activity can have legitimate explanation or legal basis and in all probability was unlawful the special assignment of group of kp s officers during the election in the coast province in collating results and fo rwarding these to police headquarters recorded in the operation orders seriou sly concerned the commission can have legitimate operational utility and requires investigat ion and explanation other issues surrounding the natural tensions between the ro of provincial administrators and police surfaced duri ng the commissions investigation administration police officers are subjec ted within current structures and operating arrangements to multiple lines of command and trol for example the administration police act requires amongst other t hings that every officer shall assist chiefs and subchiefs when called upon undergo tra ining when the district commissioner so orders and act as messenger in ma tters of administration or the public service420 ap officers are also required to be under the command of their commandant who is the officer in charge of the administration police in addition ap officers can be seco nded to the kps and act under that command structur when required to do so 420 see powers and duties of aps in appendix b 423the commission finds this situation untenable and constit utes fractured and confused command and control structure th at is not conducive to ensuring clear accountability for policing service delivery this situation if allowed to continue will consistently reinforce the perception and often reali ty that the aps are not impartial due to the close control over th em that the provincial administration system has421 findings relating to secrecy the commission found that the police ag encies appeared to unnecessarily adopt defensive position quoting the need fo r secrecy as rationale for not providing some requested material this situation is extraordinary given the full disclosures made by other agencies that are the repository of f ar more sensitive information in failing to provide the commission with basic information such as the establishment and actual numbers of officers available for service copies of national planning documents and other data including success rates in investigations the police underscored an insular introspect ive and uncooperative stance reminiscent of bygone era in the final analysis it appeared to the commission that the police agencies regarded the term security as synonymous with secrecy they failed to grasp the concept adopted by most contemporary law enforcement agenc ies that being open and interactive with communities is not only th right of citizens but fundamental to ensuring community supp ort and in developing their trust and confidence the provision of information should be two way street with kenyans receiving timely and relevant info rmation on safety and security issues from police about what is happening in their communiti 421 similar finding was articulated in the akiwumi report p 286 424findings relating to failure to respond many people testified and expressed concern that in num erous cases police officers failed to act to protect property and save lives evidence was collected suggesting that on number of occasion s the police simply watched as property was being destroyed and looting occurred in coast province in particular there was much concer n over the failure on the part of the police to intervene when they were clearly available and present number of victims and witnesses expressed the belief tha t the police were condoning the looting and property destruction there ppeared to be loot but dont kill policy this saw the emergence of citizens f rom the kikuyu and kamba communities banding together to protect their own property as there was confidence they would receive protection from the police in many instances however police did ek to respond in the best way possible but were not always successful the ua gishu district for example was the site of the kiambaa church burning that resulted in the loss of many lives poli ce attempts to rescue the situation were thwarted through combination of an inability to respond quickly enough and encountering delays th rough unlawful roadblocks findings in relation to po licies systems and processes the commission found that some systems an d policies particularly relating to deployments and appointments planning and review dealing with deaths operational policy and procedures are outdated and in need of urgent review of particular concern was that operational planning rrangements operating guidelines standard operating procedures and standing orders fall short of the standards required for modern security r g n s f u l l r v i w f t h s arrangements needs to be conducted as matter of urgency 425while it is acknowledged that some pr ogress has been made in relation to dealing with victims of sexual violence s uch as setting up gender desks in police stations the events of the pev period clearly demonstr ated that there is very long way to go the personal attitudes of officers as well as systems to deal with the victims need to dramatically improve as matter of urgency findings in relation to dealing with complaints the commission felt that the best example of how police officers deal with complaints is best illustrated by the approaches taken in relation to the victims of sexual offending there were very ma ny instances of victims attempting to report their cases to the police but being thwarted for variety of reasons given the circumstances scale of offending the shortcomings which seem to have prevailed in regard to the investigation of these crimes and also the allegations against police it is likely that separate entity woul d be best placed to investigate these matters with that underway work can begin on building strategies which will achieve into the future the matters set out in the mandate ce ntral to these strategies will be an educationawareness compon ent which will span public medical police and legal domains the approach must be coordinated and consistent so there is common understanding of the best responses fro m all parties to sexual violence all parties including police need to understand their rights and their responsibilities with regard to sexual of fending this base then needs to be complemented by the training logistic s and resources through which victims can be treated and supported and have those who offend against them dealt with effectively and in timely fashion according to the law sexual violence needs to be acknowledged by police as ser ious crime and responded to accordingly victims should be able to report crimes in an 426environment which is secure and private and in situation in which their dignity is maintained police should respond in way that is non partisan reports of this type of offending should always be recorded and properly investigated this investigation may include among other phases the exam ination of scenes and the proper collection storage analysis and evaluat ion of evidence the investigation must be carried out by poli ce officers who are adequately trained and competent at investigating serious crim reports of sexual crimes should form part of criminal intelligence proc ess consideration needs also to be given to the safety of the victim when considering whethe r the accused person is released into the community pending the completion of th policejudicial process findings in relation to resourcing the commission was frustrated in its attemp ts to fully assess resourcing issues frequent use was made of raw numbers such as the ratio of police officers to population422 given that the police agencies themselves failed to provide the commission with the actual numbers of officers or the est ablishment figure any such ratio provided is speculative it is clear that the police were in fact overwhelmed by th extent and intensity of the violence one nsis report commented on the fact tha t officers in nairobi were fatigued after being on continuous duty for several days however this aspect only presents part of the picture contributing factors to this situation include the requirement to provide more than 54000 of ficers to be present at polling stations the failure to plan properly and the low level involvement of the military 422 mr francis kimemia cw 04 told the commission that the current ratio was 1850 while the recommended ration is 1450 427merely focussing on the total numbers of police officers is problematic whilst there may be case for an increase in police numbers some basic imperatives must preexist these include recruiting and training the ri ght people ensuring the existing police culture is conducive to embracing reform systems and processes must be of high standard an d organisational leadership must be of the highest quality other factors came to the commissions attention during it s examination of this area the conditions that police office rs work under require close attention ranging from poor remuneration to often substandard living conditions these issues combine to impact negatively on the moral and in centives that impact personal performance it is expected th at any reform process will look carefully at these issues findings in relation to review and improvement arrangements key aspect of the planning cycle found to be absent was any form of formal written debriefing and operational review process the commissioner of police told the commission that one had not yet been completed lbeit several months after the violence stopped423 other senior police fficers reinforced this approach by also confirming the absenc of formal comprehensive and written review process whilst the commission observed throughout its work that the police were not adequately resourced this does not detr act from finding that the absence of these processes amounts to serious failure on their pa rt 423 cw 01 nairobi 9 july 2008 428findings in relation to other security agencies there was little if any leadership displayed by government in dealing with the violence when it inevitably broke out although some evidence was provided to the commission that hastily formed cabinet security committee csc met early in january and the nsac provided it written b riefing dated 17th january there was more effort assigned to dealing with the outcomes of the violence rather than any real effort to stop or reduce i t variable performances exhibited by the ksim were also evid ent including an apparent absence of leadership and functi onality at the executive level exhibited by the csc two of the directives communicated by the nsac under the sign ature of the then ps ministry of state for provincial administration and internal security concerned the commission424 the instruction that psic and dsic should provide security to targeted individuals who supported t he government and pnu appears to indicate bias around just wh to protect further concern for the commission was the advice that command and coordination relationships should be streamlined given that these communications were sent on 7th and 28th january 2008 it can only be assumed that these important functions and structures were not in good operating order prior to the electio ns of 2007 the performance of provincial and district security an d intelligence committees also varied from well organised entiti that met often during the crisis determined priority action and made key cisions to others that did not engage at all when arguably they were needed most the commission is satisfied that the mili tary along with supporting agencies such as the kenya wildlife service responded appropriatel during the crisis in discharging their role in backing up the prime security agencies the commission heard nothing but positive commentary on these organs 424 these communications were referred to in the nyanza pdic minutes it is not known if they were sent to all psics 429in most cases the kenya prisons service also responded well and in the case of the naivasha prison opted to receive victims of the cr isis on their property and provide basic necessities including security for sho rt period before relocation although there was mention of inappropriate behaviour n the part of some prison officers in naivasha firm supporting evidence was provided the nsis also discharged its role reasonably well in that the daily situation reports apart from period of eight days continued t be developed throughout january and february 2008 however the commission felt that the nsis could have exercised more influence on the situation especially in the area of developing special focused reports aimed at assisting the police and others get to the heart of the violence rationale for recommended ac tion regarding the police this part recognises that in terms of the police reform programme has been commenced and against that backdrop id entifies number of key areas that require immediate action these shou ld be approached in planned coordinated and integrated way to ensure th at the very best value is gained from the resulting institut ional strengthening background like all large institutions the kenya police service is fronted with host of challenges stemming from dynamic and demanding environment at times fundamental change must be made to address new challenges and respond to the evolving and changing needs of kenyan society built over years of tradition and greatly influenced by br itish colonial convention the entrenched mandate pr incipals and functions of the kenya police continue to influence its delivery of service and int eractions with kenyan society 430the experience of this commission has shown that the ke nyan police are not always in position to identify and address problems regarding their service delivery this is why an independent examination of polici ng police is critical and must be undertaken with some urgency in spite of the development and producti on of strategic plan the kenya police have been slow to accept that police reform is necessary and are reluctant to accept that the public and others outside the police have r ole to play in shaping police policy and reforms at th heart of the debate is deciding what philosophy of policing the keny police and the public desire the commission has been in the unique position of having h eard from many members of the public government official s and from the police themselves it therefore brings much needed perspective to the public deba about the current status of the kenya police and th issues and challenges it faces not only in relation to post election violence but its overall structure and ability to deliver day to day policing services to kenya the current reform programme in determining key recommendations the commission took acco unt of number of key pieces of work signalled by the government as pri ority for action in the medium and long term key amongst these is the statement of principles on longterm issues and solutions developed through the kenya national dialogue and reconciliation mediated by he kofi annan chair of the panel of eminent african personalities on 28th february 2008 specifically identified issues for the police in agenda item 4 under constitutional and institutional reform are constitutional review to establish an independent police commission 12 months review and definition of the role of the administration police 6 months 431 review laws and issues related to security and policing includ ing the independent complaints commission citizen oversight of police services enhanced informatio n disclosures human resource management and capacity building to make them consistent with modern democratic norms 6 months finalisation and rollout of the national security poli cy to enable the relevant sectors to develop their sectoral policies recruit and train more police officers to raise the pol ice to population ratio to standard by 2012 there are also definitive reforms of the state security gencies encompassed within the kenya 2030 plan and specific targets articulated in the first medium term plan 20082012425 as well as the recently announced civilian oversight board426 informing these processes will be the over all constitutional reform that has the draft constitution bomas an d wako drafts as its base427 the commission also recognised attempts to initiate reforms by the kenya police service in their strategic plan key shortcomings relating to service delivery the absence of strong institutional mechanis ms for holding police accountable to citizens and the law and the overlapping functions of having two police agencies are identified as issues for resolution dealing with perpetrators issues and aspects relating to dealing with impunity are ful ly canvassed in chapter two it is however prudent that some focus is pplied to this subject here especially relating to the action s of police officers during the pev 425 kenya vision 2030 426 formed by way of special issue the kenya gazette notice 8144 4 september 2008 427 the proposed new constitution of kenya kenya gazette supplement 2005 dated nairobi august 2005 432given that more than nine months have passed since the start of the violence around the 2007 general elections it is unlikely that many more if any perpetrators will be held to account for their actions t han have already been d l t w i t h b t h u t h r i t i s v r m ny victims of these actions and events have not been properly heard and many mo re not heard from at all some are constantly being revictimised as they relive their experi ences every day through seeing their perpetrators living and prospering within their comm unities and some who have even occupied victims land large numbers of these perpetrators ar known considerable evidence is available to use as strong investigativ base and yet any such activity on the part of the authorities has ceased it is unlikely t hat state authorities have the capability or the will to rigorously pursue offending pa rties evidence of offending by police officers is not being actively p ursued the commission believes that special arrangem ents are required to deal with these officers as well as to independently inve stigate reported excesses of force by the police it is this way that victims and wi tnesses alike will have the confidence to come forward to provide their evidence to an independent investigative entity using reform catalyst the commission has determined that there is demonstr ated need for major police reform that takes into accoun t international best practices while recognising that policing in kenya involves some unique challe nges in order to put in place the type of reforms considered necessary the co mmission believes that the immediate establishment of spec ialised and independent police reform group prg is called for consisting of both national and international policing experts this entity should be created and begin its work immediately it is difficult to see such necessary and fa r reaching reform being implemented otherwise 433one consistent and unfortunate theme that emerged from t he commissions work was that many kenyans simply do not have trust and conf idence in their police this was borne out by the numb er of victims of violence including sexual offending who simply felt they could not report their situation to police officers variety of explanations were forthcoming ranging from the need on some occasions to pay for this service general suspicion of authorities to the fact that police officers were sometimes the perpetrators it is the view of the commission that poli cing can in fact contribute to conflict situations such as that experienced in th pev in many cases police were seen as partisan in representing or favouring just one community and in some instances supporting one political side over the other international best practice recognizes that successful policing is based upon number of broad principles those princi ples will doubtless guide the work of prg in determining priorities processes and timetab for key aspects of reform to be identified and addressed in the coming month s the five principles agreed upon by this commission are briefly outlined here the police should be representative there is much value in paying close attention to the ethnic makeup of officers in the districts and down to division and station level while it is rule of thumb that th police should reflect the community it serves kenyas multi ethni c makeup requires careful management of these arrangements the police should be impartial to achieve the former the kenya police need to exhibit impartiality in all aspects of their work i n fact impartiality is requirement in achieving representative police service of assistance to this process would be measures in cultural nsitivity training common oath of office where officers swear to respect all cultural diff erences and rigorous code of conduct stressing the need for eq ual treatment of all kenyans 434policing should be decentralized currently policing in kenya suffers from imprecise structural arrangements borne out of an antiqu ated policing model based on colonial times coupled wi th confused operational and executive command across two police agencies and provincial admini stration structure this model manifests weaknesses in being sensitive to the needs f local communities single integrated command model based upon community policing elements could potentially form the basis for overall policing reform policing should be based on respect for human rights the basic tenet here is that police need to treat everyone equally and with respec t heavy handed approaches to dealing with demonstrations and the liberal application of force much of it lethal currently applied wi ll require further and careful assessment in determining the way ahead the police should be legally and politically account able the development and application of accountability mechan isms would seem to be an immediate priority for action the current void co uld be filled by number of reforms including the establishment of police service commission nd the establishment of an independent police complaints au thority ipca428 to deal with complaints against police conduct integration of the kenya police service and administr ation police the commission believes that developing world class police service for kenya would be best achieved through the crea tion of single police agency this means integrating the current two police organs give n the revelations around the unlawful use of administration police aps aroun d the elections the fact that the current structure is inextricably linked to the provincial administration system and many of the senior officers are not police professionals integrating the aps into the kenya police service is priority activi ty 428 both initiatives are fully discussed below 435it is recognised that there are difficulties in completing this important work merging two cultures ideals systems and approaches b ut the benefits will greatly outweigh these temporary obstacles integration will provide accountabili ty resourcing service delivery and performance benefits many of which are listed here ben efits include but are not limited to total independence from the provincial administration structure and separation from national government oversight unified command and control across the board consistency and unif ormity in all facets of policing including standardised policing rvice delivery standard operating procedures sops improved in vestigations capability and intelligence gathering and dissemination increased trust and confidence in the police and policing single and unified police services board one head of p olice commissioner one strategic plan and single integrated an d well understood service delivery offering single piece of enabling legi slation force standing orders guidelines practice and operational arrangements standard systems of recruitment op tions entry standards including lateral entry options basic and sp ecialised training conditions of service including living conditions and remuneration human resource management arrangements promotion and advancem ent and leadership development including command and control significant efficiency gains from bu dgeting purchasing and utility of resources capital equipment and people the elimination of interagency tension and conflicts that impact negatively on service delivery 436police act existing legislation on the provision of policing services nd in particular the governance organisation and administration of the kenyan police is inadequate some of the key weaknesses of the present police act 196 0 revised 2002 and the police standing orders 1962 revised 2001 include unclear responsibilities and confused lines of accountability constraints around the ability to place the right people in the right jobs an inadequate system for managing staff performance and discipline issues little guidance to work with partner agencies domestically or internationally few supports to enable the use of modern policing tacti cs new legislation is needed to overcome these inadequacies removing constraints to the delivery of better policing services to the community and setting platform for more effective policing in the future police act reform would equip the kenyan police to provide the best policing services for kenyans in broad terms refo rm would be undertaken to achieve two fundamental tasks first to confir m and strengthen police governance accountability and organisational arrangements in way which is suitable for contemporary age and second to improve the polices effectiveness and establish clear framework for the exercise of policing powers police service commission the police should be politically accountable to police rvice commission originally signalled in the 2005 draft constitution the wako draft this structure would be somewhat differen t in that it would cover single amalgamated police agency it could also oversee the amalgamation process 437and be made up of representatives from elected political part ies civil society business interests and ngos there is shortage of precedents from other international jurisdictions it is envisaged that the co mmission would play role in setting policing goals bu dgets and appointing the commissioner modern code of conduct the current kenyan police disciplinary rules and processes are contained within chapter 20 of the kenyan police standing orders and are inadequate the move to new and modern code of conduct would see transiti on from the current paramilitary style of managing behavioural issues in police t more mainstream employment practice it would establish the standards for behaviour across the kenyan police service and ensure consistent behaviour new code of conduct would have to be considered in conjunction with revi sed standing orders regulations or best practices manuals the simple truth is this one of the essential component s of wellfunctioning civil society is an effective welldisciplin ed police service in which the citizens have implicit trust the purpose of modern police code of conduct is to stablish the standards of behaviour expected of all kenyan police employees not just its sworn members to be successful policing service must have the trust respect of the citizens it serves the kenyan police will be judged by the way its employees represent it it is therefore necessary to maintain high standard of professional conduct all kenyan police personnel sworn and nonsworn permanent t emporary and casual employees should be cover ed by the code of conduct the cornerstone of modern code of conduct is that all employees of the kenyan police work to the highest ethical standard code of conduct should recognise and include the following basi c principles honesty and integrity professionalism fairness and impartiality respect for pe ople and confidentiality 438strengthening investigations there was general consensus that investigations per requ ire strengthening the commission supports the notion that quality investigations are the cornerstone of the justice system as far as bringing perpetrato rs to justice is concerned an option to address current issues was ffered by attorney general wako429 was that the directorate of criminal investigations be cre ated by an act of parliament as an independent and autonomous authori ty in addition to the development of workable and funct ioning independent civilian oversight arrangements430 there should still be provisions for some less serious allegations to be investigated and resolved by police t hemselves when an authority accepts complaint for investigat ion it should decide on the type of investigation to be adopted the matt er may be appropriate for police investigation and resolution this means it would be investi gated under the supervision of senior police commander in the area whe re the matter arose and this would result in speedier resolution of the co mplaint at the conclusion of the investigation the police should ad vise the authority of the results of the investigation and the decision reached if after review of the police file the matter has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the uthority there should be provisions for the authority to initiate its own inves tigation of the matter the commission believes that structural changes alone can and will not address identified issues investigations capacity and capability are best addressed in comprehensive review as recommended alongside other policing and justice related components to ensure the best solutions are identified civilian oversight of police police conduct the commission is of the view that the hasty and presumpt ive creation of police oversight board kenya gazette notice 8144 on the 4th september 2008 ahead of the presentation of its report was unfortunat an opportunity to get it 429 cw 134 430 see below 439right has been missed the new entity has few if any f the key foundation components or properly functioning arrangements necessary for t he provision of quality civilian over sight of the police this commission carefully considered th acts and omissions of state security agencies in the context of the pev and determined that th establishment of well researched legally based professional and independen t police conduct authority would serve kenyans best throughout both the public and private in camera heari ngs this commission was presented with clear evidence that the police use of force during the post election violence period resulted in rious injury and deat h to many kenyan citizens some of these actions may well have been in compliance with existing law there is also clear indication that police used excessive force in many instances and the actions of some individual officers may ve reached the threshold of criminal conduct under current legislation and convention the police are the only state security agency with the legal mandate and author ity to investigate the conduct of its own officers and for that matter the conduct of their service as an organization431 whether justified or not there is perception in the community that investigation by the police of compla ints against the police is neither independent nor appropriate the evidence before this commission of in quiry has identified real need for police oversight by an independent body outside the police with the legislative power and authority to investigate complaints against the police and police conduct 431 despite the recent introduction of civilian oversight board 440although from time to time there are complaints about the actions of the police and concerns as to the investigation of such complaints the majority of kenyan citizens have not been directly invol ved or been exposed to the process the actions of police following the d ecember election have intensified the publics concern about police conduct and reinforced t he belief that there are systems in place for police accountability kenyan society is such that the bulk of the lawabiding citizens do not come into any open conflict with members of the po lice the post election violence period changed that completely for the first respected members of society found themselves in direct opposition to the police the police were faced with the extremely difficult task of meeting their obligation to uph old the law and order in the face of overwhelming odds and in an environment wher innocent law abiding people were in the mix and ther efore vulnerable to the police response and use of force in addition the ethnic and tribal tens ions increased during the pre and post election periods these tribal loyalties an d alliances were to be found within the kenyan police itself and there is evidence that the police were seen as agents of political parties and agendas and were therefore biased complacent or outright hostile to certain sections of the community the actions which have occurred during the post election vio lence are so serious that an immediate remedy is essential it will be essential that any independent authority to which complaints can be made and which can be dealt with be outside the police rvice itself there are advantages to the police in adopting an independent investigative procedure the police woul d longer be subject to the same criticisms but more importantly they would be less likely to be aff ected by doubtful complaints brought by suspected criminals for ulteri or motives they would also be relieved of the uncomfortable obligation to investigate profession colleagues 441when the public complaint procedure for policing service is discussed there are diverse interests that must be ac knowledged and taken into account public complaint procedure that favours the interest of complainant at the expense of the member of the service is more likely to provide satisfaction than procedure which does the reverse the interest of t he general public and the police service involved must be accorded due consideration this is based on the premise that system whereby the polic investigate complaints against police members is fundamentally flawed because of the suspicion that inevitably remains in th minds of complainants complaints procedure generally acknowledged to be fair and impartial t the public and to the police is essential if the police are to enjoy the degree of public support they needed in order to discharge their own risky and necessary tasks international police oversight entities many international jurisdictions have in troduced police oversight arrangements to ensure the independent monitoring an d scrutiny of police organisations and the actions of officers moreover number of comm onwealth countries have embraced the concept including south af rica new zealand australia trinidad and tobago canada and the united kingdom although many of these institutions are differently const ituted the fundamental underpinnings are in the main similar432 these include legislative basis specific to the entitys establishment functions and powers the operational independence from the police freedom from political interference the power to conduct its own investigations transparent operating and reporting arrangements 432 for example the independent complaints directorate in south africa is constituted under the south african police service act whilst in new zealand the independent police complaints authority is constituted under its own enactment 442the commission noted that the independ ent complaints directorate icd in south africa was established as result of the work of th truth and reconciliation commissio n who recommended that the independent complaints directorate icd be gover ned by new legislation independent of general police legislation the icd be genuinely independent of the ministry for saf ety and security the icd have powers to compel the saps and others to comp ly with its requests related to conducting an investigation includ ing powers of search and seizure the icd be given the authority to bring to the attenti on of relevant officials any failure on the part of the saps to respond to icd recommendations to take disciplinary or legal action the icd be mandated to investigate corruption within th saps rather than this task being allocated to unit within the saps the icd be given the capacity r esources and authority to conduct proactive investigations and evaluations of overall policin g policies and practice as well as to respond to complaints examples of enabling legislation from both south africa and new zealand are included in appendix f 443chapter twelve impunity definition of impunity impunity means exemption from punishment or loss 433 in the international law of human rights it refers to the failu re to bring perpetrators of human rights violation to justice and as such itself cons titutes denial of the victims right to justice and redress impunity is esp ecially common in countries that lack tradition of the rule of law suffer fr om corruption or that have entrenched systems of patronage or where the judici ary is weak or members of the security forces are protected by special jurisdiction or immuni ties the amended set of principles for the protection and promot ion of human rights through action to combat impunity submitted to the united nations commi ssion on human rights on 8 february 2005 defines impunity as the impossibility jure or facto of bringing the per petrators of violations to account whether in criminal civil admin istrative or disciplinary proceedings since they are not subject to any inquiry that might lead to their being accused arrested t ried and if found guilty sentenced to appropriate penalties and to maki ng reparations to their victims the first principle of that same document states that impunity arises from failure by states to meet the ir obligations to investigate violations to take appropriate measures in resp ect of the perpetrators particularly in the area of justice by ensuring that those suspected of criminal responsibility are prosecuted tried and duly punished to provide victims with effective remedies and t ensure that they receive reparation for the injuries suffered to ensure the inalienable right to know the truth about violation s and to take other necessary steps to prevent recurrence of violations 433 see blacks law dictionary 8th ed 444 background according to its terms of reference this commission is required to recommend measures to be taken to preven t control and eradicate the occurrence of similar deeds in future measures with regard to bringing to justice those perso ns responsible for criminal acts measures to eradicate impunity and promote national reconciliation in making such requirements we think the framers of ur tors recognized that impunity lies at the heart of preventing the kind of violence that has been witnessed in this country time and time again the eradication of impunity will therefore not only blow off the cover for persons who break the law of the land but also deter others who may contempl ate similar deeds in future firm foundation in the rule of law would also promote national reconciliation the elements of systemic and institutional deficiencies co rruption and entrenched negative socio political culture have in our view caused and promoted impunity in this country election related vi olence provides the best illustration of the malady where in fi veyear cycles since 1992 when multiparty politics was introduced pre and postele ction violence has rocked various parts of the country despite official inquiries an d identification of the root causes being made we shall examine the issues of investigation p rosecution and adjudication of crimes in an effort to understand why impunity thrives in this country 445investigation prosecution and adjudication of guilt the issue of impunity is directly related to the abil ity of the state to prosecute persons for criminal offences it is ou r view that the office of the attorney general occupies an important and strategi c position in dealing with the issue of impunity with view to shedding more light on that office we invited the hon the attorney general of the republic of kenya mr am sitswila wako who has been in office for the last 17 years to testify before the commission the power to undertake criminal prosecut ions in kenya is reposed in the office of the attorney general under section 26 of the constitut ion which provides that the attorney general has the power to institute nd undertake criminal proceedings against any person take over and continue any prosecution commenced by any other person and also takeover and d iscontinue proceedings at any stage before judgment is delivered in practice the power to prosecute some cases is delegated to other agencies of state like the kenya police and even where this done it is done under the superviso ry authority of the attorney general under section 264 of the constit ution the attorney general also has the power to require the commissioner of police to investigate any matter which relates to any offence alleged or suspected it is mandatory once the request is made that the commission er of police shall comply with the request mr wako434 testified before us and enumerated some attempts m ade by various institutions to investigate electio n related violence among them the national assembly which set up select committee to investigate ethnic clashes in western and other parts of kenya 1992 otherwise known as the kiliku committee435 the standing committee on human rights kenya governm ent appointed committee to advise on human rights violations the 434 cw134 435 exhibit 136a 446standing committee investigated skirmishes occurring at the coastal region in 1998 and released report titled recent disturbances at the coast province from 13th august to date the law society of kenya in exercise of its mandate und er the law society of kenya act investigated and made report on t he violence in coast province related to the at tack on likoni police station on 13th august 1998 the judicial commission of inqu iry on the tribal clashes that occurred in various parts of kenya since 1991 otherwise known as the akiwumi commission various recommendations were made in those inquiries but t he akiwumi commission which considered the earlier reports on ethnic violence was more comprehensive how did the gove rnment deal with the report the akiwumi commission of inquiry the akiwumi commission was appointed on 1st july 1998 and its life was variously extended up to 31st july 1999 when it completed its report and submitted it to president daniel arap moi on 19th august 1999 its terms of reference which were not dissimilar to those of this comm ission were as follows to investigate the tribal clashes that have occurred in variou s parts of kenya since 1991 with view of establishing andor determinin g i the origin the probable the immediate and the underly ing causes of such clashes ii the action taken by the police and other law enforcemen t agencies with respect to any incidents of crime arising out of or committ ed in the course of the said tribal clashes and where such action was i nadequate or insufficient the reasons there for iii the level of preparedness and the effectiveness of law enfor cement agencies in controlling the said tribal clashes and in prev enting the occurrence of such tribal clashes in future b to recommend 447i prosecution or further criminal investigations against ny persons or persons who may have committed offences related to such triba l clashes ii ways means and measures that must be taken to prevent trol or eradicate such clashes in future iii to do inquire into or investigate any other matter that is incidental to or connected with the foregoing for three years however the contents of the report were t made public until considerable public pressure was brought to bear on the gove rnment and it was released to the public in october 2 002 but not without reservations the government rejected part of the report that related to t he rift valley and especially the kalenjin and maasai communities and in support of that assertion it produced 31 page undated document which had author or signatory entitled comments on commission of inquiry report 436 pressed to identify the author the attorney general said it was authored by the government presumably the president at the time at whose instanc the commission had been set up and to whom the report had b een submitted the reasons advanced for the partial rejection was that the report was not objective it took extraneous matters into account ignored some eviden ce did not give due weight to some evidence and gave lot of weight to some evidence more than warranted its findings and recommendations were b iased and prejudiced the commentary which the government directed should be read together with the akiwumi report concluded the sad chapter of the clashes in the countrys hist ory should be brought to an end to give kenyans chance to start afresh as brothers and sisters in this multiparty era accordingly in the absence of evidence to form the basis for prosecution to recommend charges or prosecution against any person sic but where there is evidence to show lapse in th performance of administrative duties or misconduct 436 exhibit 134b 448recommendations can be made for other forms of condemna tion including ia naming and iib admonishing despite the position taken by the government the attorney general testified that he had in exercise of his independent constitutiona l mandate acted on the report two years earlier we quote the relevant part of his press release dated 1st october 2002 the attorney general by letter dated 14th march 2000 in exercise of the constitutional powers under s264 of the cons titution directed that expeditious diligent and expeditious investiga tions be carried out against all persons whom the commission had recommended th at they be investigated regarding their role in tribal clash and in particular those mentioned in paragraphs 526 527 and 528 of the akiwumi report the director of criminal investigations by his letter date d 19th february 2001 forwarded to the attorney general the relev ant duplicate inquiry files 70 in number for my perusal nd necessary action of those 70 files the attorney general ordered further investigations in 40 cases of these 40 files 18 invest igations files were returned to the attorney general on 1st october 2001 after further investigations the attorney general after furth er perusal ordered further investigations in number of the cases the investigations are therefore still continuing in nu mber of cases i assure the public that when i get an investigatio n file with sufficient evidence provable in court of law which can establish prima facie case prosecution will ensue as matter of course437 what became of those investigations again we shall quote the ttorney general verbatim in his sworn testimony before the commission on 25th august 2008 437 exhibit 134c 449in some cases investigations were carried out and files bmitted to with findings that evidence was disclosed against named persons and with recommendations that the inquiry file to be closed in other cases the files submitted to were found to be incomplete and deficient in critical aspects in all such cas including some of the cases where closure was recommended the inquiry files wo uld be returned back to the police on my behalf by the direct or of public prosecutions with directives to carry out further invest igations some of those files would again be resubmitted to of ten times after inordinate long periods and without significant eviden ce having been gathered many of the returned files would never be resubm itted again many reasons could be attributed for this u nsatisfactory state of affairs including i genuine difficulties in investigating and getting witnesses because of their fear of reprisals within the context of the ethnic clashes ii lack of capacity and resources on the part of the investigating authorities iii self censorships or fear on the part of the investigators who are susceptible to pressure and manipulation it should be noted that although the attorney general h as power to request investigations to be carried out by the commissi oner of police he has enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance furthermore the police investigators are subject to discip line and control not by the attorney general but the commissioner of police in passing we express our doubts about the impotence expres sed by the attorney general in enforcing the directives given to the c ommissioner of police as stated earlier the constitution mak it mandatory for the commissioner to comply and the consequences of breach should be obvious at the request of this commission the attorney gen eral forwarded further correspondence to confirm further follow up of investiga tions and bundle of documents was placed before us438 among them was the letter dated 14th 438 letter ref agconf6d121 vol 1 dated 25th august 2008 450march

writer then analysed the allegations made the evidence gainst the named persons and his findin gs on each and continued general observation the investigation team in the course of its investigation s toured the areas affected by tribal clashes and having gone through the paraphernalia of gathering evidence noted the following χ the time lapse from the moment some of the incidences of the t ribal clashes occurred and the time the inquiry was conducted re sulted into some witnesses not being traced whilst some traced ones were u nable to correctly remember the sequence of events of the clashes hence lack of corr oboration on the other hand scores of witnesses who volunteered th eir statements were ostensibly upset with the recollection of what happ ened and therefore ended up giving vindictive statements out of bitterness survey on the list of witnesses in the commissions rep ort show that most if not all of them are public servants politicians and lawyers these by all standards are administrative witnesses who were neither t the scene of clashes nor victims of the clashes and could not therefore ad duce direct evidence in relation to the clashes ε more critical glance at the list of persons recommended by th akiwumi commission to be investigated revealed that they were the same people who testified before the very commission as witnesses but on realizing that their testimony before the akiwumi commission had started imp inging negatively on their well being decided to assume defensive stand i n recording of their statement with the police situation which gave r ise to the concealment of vital clash related information φ most of the politicians who recommended to be investigated wa s as result of their divergent and inflammatory political views as r eported in local newspapers produced as exhibits before the akiwumi comm ission of inquiry however the evidence to support the veracity of such poli tical views were obviously lacking as the whole mill of allegations was nly anchored on 452information captured by local newspapers without any for tification by the evidence of independent witnesses please advice yours fka sang cbs director of criminal investigations encs 70 duplicate inquiry files cc philemon abongo mgh mbs commissioner of police police headquarters pobox 30083 nairobi that was seven years ago and the latest report from the criminal investigation department dated 21st august 2008 shows that 37 out of the 70 files were closed 9 files are with the dpp having been resubmitted af ter further investigations and 24 are with the poli ce for further investigations the reference made by the attorney general in the press statement issued on 1st october 2002 that 1324 persons had been charged for various offences ranging from murder inciting violence and taking part in riots relating to the clashes which occurred between october 1991 and december 1992 was not related to the findings of the akiwumi report the figures were pre sented to parliament on 27th april 1993 in response to question by member of parliament for gichugu ms karua the same process of investigation in resp ect of the kiliku report and the report prepared by the standing committee was different the attorney general would make the request under s 26 of the constitution an d the police investigators would dutifully report on th lack of evidence and difficulties associated with collection of it in the end the attor ney general testified that he had done all he could within his powers to fight impun ity to quote him verbatim in cross examination 453ahmednassir now weve seen that impunity is problem for the benefit of this commission can you highligh t your achievements of your 17 year tenure in your fight agains t impunity what have you done to fight impunity for 17 years amos wako within my constitutional mandate what ive done is to do what i ought to have done and that i s to direct the commissioner of police to investigate and that i ve done even in cases where politically i should not have done l ike the akiwumi report if you read the akiwumi report and the re buttal weak attorney general would not have directed the commissioner of police to investigate all the people mentio ned there he would have said these are politically correc t i would not investigate them nor direct investigation of them nd so on but i did direct even if those people were regarded as politically correct i did direct investigations in view of the lack of any visible prosec ution against perpetrators of politically related violence the perception has pervaded for sometim now that the attorney general cannot act effectively or at all to deal with ch perpetrators and this in our view has promoted the sense of impunity and embolde ned those who peddle their trade of violence during the elec tion periods to continue doing so the attorney general readily acknowledged that there was gridlock in the criminal justice system and particularly at the investigative level he proposed the establishment of an independent investigative arm of government through an act of parliament for directorate of criminal investigations to match the currently independent prosecution and judi cial functions of the criminal justice system curiously we note that at the time the ttorney general made request to the commissioner of police to investigate the pe rsons named in the akiwumi report the department of criminal investigation s was directly under the office of the president it follows and we can safely conclude that it was indeed very difficult for th officers working directly under the same president who had made strong reservations about th report to come to different view 454from the presidents the attorney general himself ca ndidly accepted this reality i think it is precisely for this reason that du ring the tenure of the first attorney general in independent kenya the criminal investigation arm of the police was under the ttorney general and not under the police commissioner this made t he police investigators answerable to the attorney general and execution of the attorney generals general directives was therefore prompt effective and efficient this arrangem ent also insulated the cid officers from interference and manipul ation flawed investigative process is the very antithesis of successful prosecution in other words the quality of investig ation affects the outcome of both the prosecution and adjudication of the matt er and where there are successful prosecutions the culture of impunity cree ps in as people commit crimes with the knowledge that it is unlikely that proper investigatio n will be carried out the sorry state of the criminal justice syst em continued to play itself out even as this commission was in the ddle of its hearings on 21st june 2008 the attorney general appointed joint team of his officer s and police officers to review all cases related to postelection violence includi ng cases of persons charged and are in remand cases of persons charged but are ou t on bail cases pending arrest of known persons cases of persons in police cu stody but are not yet charged results of such exercise were furnished to th commission despite requests and promises up to the time of writing our report other aspects of the criminal justice system the other weakness in the criminal justice system as pointed out by the attorney general is the lack of professional manpower in the dep artment of public prosecutions where only 64 state counsel serve the entire country against an establishment of 94 the ideal complime nt would be 450 to replace 365 police prosecutors currently undertak ing that vital function 455it was necessary in the attorney generals recommendation to empower the prosecution department by granting security of tenure to the director of public prosecutions and improving the terms and conditions for hiring and retaining staff it is also necessary to revamp the capacity of the judicial function commensurately to complete fully independent and effi cient chain of administration of criminal justice obstacles to investigation of post election violence pev this commission recognizes that there are real and genui ne difficulties in investigating violence of such magnitude as took place after the 2007 elections some of these difficulties have been experienced by this commission in its work and we do not doubt that any investig ating agency will experience some difficulty some of the practical problems any investigative agency would face in investigating pev include the following most of the complainants and witnesses were victims of displ acement hence it may be difficult trace them to carry out full and proper investigations the nature of violence is one that invites expectation of retribution if person gives evidence against perpetrator in most cases the perpetrators were persons known to the victim hence the fear for retribution is real where the perpetrator of violence is an agent of state r perceived to be associated with an agency of state there is reluctance to cooperate with or give evidence to the state the attorney general in his testimony lamented the lack of witness protection programme as part of the frustrations faced by investigators while it was difficult enough to trace would be witnesses who were disp laced following the violence those who were traceable were reluctant to record statements and actively participate in identification parades or appear in court to testify for fear of reprisals furthermore the witness protection act wh ich became operational 456on 2nd september 2008 remains untested and has received bu dgetary allocation of only ksh20 million this financial year lack of political will and fear of the political blishment the akiwumi report and the accompan ying comments by the government were released in 2002 as this constituted an official inquiry into the endemic problem of ethnic clashes one would ve thought that the contents of the report would make compulsory readin g for all government administrators particularly those working in clash prone areas we were shocked however that such an endeavour which was funded from the public purse would provide lessons for those in positions of leadership the perm anent secretary in charge of provincial administ ration and inte rnal security439 confirmed that he had not read the akiwumi commission report and to us it did not come as matter of surprise either that his subordinates the pcs and dcs had knowledge of the report let alone the issues raised th erein for example the dc molo who testified before us confirmed that he had not read the akiwumi and kiliku reports yet his district was at th epicentre of ethnic and land clashes he stated that he had intelligence reports in my office and these were sufficient440 our view is that the lackadaisical ma nner in which the government dealt with the akiwumi report only goes to illustrate that the state w as not particularly interested in resolving once and for all the issue of ethn ic violence those who benefited from it were secure in the knowledge that the report notwithstanding its deficiencies would continue to gather dust and the issue of ethnic violence would be on the back burner to be resurrected when the n ext election came 439 cw 4 440 cw 56 457during the hearings the commission expl ored why concerted effort had not been made by the government to arrest and prosecute tho who are alleged to have incited funded and promoted viol ence instead of concentrating on minor actors in the mayhem most administrators spoke of fear of the general population and also fear of the political leadership commission witness 80 gave the example of three councillors who were arrested in l itein in bureti district on account of inciting violence he stated441 when you arrest the socalled politicians people do nt look into the crime they say that the police have arrested ne of their own we arrested some councillors in buret and the crowd was so rowdy they stormed the whole buret poli ce station so much so that we were compelled to release those councillors there is of course symbiotic relation ship between the politicians and their supporters which continues to fuel impunity politician s rely on their supporters to enforce immunity while their supporters who are the hand maidens of the violence get protection from the politi cal god fathers this interference normally comes in the form of orders from above senior police officer testified to this442 q we have also noted that there was tension in kisiiluo border it is common phenomenal my lord this i found to be common and when i follow ed the genesis of this problem even in 2002 and 1997 that is the area where the luos were fighting the kisii so it was potentially cha rged area my lord but what we were seeing is that the politicia ns were now working up the youth so that the two sides the luo fro m the rongo and kisii south district could now be at loggerheads q did you manage to find these people inciting and organizin g the youths 441 cw 97 we were informed that in fact the councillors were demonstrating against the alleged police shooting of two teachers 442 cw 97 458a well we were able we didnt really arrest them beca use we didnt want to create more tension than before so what we were doing is that we used to call the politicians and talk to them nd say we know what you are up to and most of them once they know we know they sort of die down so actually there was fighting at that border q and you talked about some criminal gangs called chikoro ro did you monitor this gang we monitored chikororo and my lords incidentally in that area the criminal gangs are very many there you find the nchi kororo you find sungusungu and you find amachuma this is all in that area and ochororo area these are groups which are basica lly according to our investigations we found that these are men and not r eally boys my lord who are used specifically when the elections are nea r to scare away potential voters who are against parti cular candidate so they are used every time there is an election q and you do anything about that we sort of arrested most of them because most of them ar known we arrested most of the nchikororo and sungusungu and we d lot of problems q you had what lot of problems because there was lot of tension we rrest pressure is put i release them that they should at ast be released q when you talk about pressure what kind of pressure was it you find that i get calls from nairobi my boss says did you arrest these people i say yes for this and that then he says we ll warn them let them go home i comply q and you said your boss is the police commissioner my lords my boss is the commissioner of police q so they would get arrested and you have to release them yes we release them q and when you arrested them there would be tension in ll those areas because you have arrested them of course 459a yes my lords that is what we were noticing that now there will be lot of tension even than before so that is why i am s aying these are just imaginations to play to the psychology of people or us because they know that once we arrest them they indicate everybod else so that now we cant even more or operate q did you find any politicians who were either organizing or inciting these particular youths my lords for this particular chinkororo hon nyachae was behind q and when you say behind what exactly do you mean he is the one who organize financed they were known as hi s people q and did you find any tangible evidence of this organizati on of financing that is where the problem is my lords because to get tangible evidence was very difficult but as we go along investigatin g you come across some evidence that so and so we have arrested that person that person is aligned to so and so so you see pattern of this group you arrest you see which group now turns up making lot of noise or even calling my boss or whatever but to get ta ngible evidence you say yes he paid them money q do you know that whoever was organizing them has direc t connections to your superiors at least my lords not direct connection i wont call it di rect connection my lords q or had connection to level above you what they were doing according to is that once we arrest they couldnt call direct here in kisumu but there is way of circumventing i dont know who and then they get my boss so it would come from my boss when i report because we kept on talk ing many times in the cause of the day in the morning hours or even in the evening briefs i will inform him i have all these p eople arrested i have detained them in this police station may be after day he will call and say you remember those people you arrested give them unconditional release and i will comply and people will go 460q the issue i am putting to you obviously these people you we re arresting have direct connections to persons who are higher up who are able to talk or find their way to the commissioner obviously even if they were not financing at least you can say the had some influential connections somewhere yes my lord i can say that this symbiotic relationship between the politicians and their supporters creates real and genuine fear among those who enforce the law one provincial commissioner testified that he feared to order the arrest of senior politicians involved in the incitement of violence b ecause his job would be at stake the pc echoed the words of his police counterpart francis gichu ki made 10 years ago before the akiwumi commission my lords in political government we have to be caut ious this is political government443 there must be an end to this cowardice and pious sense of self preservation in public service if impunity will be eradicated in this cou ntry the judicial function in order to seek further clar ification on and find solutions to the gridlock in the criminal justice system we also invited the registrar of the high court to shed some light on the measures the judiciar has taken to address the situation the registrar was unable to testify in person but forwar ded statement dated 28th august 2008 for long time now the judiciary has been vilified for failure to play its pivotal role in the democratic governance of th is country of the three arms of government it is the least understood and has therefore acq uired the notoriety of losing the confidence and trust of those it must ser ve because of the perception that it is not independent as an institution even if some individual 443 akiwumi report pg 284 523 461members of it were that is why for example the lea dership and members of the odm refused to submit to the jurisdiction of the cou rts to resolve the dispute that arose after the 2007 general elections in relation t the presidential results the institution has also been accused of delays in the admin istration of justice and for nontransparency in its functions in response to those accusations the registrar stated that th ere has been major reform initiatives made by the judiciary so far and th ey continue to be made some interventions for speedy delivery of justice effec ted so far include recruitment of more magistrates and expansion of the ca pacity to appoint more judges establishment of court users committees where all actors in the criminal justice system meet and resolve operational difficulties customer care desks to address public concerns mobile courts for remote areas construction of new courts around the country annual open day sessions for interaction with consumers of justice publicizing judici service charter for education of the public introduction of continuous legal education for judicial officers through the judicial training institute comprehensive review an d simplification of rules of procedure both civil and criminal and the establi shment of the expeditious disposal of cases committee which has vised modalities for reducing backlog of cases in our view while the administrative re form initiatives so far undertaken are commendable nothing short of comprehensiv constitutional reforms will restore the desired confidence and trust in the judiciary the noncontentious provisions in the draft new constitution provided new hope in the institution but there is certainty as to when it will become law proposals for the enactment of the judicial service bill which would guarantee financial and operational independence appointment discipline and rem oval of judicial officers independence and autonomy of the judicial service commission amongst other provisions are yet to be considered by parliam ent 462in the context of the postelection vi olence the police arrested numerous suspected offenders in more than 13000 incidents and 1337 ca ses were taken to court the registrar was unable to confirm the progress in the hearing and adjudication of those cases many more are pending under investigations others are pending arrest of known persons the influx f postelection violence cases in our view poses big challenge to the judiciary c onsidering the special nature of those cases and desira bility of expeditious disposal amnesty meaning we undertook in our various briefs to ad dress the socalled amnesty debate in our final report it is socalled becaus both sides of the debate have varying definitions for amnesty and consequently how it can be applied in the context of postelection violence the difficulty is not misplaced as indeed controversy has dogged the term since the greeks gave it to the world from amnestia the same root word for amnesia in common parlance amn esty is the act of an authority eg parliament or government by which the sta restores those who may have been guilty of an offence agai nst it to the positions of innocent p r s n s i t i n c l u d s m r t h n p r d n i n s m u c h s i t b l i t r t s l l l g l remembrance of the offence444 the dictionary meaning is general pardon especially for political offences445 amnesty may be extended when the authority decides that brin ging citizens into compliance with the law is more important than punishin g them for past offences some advantages cited for us ing amnesty include avoiding expensive prosecutions especially when massi ve numbers of violators are involved prompting violators to come forward who might otherwis have eluded authorities and promoting reconciliation between offenders and society the application of amnesty nevertheless raises issues of justice it implies impunity 444 research under tor 2 iii 445 the concise oxford dictionary 463that people can commit atrocities and say that they will only stop it if they are given amnesty446 the debate simply put the proponents of amnesty contend and passion ately so that the thousands of youth who were arrested an d detained in the postelection violence were exercising their democratic right to demonstrate against stolen election and therefore committed offence it was the reactio n of the police to the peaceful demonstrators which caused viol ence indeed if it was not for the youth there would be coalition gove rnment the release of arrested youth has so b een t i ed up wi t h res et t l ement f id ps as quid pro quo we take it from the secretary general of odm party prof anyang nyo ngo 447 thus the youth who were arrested should be set free as they we re exercising their democratic right to express themselves when pol ice procured violence on the other hand the opponents conten d equally passionately that human rights violations and crimes of unpreced ented gravity with serious ramifications for the future of this country were committed and the per petrators at all levels must face the full force of the law amnesty would encoura ge impunity the numbers intertwined with the issue of amnesty in principle was the issue of the number of youths arrested and detained in police custody and on ce again the parties on both sides of the debate were unhelpful in our effort to establish the exact number and identities of those who were arrested and w ere still in police custody 446 submissions from civil society and research under tor 2 aiii 447 cw 138 464we invited several witnesses to shed some light on it one was prof nyongo who stated qyou made an allegation that there are youths still being held in police custody first and foremost who are these youths how man are they and would you know where they are being held in police custody anyang nyongo mr chairman the attorney general has details on the youths and indeed i do believe that he has made presentations to the commission but mr chairman if you want more details we are quite prepared to do so but i do know that the attorney general has made presentations to this commission and although some of his figures can be doubted but i think that is for further examination by the commission to prove how many youths are still in custody chairman unfortunately the attorney general did not give us anyt hing he says the police have the information so if you have the inform ation we would like to have it anyang nyongo okay chairman i could do so not now but i know th at the evidence exists chairman thats alright if you undertake to produce it we will be happy to have it thank you despite the promise to shore up the clai m further information was received by the time we made our report the other example was the chairman of the luo council of elders ker riaga ogallo who responded t hus protas yes on the issue of the luo youth who have been arrested as consequence of the violence that erupted in kisumu i was wond ering if the luo council of elders or any other institution of the luo co mmunity that you are aware of if there are any keeping of any records kept somewhere either with your organization the luo council of elders or any ther luo or kisumu based community organization that you know of that have kept records the number and the names if possible of all the youth who were arrested at that time riaga ogallo the i think even police commissioner issue those who were arrested in kisumu they issue them i think if you we re here and yourself if you were able to listen to radios and papers they issue them not their name but the number though the number was small bu t those who were arrested were bigger than the number which was given out by the police spokesman and those who were killed were also the number police gave out were small but those who even kisumu mortuary were full of those people who were killed by they were over 46 people and they say 15 people 465 protas yes thats the reason why i was hoping that may be sour ces other than police and i was hoping that may be the luo council of elders or any other communitybased organization could have kept some n onofficial records of these arrests and the reason is because you allude to you obviously support their release and you must be aware of th debate that surrounds this issue whereby some in government and elsewhe re argue as you do that these youths should be left free and others op pose this and related issue on that debate concerns the number of these you ths arrested some people put the number figure to thousands and even mo re and i think the number that police the police have given has been stro ngly disputed by some people including some in the government so there is obviously problem with number with number of youths who were arrested and i was hoping that may be we could have in addition to figures that have been provided to us by police i was hoping that you may be aware of some other sources where we could get other figures riaga ogallo you know this thing when it happened police were all over nyanza in every district they were there and demonst rations were being carried out all over in my area or in oyugis in front of my home they killed one boy when i am seeing like this one i am seeing lik this and then they shot at him and in the town of oyugis alone over 100 boys we re gunned down and those who were arrested because police ce lls were full with those people who were arrested we could not know the numb er but what we know they were arrested the ker continued chairman and that is why we are talking about the amnesty debat because it is an important aspect of our investigations w hich we must address are there youths who were arrested if so how man are there youths who were charged in courts if so how many are ther still youths who were detained in some place and nobody knows how m any they are are there some who were killed are there some who disappeare d and we would suspect that your council would have information of that nature this is why i revert to the question my brother asked you dont have that information as council riaga ogallo we dont have the number but the information were sti ll having there are some youths who participated in this elec tion violence who have not been seen in their respective areas though some were killed and those who were killed their families took them for buria l so they knew that soandso is killed and those who disappeared they were the re they were arrested until now they have not been captured where th ey are chairman that is the question 466riaga ogallo were still also asking that question chairman that is the question because if my family was affected assuming that i was in luo nyanza and my family was ffected my was went out that day we suspect he got involved we neve r found him in the mortuary he was nowhere in any hospital we have never found him for the last six months i would come to the council of eld ers to assist if i was helpless are you saying one has ever come to compl aint about any missing person riaga ogallo sir chairman any missing young person riaga ogallo your honour sir they have come when we also go to the police station they told us that we dont have them you know where they are that is the answer were getting from police chairman yes that is so but you have the list of those who are missi ng riaga ogallo the list we have not compiled yet chairman is it possible to compile that list so that we can address t hat issue instead of hearing there are young people who are m issing somebody has that list or can compile one and nobody is giving it to anybody that well never find any solution unless we add ress that issue riaga ogallo but this time at the moment i cannot commit tha t one because i dont have funds for going round because it i s wide area when i commit myself i will avail the list now that i ca nnot do that one you honour as for the definition of youth ker ogallo said when i refer to youths these young people who still have hot tempered people these young people from 30 coming to 18 they are high tempered people to control t hem is becoming problem when something comes abruptly it did not matter whether they were in school work business or just idle the flipside was the police version and the commissioner of police categorically denied the accusation that the police had arrested any youth s who were still in their custody as at the time he testified on 9th july 2008 the police he said had received complaints on 13416 cases which they were i nvestigating they had taken all the people arrested to court in accordance with the law and their 467release was longer in the hands of the police when the attorney general testified before the commission on 21st august 2008 he alluded to an audit of all cases before the courts but did not disclose any figures as the matter was before the cabinet he said in part i may here mention that i received very many complaints that there are some people who are being charged or who are in custody and there is sufficient evidence some have not even been charged and so on lt hough t hey re in rema nd act ua lly very m ny com pla int s from all over the country so i set up in toward s the end of june beginning of july joint team of two senior officers f rom my office and from the police to carry out an audit of those ca ses which are before the court and look at the files and to see where there is evidence to recommend continuation and where these is evi dence termination but purely from the point of view of evidence or eviden ce so that this allegation that there are some people who are being ch arged who were charged there is evidence and the state is deli berately delaying the hearing of those cases for long time so as to delay those people in custody is not there so there is team now which is carrying out what i would call an audit of the cases w hich are before the court in sum there was evidence before us which we could evaluate to determine the number of youths if any arrested and still being det ained by police the law it would be against the constitution to arrest and hold any person suspected of committing crime for more than 24 ho urs or 14 days if the offence is punishable by death448 the amnesty debate would therefore be misplaced if it makes reference to persons arrested and detained beyond such periods since they would not be lawfully held there is further pro tection of the law under section 77 of the constitution the power to prosecute any ffence or not also 448 section 72 3 b of the constitution 468lies exclusively in the office of the attorney general und er section 26 of the constitution as discussed earlier when the amnesty d ebate was put to him the hon the attorney general stated pascal kambale there is this issue about the so called amnesty debate and what we understand is that this is being discus sed within the cabinet and you obviously are member of the government what c an you tell us about where this debate is now attorney general i cannot of course mention anything that is discussed in cabinet i have prescribed to constitutional oat h of secrecy in fact thats top secret you see so i cannot even mention what is there but what i can tell you is the position of the attorney general now is t hat all cases where there is evidence must be prosecuted to the logical end and all cases where there is sufficient evidence should be terminated th at is the position of the attorney general there are some people who will say that oh everything should be the debate is going on it is in the p ublic domain i am not part of that debate the law also provides in section 27 of the constitution that the president has the prerogative of mercy on various categories of pers ons listed under that section he also has the liberty to consult with an advisory committee set up under the same constitution in sections 28 and 29 apart from relevant legal provisions in municipal law we are also guided by international criminal law which does not recognise am nesty for gross human rights violators conclusion from our own analysis of the amnesty debate we think it has been unduly p l i t i c i z d n b t h s i d s i t i s i m p r t i v t g u r d g i n s t f u r t h r encouragement of the culture of impunity by granting blanket amnesty to all and sundry in the postelection mayhem th ere were obvious and serious criminal offences committed under the laws of this country s well as breaches of human rights under international law the vi ctims of the violence and international 469human rights defenders would be devastated if such amnesty was granted it is incumbent on the attorney general therefore to apply the law firmly and equitably for as long as it takes to bring to justice those persons who were culpable having said that we realize and we have stated it above that there are special challenges in terms of investigations an d prosecution of postelection violence f f n c s i t m b n c s s r t c n s i d er an offer of amnesty to some minor offenders in exchange for truthful confe ssion and assistance in the arrest and prosecution of the planners organizers fi nanciers and in the case of security agencies the perpetrators of the postelection violence other creative initiatives must also be devised to aid in investigations and prosec ution of the offenders most importantly the provisions of the new witness protect ion act 2008 should be fully utilized in aid of pev related investigations an d prosecutions findings we find in our assessment that the chain of criminal justice system is generally weak and the weakest link is the invest igative function the weakness in the system impacts on the rule of law and therefore promotes impunity urgent corrective measures must therefore be taken 470 part v recommendations 471 472 chapter thirteen recommendations this chapter contains the commissions
