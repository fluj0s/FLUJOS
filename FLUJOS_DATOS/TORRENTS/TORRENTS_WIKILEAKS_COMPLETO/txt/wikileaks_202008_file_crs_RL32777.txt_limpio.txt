of issues and options february 22 2005 eric fischer senior specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress creating national framework for cybersecurity an analysis of issues and options summary even before the terrorist attacks of september 2001 concerns had been rising among security experts about the vulnerabilities to attack of computer systems and associated infrastructure yet despite increasing attention from federal and state governments and international organizations the defense against attacks on these systems has appeared to be generally fragmented and varying widely in effectiveness concerns have grown that what is needed is national cybersecurity framework coordinated coherent set of public and privatesector efforts required to ensure an acceptable level of cybersecurity for the nation as commonly used cybersecurity refers to three things measures to protect information technology the information it contains processes and transmits and associated physical and virtual elements which together comprise cyberspace the degree of protection resulting from application of those measures and the associated field of professional endeavor virtually any element of cyberspace can be at risk and the degree of interconnection of those elements can make it difficult to determine the extent of the cybersecurity framework that is needed identifying the major weaknesses in us cybersecurity is an area of some controversy however some components appear to be sources of potentially significant risk because either major vulnerabilities have been identified or substantial impacts could result from successful attack in particular components that play critical roles in elements of critical infrastructure widely used commercial software organizational governance and the level of public knowledge and perception about cybersecurity there are several options for broadly addressing weaknesses in cybersecurity they include adopting standards and certification promulgating best practices and guidelines using benchmarks and checklists use of auditing improving training and education building security into enterprise architecture using risk management and using metrics these different approaches all have different strengths and weaknesses with respect to how they might contribute to the development of national framework for cybersecurity none of them are likely to be widely adopted in the absence of sufficient economic incentives for cybersecurity many observers believe that cyberspace has too many of the properties of commons for market forces alone to provide those incentives also current federal laws regulations and publicprivate partnerships appear to be much narrower in scope than the policies called for in the national strategy to secure cyberspace and similar documents some recent laws do provide regulatory incentives for corporate management to address cybersecurity issues potential models for additional action include the response to the year2000 computer problem and federal safety and environmental regulations congress might consider encouraging the widespread adoption of cybersecurity standards and best practices procurement leveraging by the federal government mandatory reporting of incidents the use of product liability actions the development of cybersecurity insurance and strengthened federal cybersecurity programs in the department of homeland security and elsewhere this report will be updated in

issues and options even before the terrorist attacks of september 2001 concerns had been rising among security experts about the vulnerabilities to attack of computer systems and associated infrastructure there were several reasons for those rising concerns first computer systems were becoming increasingly powerful and increasingly interconnected with many enterprises in the public and private sectors coming to rely on them for fundamental business functions second the size and reach of the internet was growing dramatically not only were more and more businesses and households in the united states using the internet but the same phenomenon was happening worldwide third the number and sophistication of attacks by criminals and vandals was growing and many experts thought that terrorists and other adversaries were preparing to launch attacks on computer systems via the internet or other means those trends have generally continued over the last several years yet despite increasing attention from federal and state governments and international organizations the defense against attacks on these systems has appeared to be generally fragmented and varying widely in effectiveness even with the establishment of the department of homeland security by the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 with its consolidation of several cybersecurity efforts within the information assurance and infrastructure protection directorate and the subsequent publication of the national strategy to secure cyberspace nssc1 concerns grew that more coordinated coherent approach what might be called national cybersecurity framework2 was needed what such framework should consist of whom it should apply to and how it should be developed and implemented have remained uncertain several processes are underway that may contribute to the development of such framework ranging from some sector specific activities to proposals for federal legislation the issues associated with that development can be difficult to understand and address for several reasons perhaps most notably because of the sheer size complexity and interconnectedness of the information infrastructure and associated technology and applications the purpose 1 the white house national strategy to secure cyberspace february 2003 httpwwwwhitehousegovpcipbcyberspace_strategypdf 2 see for example f william connor and others information security governance call to action report of the corporate governance task force april 2004 available at httpwwwcyberpartnershiporginitgovernancehtml and chris klaus and others recommendations report report of the technical standards and common criteria task force april 2004 available at httpwwwcyberpartnershiporginittechhtml these reports discuss and examine frameworks within the scope of the issues each covers governance and technical standards respectively crs2 of this report is to lend structure to the debate about those issues by examining some fundamental concepts and questions relating to framework national cybersecurity framework can be thought of as the essential set of public and privatesector efforts required to ensure an acceptable level of cybersecurity for the nation to be effective such framework would need to operate in at least four dimensions one perhaps the most obvious consists of the elements of cybersecurity it includes both the general approach eg goals best practices benchmarks standards and specific areas of focus such as technology process and people second dimension is the components of cyberspace what would be covered by the framework that includes both specific elements such as computer operating systems and internet servers and the sectors which would be involved third dimension is the method of application for example should the framework be required voluntary or ad hoc the fourth dimension is the functions and goals of the framework is its purpose to defend against crime to improve the environment for electronic commerce to protect critical infrastructure or some combination of those consensus proposal for cybersecurity framework has yet emerged and suggestions tend to focus on different approaches and components some of those emphasize cybersecurity policies and goals others procedures still others technology some stress standards others best practices or benchmarks and still others focus on guidelines this diversity of possible approaches can complicate examination of the issues further complication may arise from the lack of consensus meanings for terms used to denote different approaches to examine what kind of framework may be needed and how it might be implemented it may be helpful to address three questions 1 where are the major cybersecurity weaknesses currently and where might weaknesses be anticipated in the future the term weaknesses as used here includes vulnerabilities and associated risks as those terms are usually understood but also other factors that might negatively impact cybersecurity but might not usually be considered vulnerabilities or risks for example misperceptions about risks might be weakness weakness is major if failure to address it could realistically have significant national impact on the economy public safety or other critical services the assessment of weaknesses will also determine the goals of framework to significant extent 2 what are the major means of leverage for addressing those weaknesses these could include such approaches as the adoption of standards or best practices improvements in software engineering investment in training and education or correction of market failures 3 what roles should government and the private sector play in the use of those means of leverage to address current and potential future weaknesses it might be for example that market forces are sufficient to address the concerns alternatively incentives might be needed to promote voluntary measures or regulation might be required among the policy options that congress could consider are encouraging broader use of cybersecurity standards and best crs3 practices in the private sector using federal procurement practices to leverage general improvements in products and services encouraging mandatory reporting of security incidents facilitating productliability actions in response to inadequate cybersecurity practices encouraging the development of cybersecurity insurance and strengthening federal cybersecurity programs this report addresses each of those questions in turn however before doing so it may be useful to discuss exactly what the term cybersecurity refers to what is cybersecurity one of the prerequisites for developing common national framework for cybersecurity is common understanding of what this and related terms mean achieving that can be difficult for several reasons perhaps the major one is complexity there are many components of cyberspace and many potential components of framework variety of stakeholders will be involved with exposed to and in some cases predisposed to focus on different parts of cyberspace different elements of framework and different approaches to security consequently attempts to create coordinated national framework could be challenging another problem is that there appears to be generally accepted definition of cybersecurity and several different terms are in use that have related meanings for example information security is defined in some subsections of federal copyright law to mean activities carried out in order to identify and address the vulnerabilities of government computer computer system or computer network 17 usc 1201e 1202d and in the federal information security management act fisma pl 107296 title x 44 usc 3532 as protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction the term information assurance ia is also used one section of federal military law defines it to include computer and network security as well as any other information technology so designated by the secretary of defense 10 usc 2200e the national security agency nsa defines information assurance as measures that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability integrity authentication confidentiality and non repudiation these measures include providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating protection detection and reaction capabilities3 3 committee on national security systems cnss national security agency national information assurance ia glossary cnss instruction 4009 may 2003 httpwwwnstisscgovassetspdf4009pdf p 32 the glossary defines the 5 elements of ia as follows authentication security measure designed to establish the validity of transmission message or originator or means of verifying an individuals authorization to receive specific categories of information p 4 continued crs4 assurance more generally refers to the level of confidence in the effectiveness of security4 also both information security and information assurance may not be limited to electronic systems but may refer more broadly to the protection of information or data in whatever format or medium it exists in the context of financial services electronic security or esecurity has been defined as follows esecurity can be described on the one hand as those policies guidelines processes and actions needed to enable electronic transactions to be carried out with minimum risk of breach intrusion or theft on the other hand esecurity is any tool technique or process used to protect systems information assetsesecurity enhances or adds value to an unprotected network and is composed of both soft and hard infrastructure soft infrastructure components are those policies processes protocols and guidelines that create the protective environment to keep the system and the data from compromise the hard infrastructure consists of the actual hardware and software needed to protect the system and its data from external and internal threats to security5 neither federal law nor the nssc define cybersecurity and the latter uses the term interchangeably with cyberspace security the implication presumably is that the former term is shorthand for the latter which is also not defined however in general usage cyberspace is more of metaphor than precise concept and it has different meanings in different contexts the nssc uses it to refer to computers and the hardware connecting them6 in common parlance it is often used somewhat differently referring to kind of virtual space created by computer networks within 3 continued availability timely reliable access to data and information services for authorized users p 5 confidentiality assurance that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals processes or devices p 15 integrity quality of an is information system reflecting the logical correctness and reliability of the operating system the logical completeness of the hardware and software implementing the protection mechanisms and the consistency of the data structures and occurrence of the stored data note that in formal security mode integrity is interpreted more narrowly to mean protection against unauthorized modification or destruction of information p 34 nonrepudiation assurance the sender of data is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the senders identity so neither can later deny having processed the data p 44 4 cnss ia glossary defines assurance as measure of confidence that the security features practices procedures and architecture of an is information system accurately mediates and enforces the security policy p 3 5 thomas c glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness securing finance in new age world bank working paper 26 washington dc the world bank february 2004 p 9 6 cyberspace is composed of hundreds of thousands of interconnected computers servers routers switches and fiber optic cables that allow our critical infrastructures to work nssc p vii the nssc also says that cyberspace refers to an interdependent network of critical information infrastructures p 13 these are somewhat narrower meanings than used in this report crs5 which people and computers perform various activities such as email financial transactions data processing and system control7 in this report cyberspace means the combination of the virtual structure8 the physical components that support it the information it contains and the flow of that information within it cybersecurity bill introduced in the 108th congress the department of homeland security cybersecurity enhancement act hr 5068thornberry reintroduced in the 109th congress as hr 285 defines cybersecurity as the prevention of damage to the protection of and the restoration of computers electronic communications systems electronic communication services wire communication and electronic communication including information contained therein to ensure its availability integrity authentication confidentiality and nonrepudiation9 this proposed legislative definition is similar to the nsa definition of information assurance described above but with greater stress on communications systems10 also this definition emphasizes outcomes prevention protection and restoration rather than processes to achieve those outcomes the potential fuzziness of the term cybersecurity could be problem in the context of developing national framework to the extent that it impacts the ability of different stakeholders to reach agreement on elements of the framework however because information technology and cyberspace itself continue to evolve rapidly rigid definition would likely lose its utility quickly keeping the concept as flexible as possible may be beneficial as it is commonly used cybersecurity appears to refer to three things 7 one online definition is metaphor for describing the nonphysical terrain created by computer systems online systems for example create cyberspace within which people can communicate with one another via email do research or simply window shop like physical space cyberspace contains objects files mail messages graphics etc and different modes of transportation and delivery webopedia httpwwwwebopediacom termccyberspacehtml 21 march 2002 the term was coined in 1984 by sciencefiction writer william gibson who apparently intended it in his novel neuromancer to mean form of virtual reality created by worldwide set of interconnected computers and those who operated them 8 the term virtual structure as used here refers to the apparent or perceived organization or architecture created by or with information technology hardware and software 9 the bipartisan bill which received committee or floor action in the 108th congress further states i each of the terms damage and computer has the meaning that term has in section 1030 of title 18 united states code and ii each of the terms electronic communications system electronic communication service wire communication and electronic communication has the meaning that term has in section 2510 of title 18 united states code 10 this difference can be seen in the ia glossary definition of an information system as set of information resources organized for the collection storage processing maintenance use sharing dissemination disposition display or transmission of information cnss ia glossary p 33 crs6 1 set of activities and other measures intended to protect from attack disruption or other threats computers computer networks related hardware and devices software and the information they contain and communicate including software and data as well as other elements of cyberspace11 the activities can include security audits patch management12 authentication procedures access management and so forth they can involve for example examining and evaluating the strengths and vulnerabilities of the hardware and software used in the countrys political and economic electronic infrastructure they also involve detection and reaction to security events mitigation of impacts and recovery of affected components other measures can include such things as hardware and software firewalls physical security such as hardened facilities and personnel training and responsibilities 2 the state or quality of being protected from such threats13 3 the broad field of endeavor including research and analysis aimed at implementing and improving those activities and quality14 the kinds of attack or disruption contemplated are generally those originating with humans vandals criminals terrorists nationstates but other sources are possible such as accidents major weather events or earthquakes this threepart sense is how cybersecurity is used in this report in this usage information security information assurance esecurity and even cyberspace security as used in the nssc are aspects of but not synonymous with cybersecurity where are the major weaknesses in cybersecurity cyberspace is large somewhat amorphous and growing it is interconnected in ways that can be difficult to characterize or even identify it is also global and most of it is in the private sector therefore thorough determination of what parts of and activities in cyberspace should and even can be involved in national framework for cybersecurity is difficult to do the complexity of cyberspace and its components even within organizations makes it both difficult to test and to predict how systems will behave under unusual circumstances such as might arise from an unanticipated cyberattack15 however the issue can be made more tractable by first 11 an example of this usage is cybersecurity plan can be impervious to concerted and intelligent attacks nssc p 3 12 patch is piece of software code inserted into computer program to fix problem or bug in the program 13 for example increase the level of cybersecurity nationwide nssc p 2 this also appears to be the usage in hr 285 14 for example programs to advance the training of cybersecurity professionals nssc p 41 15 the government of the united kingdom is concerned enough about this issue that it has launched research program to discover ways to avoid catastrophic failures resulting from continued crs7 identifying those components which if successfully attacked would yield damage that would be considered unacceptable to government andor the public from this perspective there appear to be three classes of attack to consider service disruption those which cause loss of service such as by making unavailable part of cyberspace or activities that depend on it this could include for example loss of emergency or transportation communication systems or an extended unavailability of electronic financial transactions or utilities such as electricity this unavailability could result from disabling of networks through variety of attacks such as denial of service dos corruption or destruction of information such as financial records or destruction of physical infrastructure such as components of the internet backbone disruptions may be limited to particular organization region or sector or they could be broader and even global in scope theft of assets those which involve theft or other appropriation and subsequent misuse of critical information on large enough scale to have major impact such as on financial markets capture and control those which involve taking control of components of cyberspace and using them as weapons against other critical activities or elements of infrastructure such as using compromised home computers to launch dos attacks against one or more targets16 three main channels of attack also exist through cyberspace such as via worms or other malware17 by direct destruction or alteration of physical structure such as buildings or telecommunications lines or through intentional or inadvertent actions by trusted insider these channels are not mutually exclusive and combination attacks are also possible because cyberspace is constantly under attack albeit most often at low level and largely through the first channel and because most attacks produce damage which is either minimal or considered acceptable eg as cost of doing business by those attacked higher threshold of impact might need to be reached before significant efforts at developing national cybersecurity framework would be considered worthwhile by many determining that threshold in particular the threshold for government action is not straightforward especially given that most publicly known cyberattacks to date fall into either nuisance or 15 continued such emergent properties duncan grahamrowe sprawling systems teeter on it chaos new scientist 24 november 2004 httpwwwnewscientistcomnews newsjspidns99996706 16 see national research council information technology for counterterrorism washington dc national academy press 2003 p 1213 for related discussion the report characterizes attacks as potentially making system or network unavailable corrupted or compromised 17 malware contracted elision of malicious software includes viruses trojan horses worms logic bombs and any other computer code that has or is intended to have harmful effects crs8 vandal category such as defacing websites or financial crime such as stolen credit card or personal identity information additionally the costs of cyberattacks may be difficult to quantify further complicating the determination of that threshold18 in the absence of significant terrorist cyberattack the role that government should play in ensuring specified national level of cybersecurity has been somewhat controversial yet policymakers are also keenly aware that before september 2001 most observers regarded major attack by foreign terrorists inside the united states an unlikely event in that context to identify areas worthy of particular attention it could be useful to discuss what parts of cyberspace might be in particular need of protection what components of cyberspace are at risk cyberspace as used in this report comprises huge range of elements arrayed worldwide given its size and complexity reasonable question is whether cybersecurity framework is needed for all of cyberspace potentially daunting task or only for certain critical components that are especially important or especially at risk cyberspace consists not only of the internet and computers connected to it but also any electronic system or device that is or can be connected either directly to the internet or indirectly through some other device or system as well as the mechanisms that connect them these may include such things as automatic teller machines industrial control systems known as scadas19 and even telephone and other telecommunications systems these connections may be obvious or they may not thus not only is webenabled cellular telephone part of cyberspace but so is desktop phone not only because it is part of the same worldwide telephone system as the cellular phone but also because that telephone system increasingly relies on computers and the internet to help manage traffic and for other purposes even computer with connection to the internet is part of cyberspace if it has way of communicating with other computers such as through floppy disks or other removable media cyberspace also includes the software that runs computers and their connections it includes the data stored on or generated by those computers and other devices and the transmission of those data to other computers and devices it includes cables routers servers networks the internet backbone and even satellites used in internet transmissions it even has its own atlases20 and sophisticated electronic mapping techniques to help manage networks and internet 18 see crs report rl32331 the economic impact of cyberattacks 19 see crs report rl31534 critical infrastructure control systems and the terrorist threat the acronym scada is derived from the term supervisory control and data acquisition which refers to the function of those systems which are often used to control processes in industrial facilities and to log information about status and conditions they often communicate electronically with central computer systems that are connected to the internet 20 for example martin dodge and rob kitchin atlas of cyberspace boston addison wesley 2001 or martin dodge an atlas of cyberspaces httpwww cybergeographyorgatlasatlashtml crs9 communications these show that even the virtual dimension of cyberspace is highly structured and often in ways that may not be obvious21 in addition to the components of cyberspace per there are supplementary elements that can be critical with respect to cybersecurity perhaps most notable are buildings and other structures within which the physical components of cyberspace are contained and people with access to cyberspace an effective cybersecurity framework needs to take such elements into account it might be useful to consider the various physical components associated with cyberspace as cyberspace infrastructure this can be conveniently categorized into four segments internet hardware telecommunications infrastructure embedded computing devices such as control systems and dedicated computing devices such as desktop computers22 virtual cyberspace the electronic information that is stored in and flows through the physical components could be called cyberspace superstructure virtually any element of cyberspace can at least in theory pose some level of cybersecurity risk which is generally thought of as combined assessment of threat vulnerability and impact23 that gives measure of the overall potential for harm from vulnerability if corrective action is taken threat can have several different meanings but in this report it refers to possible attack for example the threat of denialofservice attack descriptions of threats often include both the nature of the possible attack and those who might perpetrate it as well as the capabilities of potential attackers and may include some description of the possible consequences if the attack is successful vulnerability usually refers to weakness that an attack might exploit how an attack could be accomplished analysis of threats and 21 see for example mapping the internet in eric fischer coordinator understanding cybersecurity crs workshop mm70048 july 21 2003 22 after national research council information technology for counterterrorism p 12 13 23 for example one definition of risk used by the national institute of standards and technology nist is combination of i the likelihood that particular vulnerability in an agency information system will be either intentionally or unintentionally exploited by particular threat resulting in loss of confidentiality integrity or availability and ii the potential impact or magnitude of harm that loss of confidentiality integrity or availability will have on agency operations including mission functions and public confidence in the agency an agencys assets or individuals including privacy should there be threat exploitation of information system vulnerabilities national institute of standards and technology information security volume ii appendices to guide for mapping types of information and information systems to security categories nist special publication 800 60 version 10 december 2003 p 5 the same publication defines threat as any circumstance or event with the potential to intentionally or unintentionally exploit specific vulnerability in an information system resulting in loss of confidentiality integrity or availability and vulnerability as flaw or weakness in the design or implementation of an information system including security procedures and security controls associated with the system that could be intentionally or unintentionally exploited to adversely affect an agencys operations including missions functions and public confidence in the agency an agencys assets or individuals including privacy through loss of confidentiality integrity or availability p 5 crs10 vulnerabilities when combined can lead to an assessment of risk statements of risk often combine both the probability of successful attack and some measure of its likely impact the nature and magnitude of economic and other outcomes of successful attack managing risks may involve several kinds of activities defense refers to how system is protected from attack and is often discussed in terms of countermeasures or controls elements may include prevention2 which involves reducing vulnerabilities and implementing other measures to deter attacks detection which involves identifying and characterizing an attempted attack either as it occurs or afterward and countering sometimes also called response which involves taking corrective measures in response to an attack to stop it or reduce its impact response and recovery refer to how and how well damage is mitigated and repaired and information and functionality are recovered in the event of successful attack risks are often characterized qualitatively as high medium or low24 the level of risk varies among different components of cyberspace and some may therefore deserve more attention than others in the development of an effective framework some components are considered to be particularly vulnerable some are viewed by different groups of attackers as particularly tempting targets and some would if compromised have particularly large impacts these may not however all translate into high risk for example target could be highly vulnerable but under little threat and with very limited impact resulting from any successful attack in contrast moderately vulnerable target under moderate threat with moderate impact from successful attack could easily be assessed as being at much higher risk identifying what are the major weaknesses in us cybersecurity is an area of some controversy while there seems to be general agreement on some problems such as software vulnerability and the increasing levels of cybercrime others have in fact remained controversial even the question of how much of concern cyberterrorism as opposed to cybercrime25 should be has been matter of some dispute however terrorists may also engage in cybercrime such as theft fraud extortion or money laundering to finance their efforts there also appear to be increasing concerns among some observers about the possibility of growing nexus among hackers organized crime and terrorists26 therefore separating consideration 24 see for example national institute of standards and technology risk management guide for information technology systems nist special publication 80030 october 2001 p 25 25 cybercrime is usually distinguished from cyberterrorism just as crime is usually distinguished from terrorism although the distinction is sometimes muddled in usage generally they are distinguished based on the aim of the activity cybercrimes generally refers to crimes committed using information technology especially the internet for personal gain and cyberterrorism refers to crimes involving information technology that are performed for political ends 26 an increased reliance on technology escalates the potential for and the likelihood of esecurity threats furthermore attacks occur more often and with polymorphic approach due largely in part to organized crime and terrorism the speed and tenacity of the hacking community is growing at rapid rate the world bank integrator group global continued crs11 of those activities in discussions of cybersecurity might not be appropriate at least in some cases there appear to be certain candidate components of cyberspace and associated activities that are sources of potentially significant risk because either major vulnerabilities have been identified or substantial impacts could result from successful attack they are components that play critical roles in elements of critical infrastructure this could include for example computer control systems such as scadas used in the chemical and energy industries and the internet infrastructure another example is information held by financial services industries that could be stolen electronically or otherwise compromised software in particular widely used computer programs such as operating systems can be vulnerable to various forms of compromise resulting for example in information theft or use of the compromised system as weapon of attack this kind of vulnerability has perhaps received more public attention than any other given that it affects virtually all owners and users of desktop systems cybersecurity governance many observers have expressed concerns that corporations and other organizations including some involved in critical infrastructure sectors see below have not developed governance mechanisms sufficiently responsive to cybersecurity needs weaknesses have been cited with respect to several aspects of cybersecurity governance including policies procedures and personnel management public knowledge and perception observers who have expressed concern about the risk of major cyberattacks from terrorists or other criminals have in many cases pointed to lack of public awareness about the risk as weakness both with respect to lack of knowledge about the steps individuals need to take to defend against attacks and the need for national public and privatesector effort while other potential weaknesses could be identified for example security of current internet protocols emergency communications or buildings housing key internet servers or central exchanges known as peering points discussion here will be limited to the four cases above because of their relevance to the issue of national framework 26 continued dialogue electronic safety and soundness september 10 2003 summary p 2 crs12 cyberspace and critical infrastructure it is obvious from even cursory examination of cyberspace that it is probably impossible and certainly impractical to secure all of it if for other reason than its global nature but even within the united states the complexities are daunting one of the fundamental tenets of cybersecurity is that simple system is much easier to secure than complex one and cyberspace is extraordinarily complex determining the elements of cyberspace that should be the focus of cybersecurity is therefore of fundamental importance one set of components for which there already appears to be general agreement to include consists of those associated with the nations critical infrastructure some components of cyberspace are also components of the us critical infrastructure ci27 defined as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters28 the national strategy for homeland security identified thirteen ci sectors29 which dhs has categorized as follows30 production industries energy chemical defense industrial base service industries banking and finance transportation postal and shipping sustenance and health agriculture food water public health federal and state government emergency services it and cyber information and telecommunications disruption of ci components by natural or anthropogenic events can have significant economic and social impacts those impacts can reverberate well beyond the affected industry as the august 2003 electricity blackout in the northeastern united states demonstrated many ci industries are increasingly dependent on cyberspace and adequate cybersecurity for those industries is important not only to them but to other industries government and the public some examples of components of ci cyberspace that have received particular attention with respect to risk are described below control systems computer systems are often used to control various industrial processes in many instances those systems are connected directly or indirectly to the internet their potential vulnerabilities are particularly concern in industries 27 for indepth discussion of issues involved in the security of ci see crs report rl30153 critical infrastructures background policy and implementation 28 42 usc 5195ce 29 the white house national strategy for

httpwwwdhsgovdhspublicinterappeditorialeditorial_0542xml crs13 that are considered part of the nations critical infrastructure especially energy generation and transportation industry such as electric utilities oil refineries and pipeline companies water utilities telephone companies and the chemical industry31 the august 2003 electrical blackout in the northeast has been attributed in part to failure of computercontrolled alarm system although it appears to have been caused by malfunctions not cyberattack32 however in january of the same year infection by computer worm caused monitoring system to become disabled in an offline nuclear power plant33 in perhaps the bestknown example of cyberattack on control systems in 2000 hacker in australia caused computerized wastemanagement system to dump millions of gallons of raw sewage into rivers and parks34 databases containing sensitive information many databases on government and privatesector computer systems contain sensitive information that can include personal data such as medical records financial information such as credit card numbers proprietary business information such as business plans or customer data securityrelated data such as risk assessments and wide range of other information that might be of interest to competitors criminals and terrorists losses from electronic theft and other forms of cybercrime are thought to be in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the united states and much larger worldwide according to some reports more than half of electronic attacks are directed at financial institutions35 however estimates of losses vary because among other reasons institutions are reluctant to share such information because of potential additional losses that could result from damage to the institutions reputation should the information become publicly known36 competitive pressures often motivate organizations to adopt new information technologies however these technologies may also create vulnerabilities by facilitating more efficient and quicker ways to commit old crimes such as fraud and theftdisturbingly as the technology becomes more complex perpetrator needs fewer skills to commit these crimes37 for example many companies increasingly use wireless communications wifi for wireless fidelity for networking and other communications many of those systems are notoriously vulnerable to compromise by hackers who can steal passwords and other information or even take 31 see shea critical infrastructure control systems 32 uscanada power system outage task

be complex and difficult for many users to implement voting systems state and local government are categorized as ci sector and like other sectors they rely increasingly on information technology to provide crucial services one example is voting systems four out of five american voters now cast ballots using systems that rely on computers for casting counting or both39 while not generally considered part of critical infrastructure voting systems are central to the functioning of government concerns have been raised by many computer security experts about the vulnerabilities of current computerassisted voting systems to compromise that could change the outcome of an election40 while focus on cybersecurity for critical infrastructure per is clearly important other cyberspace components are also relevant for example the education sector is not generally considered ci sector but attacks on components such as institutions of higher learning with significant research programs could have significant impact also ci sectors are largely thought of as being geographically limited to the united states but cyberspace is global that means both that attacks outside the united states could have significant impacts within the country and that the generation of attacks from outside the united states can be of significant concern third cyberspace components that are clearly not part of ci such as home computers may be used in attacks software design weaknesses the security problems of much widely used computer software are among the best known cybersecurity weaknesses because they affect so many computers in homes and businesses among these weaknesses the vulnerabilities of computer operating systems and email programs are among the most widely reported and exploited they can permit individual computer systems to be probed or even taken over by attackers with impacts ranging from vandalism to theft to loss of service for company or larger segment of cyberspace users for example in 2003 computer worms41 that exploited vulnerabilities in microsoft windows operating systems led to disruptions in automatic teller machines and even in one instance emergency 911 service simply by rapidly replicating and propagating themselves thereby overwhelming computer networks worldwide the disruptions to financial and 38 timothy allen wifi vulnerabilities

malware that can replicate and propagate itself without human assistance across computer network often causing harmful effects crs15 emergency services were apparently not anticipated by security experts nor probably by the authors of the worms42 the design of software can have significant effect on its vulnerability to malware43 both the complexity of the code and the way it is designed can have an impact it is general principle of computer security that the more complex piece of software is the more vulnerable it is to attack that is because more complex code will have more places that malware can be hidden and more potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited and is more difficult to analyze for security problems in fact attackers often discover and exploit vulnerabilities that were unknown to the developer software code that is not welldesigned from security perspective is more likely than welldesigned code to have weaknesses that could be exploited as well as places for malware to be hidden furthermore many experts argue that it is impossible with current engineering methods to anticipate all possible weaknesses and points of attack for complex software however code can be designed so as to minimize such vulnerabilities and welldeveloped procedures have been established to accomplish this goal44 some of those procedures can even be applied to older legacy systems good security design involves not only the code itself but also the process by which it is developed and evaluated until recently widely used software was not for the most part developed with security as major goal that was at least in part because it was not clear that in the absence of significant breaches consumers would pay for the extra cost that can be involved in developing more secure software some experts believe that publicly disclosed or opensource software provides superior security to proprietary or closedsource code45 such experts argue that 42 bruce schneier blaster and the great blackout saloncom 16 december 2003 httpwwwsaloncomtechfeature20031216blaster_securityindex_nphtml 43 there are various ways of hiding malware trojan horse for example is malware disguised as something benign or useful see kenneth thompson reflections on trusting trust communications of the acm 27 1984 761763 available at httpwwwacmorgclassicssep95 he concluded that it can be essentially impossible to determine whether piece of software is trustworthy by examining its source code matter how carefully the entire system must be evaluated and even then it can be very difficult to find malware 44 see for example richard c linger and carmen j trammell cleanroom software engineering reference model version 10 technical report cmusei96tr022 november 1996 available at httpwwwseicmuedupubdocuments96reportspdf tr02296pdf 45 open source software refers to computer program whose source code is made available to the general public to be improved or modified as the user wishes crs report rl31627 computer software and open source issues primer p 1 what is open or closed is the source code what programmers actually write this code is translated into machine code compiled for use by computers to run the programs machine code can be translated back into source code decompiled this does not recover the original source code but can be useful for example to hackers hoping to find vulnerabilities or to continued crs16 opensource software is more secure because the open review process is more thorough and can identify more potential security flaws than is possible with proprietary code advocates of closedsource code argue in contrast that proprietary code makes potential flaws more difficult to discover and therefore to exploit and that it improves security by providing more control over the personnel technology and processes involved in development and maintenance of the code since malware has been created for opensource as well as closedsource systems and since hackers are generally expected to focus on more popular systems which are currently closed source the relative security strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches have not been firmly established however approaches to improving security that could be applied broadly to different kinds of software would likely be beneficial problems with organizational governance many observers have expressed concerns that corporations and other organizations have not developed sufficiently responsive governance mechanisms to address cybersecurity needs it is generally accepted that sound cybersecurity involves focus on three elements technology operations and personnel46 successful implementation of all three elements requires active involvement by those involved in the governance of an organization the technology component focuses on the development acquisition and implementation of hardware and software organizations have often been criticized for focusing too heavily on this component the perfect technology like the perfect lock is an attractive but elusive security goal the operations component focuses on policies and procedures including such processes as certification access controls management and assessments the personnel component focuses on clear commitment to security by an organizations leadership assignment of appropriate roles and responsibilities implementation of physical and personnel security measures to control and monitor access training that is appropriate for the level of access and responsibility and accountability focus that is not properly balanced among the three elements may create vulnerabilities thus even an excellent security technology will be minimally effective if it is not properly implemented and used which requires appropriate governance mechanisms throughout the organization 45 continued defenders looking for malware that might be hidden in the machine code 46 national security agency nsa defense in depth practical strategy for achieving information assurance in todays highly networked environments nsa security recommendation guide 8 june 2001 available at httpnsa2wwwconxioncomsupport guidessd1pdf sometimes these three elements are referred to as people process and technology crs17 key aspects of governance weaknesses have been cited with respect to several aspects of cybersecurity governance generally effective governance for cybersecurity would be expected to involve establishing clear and measurable goals strategies for achieving those goals and policies and procedures to implement those strategies these would involve not only operations but personnel management including the establishment of appropriate roles and responsibilities and accountability for them throughout the organization as well as recruitment and training these aspects of governance are discussed in some detail below because governance is considered by many to be among the most important and complex weaknesses to address goals any meaningful framework for cybersecurity should arguably include clear description of its goals the desired results or state different kinds of goals might be set and some would likely be more useful than others for example goal might focus only on limiting the number and kinds of attacks that occur this would have the benefit of being highly tangible and is clearly desired state but the relationship between this goal and the other components of the framework may be difficult to determine since the number of attempted attacks is determined to significant extent by the attackers low rate of attack does not necessarily reflect effective security in addition this kind of goal could create perverse incentives since for example attacks might be reduced by limiting connectivity or computing power which would often be counterproductive that is not to say that such goal is not valuable but rather that it must be properly developed and characterized one wellestablished approach is to identify functional goals such as those that relate to maintenance of particular level of operation or performance as opposed to those that focus on prevention of attacks or protection of systems three functional goals are commonly described for information security integrity availability and confidentiality47 additional goals such as accountability authenticity reliability and nonrepudiation may be added to these basic ones for some applications48 broader functional goal commonly discussed is trustworthiness which has been defined as assurance that system deserves to be trusted that it will perform as expected despite environmental disruptions human and operator error hostile attacks and design and implementation errors trustworthy systems reinforce the belief that 47 these are defined in fisma 44 usc 3542 as follows integrity guarding against improper information modification or destruction including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity confidentiality preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information availability ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information others define these terms somewhat differently see for example national research council trust in cyberspace washington dc national academy press 1999 p 301303307 and footnote 3 above but the meaning is similar 48 glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness p 45 in reference to isoiec 13335 information technology security techniques guidelines for the management of it security gmits crs18 they will continue to produce expected behavior and will not be susceptible to subversion49 such functional goals have the benefit of being applicable not only with respect to cyberattacks but also to other sources of potential disruption such as weather events however the goals are complex and it may be difficult to find ways to map them on to other elements of framework50 it is useful to distinguish goals at different levels national sectoral and organizationspecific the nssc outlines three strategic objectives for the nation prevent cyber attacks against americas critical infrastructures reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks and minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks that do occur51 those objectives while clearly desirable in concept may be criticized as somewhat vague and it is not clear how to determine whether they have been successfully met measuring prevention of cyberattacks suffers from the difficulties mentioned in the previous paragraph it is not clear how much of reduction in vulnerability would indicate success or what it means to minimize damage and recovery time the nssc recommends set of actions but does not provide roadmap or other mechanism for assessing those actions against the goals presumably such linkages would be made through subsequent work by federal agencies and the private sector in general however national goals and objectives will of necessity be broad in nature and might best be considered concepts that individual sectors and organizations can use to help them develop more specific goals and objectives sectorspecific goals will necessarily vary depending on the mission and focus of the sector for example federal goals must be responsive to unique governmental security needs and requirements chemicalsector goals would address security of process controls and physical plants among other things52 organizationspecific goals would be expected to be more closely tailored to the individual requirements of each organization whatever focus they take set of effective goals should arguably have the following characteristics among others progress toward the goals should be measurable in meaningful way it should be possible to determine to what extent the goals have been met 49 nrc trust p 316 the report further defines trustworthiness as encompassing correctness reliability security conventionally including secrecy confidentiality integrity and availability privacy safety and survivability p 14 50 nist is attempting to do this for federal systems as required by law 40 usc 11331 and 44 usc 3533 see for example nist standards for security 51 nssc p viii 52 the chemicals sector cybersecurity information sharing forum cybersecurity strategy task team us chemicals sector cybersecurity strategy june 2002 p 8 crs19 the goals should provide basis for appropriate incentives they should stimulate improvements in cybersecurity but avoid providing perverse incentives such as inhibiting replacement of obsolete technology the goals should provide clear basis for other elements of the framework it should be possible to determine how given element relates to one or more goals strategies generally speaking strategies is used as relatively highlevel term referring to broad set of plans or approaches for meeting cybersecurity goals for example the nssc lays out set of six principles and five largely programmatic priorities for achieving the objectives presented in the document in this case the document itself is called strategy and is part of set relating to homeland security and combating terrorism developed by the bush administration53 the national security agency has developed an information assurance strategy called defenseindepth did54 which focuses on the three elements mentioned above personnel technology and operations and lays out set of principles and practices for them this strategy emphasizes the concept of layered defense nonfederal entities have also developed cybersecurity strategy documents for example industry groups corporations and international organizations because of the various meanings given to strategy in different contexts it is difficult to identify any one set of desired characteristics for the strategic components of cybersecurity framework however among those characteristics are likely to be the following55 provide an overall methodology for meeting all cybersecurity goals identify resources needs and sources identify organizational responsibilities and roles include ways of measuring progress toward the goals and responding to results of those measurements provide for flexibility and adaptation to changing conditions principles many discussions of cybersecurity include statements or lists of principles which can be thought of as generally accepted characteristics or expectations while some common themes appear in different descriptions of principles they generally seem to be developed for specific applications among the 53 the others address national security homeland security combating terrorism combating weapons of mass destruction physical protection of critical infrastructure and key assets and money laundering for comparison see general accounting office evaluation of selected characteristics in national strategies related to

available at httpwwwiatfnetframework_docsversion3_1indexcfm 55 these are based in part on characteristics discussed in gao evaluation crs20 more widelycited is published set of generally accepted system security principles gassp that nist published in 1996 they stress the role of computer security in the mission and management of an organization the importance of costeffectiveness the responsibilities of system owners beyond their own organizations the importance of explicit responsibilities and accountability and of comprehensive and integrated approach the need for periodic reassessment and the limitations imposed by societal factors such as the need for privacy56 the principles contained in the nssc are somewhat different in keeping with its broader scope they contain some similarities to the gassp but also stress the need for national effort preference for the reliance on market forces rather than government regulation and the importance of flexibility and multiyear planning57 the information systems security association issa has been developing set of generally accepted information security principles gaisp but these are in effect guidelines see below among the principles developed for specific application are those laid out in the cybersecurity strategy of the us chemicals sector the include the importance of involvement of top management the need for customized solutions the importance of national and international harmonization the need for an evolving strategy and the importance of inclusive participation58 the did principles focus on the technology leg of the strategy stressing layered defense in multiple customization of protection based on the asset being protected and the threat robust encryption key management and infrastructure and intrusion detection infrastructure delineation of principles can be an important component of any approach to cybersecurity governance providing context for the other components such as the chemical sectors integrationwiththe global economy as well as crosscutting themes such as nists need for periodic reassessment and limitations such as the nsscs importance of protecting privacy and civil liberties among the more common themes in different sets are the key role of organizational leaders the need for considering the environment beyond the organization itself the importance of contextspecificity and adaptability in response to changing circumstances and the need to take into account other factors such as cost and privacy 56 national institute of standards and technology

cybersecurity strategy june 2002 crs21 policies policy is essentially set of rules governing how cybersecurity strategies will be applied policies can usefully be thought of in terms of levels missionlevel policy lays out broad direction and guidance for an enterprise for example the nssc states it is the policy of the united states to prevent or minimize disruptions to critical information infrastructures and thereby protect the people the economy the essential human and government services and the national security of the united states disruptions that do occur should be infrequent of minimal duration and manageable and cause the least damage possible the policy requires continuous effort to secure information systems for critical infrastructure and includes voluntary publicprivate partnerships involving corporate and nongovernmental organizations59 programlevel policy provides rules for specific program or set of activities60 such policies often include the assets to be protected goals organizational responsibilities and compliance parameters including penalties systemlevel policy provides rules for securing particular system or subsystem these policies often are based on technical and risk analyses and vary from system to system depending on requirements an issuelevel policy provides rules for particular issue or area of concern such as how to handle email attachments such policies often cover objectives responsibilities and compliance this kind of policy is likely to require frequent updating in response to changes in technology and other factors the cybersecurity policies of an organization serve to provide guidance in meeting stated goals and can also provide incentives or remove disincentives for certain behavior for example whether or not employees report suspected security breaches may depend in part on the kind of policy the organization has with respect to them if the policy does not encourage reporting then employees may be reluctant to do so because of concerns about potential repercussions also policies often set expectations with respect to resource allocation if cybersecurity is high policy priority then it would ordinarily be expected to be high budget priority as well mismatch between an organizations policy and its behavior may have legal ramifications61 procedures procedures can be thought of as specifications of how to perform specific actions methodologies or processes ideally cybersecurity procedures would be designed to implement cybersecurity policies and strategies they may include for example steps to take in configuring networks to minimize the risk of successful intrusions actions to take when an intrusion occurs including how to report it and methods for evaluating potential security risks of prospective employees although many procedures may be common across different organizations or even sectors they will likely in general be the most customized and organizationspecific of governance components 59 nssc p 13 60 this and subsequent policy levels are after nist generally accepted principles p 13 15 61 glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness p 59 crs22 personnel the components of cybersecurity governance discussed above apply to personnel as well as operations according to some observers people are the most important of the three fundamental elements of cybersecurity it is they who must implement security policies and procedures and defend against any attacks if they are not adequately skilled and trained they may be unable to prevent detect and react to security breaches and they may themselves be more vulnerable to social engineering attack which involves finding and exploiting weaknesses in how people interact with computer systems62 in addition it can be particularly difficult to defend against attack by an insider so background checks and other controls to minimize that risk are especially important these considerations may be even more critical for services that are outsourced in which case direct control over personnel is substantially reduced according to some observers such trusted insiders pose the most significant threat to an organizations cybersecurity63 it is generally held that effective governance for cybersecurity requires strong commitment from an organizations leadership at the level of the chief executive officer the board of directors or the equivalent this may be especially important because returns on investment in security may be difficult to measure64 the lack of clear return on investment may create pressures to underinvest some evidence suggests that such underinvestment is an issue for many organizations65 this may be especially true for small to midsized privatesector entities and for state and local government agencies if roles responsibilities and accountability are not clear and appropriate which might be the case if for example an organization has overall cybersecurity policy structure that can create significant vulnerabilities classic case is where responsibilities are too widely distributed workers may assume that an issue is being addressed by others who share the responsibilities with the result being that the issue is not properly addressed by anyone another area of concern with respect to personnel is training development of proficient cybersecurity workforce in the united states is listed as priority in the nssc66 many security professionals consider employee training and education to 62 for example one kind of attack involves sending victims email purportedly from legitimate financial or software company and urging them to visit website also purportedly of this company where they are requested to enter information such as usernames and passwords for accounts the hacker can then use this information to take control of the victims computer or to steal funds 63 karen fogerty chief security officers lack confidence in the state of their organizations information security efforts csoonlinecom press release 26 january 2004 64 see cashell economic impact for further discussion of this issue 65 in survey of chief security officers in early 2004 majority assessed that their organizations were investing less than optimal amounts in security and that they were at best somewhat confident in the effectiveness of their cybersecurity activities the survey also found that those investing more in cybersecurity had fewer incidents fogerty chief security officers lack confidence 66 nssc p 41 crs23 be top priority67 this can be especially challenging because of the continuously evolving nature of the cybersecurity environment extent of problems and response indepth assessment has been made of the degree to which us organizations overall have established effective cybersecurity governance mechanisms however many observers believe that governance is an area of substantial weakness68 with some variation among different sectors69 problems have been identified at all levels and scales of governance from failure of leadership in the executive suite and boardroom to inadequate procedures and undertrained personnel those weaknesses have been recognized by both dhs and industry and some initiatives have been developed to address them70 some prominent ventures are discussed later in this report public knowledge and perception given widespread publicity about cyberattacks and the repeated revelations of new threats and vulnerabilities much of the public appears to be aware of and concerned about the possibility of cyberattacks71 although there appears to be little direct evidence on public awareness and preparedness regarding cybersecurity72 many experts believe that both home computer users and many organizations 67 fogerty chief security officers lack confidence 68 for example summary of several reports by the national research council states from an operational standpoint cybersecurity today is far worse than what known best practices can provide national research council cybersecurity today and tomorrow pay now or pay later washington dc national academy press 2002 p 8 69 for example sectors vary substantially in the degree to which they report cybersecurity incidents and their capital and operating expenditures on cybersecurity both of which are thought to be associated with the level of commitment to effective security of those responsible for corporate governance see lawrence gordon and others 2004 csifbi computer crime and security survey june 2004 available at

regularly updated america online and the national cyber security alliance aolncsa online safety study october 2004 available at httpwwwstaysafeonlineinfonewssafety_study_v04pdf crs24 especially small businesses are not well prepared to take necessary defensive measures there are several possible reasons for this lack of preparedness including the following cybersecurity currently involves greater level of technical proficiency than many people feel comfortable with cyberattacks are comparatively easy to hide73 many victims may be unaware of an intrusion unless it results in financial fraud or theft and that would likely be discovered well after the intrusion occurred74 both technology and threats evolve and user training and education may not keep pace many organizations underreport cyberattacks and other security incidents for several reasons including concerns about negative impacts on public confidence in the organization75 there are significant economic disincentives for investing in cybersecurity most notably cybersecurity is preventive not profit making cyberattacks are comparatively rare and effects may be distributed for example compromised computer may be used as means of launching an attack against targets rather than being target itself in addition the degree to which cyberattacks pose serious homeland security risk is matter of some dispute while many experts believe that major cyberattack by terrorists or other adversaries is substantial risk others believe that those risks are exaggerated and that the major concern is cybercrime as with other terrorist incidents public perception will probably continue to be shaped to significant degree by the extent of public knowledge about any major attacks that do occur what are the major means of leverage the above discussion illustrates the depth of the challenge faced in developing effective cybersecurity it also shows the diversity ubiquity and importance of cyberspace components and demonstrates that cyberspace includes important elements that might not at first glance be considered part of it given that diversity 73 nrc cybersecurity today and tomorrow p 8 74 for example malware may be surreptitiously planted on home computers to turn them into components of bot net where the computer is used along with many others to launch internet attacks without the computer owners knowledge even while the owner is using the computer robert lemos and jim hu zombie pcs caused web outage akamai says cnet newscom 16 june 2004 75 this is known as reputation risk glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness p 14 crs25 and complexity one approach would be to restrict attention to those components associated with particularly high levels of risk two limits to such an approach are first focus solely on those components known currently to be at high risk could quickly become obsolete while there are currently many known vulnerabilities which if addressed would substantially improve cybersecurity future or currently undiscovered vulnerabilities may come from unexpected places cybercriminals and cyberterrorists would likely seek out new vulnerabilities as current ones are eliminated writers of nuisance viruses have been doing that for several years in many ways cybersecurity involves kind of arms race with adversaries and defenders each adapting successively to actions by the other this arms race is likely to continue as long as information technology and cyberspace continue to evolve at current and expected rates second some would argue that such focus would simply be an extension of the current fragmented approach which is largely reactive as each new vulnerability is discovered new fix is developed and increasingly costly and ineffective what is needed they say is strategic approach that is more preventive or even preemptive in nature rather than largely reactive and defensive76 some argue that the best approach is to reduce the incentives for catastrophic attack77 rather than focusing on preventing all attacks if experience with cyberspace so far is any indication this may be impossible or certainly impractical such an approach would suggest focus on 1 limiting damage and 2 recovery to be effective any preventive approach should probably be broadly applicable to different organizations and systems the interconnectedness of cyberspace gives it some of the characteristics of commons kind of public resource for which in the absence of appropriate controls costs of use by any individual are distributed broadly to the community of users classically using limited resource such as pastureland or fishery as commons promotes overuse and degradation of the resource it pays each individual to maximize his or her use of the resource to graze as many cattle or catch as many fish as possible matter the consequences to the resource as whole this effect has been called the tragedy of the commons78 in cyberspace costs of poor security are often distributed because compromised systems may be used in attacks on others with little impact on the compromised system see above in addition however those costs may be amplified naive user may compromise the integrity of an entire network79 there are several options for broadly addressing weaknesses in cybersecurity such as those discussed in the previous section the following options will be discussed in this section 76 esecurity is more reactive than proactive practice but this approach should be altered in order to decrease future threats

using benchmarks and checklists use of auditing improving training and education building security into enterprise architecture using risk management and using metrics this discussion is followed by brief consideration of the role of economic incentives standards the broad adoption of established standards or the development and adoption of new ones could be one way to improve cybersecurity one widely used definition of standards is prescribed set of rules conditions or requirements concerning definitions of terms classification of components specification of materials performance or operations delineation of procedures or measurement of quantity and quality in describing materials products systems services or practices80 as this rather eclectic definition illustrates there are many different kinds of standards81 they may be classified according to purpose eg product process testing or interface standards they can also be classified according to their focus commonly distinction is made between performance standards which focus on function and design standards which specify features dimensions or other such characteristics third classification is based on how standards are developed and implemented they may be developed through consensus or some other process they may be implemented voluntarily or they may also be imposed for example by law and therefore mandatory voluntary consensus standards are common and federal law encourages their use by federal agencies including dhs82 standards may also be open or proprietary but different observers define open standard 80 national standards policy advisory committee national policy on standards in for the united states and recommended implementation plan december 1978 p 6 81 this discussion is after

requires that all dhs standards activities be be conducted in accordance with section 12d of the national technology transfer advancement act of 1995 15 usc 272 note and office of management and budget circular 119 the 1995 act requires federal agencies to use voluntary consensus standards except where they would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical circular a119 provides guidance for implementing this provision crs27 somewhat differently83 some form of open standards is the approach used typically by major standards organizations which kinds of standards to adopt will very much depend on the goals identified and the characteristics of specific elements in general design standards or detailed regulation usually cannot evolve readily in parallel to an evolving technology given the rapid evolution of information technology there appears to be agreement that their use should be avoided for elements that are not yet mature if appropriate results can be obtained through more flexible approaches such as performance standards or best practices several organizations are involved in the development of cybersecurity standards nist performs wide array of standardsrelated activities including promoting the global use of us standards providing information and technical support to industry and others coordinating the development of national voluntary

to as standards there are aspects of them that are not easily characterized as standards at least according to some observers the notion of criteria is broader than that of standards because it generally includes things such as statements on how system should be designed and operated that cannot be directly assessed by examining the product105 also protection profiles are not written into the cc but are developed and updated as needed code of practice several standards have been developed relating to overall information security practices they might be used in conjunction with other guides such as the cc as elements of an overall framework for cybersecurity there appears to be at least some agreement that good security management standard should cover all important security issues be comprehensive and uptodate be clear unambiguous and easy to understand and use be practical and achievable be scalable to any organization and provide basis for measurement of performance106 the most widely recognized codeofpractice standards are isoiec 13335 and isoiec 17779 the first provides broad guidelines for managing it security gmits in the context of an organizations overall management and stresses challenges posed by the global nature of cyberspace it addresses universal security concepts management and planning risk assessment merits of alternative solutions and

for information security management and13335 addresses how to achieve it111 the standard was issued in 2000 and revision began in 2001 it is based on and virtually identical to the 1999 update of the british standard in information security bs 7799 part 1 which was initially published in 1995112 while called standard isoiec 17799 has been described as more similar to set of guidelines in that it is not written in such way that conformance can be certified113 the standard contains 127 major controls and thousands of bits of guidance but they are not presented as imperatives114 thus organizations may adapt the standard to their needs modifying the application of some sections to fit their management structure or discarding sections that do not apply115 this flexibility has been both praised and criticized on the one hand it means that organizations can use the standard without compromising other key business requirements on the other hand it makes conformance more difficult to assess116 while isoiec 17799 does not itself include certification scheme some countries have developed such schemes perhaps most notable is bs 7799 part 2 developed and used in great britain and also available in other countries including the united states117 this standard specifies requirements and controls for an organizations information security management system isms in ways that can be

experience and expertise of isf members and staff other standards such as isoiec 17799 and the results of isf surveys topics covered include security management critical business applications computer installations networks and systems development that set of topics appears somewhat more limited in scope than the set covered by isoiec 17799 but direct comparison was not possible for this report each topic is organized into several areas 30 altogether which in turn contain several sections 132 altogether each section contains principle an objective and several specific actions or controls the

generally accepted best practice124 nevertheless it is similar enough in both structure and method of development to the standards described above that it arguably should be considered codeofpractice

federal information systems except national security systems which fall under the responsibility of the committee on national security systems cnss and the agencies that operate the systems128 the federal information processing standards fips are standards developed by nist for requirements for federal systems not covered by available voluntary industry standards129 some fips are mandatory for federal agencies while others are not fisma requires nist to develop standards and guidelines including minimum requirements for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets except for national security systems130 none of the fips publications to date specifically address governance issues fips are developed with rulemaking procedures similar to those established by the administrative procedure act131 some fips are adopted by private sector entities for example the data encryption standard des fips 46 introduced in 1977 provides method for cryptographic

practices there are also several other nist publications on various aspects of cybersecurity such as capital planning system development security awareness and training and so forth134 nsa has established an information assurance technical framework forum iatff135 to develop framework for solutions to information assurance problems encountered by federal agencies and industry framework document136 available through the forum provides technical guidance for protecting information and information infrastructure using nsas defenseindepth strategy strengths and weaknesses of standards the widespread use of well established and welldesigned cybersecurity standards would have potential benefits such standards would provide common language and criteria for determining how well organizations are adhering to recognized security needs and requirements in addition as the use of the standards increased the overall level of security would arguably rise as well also the standards would presumably provide common baseline from which continuous improvement in cybersecurity could be implemented through the evolution of the standards however the use of standards in cybersecurity has also been criticized by some some common criticisms are described below they are not sufficiently flexible and cannot track changes in the technology international standards are often updated on three to fiveyear cycle given the rate of evolution of cyberspace some observers have complained that standards become outdated too quickly to be useful for cybersecurity proponents counter that properly developed standards are in fact sufficiently flexible that they can accommodate the technological improvements that are likely to occur between revisions international standards such as iso 17799 are often revised on three to fiveyear cycle both cobit and the isf standard are updated on twoyear cycle the common criteria development board is charged with issuing updates and corrections to

information assurance partnership common criteria evaluation and validation scheme ccevs validation body the interpretations process 6 december 2004 continued crs35 they can be expensive to conform to if certification is available as with bs 7799 part 2 the process of becoming certified may be expensive especially for smaller enterprises even without certification organizations adopting standards may find they need to significantly alter business practices possibly at considerable expense and sometimes in ways that are not in keeping with the optimum business model for the particular enterprise proponents counter that while return on investment may be difficult to measure directly the process of coming into compliance can help organizations identify and correct serious cybersecurity deficiencies and protect them from large expenditures to recover from success attack or from loss of reputation that can be very difficult to regain they are too much like regulation if adherence to particular set of standards becomes expected then certification bodies might take on some of the characteristics of regulators with the attendant benefits and disadvantages proponents may counter that such need not be the case especially if the standards and certification are well designed there are sufficient alternative paths to certification to avoid the development of effective monopolies and compliance is voluntary as it is with most standards the mixed success of the common criteria illustrates some of these reported pitfalls these include lack of flexibility despite attempts to build flexibility into the cc the inability to keep pace with evolving technology and cost and time required for certification138 measuring success may be difficult for codeofpractice standards high level codeofpractice standards such as isoiec 17799 have been criticized for not being specific enough to provide sufficient guidance or sufficient common basis for measuring and comparing practices among different organizations at the same time bs 7799 part 2 has been criticized for being too much of checklist and insufficiently adaptable to different kinds of enterprises proponents counter that such critics misunderstand the application of the standards that comparable metrics can be developed and that certification can readily be adapted to the requirements of particular enterprise cc cobit and other standards have been criticized for being difficult to scale especially to the needs of smaller organizations that may not have primary it focus attempts have been made to compensate for this problem for example itgi has developed form of cobit specifically designed for smaller enterprises despite such concerns the advantages of codeof practice and other cybersecurity standards appear to be sufficient that their use is increasing see below 137 continued httpniapnistgovccschemeinterpsprocesshtml 138 see for example subcommittee on technology

hearing 17 september 2003 httpreformhousegovtiprchearingseventsingleaspx eventid527 crs36 the development process may be cumbersome some of the criticisms associated with standards result from the particular methods by which most standards are developed for example the ansi process includes consensus on proposed standard by group or consensus body that includes representatives from materially affected and interested parties broadbased public review and comment on draft standards consideration of and response to comments submitted by voting members of the relevant consensus body and by public review commenters incorporation of approved changes into draft standard and right to appeal by any participant that believes that due process principles were not sufficiently respected during the standards development in accordance with the ansiaccredited procedures of the standards developer139 the designated consensus body is required to be balanced with regard to different interests consensus does not require unanimity but does require substantial agreementby directly and materially affected interestsand that all views and objections be considered and that an effort be made toward their resolution140 this process which may require several meetings ensures that the interests of all involved parties are taken into account but it can be slow and may require compromises that can lead to more complex standards in contrast the internet engineering task force ietf develops standards through process that is performed largely online interested parties form working group to identify the scope of the standard and begin developing it participation in the working group is completely open to anyone interested but there is active attempt to guarantee balance among different interests drafts of the standard are posted online and comments incorporated once the group reaches rough consensus defined as agreement by very large majority of the working group141 the draft is sent to the internet engineering steering group iesg for independent review by experts after successfully passing review the draft may become standard through some additional steps according to some observers the use of fully open online process rough consensus and independent review results in cleaner standards and more rapid process than the more traditional approach taken by most standards bodies certification certification usually refers to formal approval by some entity such as laboratory that product process or person meets specified set of criteria for example an electrical product may be certified as meeting safety standards physician may be certified as meeting particular level of competency in an area of specialization the certifying entity may be accredited by recognized authority such as government agency or professional association accreditation may also 139 ansi standards activities overview httpwwwansiorgstandards_activities overviewoverviewaspx accessed 29

the authorization to use particular information system and accept the attendant risks143 certification processes exist for both product evaluation and code of practice standards for example products can be certified under the cc as discussed above other product evaluation certifications have also been developed for instance the technology group for the financial services roundtable bits runs security certification program for products used by the financial services industry144 the criteria used follow the general scheme laid out in the cc for code of practice certification is available in many countries including the united states under bs7799 part 2 the number of those certifications has been increasing substantially especially in asia145 with more than 800 organizations certified worldwide although only few in the united states146 professional certification is also available from some organizations for example the information systems audit and control association isaca147 offers certification for information security auditors and managers and the international information systems security certification consortium148 offers certification for information security professionals such certifications usually require several years of relevant professional experience successful completion of an examination process adherence to code of conduct and continuing education in the field strengths and weaknesses of certification certification can be an important component of any attempt to adhere to set of established standards that is because it provides means of independent verification that criteria set by the standards have been met many of the criticisms of standards discussed above and counters to them can be applied to certification as well the strengths and weaknesses of certification can be illustrated by isoiec 17799 and the cc if certification were available for isoiec 17799 companies that claim to have adopted it could demonstrate that they have been assessed by an independent accredited body as conforming to its requirements however they would not be free to adapt the standards however they wished to their particular 142 this is

httpwwwisacaorg 148 httpswwwisc2org crs38 operating situations and needs product certified under the cc can be used with confidence in the kinds of environments to which the certification applies however the certification process is expensive and timeconsuming increasing the costs of the products and potentially impeding the adoption of newer technologies there also does not appear to have been any systematic assessment of the effectiveness of certification under standards such as bs7799 part 2 with respect to improving cybersecurity that may be in part because the certification has been available for only few years there are at least two ways that success could be measured and that different standards and methods of compliance could be compared149 first the incidence of security problems including but not limited to attacks would be expected to be lower for organizations using the most effective standard and compliance method that measure may be hard to use as long as organizations are reluctant to reveal security breaches or other problems as has been reported150 another more indirect metric would be the relative success of different certifications presumably an organization that finds particular certification to be effective would be more likely to renew it or to purchase additional products certified under it than switch to another or discontinue use however other factors such as cost can also influence the relative success of different certification regimes best practices best practices often refers to strategies policies procedures and other action related elements of cybersecurity that are generally accepted as being the most successful or costeffective such practices can be identified for virtually any of the elements of cybersecurity framework from goals to specific procedures or specifications unfortunately there does not appear to be any overall agreement on what constitutes best practice the term implies that the practice in question has been assessed as being superior to all others but the basis of such assessments if provided usually appears at best to be consensus among experts rather than rigorous empirical comparison of alternatives in fact it is not uncommon in the literature for set of best practices to be asserted with description of what criteria were used to identify them as best given the vagueness associated with the use of this term it might be more appropriate to refer instead to commonly accepted or generally accepted practices at least where there is evidence to that effect151 what is called set of best practices can vary greatly in content and method of development at one extreme are standards developed through wellestablished 149 see also the section below on measuring success 150 national survey on computer crime and security conducted for the last several years has found little change in reporting of incidents by organizations experiencing intrusions with about half of all participating organizations responding that they did not report them with most of those citing concerns about reputation risk as primary reason for not reporting gordon 2004 csifbi survey p 13 151 see for example nist generally accepted principles and practices crs39 methodology such as the code of practices contained in isoiec 17799 or cobit at the other extreme set of best practices might simply be recommendations from one person published in newsletter article best practices may be developed specifically for one sector or industry for example the network reliability and interoperability council nric has developed set of more than 150 cybersecurity best practices for the communications industry152 most of these are fairly general such as disable unnecessary services but some are much more specific however they are intended to address classes of problems rather than providing detailed fixes to specific problems nric used an industry consensus approach to develop them stressing that practice is included only after sufficient rigor and deliberation including discussions among experts and stakeholders about whether the practice is implemented widely enough its effectiveness and feasibility the risk associated with failing to implement it and alternatives nric proposes that these practices be used as recommendations and not as requirements and that they be adapted to the individual needs of the organization using them in another example the asp industry consortium produced set of white papers prepared by the consortiums security subcommittee that include about 25 best practices for network and platform security153 the practices described are fairly general such as use remote access sparingly the methodology by which they were developed is not described another group of best practices with relevance to cybersecurity is known as capability maturity models cmm essentially these are practices arranged along hierarchy of maturity levels designed to help organizations identify the level at which they operate processes for the development of software and other products and to improve those processes by successively improving to higher levels of maturity154 the system has been developed as joint publicprivate partnership initiated by the department of defense in the 1980s one example is cleanroom software engineering procedures based on mathematical verification of designs and statistical testing of systems that are designed to produce highly reliable software that has minimum of errors and vulnerabilities for applications where security considerations are priority techniques have been developed to engineer systems to the appropriate level of security corresponding to the specific needs for the application such systems are designed with carefully specified requirements and are thoroughly reviewed and tested before implementation155 152 see nric nric best practices httpwwwbelllabscomuserkrauschernric 13 september

j trammell cleanroom software engineering reference model version 10 technical report cmusei96tr022 november 1996 available at httpwwwseicmuedupubdocuments96reportspdf tr02296pdf crs40 best practices would not necessarily be associated with certification or audit process so it can be difficult to determine if an organization is in fact conforming to them effectively however they generally provide degree of flexibility and adaptability that may not be available with more formal approaches furthermore they may be easier to update in response to the rapid evolution of technology cyberspace and the threat environment guidelines guidelines may be thought of as general recommendations relating to elements of cybersecurity they are not necessarily associated with any particular methodology or criteria in contrast to standards and at least in theory best practices other than the authority of those making the recommendations one commonly cited set of guidelines is the guidelines for the security of information systems and networks of the organization for economic cooperation and development first adopted in 1992 and most recently revised in 2002 the nine basic principles contained in the guidelines are intended to provide foundation for the development of culture of security the principles focus on the importance of awareness of and responsibility for security the importance of timely responsiveness to security incidents the role of ethical considerations and democratic values the need for risk assessments security as an essential design element for information systems the need for comprehensive security management and the importance of continual review and reassessment many of these principles are also reflected in other documents including isoiec 17799 generally accepted information security principles gaisp is an attempt to draw together hierarchical set of principles that have been reviewed by experts in information security and that meet specified criteria the project was initiated by the information systems security association an international nonprofit association of information security professionals gaisp consists of principles standards conventions and mechanisms that information security practitioners should employ that information processing products should provide and that information owners and organizational governance should acknowledge to ensure the security of information and information systems156 it is intended to provide basis for self regulation for the profession analogous to the generally accepted accounting principles gaap used by certified public accountants157 the hierarchical approach aims to provide guidance that can be applied at various levels within an organization from executive governance to daily management of security risks basel principles the financial services sector has been among the leaders in developing and implementing components of cybersecurity framework the basel committee on banking supervision has released set of guidelines called risk 156 information systems security association generally accepted information security principles version 30 2004 p 2 gaisp is successor to an earlier effort called generally accepted system security principles 157 see for example federal accounting standards advisory board generally accepted accounting principles httpwwwfasabgovacceptedhtml crs41 management principles for electronic banking158 while seven of the fourteen principles and practices described in the document relate to security controls159 the basel principles are particularly notable for the degree to which they stress the importance of institutional leadership and the management of legal and reputational risk in the context of cybersecurity for example the first three principles place responsibility for active oversight of cybersecurity management directly on boards of directors and senior management the principles relating to legal and reputational risk focus on information disclosure protection of customer data including privacy and continuity of service the difference between guidelines and best practices is not perhaps as distinct as the difference between either of those and standards while guidelines may provide even greater flexibility and adaptability than best practices their general lack of specificity may make effective implementation more challenging as with best practices guidelines would not necessarily be associated with certification or audit process so it might be difficult to determine if an organization is in fact conforming to them effectively benchmarks and checklists fundamentally benchmark is simply reference point against which performance is measured it might be used as goal or it might be considered level of minimum acceptable performance the latter might also be called baseline with respect to computers benchmark often refers to test used to compare one or more aspects of performance of system such as processing speed with other systems or with specified level of function with respect to cybersecurity the terms benchmarks and checklists are more often used to denote sets of security configurations and settings that are recommended to achieve specified level of security one wellknown set provides minimum security configurations for the microsoft windows 2000 operating system developed through consensus process involving federal agencies and private organizations160 it was released by the center for internet security cis in 2002161 security configuration benchmarks have also been developed for other operating systems application software and some hardware162 nist has developed program 158 the document was released in july 2003 and is available at

pcigcightml for the federal government crs42 to devise security checklists for software and hardware used by federal agencies163 the defense information systems agency disa164 and nsa also produce configuration guidance documents producing an effective set of codeofpractice benchmarks is arguably more difficult than producing technical configuration guidance one example of set of codeofpractice benchmarks was developed by the human firewall council consortium of information security professionals called the security management index it is now managed by issa165 based on iso 17799 it permits organizations to perform selfassessments via completion of survey to determine how well they conform to the objectives in the standard in comparison to other organizations that have participated benchmarks and checklists can be an important element of cybersecurity framework but are by their nature very specific and limited in scope also some confusion may result from the occasional use of the term as synonym for standards auditing auditing is often thought of as formal examination of financial or accounting records but it is also used in broader sense such as to denote independent examination of an organizations adherence to established controls policies or legal requirements166 an organization may undergo for example security audit of its information systems that may involve an examination of hardware software procedures configurations environment and user practices an audit may be performed by the organization itself or it may be performed by an independent auditor usually firm that specializes in accounting and auditing audits usually follow set of established practices and procedures such as the statement on auditing standards 70 known as sas70 issued by the auditing standards board of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa167 information security audit guides have also been developed for government agencies168 an audit usually involves testing of controls and results in report that includes the opinion of the auditor about the adequacy of the controls examined with recommendations for improvements it does not result in

expected to conform to established standards in the conduct of an audit169 auditing methods and requirements are most well developed with respect to financial and accounting processes as result some audits might tend to underemphasize aspects of cybersecurity that are not related to those processes the results of audits might also vary significantly among different auditors the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204 requires audits of financial controls including information security controls for publicly traded companies training and education if as some observers believe people are the most important element of effective cybersecurity then training and education should be an important means of leverage to improve cybersecurity inadequate cybersecurity practices by users it personnel and even corporate leadership have been widely cited as major vulnerability170 the nssc lists national cyberspace security awareness and training as one of its top five priorities elements include comprehensive national awareness program and support for training education and professional certification171 the national cyber security alliance ncsa has been established as publicprivate partnership of government agencies corporations and nongovernmental organizations to promote cybersecurity education and awareness172 many factors can influence the effectiveness of training and education to enhance cybersecurity for example programs and materials vary in quality and poorly designed program is unlikely to provide significant improvements in cybersecurity in addition training may not be able to compensate sufficiently for poor system design 169 see for example information systems audit and control association is standards guidelines and procedures for auditing and control professionals 1 july 2004 available at httpwwwisacaorgcontentmanagementcontentdisplaycfmcontentid13927 this document defines standards as mandatory auditing and reporting requirements guidelines as guidance in applying the standards and procedures as methods an auditor might use in an audit p 6 170 see for example thomas glaessner and others electronic security risk mitigation in financial transactions the world bank june 2002 available at httpwww1worldbankorgfinanceindexhtml in many countries throughout the world statistical analysis reveals that more than 50 percent of electronic security intrusions are carried out by insiders an uneducated or undereducated workforce is inherently more vulnerable to this type of incident or attack in contrast welltrained workforce conscious of security issues can add layer of protection hence the safety and efficiency of technology is directly related to the training and technical education of the persons using the technology p 51 171 nssc p 37 42 172 see httpwwwstaysafeonlineinfo the major government agencies supporting this alliance are dhs and the federal trade commission crs44 enterprise architecture effective cybersecurity needs to focus not only on the individual elements of an organizations information technology but also how they interact the term enterprise architecture ea has become increasingly used to refer to the components of an organization and how they work together to achieve the organizations objectives specific definitions and usage vary ea is often used specifically to refer to the information technology component of the architecture and especially to the interoperability of those components it is also used to denote blueprint of an organizations business operations and the technology required to perform those operations173 the federal government is developing businessdriven ea to improve interoperability and services174 an organization can characterize its ea to assist in planning and development of its information technology such characterization can provide an opportunity to make security an integral part of ea this component of ea is sometimes called the security architecture175 however even the initial characterization of an organizations ea can be timeconsuming and expensive and the costs of reengineering to build in security may be prohibitive for many organizations in addition the need to build business case to justify it investments which is often considered important to the ea approach may create barriers to improving security given the traditional difficulties of demonstrating financial return on investments in security risk management the approach embodied in defenseindepth recognizes that security cannot be perfect but rather reduces the risk and impact of successful attack or other breach such reduction can be captured through risk management which involves identifying controlling and mitigating threats vulnerabilities and the impacts of security breaches the steps in effective risk management include assessment of risk steps to mitigate them and continuous evaluation and adjustment the approach often involves costbenefit analysis to help determine optimal mitigation steps mitigation may involve accepting the risk as cost of business avoiding risk associated with particular activity for example by not engaging in it limiting the risk through effective use of controls and transferring the risk for example through insurance176 some insurance companies have begun to offer cybersecurity policies 173 see crs report rl31846 science and technology policy issues for the 108th congress 2nd session p 16 174 see httpwwwwhitehousegovombegova1feahtml 175 see for example network applications consortium enterprise security architecture framework and template for policydriven security 3 december 2004 available at httpwwwnetappsorg 176 see for example gary stoneburner and others risk management guide

httpwwwfoundstonecomresourceswhitepaperswp_security_ continued crs45 under which companies can transfer some of their risks in the event of successful attack carriers may require clients to implement specified security practices to qualify for insurance however in the absence of reliable actuarial data about the risks and costs of cyberattacks it may be difficult for carriers to set appropriate insurance rates to be effective risk management requires accurate risk assessment however many cybersecurity risks may be difficult to assess for reasons discussed earlier in addition risk management approach may lead an organization to accept risks for which the potential impacts of security events are low regardless of external impacts177 thus risk management is not likely to sufficiently address cybersecurity problems associated with the commons properties of cyberspace discussed earlier in this report metrics whatever approaches are used to improve cybersecurity measuring their success would appear to be essential to determining how effective they are and to making improvements however fundamental problems exist with measuring success in security seemingly the most appropriate measure is the number of successful attacks but in fact attacks especially the kind of major attack for which effective defense is critical may be comparatively uncommon so that absence of successful attack may not indicate effective security178 in addition attackers often take steps to avoid detection so an absence of detected attacks may in fact be measure of poor rather than good security this conceptual problem might be addressed through the use of proxy measures such as how well technology policy and activities conform to certain accepted benchmarks as well as the use of proficiency testing such as blind red team attacks or other penetration testing not only is it difficult to identify appropriate metrics for cybersecurity there are also risks of distortions that may be associated with any particular metric virtually any given metric will measure only one or limited number of aspects of goal if however the limitations of the metric are not understood attempts to use it to optimize security can lead to distortions as the above example illustrates this appears to be general concern179 however some argue that using even distorted metrics can be beneficial if the process of measuring them focuses attention on problems or deficiencies and leads to correction 176 continued risk_managementpdf 177 this is because costbenefit analyses do not usually take externalities into account of course even in the absence of direct impact accepting such risks might nevertheless involve reputation costs 178 of course the incidence of viruses trojan horses and other kinds of malware has increased steadily as have attempts to compromise computers with them nevertheless relatively simple measures can guard against most such attacks 179 ronda henning and others workshop on information system security scoring and ranking 21 23 may 2001 proceedings silver spring md applied computer security associates 2002 crs46 metrics relating to the effects of security events are called impact metrics those relating to the delivery of security services are called effectiveness or efficiency metrics and those relating to the execution of security policies are called implementation metrics nist has published guidelines on such metrics to assist agencies in complying with federal requirements180 the document does not urge the adoption of any specific set of metrics although it does provide examples instead it recommends that the metrics chosen use data that can be realistically obtained that measure existing stable processes and that facilitate the improvement of security implementation the kinds of metrics that can be effectively gathered will depend on the level of maturity of the security program programs at low levels of maturity will of necessity be limited to using implementation metrics impact metrics can be effective for organizations that have mature security programs with fully integrated procedures and controls181 economic incentives implementation of cybersecurity measures may involve substantial costs and is therefore sensitive to market forces and other economic factors if sufficient economic incentives exist for improving cybersecurity then organizations are likely to make the investments needed in the absence of government regulation or other drivers one concern often raised is that economic incentives are often insufficient and that in fact significant counterincentives exist the perceived inadequacy of incentives for cybersecurity can be seen as form of market failure kind of economic inefficiency182 there are several lines of evidence supporting this view for example it can be difficult for law enforcement officials to arrest and prosecute hackers if companies are unwilling to provide information on cyberattacks yet company risks suffering significant reputation costs if that information leads customers to conclude that the companys information systems are not sufficiently secure in addition investments in cybersecurity cannot easily be analyzed in terms of return on investment since they do not contribute to income in measurable way183 therefore companies may be reluctant to make the necessary investments also impacts of compromised systems may reach far beyond the system where the compromise occurred184 the interconnectedness of 180 marianne swanson and others security metrics guide for information technology systems nist special publication 80055 july 2003 available at httpcsrcnistgovpublicationsnistpubs80055sp80055pdf 181 the guidelines provide the following example the impact metrics would quantify incidents by type eg root compromise password compromise malicious code denial of service and correlate the incident data to the percentage of trained users and system administrators to measure the impact of training on security ibid p 12 182 glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness p 18 19 183 for discussion of this and other cost issues in cybersecurity see crs report rl32331 the economic impact of cyberattacks 184 for example computer failure was significant factor in the august 2003 electrical blackout in the northeastern united states uscanada power system outage task force final report on the august 14 2003 blackout in the united states and canada causes and recommendations april 2004 httpsreportsenergygovblackoutfinalwebpdf the continued crs47 cyberspace has made it to significant extent commons with associated economic externalities the widespread adoption of the kinds of leverage to improve cybersecurity discussed above may be doubtful without changes in the current incentive structure such changes could arise from several sources among them are increases in public demand for cybersecurity changes in expected behavior within sector regarding investment in cybersecurity185 publicprivate partnerships and regulation or other action by governments while not all such factors are themselves economic in nature they can clearly affect the economic incentive structure for example company that does not respond to expectations from its peers for improved cybersecurity may suffer significant reputation cost similarly company that is found to violate government requirements may suffer both reputation costs and direct punitive action or may be held financially liable for damages what roles should government and the private sector play the above discussion shows that 1 there is currently unified national framework for improving cybersecurity 2 there are several areas of weakness where such framework could be useful in generating improvements and 3 several means of leverage exist that could be used in the development and implementation of such framework questions remain however about whether additional federal efforts would be needed or desirable according to the nssc government role in cybersecurity is warranted in nongovernmental cases where high transaction costs or legal barriers lead to significant coordination problems cases in which governments operate in the absence of private sector forces resolution of incentive problems that lead to under provisioning of critical shared resources and raising awareness186 are market forces along with current government and privatesector policies and practices sufficient to put in place the necessary components if not will additional voluntary efforts be sufficient or is further government action required this section discusses whether current efforts are adequate and what policy options exist for further action 184 continued economic cost of that blackout has been estimated at several billion dollars with most of that loss occurring outside the electric utility sector electricity consumers resource council the economic impacts of the august 2003 blackout 9 february 2004 httpwwwelconorgdocumentseconomicimpactsofaugust2003blackoutpdf 185 for example collective concern regarding reputation risk or the potential for government intervention might lead organizations within sector to agree on minimum standard of cybersecurity practice 186 nssc p ix crs48 current efforts while many observers argue that cybersecurity efforts remain inadequate overall substantial evidence of improvements can be found they range from steady increases in the number of organizations adopting cybersecurity standards of practice see discussion above to efforts to increase public awareness about cybersecurity to new federal and state requirements for government and privatesector information systems the legal framework for cybersecurity continues to evolve with new federal and state laws being implemented and new publicprivate partnerships have been developed laws and regulations according to the nssc it is the policy of the united states to prevent or minimize disruptions to critical information infrastructures and thereby protect the people the economy the essential human and government services and the national security of the united states disruptions that do occur should be infrequent of minimal duration and manageable and cause the least damage possible the policy requires continuous effort to secure information systems for critical infrastructure and includes voluntary publicprivate partnerships involving corporate and nongovernmental organizations187 however current federal law and regulation is generally much narrower in scope applying to computer systems operated by or on behalf of the federal government188 the requirements and governance mechanisms differ depending on whether or not system is designated as national security system in general however the federal information security management act of 2002 fisma title iii of pl 107347 the egovernment act of 2002 requires agencies to develop policies and standards to provide for the integrity confidentiality and availability of information as required by the act nist has developed broad range of standards and guidelines189 and the office of management and budget omb reports annually to congress on agency compliance with it security requirements in its most recent annual report omb reported substantial improvements overall190 although the government accountability office gao noted wide variability in agency compliance and 187 ibid p 13 188 for discussion of specific federal provisions with respect to both government and private systems see crs report rl32357 computer security summary of selected federal laws executive orders and presidential directives 189 see national institute of standards and technology fisma implementation project httpcsrcnistgovseccertindexhtml 2 november 2004 190 office of management and budget fy2003 report to congress on federal government information security management 1 march 2004 httpwwwwhitehousegovombinforegfy03_fisma_reportpdf the report does not include information on national security systems crs49 significant weaknessesthat put critical operations and assets at risk191 among the areas of weakness cited was the program management framework for security despite remaining weaknesses and concerns these federal programs and requirements can be important not only directly by improving federal cybersecurity but also by providing information opportunities and incentives for improving cybersecurity in the private sector nists fisma standards and guidelines are publicly available as are some information assurance documents produced by the national security agency192 even though they apply only to government agencies and contractors federal cybersecurity requirements can also potentially stimulate market for more secure products for example if companys product must meet certain security specifications for federal agencies it may be more costeffective for the company to make those specifications available in general rather than customizing the product for the federal government nevertheless privatesector organizations are not required to implement fisma and its impact on nongovernmental cybersecurity does not appear to be wellcharacterized some federal laws do place security requirements on certain classes of private sector information and controls193 these include protections for personal information for customers of financial institutions grammleachbliley act of 1999 pl 106102 health information that is held by healthsector entities and that is identifiable with respect to person health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 pl 104191 and audits of financial controls which has been interpreted as including information security of publicly registered companies sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107204194 these are obviously limited domains of influence in cyberspace but they appear to have resulted in significant response in the private sector195 and may have influence beyond their immediate domains of applicability196 the sarbanesoxley act in particular impacts corporate governance with respect to cybersecurity by specifying that corporate management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 191 government accountability office

its customers to institute appropriate cybersecurity measures crs50 controls197 nevertheless none of these laws specifically address the question of framework for cybersecurity their major influence on the development of such framework may be the regulatory incentives that they provide for corporate management to address cybersecurity issues the homeland security act of 2002 hsa gives dhs some authority and resources relating to cybersecurity the national cybersecurity division ncsd was established in june 2003 within the directorate for information assurance and infrastructure protection iaip of the department according to dhs the divisions mission includes the following 1 identifying analyzing and reducing cyber threats and vulnerabilities 2 disseminating cyber threat warning information 3 coordinating cyber incident response and 4 providing technical assistance in continuity of operations and recovery from cyber incidents198 ncsd has created computer emergency response team uscert199 in cooperation with carnegie mellon university to coordinate cybersecurity efforts and established new alert system it has also engaged in efforts to facilitate publicprivate cybersecurity partnerships notably by sponsoring the national cybersecurity summit to that end in december 2003 and followup efforts dhs also sponsors cybersecurity research and development within its science and technology directorate state laws can also have impacts both within and beyond the states that enact them for example the california database protection act ca sb1386 which went into effect july 1 2003 requires any government or private entity doing business in california to reveal to affected residents of the state any security breach that results in unauthorized acquisition of personal information such as social security numbers or information that could permit access to financial accounts while the law requires only notification it is expected to impact cybersecurity because organizations are believed likely to prefer instituting improved security to disclosing breaches with the latters attendant reputation costs it is also expected to have impacts beyond the states borders since interstate businesses are unlikely to institute separate cybersecurity procedures for different states laws and regulations in other countries may also impact cybersecurity measures taken by organizations in the united states especially if those organizations also engage in relevant activities in those countries one example comes from the european union eu which has adopted two directives that require organizations to implement cybersecurity measures eu directives 9546ec on data protection and 200258ec on privacy and electronic communications require member nations to implement measures to ensure the protection of privacy of personal data held or communicated by organizations engaged in commercial or other relevant activities within the eu 197 sec 404a1

cybersecurity frameworks one way sector industries are working together is through voluntary partnerships called information sharing and analysis centers isacs200 dhs lists fourteen such centers201 the centers vary substantially in their activities and relationship with government202 in addition some consortia have been formed to facilitate development and coordination of cybersecurity efforts in addition to groups such as bits cis isf and issa mentioned earlier in this report other examples include the cybersecurity industry alliance csia203 the internet security alliance isa204 and the national cyber security partnership ncsp205 there is significant variation however in the degree to which these groups are considered to be effective working groups developed pursuant to the december 2003 national cyber security summit developed reports with recommendations and guidance for improving cybersecurity the corporate governance task force report206 recommended that organizations adopt governance measures207 derived from isoiec 17799 fisma and other sources it also recommended that dhs endorse the recommendations and launch public campaign urging their adoption by organizations other task forces produced reports with recommendations on software security education and awareness for home users and small businesses information sharing and technical standards and the cc208

httpwwwcyberpartnershiporg crs52 particular supporters of stronger government efforts including regulation argue that they are necessary to improve security and will have positive economic impact by reducing uncertainties concerning economic loss from cyberattacks opponents point to costs the difficulty of determining what requirements are necessary and how to measure compliance and problems in dealing with boundaries between networks and between nations209 some specific arguments that might favor legislative action are as follows most critical infrastructure is in private hands210 yet problems in these sectors arising from inadequate cybersecurity could have implications well beyond the sectors themselves some experts argue that cybersecurity is fundamentally public good and therefore requires government involvement211 there are aspects of cyberspace that resemble those of commons an asset such as public road that is generally available to the public rather than being in private hands unregulated commons can be susceptible to exploitation degradation and other problems as the role of cyberspace in the us and world economy continues to increase its protection and reliability will become more clearly in the national interest as is the case for example with commercial aviation and product safety212 the growing amount of personal information including financial information that is communicated via cyberspace makes it increasingly attractive to thieves and other criminals making the lawenforcement function of government more relevant to cybersecurity the apparent failure of market incentives to stimulate adequate cybersecurity efforts means that governments may be required to intervene to correct the market 209 jeffrey payne regulation and information

regulation of standards at meat packers auto manufacturers or financial institutions were all ok with government mandating certain shields to keep our skies safe establishing minimum security standards in these and other key areas should be looked at in the same light government has role in fighting cyber terrorism san francisco business times 2 december 2002 available at httpsanfranciscobizjournalscomsanfranciscostories20021202 editorial3html crs53 failure an oftencited example is the underreporting of security incidents by an organization despite the fact that timely and sufficiently complete reporting is important for effective response as well as planning among the disincentives for reporting are damage to reputation213 that can result in loss of customers or revenue in the case of company or political repercussions in the case of government agency laws such as the california database protection act discussed above can help to correct such market failures although they can themselves create market distortions or other problems however many other observers believe that legislative action is unnecessary or inappropriate arguments against such action include the belief by many that regulation would be too intrusive and would stifle innovation that voluntary efforts are sufficient that time should be allowed for current laws and voluntary efforts to have impact before further legislative action is considered and that the threat from cyberattack is not great enough to warrant further government action models two models have sometimes been cited as providing possible avenues for federal efforts to develop cybersecurity framework the year2000 y2k computer problem and environmental and safety regulations each is discussed below response to the year2000 computer problem government involvement in the efforts to resolve the year2000 computer problem214 is sometimes cited as possible model for government involvement in cybersecurity key element in that approach was the use of evolving and increasing requirements for publicly traded companies via actions by the securities and exchange commission sec the sec promulgated rules to require companies to respond to the y2k problem congress passed laws to facilitate information sharing and to reduce liability if the company had complied this appeared to demonstrate that 1 the sec can be effective in promoting changes such as those required for improved cybersecurity 2 congress can be an effective enabler of solutions for example by removing barriers to effective information sharing and 3 gradual incremental approach can be effective215 however critics respond that the model is inappropriate for three reasons first the y2k problem is thought by many to have been much less serious than feared so that the effectiveness of response may be questionable as reason for the low number of significant incidents second the problem was fundamentally much simpler than cybersecurity which may require much more complex set of responses third it was onetime problem whereas cybersecurity needs are continuous nevertheless the lessons learned from the y2k 213 glaessner and others electronic safety and soundness p 18 214 basically this was problem with the way most computer software had been designed to handle dates much software code was designed when computer memory was at premium and therefore was coded to process only the last 2 digits of the year therefore the program could not distinguish an entry for the year 2000 from one for the year 1900 this could be particularly concern for programs that used clocks for core processes predictions about the impacts of this discrepancy ranged from trivial to disastrous effects because of the risks of disastrous impact substantial effort was launched to modify or replace computer code both programmable and hardwired to correct the problem 215 payne regulation and information security p 35 crs54 problem may usefully inform the cybersecurity response in fact the sarbanesoxley act uses the sec to promote cybersecurity although the act does not directly provide for gradual improvement the evolution of auditing standards could have that effect safety and environmental regulations whether cybersecurity standardization can be approached using safety or environmental regulation or similar efforts as model might also be considered for example the analogy of cyberspace with the highway system the information superhighway raises the question of whether governments might consider security regulations analogous to safety regulations that apply to roads vehicles and drivers environment the environmental protection agency epa administers several laws aimed at reducing and preventing environmental problems216 for example the pollution prevention act of 1990 required epa to develop and implement strategy for reducing pollution at the source217 in comparison the hsa requires dhs to develop comprehensive national plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastructure of the united states including power production generation and distribution systems information technology and telecommunications systems including satellites electronic financial and property record storage and transmission systems emergency preparedness communications systems and the physical and technological assets that support such systems218 the plan would therefore include several key elements of cyberspace however the act does not explicitly provide dhs with authority to implement the plan219 the emergency planning and community righttoknow act of 1986 requires many industrial facilities to report release of toxic chemicals annually submission of information on cybersecurity problems such as attacks remains voluntary under hsa but the act contains provisions to facilitate such submissions for certain kinds of information220 the clean air act and related legislation requires epa to set and enforce national standards for ambient air quality and assigns major responsibility for compliance to the states it also requires standards for vehicle emissions that have 216 for more detail about these statutes see crs report rl30798 environmental laws summaries of statutes administered by the environmental protection agency 217 42 usc 13103 218 sec 201d5 219 also the nssc was not developed pursuant to any specific legislative mandate and federal agency has been given statutory authority to implement it 220 specifically the act defines protected class of nonpublic critical infrastructure information relating to security for example instances of attacks or known vulnerabilities and prohibits public disclosure and certain other use by dhs of such information if voluntarily submitted to the federal government crs55 led manufacturers to modify technologies to meet those standards the hsa does not provide dhs with authority to set or enforce national standards for cybersecurity food and product safety several federal agencies share responsibility for regulating food safety in the united states primarily the food and drug administration of the department of health and human services and the food safety and inspection service of the department of agriculture221 both agencies set regulations with input from industry and other interested parties and use monitoring by inspectors to ensure conformance with the regulations the consumer product safety commission is an independent regulatory agency established to protect the public from unreasonable risk of injury or death from consumer products the agency sets voluntary and mandatory product safety standards has the power to recall or even ban hazardous products222 also under state product liability laws plaintiffs may sue for damages for injury to person or property resulting from defective product223 the federal government does not regulate or set mandatory or voluntary standards for cybersecurity except to some extent with respect to federal agencies and contractors the federal approaches to environmental protection and to food and product safety could provide potential models should congress wish to use government regulation as way of improving cybersecurity as some have proposed224 however the highly interconnected amorphous and constantly evolving nature of cyberspace might provide significant barriers to the creation of regulations that improve cybersecurity but do not impede technology development and entrepreneurship options for congress should congress consider taking action to facilitate the adoption of framework for cybersecurity there are several options that might be considered with respect to both legislation and oversight some possibilities are described below to illustrate the range of options the examples are for illustration only225 therefore discussion of benefits and disadvantages is given among the legislative options are the following encourage the widespread adoption of cybersecurity standards and best practices there are several potential ways to achieve such goal perhaps the strongest measures would be for congress to provide the department of homeland security or another agency with regulatory authority over cyberspace industries and direct the department to develop and enforce mandatory cybersecurity standards presumably through process that involved the industries and other interested parties as is the case for example with food safety moderate approach might be to further codify and strengthen dhss role in working work with industry to develop 221 see crs 9891 food safety agencies and authorities primer and crs report rl31853 food safety issues in the 109th congress 222 httpwwwcpscgov 223 see crs issue brief ib97056

dailyfed1204120104c1htm 225 crs does not take positions on legislative issues crs56 voluntary standards and best practices or to provide tax incentives for companies to adopt acceptable cybersecurity measures leverage procurement congress could require that cybersecurity be high priority in all federal acquisitions of information technology it could further require that companies that operated under accepted levels of cybersecurity practices such as recognized international standards would receive preference for federal contracts encourage mandatory reporting to further counter disincentives for companies to report cybersecurity vulnerabilities and breaches congress could require federal and private organizations to reveal certain kinds of security breaches as california has done226 it could also require companies to report specified classes of incidents and vulnerabilities to dhs under the protections afforded by the hsa rather than relying on voluntary reporting facilitate product liability actions congress could direct dhs to identify classes of cybersecurity weaknesses for which states could permit plaintiffs to sue manufacturers under product liability laws or provide some other mechanism to facilitate such redress facilitate development of cybersecurity insurance to the extent that lack of reliable actuarial information or other barriers are impeding the development of cybersecurity insurance congress could facilitate the development of the industry by providing for reinsurance or other guarantees as it does in certain other areas227 strengthen federal cybersecurity programs hr 5068 introduced in the 108th congress and reintroduced in the 109th congress as hr 285 proposes establishing the position of assistant secretary for cybersecurity within dhs with responsibility for among other things implementing priorities similar to those laid out in the nssc the 109th congress might enact legislation with such provisions and also could strengthen existing cybersecurity efforts in other agencies such as nist and nsf and through the sec oversight and investigative hearings could also provide mechanisms for congress to facilitate the development of cybersecurity framework several hearings were held during the 108th congress most notably by the subcommittee on cybersecurity science and research and development of the house select committee on homeland security228 and the subcommittee on technology 226 see discussion of the california database protection act under the section above on current efforts 227 for example in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks congress enacted the terrorism risk insurance act pl 107297 to assist both policyholders and the insurance industry in adjusting to the impacts of the attacks see crs report rs21444 the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 summary of provisions 228 for list of hearings and other activities see subcommittee on cybersecurity science and research development of the u s house of representatives select committee on homeland security cybersecurity for the homeland report of the activities and findings by the chairman and ranking member december 2004 available at continued crs57 information policy intergovernmental relations and the census of the house committee on government reform229 additional hearings could be held during the 109th congress on legislative options such as those described above or for example on implementation of the recommendations relating to vulnerability reduction in the nssc alternatively congress might decide that legislative action or targeted oversight would be appropriate at this time there remain considerable differences of opinion among experts about both the seriousness of cybersecurity threats especially with respect to terrorism and the potential benefits and disadvantages of any additional federal action to improve cybersecurity in the private sector in addition ongoing and new government and private sector efforts such as those discussed above might result in sufficient improvements to render additional congressional action unnecessary or of marginal benefit the question remains however whether those efforts will have sufficient impact quickly enough to meet national cybersecurity needs the answer to that question will likely depend to significant degree on the scale and immediacy of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities over which there is still considerable debate matter what actions congress might take to strengthen cybersecurity efforts there are several issues that may be influential in the debate in addition to the uncertainties discussed above one significant issue is the degree to which cyberspace is in fact commons with the attendant characteristics that reduce the likelihood that market mechanisms alone can lead to appropriate security another is the difficulty of obtaining coordination and cooperation from the large number of interested and affected parties especially given the global nature of cyberspace third issue is whether the different approaches advocated by different groups can be effectively harmonized so that there is common understanding of what the key elements of cybersecurity framework should be and how they should be implemented related to that is the issue of how to ensure that the particular needs of different sectors are met while attempting to achieve harmonization finally there is the issue of lag time the degree to which the speed of evolution of cyberspace and its supporting technology outstrips attempts to develop effective standards and other elements of cybersecurity framework those and other issues strongly suggest that the attempt to develop national framework for cybersecurity is likely to remain significant challenge for the nation during the 109th congress 228 continued httphschousegov filescybersecurityreport120604pdf 229 list of subcommittee hearings in the 108th
