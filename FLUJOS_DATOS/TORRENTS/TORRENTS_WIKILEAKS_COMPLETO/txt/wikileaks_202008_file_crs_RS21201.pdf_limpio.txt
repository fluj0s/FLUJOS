environmental policy resources science and industry division summary to address nationwide water polluti on problem caused by leaking underground storage tanks usts congress created leak prevention tection nd cleanup program in 1984 in 1986 congress establishe d the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund to help the environmen tal protection agency epa and states to remediate leaking petroleum usts where ow ners failed to do so and to oversee lust cleanup activities by responsib parties despite much progress in the program challenges have remained key issue has been that stat resources have not met the demands of administering the ust leak prev ention program states have long sought larger appropriations from the trust fund to support the lust cleanup program and some also sought flexibility to use fund re sources to administer and enforce the ust leak prevention program another issue has concerned the detection of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in groundwater at many lu st sites and in water supplies this gas additive was used widely to meet clean air act requirements to reduce auto emissions however mtbe is very watersoluble nd once released it is more likely to reach water supplies and often is more costly to remediate than conventional gas leaks in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the 109th congress expanded the leak prevention provisions in the ust pr ogram imposed new program responsibilities on epa and states and authorized use of the lust trust fund for prevention as well as cleanup activities in the energy inde pendence and security act of 2007 pl 110 140 the 110th congress amended the clean air act to authorize epa to regulate fuels and fuel additives for the purpose of protecting water quality as well as air quality this report reviews the lust program and related issues nd developments background in the 1980s epa termined that many of the roughly 22 million underground storage tanks usts in the united states most of them storing petroleum were leaking many other tanks were nearing the end of their useful life expectancy and were expected to leak in the near future approximate ly 50 of the us population relies on groundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21201crs2 water for their drinking wate r and states were reportin g that leaking underground tanks were the leading source of groundwater contamination in 1984 congress responded to this environmen tal and safety thr eat and established leak prevention detection and cleanup pr ogram for usts containing chemicals or petroleum through amendments to the solid waste disposal act 42 usc 6901 et seq also known as the resource conservation and recovery act rcra subtitle i directed epa to establish operating re quirements and technical standards for tank design and installation leak detection spill and overfill control corr ective action and tank closure the universe of regulated tanks was extremely large and diverse and included many small businesses consequently epa phased in the tank regulations over 10year period 1988 through 1998 strict standards for new ta nks took effect in 1988 and all tanks were required to comply with leak detection regu lations by late 1993 all tanks installed before 1988 had to be upgraded with spill overf ill and corrosion protection replaced or closed by december 22 1998 in 1986 congress established respons program for leaking petroleum usts through the superfund amendments and r eauthorization act pl 99499 which amended rcra subtitle i the amendments authorized epa and states to respond to petroleum spills and leaks and created the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund to help epa and states cover the costs of responding to leaking usts in cases where ust owners or operators do not clean up site epa and the states have used the annual lust trust fund appropr iation mainly to oversee nd enforce corrective actions performed by responsible parties they so use the funds to conduct corrective actions where responsible party has been identifie d where responsible party fails to comply with cleanup order in the event of an em ergency and to take cost recovery actions against parties epa and states have been successful in getting responsible parties to perform most cleanups in thes cases the cleanup costs typically have been paid for by state fund discussed below the respons ible party andor private insurance state funds the 1986 law also directed epa to establish financial responsibility requirements to ensure that ust owners nd operators are able to cover the costs of taking corrective action and compensating third parties for injuries and property damage caused by leaking tanks as mandated epa issued regulations requiring most tank owners and operators selling petroleum pr oducts to demonstrate minimum financial responsibility of 1 million alternatively ow ners and operators could rely on state assurance funds to demonstr ate financial responsibility saving them the cost of purchasing private insurance most states established fina ncial assurance funds unlike the federal lust trust fund st ate funds often are used to reimburse financially solvent tank owners and operators for so or all of the costs of remediating leaking tank sites revenues for state funds typically have been generated through gas taxes and tank fees and collectively these funds have provide d more cleanup funds than the lust trust fund june 2007 survey of states showed th at cumulatively stat had collected and spent roughly 1545 billion through their f unds during 2007 state funds collected 15 billion in annual revenue s and paid out total of 101 billion while outstanding claims against state funds reached 268 billion up from 132 billion in 2006 the number of sites with claims increased from 143827 in 2004 to 162699 in 2007 while 10 states had made transition to private insurance 20 st ates had extended their funds original sunset date to address the backlog of leaking tanks see the 2007 state financial assurance funds survey at httpwwwastswmoorghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21201crs3 1 government accountability office leaking underground

centpergallon motor fuels tax that began in 1987 the energy policy ac t of 2005 pl 10958 hr 6 extended the tax through march 2011 during fy2008 the tax generated roughly 17326 million in revenue down from 22826 million in fy2007 the trust fund earned another 12734 million in interest for an timated revenue total of 3006 million for the fiscal year at the end of fy2008 the trust funds net ssets were 321 billion preliminary estimate epa roughly estimates that the average cost of cleaning up leaking tank site is 125000 and through march 2008 106577 releases still required reme diation although epa expects that private parties will pay fo r most cleanups in 2007 states estimated that 12 billion was needed to remediate at leas t 54000 tank sites that lack viable owners1 in recent years congress has appropria ted approximately 72 million annually from the trust fund to support the lust response pr ogram in the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 congress provi ded 1058 million from the fund including roughly 72 million for the cleanup progra m and also 338 million for the ust leak prevention program reflecting the newly au thorized uses of the trust fund under the energy policy act for fy2009 as previously the president requested funding from the trust fund only to support the lust clea nup program 723 million funding for the ust leak prevention program was re quested from general revenue funds epa typically has allocated approximately 81 roughl 58 million of the annual trust fund appropriation to the states in th form of coope rative agreements and 4 to support lusteligible activities on indian lands epa s used the remaining 15 for its program responsibilities the ener gy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 1522 specified that epa must allot at least 80 of the lust trust fund appropriation to the states under cooperative agreements with epa the states receive grants to help cover the cost of administering the lust program stat have used most of their lust program grants to hire staff for tec hnical oversight of corrective ac tions performed by responsible parties typically they have used about onethird of the lust money they received for cleaning up abandoned tank sites and undertaking emergency responses epa uses its portion of the appropriati on to oversee cooperative agreements with states implement the lust corrective acti on program on indian lands and support state and regional offices epa priorities in the lust program have included reducing the backlog of confirmed releases promoting better and less expens ive cleanups providing assistance to indian tribes assisting with the cleanup of more complicated sites especially sites contaminated with mtbe and implementing the energy policy act provisions program accomplishments and issues epa reports that since the federal unde rground storage tank program began more than 168 million of the roughly 22 million petr oleum tanks subject to regulation have been closed and overall

were making solid progress in addressing tank leaks new problem emerged the gasoline additive mtbe was being detected at thousa nds of lust sites and in numerous drinking water supplies usually at low levels gasoline refiners had relied heavily on mtbe to produce gasoline that contained oxygenates as required by the 1990 clean air act amendments as way to improve combusti on and reduce mobile source emissions once released into the environment however mtbe moves through soil and into water more rapidly than other gasoline components becau of its mobility mtbe is more likely to reach drinking water supplies and it often is more difficult and costly to remediate than conventional gasoline although mtbe is thoug ht to be less toxic than some gasoline components such as benzene even sma ll amounts can render water undrinkable because of its strong taste and odor also in 1993 epas office of resear ch and development concluded that the data s upport classifying mtbe as possible human carcinogen3 although epa has not done so at least seven st ates have set drinking water standards for mtbe and many states have established cl eanup standards or guidelines at least 25 states have enacted limits or bans on the use of mtbe in gasoline at least 42 states require testing for mtbe in ground water at lust sites in 2000 survey 31states reported that mtbe was f ound in ground water at 40 or more of lust sites in their states 24 states reported mtbe at 60 to 100 of site s an update of this survey found that many sites had not been sted for mtbe and that most states did not plan to reopen closed sites to look for mtbe implementation and compliance issues epa estimated that by fy2001 89 of usts had upgraded tank equipment to m eet federal requireme nts however the government accountability office gao reporte d that because of poor training of tank owners operators and other personnel about 200000 29 usts were not being operated or maintained properly thus in creasing the risk of leaks and ground water contamination gao also reported that only 19 states physically inspected all their tanks every three years the minimum epa considered necessary for effective tank monitoring and that consequently epa and states lacked the information needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the tank program and take appropriate enforcement actions4 among its initiatives to improve compliance epa revised the definition of compliance significant operational compliance to place greater emphasis on the proper operation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21201crs5 maintenance of tank equipment and syst ems in june 2008 epa reported that nationwide 77 of recently inspected ust f acilities were in compliance with the release prevention regulations 73 were in compliance with the leak detection regulations and 65 of facilities had complied with the combined requirements legislation the 109th congress addressed lust and mtbe contamination issues in the energy policy act of 2005 epact pl 10958 hr 6 the act revised the ust leak prevention and cleanup programs title xv subtitle b and extended the 01 centpergallon motor fuels tax that finances the lust trust fund through march 2011 1362 mtbe in the energy policy act of 2005 the house version of hr 6 had included retroactive safe rbor provision to protect ma nufacturers and distributors of fuels containing mtbe or renewable fuel s from product liability claims this provision was opposed by water utilities local govern ment associations and many states opponents argued that providing liability sh ield would effectively leave gas station owners liable for cleanup and as these busine sses often have few re sources the effect of the provision would have been that the burden for cleanup would fall to local communities water utilities and the states proponents argued that safe harbor was merited because mtbe was used heavily to m eet federal clean air mandates they further argued that the focus should be placed on preventing leaks from usts which have been the main source of mtbe contamination for more information on lust and mtbe provisions in pl 10958 see crs report rl32865 renewable fuels and mtbe comparison of selected provisions in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 and hr 6 by brent d yacobucci et ultimate ly the conferees dropped the safe harbor provision and dropped provision to ban mtbe additionally pl 10958 repealed the clean air act oxygenated fuel requirement that had prompted extensive use of mtbe underground storage tank compliance act title xv subtitle b of epact comprised the underground storage tank compliance act ustca the ustca amended rcra subtitle i to add new leak prevention and enforcement provisions to the ust regulatory program and imposed new re quirements on states epa and tank owners the ustca requires epa and states that receive funding under subtitle i to conduct compliance inspections of tanks at least once ev ery three years it also requires states to comply with epa guidance prohibiting fuel delivery to ineligible tanks to develop training requirements for ust operators and individuals responsible for tank maintenance and spill response and to prepare compliance reports on governmentowned tanks in the state further to protect groundwater states must require either that new tanks located near drinking water wells are equipped w ith secondary containment or that ust manufacturers and insta llers maintain evidence of financ ial responsibility to provide for the costs of corrective actions ustca imp lementation informati on and documents are available online at httpwwwepagovoustfedlawsepact_05htm the ustca authorized the appropriation of 155 million annually for fy2006 through fy2011 from the lust trust fund for stat to use to implement new and existing ust leak prevention requirements nd to administer state programs for cleanup purposes the ustca authoriz ed trust fund appropriations of 200 million annually for fy2006 through fy2011 for epa and states to administer the lust cleanup programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21201crs6 and another 200 million annually for fy 2006 thr ough fy2011 specifically for addressing mtbe and other oxygen ated fuels leaks eg ethanol the 110th congress to increase state program re sources and facilitate cleanups congress provided the new funding authoritie s under epact including the authority to use the lust trust fund for prevention ac tivities in addition to cleanup activities nonetheless trust fund re quests have remained at roughly 72 million for fy2008 the president requested 724 million from the lust trust fund for cleanup activities and another 223 million from general revenues thr ough the state and tribal assistance grants stag account to support leak pr evention activities the senate committee on appropriations similarly recommended cl eanup fundi ng from the trust fund and prevention funding from the stag account s rept 11091 in contrast the house report for epas fy2008 funding bill hr 2643 hrept 110187 noted that the epact authorized the prevention grants to be funded from the lust trust fund the house combined the funding to reflect the broad uses of the trust fund authorized by epact the housepassed bill approved 1179 million from the trust fund for cleanup and leak prevention including tank inspection ac tivities this amount included 10 million more than requested for lust cooperative agr eements and 157 million more for state ust grants authorized by epact which when combined with the funds moved from the stag account would have provided tota l of 355 million for prevention activities noting this increase in ust funding the house rejected epas request that congress revise the state inspection requirements unde r epact the consolidated appropriations act 2008 followed the house approach nd provided total of 1058 million from the trust fund to support both ust and lust programs for fy2009 epa requested 723 million from the trust fund for the lust cleanup program epa also requested 228 million unde r the stag account to help states meet new epact responsibilities includi ng 1 triennial tank inspec tions 2 operator training 3 prohibition of delivery to noncomplyin g tanks and 4 secondary containment or financial responsibility for tank manufacturers and installers in an effort to reduce epact costs to states epa submitted legislative language to allow states to use alternative mechanisms to meet the inspection mandate congress did not consider specific epa appropriations rather the consolidated appropriations act for fy2009 pl 110329 generally extended funding for epa progra ms at fy2008 levels through march 6 2009 an emerging ust issue concerns the impact that biofuels may have on storage tank infrastructure ethanol for exam ple is more corrosive than gasoline thus increasing the risk of leaks in tank systems the renewable fuel mandates in the energy policy act and the energy independence and security ac t of 2007 eisa pl 110140 present new technical issues for usts nd for fuel storage and deliver infrastructure generally to address this issue the house passed hr 547 hrept 1107 to require epa to establish research and develop program on materials that could be adde d to biofuels to make them more compatible with existing infrastructure used to store and deliver petroleumbased fuels the senate did not act on this bill in an effort to prevent or address any water quality problems that might result from the use of biofuels such as those experienced with mtbe use eisa amended section 211 c of the clean air act to allow epa to regulate fuels and fuel additives to protect water quality as well as air quality for further discussion of biofuels
