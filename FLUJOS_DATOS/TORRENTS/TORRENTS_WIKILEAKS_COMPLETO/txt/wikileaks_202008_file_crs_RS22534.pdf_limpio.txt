relief will be funded with the money obtained from the sale of some imf gold in the late 1990s the mdri raises several questions for polic makers what is the effect of debt on the poorest countries what impact can the mdri be expected to have on poverty reduction what policies could ma ke debt relief more effective looking at several studies of the eff ectiveness of the hipc program from 19962006 it appears that although debt relief can sligh tly increase the amount of financial resources available to poor countries the debt burde n is not the main impediment to poverty reduction and economic growth in the p oorest countries weak macroeconomic institutions and difficulty absorbing foreign assistance as well as political challenges appear more likely hurdles alleviating the bt burden in the absence of other strategic reforms is unlikely to substantially cont ribute to improved conditions in the poorest countries if combined with other efforts however debt relief can have complementary effect on domestic government finances and can help promote further reform past debt relief efforts the mdri builds on several bilateral and multilateral debt relief initiatives conducted over the past twenty years in the 1980s and early 1990s as the debts of the poorest countries increased rapi dly compared to other lowin come countries the g7 and other creditor countries impleme nted several plans aimed at reducing the countries debt payment burden bilateral debt relief in 1988 in response to g7 initiative group of major creditor nations known as the paris club agr eed for the first time to cancel debts owed to them by up to onethird instead of refi nancing them on easier terms as they had done previously4 over the next decade the paris cl ub gradually increased the amount of debt that it would be willing to write off by up to 90 in 1999 the united states did not participate in the initial debt forgiveness pl ans but in 1991 at the initiative of congress independently forgave almost all of the debt owed to it by the poorest nations since 1991 the united states has forgiven 239 billion in foreign debt5 hipc debt relief the imf and world bank introduced debt relief in 1996 through the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative when conceived the intention of the program was to reduce poor c ountries debts to socalled sustainable level

agreement between the united states and the europeans us officials had reportedly argued that the cost of multilateral debt relief could be borne by the institutions and did not require donors contributing any new assistance other creditors believed the institutions should be compensated for their debt forgiveness to avoid dive rting potential resources that could be lent to the poorest countries any debt relief they argued should be additional to existing multilateral assistance the compromise plan entailed the multilateral devel opment banks receiving new money from creditor

debt relief debt relief emerged as foreign policy issue mainly through moral arguments against requiring the poorest c ountries to repay their debts at united nations conference on africa in 2004 columbia university professo r and united nations advisor jeffrey sachs remarked civilized nation should try to collect the debts of people who are dying of hunger and disease and poverty7 others including the bush administrati on presented what they viewed as pragmatic argument for debt relief they argued that debt was locking these poorest countries into poverty and preventing th em from using their own resources for development8 by providing debt relief they argued resources that would have been allocated for debt repayments would now be redirected toward new investment andor domestic social services at press release announcing the mdri deal former world bank president paul wolfowitz announced that across africa and around the world leaders in 38 countries will longer have to choose between spendi ng to benefit their people and repaying impossible debts9 recent studies cast doubt however on debt reliefs contribution to larger development and poverty reduc tion goals these studies argue that poor underlying economic and political conditions are the ma in reason for the hipcs poor performance in light of this research congress may wish to explore in more depth what

debt at the crossroads edited by chris jochnick and fraser preston oxford university press 2006on poor countries economies and under what conditions debt relief can help promote economic growth nd poverty reduction how debt affects the hipc countries historically policymakers and academics viewed high levels of debt as constraint on economic growth it was argued that as long as investors ex pected countrys debt level to impair its ability to repay its loans its debt overhang investors w ould abstain from entering country out of concern that the government may resort to distortionary or infla tionary measures such as expanding the money supply or raising taxe s on their profits to finance debt payments even if the debt is not being serviced the theory suggests that it is still an impediment to economic growth because of the effect the large debt stock has of dissuading private investors in debt overhang situation the appropriate policy response is to forgive the debt either entirely or to some sustainab level so that investor confidence will be restored10 debt overhang theory was instrument in driving the development of the hipc program over time however it became pparent that the theory was not especially well suited for the poorest countries which relied on foreign assistance rather than private investment as their ke source of foreign capital according to the world banks 2006 evaluati on of the hipc program debt relief alone is not sufficient for debt sustainab ility in the poorest countries under hipc 18 countries had their debt levels reduced to half their initial vels cancelling 19 billion of external debt however in 11 out of the 13 countries with data available the debt situation has worsened in 8 countries debt levels once again exceed hipc thresholds11 several reasons may explain this situation first the concepts of sustainable debt and debt overhang may be in appropriate for the hipc count ries earlier debt overhang models were designed with middleincome countries in nd which were suffering under heavy nonconcessional private debt for ex ample when financial crises hit latin american countries in the 1980s their debts were resolved under the brady plan negotiated by former secretary of the treasury nicholas brady the forgiveness of debt amounted to 60 billion after which private capital surged into the brady countries these countries received 210 billion dollars in net capital flows in the five years following their debt writeoff12 in the case of the hipc count ries investors were more lik ely to stay away for other reasons such as political and economic inst ability rather than any concerns about indebtedness per moreover unlike other debtor nations bilateral and multilateral hipc debt is highly concessional ie inex pensive compared to private sector debt foreign aid providers have not stopped their aid just because they are not being repaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22534crs6 13 junko koeda

expectations of the multilateral debt relief initiative center for global development working paper number 88 may 2006 15 crs report rl30449 debt and development in poor countries rethinking policy responses by jf hornbeck100 on their bilateral debt mo reover the inflow of foreign aid funds is typically more than sufficient to cover debt payments so the cost of debt service is effectively borne by the donor countries rather than by the debtors secondly there are additiona l factors unique to the poorest countries that may promote increased indebtedness since their debt is highly concessional there may be perverse incentive for countries not to grow in order to remain ligible for multilateral assistance preliminary evidence looking at 94 countries 33 of which are low income over 19882000 found evidence of this effect significant number of countries appeared to stagnate around the income level that fined eligibility for c oncessional assistance above the cutoff level countries would long er be able to receive concessional aid by diverting their assistance away from investment toward consumption they were able to hover just below the eligibility cutoff13 issues for congress high levels of debt especi ally in the case of the poorest and most indebted countries are largel symptom of deeper more fundamental economic and societal difficulties removing preexisting debt is not seen as improving growth or reducing poverty by itself this raises two key questions that the second session of the 110th congress may wish to consider 1 what impact can the mdri be expected to have on poverty reduction and 2 what policies c ould make poor country debt relief more effective in reducing poverty andor promoting economic growth the impact of mdri debt relief will likely be modest at best first by definition mdri debt relief does not incr ease the overall resources availa ble to poor countries any debt relief that country receives results in net decrease in future multilateral aid resources allocated second the amount of debt relief provided by mdri is small in the case of the 15 african hipcs on average they paid 19 million in debt service to the world bank in 2004 that same year they received 197 million in new world bank aid and 946 million in total aid14 any debt relief even if it were in addition to existing foreign aid would provide only minuscule increase in domestic resources thus it appears that debt relief can have its largest impact if it is situated as part of broader package of reforms that include among other things increased debt management capacity and targeted growth enha ncing changes in national policy15
