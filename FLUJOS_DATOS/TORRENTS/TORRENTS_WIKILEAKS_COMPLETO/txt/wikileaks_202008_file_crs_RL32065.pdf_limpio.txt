growing elderly population and demands for greater public commitment to home and communitybased care for persons with disabilities have drawn the attention of federal and state policymakers for some time spending on longterm care by both the public and private sectors is significant in 2001 spending for longterm care services for persons of all ages represented 122 of all personal health care spending lmost 152 billion of 124 trillion federal and state governments accounted for almost tw othirds of all spending by far the primary payer for longterm care is the fe deralstate medicaid program which paid for almost half of all us longterm care spending in 2001 federal and state medicaid spending for longterm care in fy2001 was about 75 billion representing over onethird of all medicaid spending over 70 of medicaid longterm care spending was for institutions nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded icfsmr many believe that the current federal financing system paid through medicaid is structurally biased in favor of institutional care state gove rnments face significant challenges in refocusing care systems given the structure of current federal fina ncing many states have devoted significant efforts to change their longterm care systems to expand home and communitybased services for persons with disabilities and their families nevertheless financing of nursing home care primarily through the medicaid program still dominates most states spending on longterm care today while some advocates maintain that the federal government should play larger role in providing support for home and co mmunitybased care congress has not yet decided whether or how to change current federal policy one possibility is that congress may continue an in cremental approach to longterm care without major federal policy involve ment leaving to state governments the responsibility for developing strategies that support home and communitybased care within existing federal funding constrai nts and program rules to help congress review various policy lternatives and to assist policymakers understand issues that states face in

communitybased services states seek to change the face of longterm care arizona since medicaids1 enactment in 1965 most states have relied on the program as the primary payer for acute and longterm care services for lowincome individuals unlike most states however arizona did not be gin participation in medicaid until the 1980s the states emphasi s on private market solutions to fiscal problems and support for decentralized gove rnment placed fiscal responsibility for health care largely on private payers and county governments in addition arizonas enactment of the states howell code in 1864 placed legal responsibility on counties to provide health care for unemployabl persons without relatives capable of supporting them although arizonas c ountycentered approach allowed local governments flexibility in program design it also generated significant variation across county programs and growing fiscal pressure2 stressed county budgets combined with limited revenue ba tax increases in arizona require citizen approval through ballot m easures through the 1970s impelled the state to seek federal matchi ng dollars through the medicaid program3 in 1982 arizona gained approval from th center for medicare and medicaid services cms then called the health care financing administration to implement medicaid managed care system based on capitated contracts with health plans organized at the county levels for acute car services only the state proposed this program under research and demonstra tion waiver authorized by cms underhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32065crs2 4 longterm care in ar

for service expenditures traditionally provided through the medicaid program ahcccs receives federal per capita matching payment for each eligible beneficiary under the section 1115 waiver the arizona health care cost containment system ahcccs was established as the state agency responsible for overseeing the medicaid program in the absence of other statewide managed care programs to serve as examples for arizonas medicaid program ahcccs modeled its managed care arrangements for acute care services largely on examples available in the private insurance market as ahcccs was originally established to deliver acute care service counties and private payers remained largely respons ible for financing longterm care services for lowincome individuals counties were the sole payers for nursing home care on behalf of lowincome indi viduals and major payers fo r residential board and care assistance assessment case management and other services provided in the home 1984 report by the pritzlaff commission on longterm care forecasted that arizonas population of lowincome elde rly with longterm care needs would continue to grow and that county and state budgets would become increasingly strained the report also projected that the growth in the proportion of county and state budgets needed to pay for instituti onal care would be unsustainable the commission encouraged the state to enter into new agreement with cms to establish program of ahcccs that would arrange for and fund medicaid longterm care services4 in december 1988 the state amended its section 1115 medicaid waiver and established program of ahcccs called the arizona longterm care system altcs through altcs the state began obtaining federal ma tching dollars for longterm care services author ized under

and other stakeholders as well as unique characteristics of the states longterm care programs are discussed below concerns addresse d through task forces developed by the arizona legislature such as the intraagency committee on longterm care and the elder issues task force are also identified costeffectiveness of home and communitybased services for years program administrators state gislatures governors and members of congress have debated the costeffectiveness of home and communitybased care in lieu of institutional care broad disagreement persists among stakeholders concerning the savings that might occur if the medicaid program were to invest in broader array of home and communityb ased services for more individuals medicaid gives states the option to c over home and communitybased services but does not mandate them many assert that the per capita costs would decrease for persons living in the community with low care needs and increase for persons with very high care needs others claim that larger investment in home and community based services by medicaid would enc ourage many more people to enroll in medicaid and thus increase total expenditures at the time of altcs inception pr ogram administrator s were committed to using home and communitybased services as an alternative to nursing home care federal agency staff at cms then called the health care financing administration hcfa were concerned that clients w ould use home and communitybased services as complement to nursing home care rather than as substitute and that total program expenditures would increase due to an overall increase in utilization cms was also concerned that more arizonans would be attracted to altcs home and communitybased service options and substantial increases in enrollment would result to contain altcs growth cms capped total home and communitybased service expenditures at greater than 5 of the altcs budget for the elderly and disabled in 1989 this cap increased steadily over the years by 1995 cms had raised the cap to 45 the cap was re moved on october 1 1999 partly as result of study commissioned by cms study by william weissert phd in 1997 found that the use of home and communitybased services for individuals with high risk of prolonged stay in nursing home resulted in subs tantial savings for altcs even after subtracting the cost of the home and communitybased servi ces that were provide d in lieu of nursing home care he also found that the use of home and communitybased services for clients with low probability of long nursing home stay may be even greater than what would otherwise have been spent fo r their care in nursing homes finally weisserts study did not find sufficient evidence of increased enrollment58httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32065crs42 58 continued savings from home and communitybased services arizonas capitated medicaid long term care program journal of health politics policy and law vol 22 6 dec 1997integration of acute and longterm care servi ces many states divide the responsibility of providing medi caidcovered longter m care services and medicaidcovered acute care services among different programs andor agencies payment and management of services fo r these individuals are often further complicated for those dual eligibles that receive payment for many of their acute care services by medicare for these persons the coordination of care and the payment sources for that care are divided across three programs andor agencies several advocates and constituency groups have asserted that this division of responsibility in caring for dual eligibles has contributed to fragmented health services delivery system fraught with administrative inefficiencies and incentives to shift costs across programs unlike other states arizona has arrang ed for the provision of medicaid acute and longterm care services under single agency ahcccs persons that are eligible for longterm care services and are enrolled in managed care receive all of their medicaidcovered services through single mco according to state officials centralizing the payment and administration for both categories of services allows the state to use its spending authority to uni formly apply certain medicaid policies across all medicaidcovered services provided to certain indivi duals and all providers of those services the fact th at single mco is responsible for coordinating all medicaidcovered services may also s implify the programs coordination with medicare for those beneficiaries who are dual eligibles arizonas integration of acute and longterm care services could serve as model to states interested in developing more seamle ss system of care delivery despite this integrated system some advocates expressed an interest in eliminating the administrative inefficiencies associated with using multiple payers and delivery systems between medicare and medicaid for dual eligibles one suggestion pertained to the pooling of dicare and medicaid financing to promote financial and service integra tion another suggestion was to consolidate the program rules to promote improved administrative integration costcontainment initiatives the altcs system incorporates number of costcontainment initiatives integrated into its managed care system the following describes some of these initiatives capitation payments capitation payments paid to mcos are made on per month per beneficiary basi s payments are adjusted to account for the number of clients altcs expects that the mco will place in home and communitybased settings versus institutional settings by paying capitated payments to mcos ahcccs shifts lot of the risk for cost overruns away from the medicaid agency onto the mcos provider payments rather than standardize provider reimbursement levels at the same level mcos have flexibility tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32065crs43 determine the amounts to pay provi ders this flexibility allows mcos the opportunity to adjust payment levels according to their needs to contain costs anecdotal evidence from state providers suggests that there is significant variation in the amounts paid to mco providers costeffectiveness tests altcs requires that case managers apply costeffectiveness tests when developing care plans this test discourages placement in nursing homes or icfmrs for persons whose needs could be met in home and communitybased settings at lower cost state officials report that per capita spending on individuals enrolled in home and co mmunitybased services is often less than per capita spending on institutional care profit incentive state laws allow mcos to keep excess funding not spent on the cost of care as profit some advocates raised concerns about the use of medicaid dollars for profit state officials interviewed contend that the incentive for mcos to earn profits has contributed toward increasing home and communitybased participation in altcs ahcccs administrators monitor profit margins of participating mcos and may adjust payments for future years to mcos to control for continued high profits altcs eligibility advocates providers and st ate officials raised number of concerns pertaining to the implementa tion of eligibility rule s equity of access to services and delays in eligibility determin ations while arizona s financial eligibility standards enable the state to contain altcs spending they may also make the administrative process of applying for medicaid difficult for some people for example persons whose income exceeds 300 of ssi may place excess income into miller trust see eligibility section above for many the placement of funds in trust may require paid assistance such as by an attorney or accountant in addition persons may find the resources criteria particularly stringent especially those who need assistance to remain in their homes for example qualifying for medicaid would leave an enrollee without saved resources to pay for needed household expenses and emergencies despite the fact that the longterm care system is centrally managed advocates claim that inconsistencies in the implementation of the program exist across the state for example advocates and consumers asserted that not all altcs eligibility workers apply eligibility sta ndards and income and resour ces counting procedures in the same way they asserted that one i ndividual may be found ligible in one county and denied coverage alto gether in another county advocates also have expressed concer n about long delays in the eligibility determination process especially for pe rsons who require home assessment visits advocates assert that these delays are often too long to wait for persons with relatively urgent longterm care needs lack of presumptive eligibility authority the medicaid statute prohibits state medicaid agencies from making retrospective payments to home and communitybased providers that serve pe rsons before they are enrolled in the medicaid program it does not however prohibit medicaid agencies from makinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32065crs44 59 states medicaid plan must provide that medicaid eligibility is effective later than the third month before the month of applic ation if the individual 1 received medicaid services at any time during that 3month retroactive eligibility period or type covered under the plan and 2 would have been eligib for medicaid at the time he received the services if he had applied or someone had applied for him regardless of whether the individual was alive when application for medi caid was made the states medicaid agency may make eligibility effective on the first day of month if an individual was eligible at any time during that month medicaid manual 14703retrospective payments to nursing hom for this purpose thus home and communitybased providers generally do not serve persons until their medicaid eligibility is established thus limiting their services to persons who can afford to pay outofpocket and persons who are enrolled in altcs these providers are often hesitant to assume the financial risk of providing care to individuals pending altcs determination because providers generally do not have sufficient resources to recover the cost of uncompensated care in contrast advocates expl ained that nursing homes ar often the most reliable providers for persons who need servi ces immediately and cannot wait until they receive notification of enrollment from tcs nursing homes can often assume the risk of altcs denial because denial would require the individual to spend down given the generally high price of nursing home care the clients often deplete their income and resources within predictable period of time usually 6 months to year in addition some medicaid certified nursing homes facilita the application process by assisting applicants in the filing of eligibility forms once enrollment in altcs is approved federal gu idelines require states to make retroactive payments for covered services up to 3 months prior to the day of application59 s r s u l t advocates assert that this difference in the ability of providers to assume risk creates excessive reliance on institutional care eligibility for state only funded programs arizona through its state only funded programs for the elderly pe rsons with physical disabilities and persons with mrdd have addressed some of the medicaid financial eligibility barriers these programs allow persons with f unctional impairments to qualify without undergoing financial tests by providing services to persons before they deplete their income on care nonmedical home and comm unitybased services may help delay or prevent persons from becoming eligible for altcs state budget allocations however limit the amount of funding availabl to serve all of the persons needing assistance stateonly funded programs may serve as m odels for other states that have the financial capacity to expand th pool of eligibles they may also serve as examples for any federal initiatives that may be proposed to expand eligib ility the state maintains waiting list for this program longterm care staffing as in all states the majority of longterm care in arizona is provided by direct care provi ders including registered nurses licensed practical nurses and paraprof essionals home health aide s nursing aides personal care and home care aides there have b een widespread accounts across the nation of hospitals nursing homes home health ag encies and other longterm care providershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32065crs45 having great difficulty attracting and retaining nursing nd paraprofessional personnel arizona faces this challenge as well speculation by advocates suggest that lack of sufficient child care and affordable housing contributes to the stat difficulty in hiring qualified staff according to advocates this problem is particularly acute in arizonas rural areas that have high costs of living such as prescott in yavapai county the need for workers to travel long distances in rural areas between the homes of program participants often navigatin g unpaved roads magnifies th difficulty of retaining qualified staff advocates also explained that the relatively low wages limited or employee benefits and insufficient opportun ities for professional development such as promotions and training opportunitie s offered to professionals have magnified the problem state officials and advocates also explained that training of staff on reservations is often inadequate to meet altcs st andards without sufficient supply of providers on reservations altcs occasiona lly requires native americans to leave their reservations to receive care at th core of all these challenges are issues concerning quality of care and adequacy of the supply of those nurses and paraprofessionals who play central role in providing longterm care services arizonas task force on the future of longterm care made number of recommendations to the state legislature in response ahcccs raised rates in cy2001 by 10 these rates we re intended to pay for in creased wages and benefits for nursing paraprofessionals the followi ng year the state legislature passed an approximately 15 rate increase to be paid to mcos these increases were restricted for use toward higher wages nd or benefits for nursing aides and became effective in cy2002 assisted living as an alternative to nursing home care providers and advocates in arizona ex pressed concern about incr eased disability levels of clients in communitybased settings in recent years anecdotal evidence suggests that this increase is particularly apparent in assisted living facilities assisted living residents as reported by advocates and pr oviders are looking increasingly more like nursing home residents of 5 years ago caring for persons with acute disabilities in assisted living settings raises concerns about safety and quality of care states have demonstrated significant variation in the degree to which they monitor the care that is provided in these facilities as well as the training that is offered to caregivers unlike most states arizona established rules in 1998 to oversee assisted living facilities in addition ahcccs requires mcos to oversee the care provided to altcs beneficiaries in assisted living facilities other issues other issues raised by advocat providers and state officials are consumer choice one of arizonas 15 c ounties offer participants choice between mcos maricopa county once enrolled in mco altcs participants many select within the range of providers available consumerdirected care on larger scale is not done formally in arizonahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32065crs46 estate planning and avoidance of estate recovery state officials reported that although there ma be small number of people sheltering assets in order to qualify for altcs sooner than they otherwise would the number is grow ing many people shelter assets in trusts ie pooled trusts annuities and other financial instruments that are deemed not available to the medicaid applicant to pay for longterm care anecdotal evidence was also presented about the growing incide nce of persons who shelter assets so as to avoid arizonas medi caid estate recovery program provider costs liability insurance nursing home providers were unanimous in their concern about the increasing costs of liability insurance and the absence of state caps on punitive damages this issue was raised by many of the provider groups who were interviewed for this study affordable housing state officials advocates and providers raised concerns about limited access to affordable housing for older and working age persons with disabilities they also expressed concern about the limited ability to use medi caid dollars to cover room and board expenditures for altcs enrollees uneven distribution of providers advocates asserted that shortages of certain providers such as adult day care agencies or nursing homes were prevalent in some counties and available in only limited supply in other counties part of this problem may be attributed to mcos flexibility in setting payment levels for local providers another reason is that the majority of the population lives in the phoenix and tuscon metropolitan areas and thus fewer providers can be found outside of these areas they explained that rural areas often experience higher scarcity of providers than urban areas in the
