of agriculture operation and cost jasper womach agricultural policy specialist resources science and industry division summary the us department of agriculture u sda has long opera ted programs that directly assist farmers and others with the production and marketing of numerous crops including tobacco in most cases the crops themselves have not been controversial however where tobacco is involved the us of federal funds has been called into question taken together all of the dir ectly tobaccorelated activities of the usda generated net expenditures of an estimated 308 million in fy2006 and the budget anticipates net expenditures of 295 million for fy2007 over 90 of this spending is related to crop insurance the federally financed tobacco price support program once the major form of tobacco farmer assistance and in some years costly program was terminated at the end of crop year 2004 the usda is prohibited by language in th annual appropriations law from spending funds to help promote tobacco xports and to conduct research relating to production processing or marketing of tobacco and tobacco products other tobaccorelated activities have been subjected to congressional scrutiny the usda does operate numerous programs that are not tobaccospecific but are available to farmers that produce tobacco and other crops these are not examined in this report price support program from the late 1930s through the 2004 cr op the usda operated the tobacco price support program it was designed to raise and stabilize farm tobacco prices at higher levels than they otherwise would have reached this was accomplished through combination of farm marketing quotas and federal nonrecourse commodity loans administration was done throug h the county offices of the farm service agency fsa1 and loan program funding was provided through the co mmodity credit corporationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97417crs2 2 httpwwwrmausdagov 3 httpwwwamsusdagovtobccc in 1982 legislation was adopted that applied an assessment on all tob acco marketings to be used to offset price suppor t losses and make the an operations function at net cost to taxpayers on two occasions legislation relieved the program of its obligations on large inventories these actions cost about 1 b illion in addition congress made socalled tobacco loss payments of 852 million during fy2000fy2003 to offset sharp decline in farm sales to domestic and foreign buyers overall from fy1982 through fy2005 tobacco support net expenditures totaled about 157 billion for an annual average cost of 71 million after congress enacted the fair and equ itable tobacco reform act of 2004 pl 108357 the tobacco support program came to an end tobacco quota owners and farm operators were compensated for the diminished value of their farms and the loss of future support with payment of 96 billion over 10 years funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers because of this tobacco buyout ccc support program expenditures have been eliminated and it is not anticipated there will be any future ad hoc assistance to tobacco farmers fsa administrative expenditures associated with the buyout are estimated to be 1827 million in fy2006 and the budget for fy2007 is zero for additional informa tion see crs report rs20802 tobacco farmer assistance and crs report rs22046 tobacco quota buyout federal crop insurance the federal crop insurance program ad ministered by usdas risk management agency2 provides farmers with subsidized mult iperil insurance on tobacco and other crops the insurance covers unavoidable produc tion losses due to adverse weather insect infestations plant diseases and other natural calamities it does not cover avoidable losses caused by neglect or poor farming prac tices sales and serv icing of policies are done by private companies with some fede ral reimbursement nd most of the net indemnity losses fall upon the government additionally the premiums have been subsidized since 1980 in order to encourag participation and avoid enactment of ad hoc disaster assistance programs experimental crop revenue coverage available for wheat corn and soybeans is not available for tobacco total net federal expenditures for tobacco crop insurance coverage include outlays for crop loss indemnity payments plus the premium subsidies plus sales administrative expenses less the farmerpaid premiums net federal outlays ar estimated to be 279 million in fy2006 and are budgeted at 287 million for fy2007 tobacco inspection and grading the usdas agricultural marketing service ams3 carries out voluntary inspection and grading services at tobacco auction markets and import terminals the establishment of uniform standards of quality with grading by unbiased experts helps assure that auction markets perform efficiently and fairly historically federal gradinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97417crs3 4 httpwwwamsusdagovtob 5 httpwwwarsusdagovmainmainhtm 6 httpwwwcsreesusdagovprovided an assurance of quality for tobacco held as collateral for ccc price support loans additionally imported and domestic tobacco is inspected voluntarily to guard against illegal pesticide residues since 1981 the grading and inspection services have been financed through user fees now set at 062 per 100 pounds for grading and 085 per 100 pounds for pesticide testing these fees are sufficient to fully cover the costs of inspection activities as well as the cost of developing and maintaining the standards applied by the inspectors this has dramatically reduced the use of ams inspectors ams inspection work now is done on imported t obacco as nearly all of the domestic crop is contracted for sale rather than auctioned market news services the agricultural marketing service4 provides market news service for sellers and buyers of tobacco daily reports of grades prices and sales volume at the auction markets are distributed throughout the tob acco industry the cost of the tobacco news service in fy2006 is an estimated 190000 nd the budget for fy2007 is 194000 similar market news services are provided for all major agricultural commodities market news services are designed to provide farm ers and others in the marketing chain with timely accurate and unbiased information on market conditions to help them make better decisions on where and when to sell and buy commodities according to economists such information is necessary for market economy to function efficiently and effectively in the absence of taxpay erfunded market news rvice the information might be collected and sold by commercial ente rprises but questions of bias could arise tobacco research in the past usdafunded research relate d to tobacco production processing and marketing some of the research was carried out by agriculture research service ars5 scientists and some was done by university scientists funded through the cooperative state research

harves ting progress yield and production this information helps the business community in cluding farmers develop marketing plans also it serves to alert policy officials of likely shortages or surpluses thereby facilitating plans for any government action that might be taken the information that nass compiles and distributes is considered by economists to be critical to an efficiently functioning market economy it is argued that the absence of nass data would most severely disadvantage farmers and government officials who are least able to obtain information through alternative sources tob acco is one in long list of commodities on which nass staff collects information the timated cost of this effort for tobacco is 231000 in fy2005 and the budget for fy2007 is
