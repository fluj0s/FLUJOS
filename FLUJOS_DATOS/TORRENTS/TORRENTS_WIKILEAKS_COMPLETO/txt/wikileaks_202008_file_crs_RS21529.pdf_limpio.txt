research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs21529 may 23 2003 qaeda after the iraq conflict audrey kurth cronin specialist in terrorism foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the may 12 2003 suicide bombings of three western housing compounds in riyadh saudi arabia reopened questions about the strength and viability of qaeda in the postiraq conflict environment the apprehension of number of senior qaeda leaders in recent months combined with the absence of major terrorist attacks during the military campaign in iraq had led some to believe that qaeda was severely crippled and unable to launch major attacks others argued that the organization was in transition to more decentralized structure had gained new recruits and might even be growing threat this report analyzes cu rrent viewpoints about th state of qaeda and the threat it poses to the united states it will be updated as events warrant the may 12 2003 bombings of three western housing compounds in riyadh saudi arabia marked an apparent evolution in th behavior of qaeda that some experts believe provides insight into the viability of the organization after the us military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan alt hough there has been important measurable progress in the united states efforts against qaeda since september 11th experts disagree as to whether the organization as whole presents greater or lesser threat to the united states and its interests today at the heart of the analysis is the question of whether qaeda can launch additional major attacks of strategic impact or whether the organization is now largely relegated to low level tactical attacks in the wake of the riyadh bombings this report examines the debate about how to assess qaedas strength and will explain the major points on which experts differ as well as the assumptions underlying their arguments the attack in saudi arabia was not the first recent incident to display suspected links to qaeda beginning in 2002 qaeda repor tedly either contributed to or participated directly in number of wideranging attack s including against passenger plane and hotel in kenya in which 15 were killed and 40 injured night club in indonesia where about 180 were killed french oil tanker ff the coast of yemen in which one crewman was killed and four injured and

has been warning of the likelihood of additional terrorist attacks for many months3 but the absence of major terrorist incidents during the iraq war had led to degree of optimism even among those who believed that qaedas terrorism had not ended osama bin laden in an audi otape released april 7 2003 urged his followers to mount suicide attacks to avenge the innocent childre nassassinated in iraq on some previous occasions such public declarations had been followed by major events when those attacks did not occur after bin ladens april statement their absence was seen as possible indicator of the organizations w eakness although intelligence officials cautioned that qaeda was still capable of mounting significant attacks there was sense that us counterterrorism operations against qaeda had severely damaged the organization cofer black head of the stat departments counter terrorism office was quoted in early may 2003 saying this was the big game for them you put up or shut up and they have failed it proves that th global war on terrorism has been effective focused and has got these guys on the run4 the attacks in saudi arabia as well as s ubsequent explosions in morocco seem to have tempered that optimism not just b ecause they occurred us officials had consistently argued that future attacks were inevitable and had even warned of heightened security threat to saudi arabia but because the riyadh bombings in particular displayed specific characteristics that worried terrorism experts before then the selection of targets since 911 seemed to indicate that the us assault on qaeda had forced it to shift to opportunistic soft targets especially t ourist destinations in areas of the world that were relatively unfortified against terrorist attacks the riyadh attacks were more sophisticated th perpetrators reportedly us ed high quality explosives engaged in multiple coordina ted attacks carried out l ongterm reconnaissance and attacked wellfortified targets5 they also

characteristics of qaeda there is great deal that remains u nknown or debatable about the specific nature size structure and reach of the organizati on despite many years of studying it for example western experts are not exactly re how many members it has now or has had in the past estimates are of ten based upon an approximation of how many people trained in qaeda camps in afghanistan and s udan the estimates range as high as 600007 and as low as 200008 these assessments are inexact in part because the total number of camps that operated is not firmly agreed9 but even if experts knew the correct total number of camps and trainees not all the pe ople who took the training necessarily became or remained actual members of the organization10 the state department estimates that qaeda probably has several thousand members and associates11 but since these are all estimates it is not known wh at proportion of qaeda mbers us and allied forces have captured or killed12 but do operatives even necessarily need to be members it is apparent from some of those apprehended in failed pl ots that it is not essential to be formally in qaeda in order to carry out attacks operatives seem to vary from the besttrained controlled and financed professional cadres such as mohammed atta who led the september 11th attacks to lesstrained and relatively unc ontrolled volunteers such as ahmed ressam who intended to blow up angeles interna tional airport and ri chard reid who tried to detonate plastic explosives in his shoes aboard an american airlines transatlantic flight13 qaeda

the organization is said to be structur ed like modern corporation reflective of management concepts of the early 1990s including bottomup and topdown networks common mission statement and entrepreneurial thinking even at the lowest levels this makes it extraordinarily flexible and ma ny believe able to survive serious blows15 qaeda has also developed strong ties to other terrori st organizations some new and some longstanding16 osama bin laden formed an umbrella group in late 1998 the international islamic front for jihad agai nst jews and crusaders which included not only qaeda but also groups from egypt algeria pakistan and bangladesh some argue that qaeda has been something of hybrid terrorist organization for some time17 sampling of groups currently thought to be connected includes the moro islamic liberation front philippines jemaah islamia h southeast asia egyptian islamic jihad merged with qaeda in 2001 alansar mujahidin chechnya algamaa alislamiya egypt and has worldwide presence abu sayyaf philippines the islamic movement of uzbekistan and harakat ulmujahidin pak istankashmir the list is illustrative not comprehensive some experts see increased reliance on connections to other groups as sign of qaedas weakness others poi nt to enhanced coope ration with other groups as worrisome indicator of st rength especially with groups that formerly focused on local issues and now display evidence of converg ence on qaedas international antius antiwest agenda an important question is whether qaeda might be evolving further into new form more like movement than formal organization increasingly diffuse internationally nd less reliant upon its own membership organization in transition clearly qaeda is in transition whether that transition will lead to something more or less dangerous is point of contention on one hand clear progress in apprehending or killing senior leaders of qaeda has been evident in recent weeks president bush announced that the united st ates has captured about half the senior leadership18 other sources claim that about third have been captured19 many of these terrorist leaders have been crucial participants in past

adapts to changing circumstances including the loss of some senior leaders the two most senior leaders osama bin laden and ayman alzawahir i are widely believe d to be alive and at large and terrorism experts argue over the extent to which succession plan is in effect to replace those who have been captured21 during the week before the riyadh attacks email interviews conducted by the l ondonbased magazine majalla apparently with qaeda spokesman thabet bi n qais claimed that q aeda had undertaken thorough restructuring of its leadership22 one of the worrisome aspects of the attack itself was the apparent involvement of people thought to have been werlevel fighters who may have now stepped into the breach for exampl khaled jehani who was previously considered lowlevel operative seems to have been involved in the riyadh operation23 also mentioned is seif aladel one of number of younger qaeda members who seem to have gained influence in the absence of former leaders and who may have played role24 many worry that this could illustrate an evolution within qaeda to new generation25 this as well as other evidence in th attack itself seems to demonstrate level of central direction fi nally some believe that there has been spike in recruitment to the network as result of the us military operations in iraq leading to worry that despite its serious recent losses qaeda could grow stronger in future months26 stronger or weaker ultimately the debate about qaedas current st atus centers on the important question of whether it is growing or declining in strength in the wake of the afghanistan and iraq military campaigns when the predicted terrorist attacks on the united states and its interests did not materialize what is the current level of threat to the united states most

succession plan in action central coordination of attacks and growing international ties all incr easingly converging on common international agenda hostile to the united states and its allies may give us officials new reason for concern in the short term at least even successes in counterterrorist operations against more decentralized organization can lead to greater difficulty in collecting reliable intelligence as the paths of communication are increasingly unfamiliar the personalities are changing and the locations of operatives are more diffuse while the long term trajectory is very difficult to assess for the time being it s eems that qaeda or its successors has emerged from period of inactivity and re mains very serious threat requiring concentrated attention and vigorous countermeas ures on the part of its prospective targets issues for congress congress may face number of questions in the coming months these include how does us counterterrorism policy need to adapt to match the changing threat of qaeda and its associated groups is there need for strategic reassessment of the successes and failures of us counterterrorism policy in the postiraq strategic environment not only in the military and intelligence fields but also in foreign policy law enforcement international cooperation public diplomacy foreign aid homeland security and elsewhere are there places where us policies in given area are now longer meeting the challenge are potentially counter productive or where funding is inadequate or misplaced how will the us occupation of iraq affect the changing regional terrorist threat to what degree will regime change in iraq alter the overall international terrorist threat to the united states at home and abroad will progress or the lack thereof in achieving an israelipalestinian peace agreem ent and resolving sensitive issues such as the conflicts in kashmir southern philippines chechnya and elsewhere affect qaedas prospects
