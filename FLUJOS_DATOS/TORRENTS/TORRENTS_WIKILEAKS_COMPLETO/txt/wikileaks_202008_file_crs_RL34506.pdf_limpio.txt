grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34506tsunami detection and warnings for the united states summary congress raised concerns about the possi ble vulnerability of us coastal areas to tsunamis and the adequacy of early warning for coastal areas after strong underwater earthquake struck off the coas t of sumatra indonesia on december 26 2004 the earthquake generated tsunami that devastated many coastal communities around the northern indian ocean and may have cost around 170000 known deaths and 1000 00 still missing and generated 186 million in damages officials determined then that tsunami early warning systems operated in the indian ocean in december 2005 president bush released an action plan for expanding the us tsunami detection and early warnin g network which was expected to cost millions of dollars and would include building the infrastructure and maintaining its operations some members of congress argued that the benefits would far outweigh the costs other members questioned the probability of tsunamis outside the pacific basin long before the tsunami disaster the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in the depar tment of commerce envisioned piggy backing tsunami detection and warning instrumentation on existing marine buoys tide gauges and other ocean observation nd monitoring systems however noaa was also experimenting with new d eep water tsunami detection technology congress approved emergency funding in fy2005 for the presidents action plan for procuring and deploying compre hensive us tsunami early detection and warning system this meant expanding an existing six deep ocean tsunami detection buoys into network of 39 which would be sited in the pacific and atlantic ocean basins including the gulf of mexico caribbean sea and the far pacific ocean to monitor us trust territories at risk proponents of the noaa program also ca lled for funding authorization to address longterm needs of the us netw ork such as maintenance and to support social programs aimed at disaster prepar edness and adaptation to risk emergency experts stressed the need for education of indigenous people and visitors about the potential dangers of tsunamis in an area adaptation to potential risks such as constructing public shelters periodic evacuation drills and informed landuse planning many also asserted that local officials need to be empowered to rapidly alert populations of an evacuation and to take appropriate sa fety precautions even if that entailed using lowtech high impact solutions such as sirens with respect to tsunami
