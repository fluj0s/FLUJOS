complete accordance regarding what constitutes scf islamic finance laws and regulatory practices vary across countries the lack of conc urrent viewpoints makes it di fficult to standardize islamic

promote international consistency in islamic finance for instance the islamic financial services boards ifsb puts forth standards for supervision and regulation22 as another example the accounting and auditing organization for islamic financial institutions aaoifi issues international standards on accounting auditing and corporate governance23 many leading islamic financial centers around the wo

united states may have implications for congressional oversight congress may be interested in evaluating the relationship between the current us banking legal and regulato ry framework and islamic finance current us laws and regulation ma be broad enough to accommoda some aspects of islamic finance others aspects of is lamic finance may pose some unique challenges to us laws and regulations such as applying rules creat ed for conventional interestbased products to islamic products27 there is debate about whether or not or the extent to which regulators should apply rule s on conventional products to islamic product counterparts28 some express concerns about the national security impli cations of islamic finance specifically that islamic banking transactions may channel funds to terrorists or facilitate terrorists access to funds others assert that the risks of islamic finance are not significantly greater or differe nt than those from conventional finance and that the majority of recent terrorist financing cases related to scf have been thrown out of court in congressional testimony one obser ver stated there is reas on in theory to suspect that islamic finance would be particularly immune or particularly vul nerable to abuse by money launderers or rrorist financiers29 some proponents also assert that security related concerns about islamic finance stem from lack of understanding of scf or from stereotyping30 there may be conflation of islamic finance with hawala an informal trustbased money transfer system prominent in the middle east and many muslim countries hawala transactions are based on an honor system with promissory instruments exchanged between the parties and records of the transactions some analysts consider the hawala system particularly susceptible to terrorist financing congress also may be interested in the possibility of islamic finance as vehicle for sidestepping us and inte rnational economic sanctions for example the sudanese government reportedly issued is lamic bonds to gulf investors in order to circumvent us sanctions31
