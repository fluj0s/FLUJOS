provisions accounting for almost half of the total revenue loss would be the extension of the 50 bonus depreciation deduction maintaining the increase in the alternative minimum tax exemption would also be expensive reducing revenue by approximately 181 billion over the period httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21708 the revenue estimates of extending the expiring jgtrra provisions contained in this table
