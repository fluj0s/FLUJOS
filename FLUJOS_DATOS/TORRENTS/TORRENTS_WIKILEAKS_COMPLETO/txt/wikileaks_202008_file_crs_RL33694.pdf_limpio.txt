billion to 116 billion funding for all other programs authorized by the perkins act decreased from fy2000 to fy2006 primarily due to funding decreases in fy2006 appropriations for example funding for

authorized to award grant to each state that exceeded state adjusted performance levels for title i of wia the expected levels of performance for title ii of wia and the adjusted levels of performance for perkins iii perkins iii provided specific funding authorization to support these incentive grants for fy2000fy2003 funds were not authorized for fy1999 while the perkins act was not reauthorized until 2006 funding continued to be provided for incentive grants thro ugh fy 2006 pl 109270 eliminated the setaside for incentive grant funding beginning in fy2007 funds previously set aside for this purpose will be pr ovided to states through the basic state grants formula b the us department of education ed was unable to negotiate performance levels with states for fy1999 as states lacked sufficient data for all of the core indicators of performance specified in statutory language thus ed was unable to award incentive grants based on states meeting agreed upon performance levels for fy2000 congress reallocated the 054 setaside for incentive grants to basic state grants c funds were appropriated for this program until fy2001 d the administrations budget request for fy2004 fy2005 and fy2006 requested funding for this program currently authorized by perkins iv under the higher education account the administration proposes reauthorizing this program under the higher education act which is scheduled for reauthorization in the 110th congress for fy2003 and subsequent fiscal years funding for this program is not reflected in this table for comparability purposes as ed longer includes it under career and technical education in its budget tables national programs include research development dissemination evaluation and assessment na not applicable while the hsri would provide some flex ibility in how funds are used the hsri would also require new high school assessm ents to be administered currently under the elementary and secondary education act as amended by the child left behind act pl 107110 high school stude nts must be tested at least once in grades 1012 in language arts and math ematics the hsri would require that students be tested annually in language arts and math ematics in at least two additional high school grades states woul d be required to use some of their hsri funding to support these efforts assessmen ts would have to be in place by the 2010 2011 school year10 leas would be held accountab by their state for improving secondary school student performance given the emphasis that would be placed on student assessments it is possible that leas that would receive competitive grants through this initiative could choose to pursue interventions other than career and technical education it is also possible that leas currently using federal dolla rs to support their career and technical education programs may not receive co mpetitive grant through the hsri possibly reducing or eliminating career and technical education options for students in those leas in addition grants would be awarded at the postsecondary level11 congress however did not authorize th hsri rather it reauthorized the perkins act in addition congress has not acted to include the hsri in fy2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33694crs6 12 as previously mentioned the occupational and employment information program did not receive funding in fy2006 and neither the ad ministrations budget request nor the house and senatereported bills would provide fundi ng for the program in fy2007 the program was reauthorized however by pl 109270 the techprep demonstration program did not receive funding in fy2006 and was not reauthorized by pl 109270 13 for more information about fy2007 appropriati ons for programs administered by the us department of educa tion see

instead to continue funding for car eer and technical education and most of the programs au thorized under the perkins act12 both the house committee on appropriations hr 5647 hre pt 109515 and the

previously mentioned the largest pr ogram funded by the perkins act is the basic state grants program the prog ram primarily supports career and technical education activities at the secondary and postsecondary levels in leas area career and technical education schools and institutions of higher education uses of funds include for example establishing li nkages between seconda ry and pos tsecondary career and technical education providing professional deve lopment supporting career and academic c ounseling nd transitioning students from subb accalaureate career and technical education programs to baccalaureate degree programs including the development of articulation agreements while substantially smaller in terms of funding the techprep program focuses on combining and coordinating secondary and postsecondary career and technical edu cation activities into coherent sequence of courses funds for the basic state grants pr ogram and the techprep program are distributed to st ates by formula14 the formulas are based primarily on population factors and per capita income factors weig hts are assigned to individuals in three population groups ages 15 to 19 ages 20 to 24 and ages 25 to 65 with the largest weights assigned to the younges t population group per capita income pci is defined as the total personal income in state divided by the population of the state it affects the weighted populati on count for each state through an allotment ratio15 this helps to provide states with wer pcis with additi onal grant funds and vice versa the distribution of funds is also affected by minimum grant provision and hold harmless provision th at provides all states with at least their fy1998 grant amount assuming appropriations are sufficient to do so16 tables 2 and 3
