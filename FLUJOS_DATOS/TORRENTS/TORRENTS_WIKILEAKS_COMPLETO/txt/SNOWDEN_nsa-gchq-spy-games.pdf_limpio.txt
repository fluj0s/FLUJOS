of games virtual environments tssi issue we know that terrorists use many featurerich internet communications media for operational purposes such as email voip chat proxies and web forums and it is highly likely they will be making wide use of the many communications features offered by games and virtual environments gve by 2010 the sigint enterprise needs to begin taking action now to plan for collection processing presentation and analysis of these communications with few exceptions nsa cant even recognize the traffic and therefore it is impossible to even say what percentage of the environment is gve let alone determine how targets are using the communications features of gves however gves offer siginthumint opportunity space and more research is needed to figure out effective exploitation ssi gves today allow individuals to gather with likeminded others online many gves offer communications such as private chat p2p group chat chat to an alias and broadcast chat both text and voice also many gves allow convergent technologies to intermingle such as xboxlive which can be run via an xbox360 gaming console andor connect via pc to normal msn chat second life offers the ability to anonymously text to gsm phone sms and soon they will offer anonymous voice calls so that phone numbers do not have to be known by either party and wont show up in collection some gves allow third party interfaces which allow limited functionality from web browser this overcomes obstacles such as highbandwidth requirement and or not being allowed to download software think internet café usage in addition many gves are able to be used via mobile devices connected wirelessly phones handhelds laptops connected to the gves specialized forums and other social networking sites have sprung up to provide an additional place to interact connect or share these sites and any others can be advertised in the gves so that if terrorist web forum has to move locations it can be found by its members again areasgroups can be accessrestricted memberonly they are essentially private meeting places and can be used for planning comms and training etc gves are used for collaboration forterras 3d world is coming to jwics to do this icwide ufouo gves have been made that reinforce prejudices and cultural stereotypes while imparting targeted message or lesson both from the western point of view and in the middle east americas army is us army produced game that is free download from its recruitment page and is acknowledged to be so good at this the army longer needs to use it for recruitment they use it for training the lebanese hizballah has taken this concept and the same basic game design and made its own version of the game called special forces 2 sf2 which its press section acknowledges is used for recruitment and training in order to prepare their youth to fight the enemy radicalizing medium the ultimate goal is to become suicide martyr one cannot discount the fun factor involvedit is important to hold your target audiences attention and makes ingesting the message not even noticeable sf2 features multiplayer online text and voice chat for up to 60 players simultaneously effectively acting like vpn or private chat forum sf2 is offered at 10 copy and so also goes to fund terrorist operations ssi these games offer realistic weapons training what weapon to use against what target what ranges can be achieved even aiming and firing military operations and tactics photorealistic land navigation and terrain familiarization and leadership skills while complete military training is best achieved in person perfection is not always required to accomplish the mission some of the 911 pilots had never flown real plane they had only trained using top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 top secretcomintrel to usa aus can gbr nzl20320108 microsofts flight simulator when the mission is expensive risky or dangerous it is often wiser idea to exercise virtually rather than really blow an operative up assembling bomb or exposing sleeper agent to law enforcement scrutiny militaries around the world use virtual simulators with great success and the hizballah has even hooked up playstation controller to laptop in order to guide some of its real missiles kuma wars is us owned company that offers realistic battle simulation of real battles in iraq usually one month after they actually happened the player can redo maneuvers in lessons learned way for training or you can switch sides and see how it works from the opposite side it also provides real terrain features such as real road signs from real roads in iraq and simulated nightvision goggles environment tssi qaida terrorist target selectors and gve executables have been found associated with xboxlive second life world of warcraft and other gves in pinwale network traffic tao databases and in forensic data other targets include chinese hackers an iranian nuclear scientist hizballah and hamas members gchq has vigorous effort to exploit gves and has produced exploitation modules in xboxlive and world of warcraft after beta testing they expect reporting to begin in april 2008 the fbi cia and the defense humint service all have humint operations in second life and other gves and are very interested in forming deconfliction and tipping group that would be able to collaborate on operations tssi gves are an opportunity we can use games for cne exploits social network analysis humint targeting id tracking photos doc ids shaping activities geolocation of target and collection of comms it has been well documented that terrorists are opsec and tech saavy and are only getting more so over time these applications and their servers however are trusted by their users and makes an connection to another computer on the internet which can then be exploited through target buddylists and interaction found in the gaming and on gaming web sites social networks can be diagramed and previously unknown sigint leads and connections and terrorists cells discovered gves can contain online presence indicators geolocation and id tracking can be gleaned and used in apprehension operations tssi recommendation the amount of gves in the world is growing but the specific ones that ct needs to be methodically discovered and validated only then can we find evidence that gves are being used for operational uses protocol exploitation sfl and tao should begin profiling their databases and the gves for collection and exploitation possibilities open source apstars produced gve lists and selectors should be used to run against utt and other databases to check for cross matches to develop target selectors ct sigdev along with ct topis will study the collected traffic to find and track targets of interest there should be concentrated effort to conduct research into target use of gves and signatures for survey collection should be developed targets and specific apps should be chosen to exploit to ensure that terrorists gvesocial site usage is covered by sigint and the system is not left behind the times all avenues should be taken to develop pes and cne exploits as gves are found on target computers we need to develop viewerdb that allows linguistanalysts to viewexperience voicetextvideo traffic together and archivee the gve data associated with reporting which will also be essential for yahoo skype webcam vtcs and biometrics ssi ct sigdevssg should establish process to deconflict icwide ops in gves and to develop strategy for collaboration members from at least cia fbi dia nsa and gchq should participate to make the coordination significant members should have ability to check tasking traffic and status of current operations games look

casual gaming on cell phone or pc or virtual world where individuals are connect ed via the internet interaction in and around games is increasing games entertain encourage interaction enable financial gain and teach lessons while many of these activities are meant to be harmless they also have the potential to be exploited for malicious activities over the course of year extensive study was done on the common use of games and their applicability to terrorist activities academic journals and papers newspaper and magazine articles textbooks nonfiction wo rks ingame exploration and personal interviews on games psychology and sociol ogy as well as attendance at seminars on these issues for example the serious games conference or saics cyberinfluence conference series represent the main sources for this report the report was written in five standalone papers that are compiled here as comprehensive primer for the current and potential future of game usage majority of the information contained in this report identifies facts and trends and applies them to the realm of ic concern chapters 1 2 and 4 in addition the paper contains examples of fictitious scenarios that terrorists or extremists might employ chapter 3 technology advancements and trends that might enable those scenarios chapter 4 and recommend steps to ensure that those hypotheses are not realized chapter 5 games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 5 chapter 1 games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 6 gaming markets why we care demographics the gaming population crosses age gender and cultural boundaries making inroads into previously untapped markets and providing terrorist organizations with powerful platform to reach core target audiences the core demographic for gaming is 18 35 yearold males however the average age of the typical gamer incr eases by one year each year and women now comprise nearly onethird of all adult gamersi the online gaming population is expected to grow rapidly in the near term resulting in an estimated 10 million online game players in the us ie the equivalent of the entire population of ne w york city and 30 million online game players worldwide ie the equivalent of the entire population of shanghai bombay and karachi combinedii while the majority of online gamers originate from us and asian markets the rapid expansion of internet cafes an d broadband technologies will enable the growth of online gaming populations in other regions for example the fastest growing gaming markets are occurring in europe the middle east and africaiii gaming sales continue to increase by compound annual rate of 191 sales surpassed 23 billion usd in 2003 and are estimated to reach 56 billion usd by 2008 in turn revenues reached pproximately 6 billion in 2004 and are projected to reach 143 billion by 2009 iv popularity gaming has emerged as the preeminent form of entertainment among 18 35 year old males consequently the gaming industry now rivals traditional entertainment industries including the film and music industries in rms of growth revenue and consumptionv for example the gaming industry is growing by 20 compared to 75 71 and 2 growth rates in the film televi sion and music industries during the same period furthermore ac nielson predicts that within four years the film industry will be just onethird the size of the computer game marketvi game users typically spend 2030 hours pe r week on online games and more than 20 of online gamers identify themselves as residents of virtual worldsvii the stereotype of the lonely gamer spendi ng long hours in social isolation is longer tenable while some games are pl ayed by singular or group of isolated players computer gaming now is increasingly social with the growth of local games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 7 area network lan games played in internet cafes and the expansion of massively online multiplayer games mmog users are now interacting with others in the game ie guilds online in other cyber media ie web sites message boards and social ne tworking sites and in cybercafés providing fertile ground for terrorist activities it is widely thought that online gaming may have similar cultural political and social influence on todays gamers that music religion and politics had on earlier generationsviii global patterns in game play time spent social interaction and reach games consume great deal of time and effort by significant number of players around the world in study done by nick yee at stanford university on massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpg users 50 of the 30000 respondents worked full time with only 22 as fulltime students the average age of the respondents was 265 women tended to be older than and on average the respondents spent 2271 hours per week in their chosen mmorpg time involvement which suggests that there is substantial level of emotional investment in the mmorpg environment global market counterstrike is considered the most popular online firstperson shooter fps game in the world with the more than 200000 players playing simultaneously and contributing more than 55 billion minutes of playing time each month on the official network consisting of more than 100000 servers counterstrike is played extensively throughout central southeast and southwest asia in addition to the core us european and asian markets palestinian reportedly more than 25 of children between the ages of 6 and 17 in the market palestinian territories ccess the internet thro ugh internet centers that have emerged in refugee camps rural villages and urban areas palestinian internet center managers and computer lab owners have reported that most children spend most of their time playing online games including pro arab games like special force and under siege southwest kuma games produces and distributes episodic games depicting real life southeast military operations these games are played throughout southeast and asian markets southwest asia during the height of media coverage on middle east networks like aljazeera 20 of kumas total audience originated from the middle east region with significant amounts of game traffic coming from egypt and notable number of players originating from iran and iraq see end note xxvii games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 8 functionality of online games games are platforms on which partici pants may communicate coordinate socialize train learn simulate experiment build proselytize and even barter virtual goods such functions indicate that the line between the virtual world and the real world is blurring and to some users may be nonexistent that virtual worlds are becoming synonymous with the real world provides and interesting opportunity for terrorists to conduct range of activities with anonymity as virtual worlds become more popular pervasive and sophisticated so too will terrorist opportunities to exploit them for example as gaming becomes increasingly popular across multiple demographics and access to various gaming platforms increases ie access to personal computers internet cafes and mobile platforms it will become easier for terrorist groups to reach core target audiences for these reasons many expect that terrorist groups will increasingly verage online and computer based games to support their activities in the future propaganda and influence terrorist groups and sympathizers could use games to twist historical context demonize enemies disrupt the social moral compass and desensitize users to violenceix games designed to appeal to terrorist sympathizers leverage salient political themes and typically exploit proarab and antiisrael sentiment such games attract players because they provide them with consonant message and an opportunity to take part virtua lly in resistance movementsx special force developed by hezbollah plays on the common themes of israeli occupation and palestinian victimization and offers players the opportunity to fight back by digitally reenacting various elements of the intifada for instance the introductory level of special force involves target practice and shooting exercises using images of israel i generals as the mark later levels involve the digital reenactment of ba ttles that have occurred between the idf and palestinians during the israeli occupationxi special force was intentionally designed by hezbollah to reinforce and disseminate the groups values concepts and ideas among supporters and sympathizers while giving passive supporters the opportunity to experience the viscera of the front linesxii special force is available in arabic french english and farsi and thus is widely availabl to traditional hezbollah audiences and othersxiii games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 9 under ash and its sequel under siege were published by the syrian company dar alfikr the player takes the role of palestinian national opposing the occupiers from israel under siege in particular is based on actual events but is presented from the syrian perspective the game employs visceral imagery and sound including scenes of palestinian children being murdered summary executions being held in public streets highspeed chase scenes and sounds of gunfire and heart pumping music the scenes too are designed to evoke outrage and to play on common themes including israeli occupation injustice and revenge the iranian islamic students associati on has also developed an online game commander bahman in which users play the role of specialforces unit tasked with protecting iranian nuclear capabilities from american aggression this game was developed in direct respons to kuma reality games release assault on iran kuma has subsequently developed another installment assault on iran pt3 in the hopes that this internationa l dialogue sparked by the depiction of global affairs in the game space will continue assault on iran pt 3 is planned be released in arabic english and farsixiv video games make particular assumptions within their environment that can transcend specific message to users for example the games ummah defense and ummah defense ii free for download on the internet are set in the future based on the premise that at some point in history muslims will have conque red the world and killed or converted all nonmuslims users act as member of the intergalactic muslim council working to protect earth from the sole disbeliever and in his army of robots sent to destroy the earth it was necessary to construct robots as all other humans believe in islam the overarching message is that establishment of the caliphate is possiblexv playing games within this context allows users to experience this reality in sensory way that makes the message real video games are an ideal influence plat form because they incorporate imagery narrative camaraderie and action this combination works because advanced imagery and graphics can be used to engage the senses storylines can be us ed to provide context and group goals camaraderie in the form of multiple players facilitates higher levels of engagement and action in the form of participation is requiredxvi radical groups are using gaming platforms to propagate religious ideology this can take place in number of different ways for example fps game can help demonize declared enemy while educational games can offer manipulated religious doctrine as scripture games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 10 for example innovative minds inc has developed series of six multilevel downloadable games entitle d islamic fun which are aimed at teaching children between the ages of 5 and 11 year s of age about islam islamic fun is marketed as faithbased alternative to secular games and includes many age appropriate game titles including fishing bear tree hop and two bunny race however embedded in this game package is another game entitled the resistance in which users assume the role of farmers in southern lebanon who join the islamic resistance against invading israelisxvii many believe that these types of games encourage anti semitism and promote terrorismxviii communications games provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups and sympathizers because ingame conversations often are difficult or impossible to monitor many games contain capabilities like voip chat and file transfers that allow realtime communications to take place and few sites monitor such traffics or keep log files as would traditional internet service providers isps massively multiplayer online games mmog are ideal locations to support secure terrorist communications because of the enormous scale on which they are played at given time thousands of subscribers can be connected to virtual world on various game servers potentially complicating matters are that some games can be hosted by gamers on their own dedicated server or pc ingame communication channels would be difficult to collect by current internet control methods because speech and text ngles with data from the game this increases the chances that authorities will overlook communications they would normally prohibit recruitment online gaming can serve as recruiting tool this has already proven true in the us as the us army found that 28 of players logging on to play its americas army online game also visited the corresponding recruitment site monitoring strategy games like counterstrike can be an effective way to track individual skill levels in firearms tacti cal operations group cohesion leadership etc this information can then be used by interested parties to evaluate qualifications for military or insurgent recruitment participation in virtual communities can facilitate offline activity members of terrorist groups could enter or monitor on line game environments with the intent of translating virtual skills and actions into real world commitments and activities games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 11 training and simulation games can supplement field training by familiarizing recruits with the tactics weaponry and skills needed to conduct operations military type games can be used to help acquire skills in team work communications leadership and operational tactics this trend is likely to manifest itself in the near future as games are increasingly leveraging real time data from the battle field culturally accurate games can help foreign terrorists avoid profile raising mistakes and assist in assimilation combat simulators such as those developed by bbn technologies as part of the pentagons darwars project are used to help soldiers bound for iraq prepare for combat among the offerings darwars ambush combat simulation game designed to train up to 24 soldie rs at time in military convoy operationsxix increasingly realistic virtual environmen ts further blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds these environments create immersive environments that draw users into the game world this results in more truetolife training grounds and enhances games underlying message as the user experience becomes more immersive the us military is currently using game s as tool to equip personnel with training in numerous key areas including tactical planning mission rehearsal incorporating lessons learned and tactical language training xx cots programs used to develop combat simulators are inexpensive widely available and could offer terrorist groups the opportunity to simulate attacks prior to their execution such programs could enable fairly accurate damage assessments and provide insight into necessary course correction to limit risk and unintended consequences associated with particular attack for example the maya unlimited fluid simulation software available for 159 offers users the ability to recreate the mushroom cloud caused by nuclear explosion users can control the influence of fuel and other ttributes and add key ingredients such as temperature scale buoyancy dissipati on turbulence and diffusion games could also be used as part of the attack plan itself with the rise of mobile gaming terrorist groups can use the platform to its advantage instead of planting bomb near crowd of people for exam ple it can place one at random location and lead game players to the bomb this is speculative based on flash mobs and mobile gaming use flash mobs are groups of people that converge in public places for brief periods of time and dissipate quickly there after flash mobs have occurred worldwide and are frequently organized around political protest efforts the french riots of 2005 were organized largely through flash mob efforts paired with mobile scavenger hunting location

million dollars in sales in the united states similarly in asia realcash virtual item trade exceeds 100 million annuallyxxi current estimates indicate that intangible goods in digital worlds are worth 12 billionxxii because users are able to create their own content in games entrepreneurs profit in realworld dollars by selling professional services or goods one virtual real estate mogul in second life makes nearly 150000 per year in realworld dollars fund raising efforts are already happening in virtual worlds in 2006 american cancer society acs held its second virtual relay for life in second

live fundraising events in second life to help victimsxxiv organizations could use virtual worlds as vehicle for generating income while the money raised might not be enough to fund sizable organization it could be revenue source for smaller cells ease of production of games the growing availability of middleware or mods drastically lowers the barriers of entry for game development allowing almost anyone to become game builder middleware products are available for margin fee usually the cost of game or can be downloaded free from the internet mods are typically used to create additional content to games partial conversions or new games total conve rsions popular middleware products include 3d world building packages such as genesis 3d quake unreal and halflife multiplayer

counterstrike halflife and americas army unreal as well as several games of more questionable nature including ethnic cleansing genesis 3d under ash genesis 3d and special force genesis 3d mods not only provide developmental shortcut but also enable game producers to improve existing games whereby increasing their popularity mods can be used to transform existing ga mes for example unidentified gamers modified the fps game battlefield 2 enabling players to take on the role of extremists whose home village in iraq suffered collateral damage during fictional us operationxxv another prime example of the use of mods is the cdrom game ethnic cleansing produced by resistance records to promote the white supremacy agenda the game promotes the killing of subhumans other races and jews in setting similar to new york city the game is patterned after popular mainstream video games quake and doom turning racially motivated violence into form of entertainment users are given the option of

software that provides enhancements in several key areas of game production including character animation advanced ai and realworld physics kuma is easily able to produce immersive realistic games in little time additionally in an effort to make the games more easily downloaded by users in the middle east kuma has developed persia disk that can easily be copied and redistributed using the disk once the game design is loaded onto the users pc internet connection is required to play although lowband connection is adequate to attain new episodesxxvii terrorist groups likely could reduce development costs further by soliciting sympathizers with the required skill sets to work for free or reduce costs as their contribution to the jihad analogous to how religious game deve lopers operate to reduce costsxxviii college students provide plausible target for recruitment machinima is film making within the realtime 3d virtual environment of video game its the use of video game graphi cs technology to create animated films machinima combines aspects of film making animation and game design to transform an interactive medium video game into production studio complete with

such as the one used to produce sonic jihadxxix and allow users to create quality machinima productions productions such as sonic jihad which are made with trial versions of machinima software frequently place their websites directly in the center of the screen in order to drive peopl to their sites to purchase full versions productions like sonic jihad not only can promote propaganda but direct sympathizers who wish to create similar productions to the software needed in 2005 machinima french democracy depicted the views of the minorities during the french riots the welldeveloped story carries political message allowing one to sympathize with the minority position in the riots the machinima was produced on november 22 ju st 5 days after the riots ended similar to using mods to develop games realtime video capture software like fraps allows users to record video of the activity taking place on ones pc during game play for example once downloaded this software records to capture audio and video bits up to 1152x864 and 100 frames per secondxxx the use of such software in games like kumawars would allow users to develop machinima productions of recent combat events adding their own twist features of fraps realtime video capture software screen capturing digital images taken by the software recording the visible items on the monitor as screenshot in formats such

audiences games by nature are learning experiences playing game involves building skills in order to advance to new levels in the game traditional teaching and conditioning methods are used to teach and develop the player learning is central to players ingame successxxxi learning in games can be transparent eg helping to refine players shooting technique or hidden developing predisposition in player toward particular cause or message the latter often involves the promotion w ithin the game of particular set of values or ideologies via the storyline or setting and the use of emotional tools to elicit particular reactions finally games can be effective influe nce platforms because they are popular captivating players and encouraging them to return for more video games are weaponized texts or disr upters of psychic stabilityi mean to say that games perform what pierre bourdieu calls symbolic violencein other words that gentle invisible form of violence which is never recognized as such like educational institutions video games are instances of symbolic violence in the sense that they inflict themselves on players the world of the video game is nothing more than the onscreen rendering of programmed instructions and decrees players are schooled by an aggressive bombardment of pixellated images and sounds every moment is direct imperative an attack that demands response

active and passive ways knowledge and skills games can serve as place to learn imparting knowledge and teaching skills during prehistoric times hunting games were used to teach young people how to handle dangerous situations in the wild today games are often more comple x involving dynamic platforms sophisticated storylines and diverse goals individuals progress through an entire learning cycle when playing game beginning with openness to new situations nd rules then taking certain actions and reflecting on them and finally learni ng how to operate successfully in the game see figure 1 often the learning process continues outside the game in such ways as conversations with friends participation on fan websites reading about the games and player meetups onlinexxxiii games look at emerging

when an individual plays game he is open to its structures rules and messages 2 action by nature games present problem that player must address and act on in order to advance in the game actions must take place within the rules and value systems of the game in this diagram the game is represented by the box environment in order for the player to participate and move forward in the game

coaching the rules of the game prov ide guidelines on how to take action and what is permissible and acceptable d instinctive learning when quick action is required instincts will play role in how play is performed this often in cludes mix of lessons learned from past experiences players personal values system and physical and emotional reactions this part of learning is generally subconscious nurturing the individual assessments about how well the player is playing the game are made frequently throughout the game games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 19 the structure of games promotes learning through rewards system video and other games teach correct course of action by providing immediate feedback on players initial action as discussed with regard to the learning cycle players then reflect on their initial action in an effort to achieve better outcome the next time they are faced with similar situation in the game learning action feedback reflectionxxxv players advance to higher levels in games by learning appropriate responses during earlier stages of the game ga mes have reinforcement and punishment mechanisms such as gaining or losing points for desired responses ie operant conditioningxxxvi the chainsaw model of video games visually represents the accumulation of knowledge andor skills that leads to adva ncement to higher level in game players move through series of microchallenges that when combined lead to advancement exhibit 22 the chainsaw model of video game story

player consciously or subconsciously makes an assessment about what worked what didnt work what could be improved and how to take action differently in the future 4 unlearning to openness reflection enab the unlearning of decisions and actions taken in the previous game and creates openness to trying again to succeed this completes one learning cycle and starts another games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 20 games often require action without expertis forcing players to experiment and learn xxxviii such learning experiences often involve role exploration project execution and operating within game producers version of facts and history role exploration or choosing virtual persona and acting out this role in the game teaches players the challenges and limits of that role xxxix multiplayer games which require numerous individuals to carry out mission teach players how to become leaders and execute collaborative project in its entiretyxl immersion in game producers version of facts or history teaches players how to operate in the defined sociopolitical environment this can result in player

feeling like learning is not work with games and spend more time with the subject matter than if they were reading book bout the topic some studies indicate that students retain information from games

to the internet to support its operational objectives games have already been explo ited by terrorist extremists and sympathizers emerging trends within the game space suggest grea ter opportunities will exist for future exploitation enhancing ra nge of terrorist operations from supporting strategic propaganda and influence activities to more highly instrumental uses such as communication fundraising and recruitmentlix such activities warrant concern given the increasing popularity of gaming which seems to be transcending age gender and cultural boundaries several plausible scenarios exist where terrorist organizations could leverage the power of the gaming medium to achieve operational goals with minimal training and expertise this paper will outline the current capabilities and potential scenarios by game genre demonstrating how terrorist organization might exploit the game space the extent to which games can be used by terroris t groups to supplement their other activities depends on variety of factors to include internet connectivity of game users cost and availability of hardware andor software required to play game level and kind of interaction between players that the game allows ease of use of game degree of game skills transferability to realworld activity degree of realism in game design such as graphics and programming sophistication barriers to game production potential uses of games for terrorist activities propaganda and influence terrorists and sympathizers use games to twist historical context demonize enemies disrupt the social moral compass and propagate ideology communications games provide attractive communications channels for terrorist groups and sympathizers because ingame conversations often are difficult to monitor recruiting online gaming can serve as recruiting tool for example the united states army found that 28 of players logging on to play its americas army online game also visited the corresponding recruitment site simulation practice and team management games can supplement field training by familiarizing recruits with the tactics weaponry and skills needed to conduct operations and planning money laundering

social interactions virtual world environments allow users to communicate and participate in activities simultaneously with other users regardless of the physical distance between them typically producers establish virtual world and allow users to develop space and design items within the world rpgs require players to undertake role and play out narrative in simulated worlds with pre programmed characters and quests players can customize their characters and then interact with other players to complete goals or quests rpgs have been produced using both firstperson and thirdperson perspectives some popular examples of this genre are ultima final fantasy diablo and fallout games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public

they are interested in attacking and carry out realistic virtual dry runs of their attacks they consider expanding their networ k and developing an ongoing virtual terrorist training camp complete with lessons on the manufacture of bombs the proper use of artillery and basic lessons on the most effective places to shoot person to mortally wound them because virtual worlds can serve as platform for hardtotrace communications and private sometimes passwordprotected m eetings when members are separated by distance the terrorist network also utilizes the virtual space for cell management and meetings the meetings help ensure that members are accounted for on regular basis while drawing little attention to the gathering or the members association virtual interaction helps team members become familiar and develop trust with their teammates long before they meet facetoface working together in games or virtua l worlds build teams cohesion which translates into better synergies in realworld situations games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 31 frequent interaction with his network helps the leader monitor the level of his team members commitment to the cause and ensure that they do not waver from the groups tactical and strategic missions this also helps the leader prevent members from

the realtime 3d virtual environment of video game all that is required is game and desktop computerlxiv the combination of machinima software and virtual world or video game such as planet battlefield allows one to film their ingame activities as they play to develop film which is easily distributed over the internet terrorists could easily exploit this technology through the use of virtual characters and audio mashups terrorist c ould anonymously create machinima films that included speeches updates and briefings he could use the technology of virtual communities to create target sites to convey to cell members the next planned attack use games to give visual plan of how the attack should be carried out and familiarize teammates with the terrain of the intended site with the technology of second life additionally one could use machinima to create likable militant hero with whom their target audience could identify during the month of december saic analysts periodically

than 500000 to promote the premiere of the sopranos ae has developed mixed reality game played both on the internet and in the real world and involving searches for particular advertisements and other sightings alternate reality scenario 1 this scenario is fictitious terrorist cell is planning to bomb the us embassy in jakarta alternate or mixed reality games allow the cell to practice the attack in realistic environment with unexpected people noise and obstacles during the dry run cell members communicate through the operations coordinator who has access to th internet and telephone as the members communicate during the dry run in the real world it looks to other people like they are innocently talking on their cell phones looking at their palm pilots or sending text messages to friends in fact they are calling headquarters with information on security cameras wiring security guards power sources crowd congregation locations an d other data following maps on their pdas and communicating with team members with location tracking devices the coordi nator could track gps positions of cell phones or capture team members moveme nts with other members cameras and video phones the cell carries out its mission in the same manner that it had practiced using mixed reality gaming tools alternate reality scenario 2 this scenario is fictitious terrorist cell wishes to draw crowd to specific location in seattle and then distribute contagious biological agent cell develops an alternate reality game and posts it on the alternate reality game network on the internet games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 34 the game encourages parents to take their children to famous landmarks in seattle and teach them about seattles history and culture with each landmark visit they will gain certain amount of points whoever collect s 1000 points will receive free entry to popular local attraction on particular day the cell persuades the seattle science museum to grant free entry to winners in exchange for publicity parents and children tour the city coll ecting points when they take photos of particular landmarks or barcodes prepos ted around town when they collect 1000 points they are sent text message that says they have won free day at the seattle science museum on february 15 with nearguaranteed crowd at the science museum cell members distribute the biological agent on february 15 th winners and others there return home and spread the biological agent to families friends and schools geocaching geocaching is another treasure hunt type game using handheld gps devices the players use the information on the internet to search for the treasure in reallife many times the caches are not worth significant amount of money but it is the sense of adventure and accomplishment that draws people to the game to participate in geocaching one needs place to post geocache locations typically the internet handheld gps component and treasure typically geocachers sign up for an account on geocaching site once on the site they can search for geocaches that others have left similarly they can hide cache and post its coordinates for other people to find geocachings popularity has spread across europe and the united states asia and africa also are home to many participants the caches are ranked in terms of difficulty to find the terrain and the type of cache once cache is found the geocacher typically will sign log book at the site or via the website to inform people that

geocaching scenario this scenario is fictitious terrorist cell leader has cell members build and transport bomb to detonation spot naval watch station between angeles and san diego using geocaching 1 cell member 1 buys component of the bomb near reno nevada he then stashes his purchase for the next member to find in southcentral nevada 2 cell member 2 knows only the code name of cell member 1 he knows that 1 will be hiding partially built bomb th at requires the component that he has bought he watches and waits for pos ting by 1 of location within the predetermined 100 miles from his base when 1 posts he rushes out to find the cache takes the developing bomb adds his component and takes it to place within 100 miles of the southeastern utahnevada border 3 cell member 3 repeats the same process as cell member 2 this process continues until the bomb is completed 4 the final cell member takes the bomb to the naval watch station and detonates it as planned red flags were raised because the transport and purchase of the bomb components were spread out across four states exhibit 37 geocaching construction and transportation scenario games look at emerging trends uses threats and

the virtual world popular experiences in these games include flying racing sporting and building there are many kinds of users of simulation games for example to train soldiers the united states military uses simulation games including flight simulators urban warfare simulations and even co mmunication simulations for deployment in foreign countries likewise terrorist cells could use simulation games for communication recruitment and team management as well as for dryruns of missions some of the most successful titles include microsoft flight simulator gran turismo madden nfl and simcity simulation scenario this scenario is fictitious terrorist leader wants to stage biological and chemical attack on several washington dc metro stati ons simultaneously the cell leader would like to simulate all stages of such an att ack including the construction transportation and implementation of the plan basic benefits of simulated attack include cell members use virtual simulation to monitor times and locations to carry out an attack across multiple stations cell members use virtual simulation to case the environment prior to the attack in order to identify and mitigate potential obstacles the cell leader is able to integrate digital imagery and simulated sounds to acclimate operators in order that they execute the attack more effectively mapping programs such as google earth can be integrated into online simulation games to reconstruct streets buildings and other topographical features near potential attack sites the cell leader integrates information provided by the city inspectors office including actual building codes and utility locations to generate more accurate game construction software program that simulates hospital and laboratory environments is uploaded into the game space the software is intended for training medical staff and laboratory technicians about safe handling and storag of dangerous chemicals and biological agents it also trains first responders on containing spills cell members use this program to learn safe handling transport an d deployment of the chemical and biological agents they will use games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 37 utilizing actual plans for the metro system provide insight into tunnel and station structures such plans accurately portray the location and significance of key power sources ventilation ducts and other infrastru cture features critical to an effective biological attack the cell leader utilizes software that scans the structural and architectural plans of key structures to create 3d virtual metro system he then places the virtual metro system on password protected island in virtual world and shares the password with other cell members additional details are entered into the virtual metro station using the same techniques cell members casing the real metro system identify security checks including camera and video installations and th program their locations by integrating these systems into the simulated metro system the cell members identify and overcome obstacles through tria l and error identifying and inputting passenger traffic patterns through the metro system further enables accuracy in planning and executing attacks the breadth of data and sophistication of the software programs allows the cell to perform damage assessments against each scenario to help predict which conditions would be most effective in delivering chemical or biological infections through their dry runs experimentation and pr actice the simulation in its entirety determine the optimal operation while maximizing the effectiveness and impact as the scenarios are being planned and practice the cell leader obtains sensors to monitor cell members biological responses further some games have features that allow leaders to monitor player statistics he hooks the cell members up to these sensors and has them perform various tasks related to the simulation nd monitors their responses this helps the cell member determine the roles of the members based on their natural responses it also helps identify training or conditioning that must occur before the mission the cell member also tracks player performance and time spent in the simulation through ingame player performance statistics through the cells dry runs the team becomes comfortable with their roles during the mission thereby reducing the margin of error games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 38 each member knows their roles and what their colleagues will be doing simultaneously they practice scenarios that may occur during the mission and determine how to act they are now less susceptible to surprises through research and ingame simulation it is determined that maximum impact can be expected using three bombers in each of four metro stations metro center gallery place union station capitol south and lenfant at 845 am on tuesday in late march each cell member knows their responsibilities and the timing on their movements knowledgebased games knowledgebased games are proven success in teaching many organizations have begun to develop video and othe r games to teach children about their work or mission the united nations for example provides food force for free via the website the game aims to teach child ren about global hunger and food aid likewise middle eastern groups have atte mpted to influence children via games the islamic fun suite contains the game the resistance which carries the following introduction to the game you are farmer in south lebanon who has joined the islamic resistance to defend your land and family from the invading zionists other popular titles include where in the world is carmen sandiego blues clues blues big musical and one of the first ducational video games oregon trail knowledgebased game scenario this scenario is fictitious alaqsa martyrs brigade would like to teach children about the israelipalestinian conflic t the group knows that vivid interactive games are likely to entertain children while providing an eff ective education platform they develop game from the palestinian pointofview that distorts history by embellishing atrocities committed by the israelis and minimizing culpability of the palestinians in order to win the game the young player must answer questions correctly to save his family and friends correct answer as deemed by the

sustain any injury he promises you that your youngest brother will be cared for time is of the essence however and the freedom fighters are expecting your decision tonight what will you do your options are refuse their offer you thank the freedom fighter but resign you rself to live under israeli occupation your father would understand you are trying to protect yourself and younger brother although you know that the israeli forces could come again at any time b not respond to the offer your family has already been destroyed and you do not want to worsen the situation beware however as your failure to join the islamic resistance essentially means that you are complying with the zionist occupation c join the resistance and offer yourself as suicide bomber you begin training today you

management in order to achieve victory many of these games can be likened to traditional tabletop war games occurring in either turnbased or realtime situation real time strategy games rts have become the predominant game in this genre popular titles in turnbased or r ealtime strategy games include starcraft warcraft civilization master of orion command conquer and age of empires traditionally strategy games have focused on military movements in todays information technology environment how ever strategy games teach business management and negotiation skills terrorists might use strategy games to teach new leaders fundraising techniques mission planning and how to manipulate cell members into complete missions strategy game scenario this scenario is fictitious terrorist group would like to engage younger players and distribute propaganda to segment of the populati on that will be important in future jihad efforts the group would like to also determine if there are any players that fit the profile of their recruiters the terrorist group develops game that simulates the duties and camaraderie of their islamic brothers in jihad the terrorists build into the game lodging rank and file roles benefits of those roles and weapons structur that allows players with higher status to have better weapons the stra tegy in the game is to not only overcome their enemies in this case corrupt official police force but they must also become leaders of their brothers to obtain better weapons and benefits within the group the setting of the game begins when young strong iraqi sees neighbor after neighbor murdered by corrupt police the player must build citizen armies to counter the corrupt police forces the player must train his troops as well as raise funds he must avoid the crowd turning against him the game is distributed for free to reach the greatest number of people and can be played amongst other members by connecting to the internet members of the terrorist group games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 41 which produced the game also play the game and assess other players

the industry fueling its expansion into previously untapped markets and affording terrorist organizations greater opportunities to reach and target core audiences emerging trends in the gaming industry w ill be used to the advantage of groups committed to terrorizing societies to achieve their goals terrorist organizations have already demonstrat ed the capability to utilize technological advances to enhance their operations as monstrated with their extensive use of the internetlxvi as emerging trends come to fruition in burgeoning markets it is only matter of time before terrorist organizations further exploit these trends in the gaming space for similar purposes the multiple uses of an expanded game space will be numerous and from the terrorists perspective invaluablelxvii terrorist will be able use the enhanced game space to conduct range of ope rations from supporting strategic propaganda and influence activities to more highly instrumental uses such as communication fundraising and recruitment emerging trends in the gaming industry will continue to drive culture technology and creativity in both mature and previousl untapped markets they are expected to serve as catalyst for the gaming indust rys rapid growth across age gender and cultural boundaries many emerging gaming trends are enabled by the spread of existing technologies and the advent of new ones three major technological drivers propelling the gaming industry into unta pped markets will be the diffusion of broadband internet access the maturation of the mobile platform and the fruition of reliable wireless communication networks such as third generation 3g and fourth generation 4g networks collec tively these trends will improve access and make online gaming in nascent markets reality emerging trends will continue to spur the gaming space ensuring its growth continues at near exponential rates evidence of trends spurring the gaming industry can be seen in the growth of virtual worlds like lineage everquest world of warcraft wow and second life hugely popular these virtual worlds have evolved due to technol ogical advances such as the evolution in computing processing units cpus and graphics processing units gpus peak throughput gabriel weimann makes this point regarding the internet but his argument can be extended to the game space due to many similarities between the two mediums for more information see weimann gabriel wwwterrornet how modern terrorism uses the internet united states institute of peace special report 116 online gaming has been growing at rapid rates in both mature and nascent markets in particular within virtual worlds evidence can be seen in both the revenue generated by the gaming industry and the sheer number of gamers which cross cultural gender and age boundaries games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 44 power the spread of broadband internet access and the integration of communication technologies newer technologies and em erging consumer usage patterns are expected to continue to spur growth in the future within the gaming sector changes have occurred at rapid pace w ithin the gaming space and emerging trends indicate more changes are forthcominglxviii many trends will change how players interact with games and with each other through games as trends come to fruition as interactive gaming changed how an entire generation saw itself in relation to the world in mature markets it will also likely change how generations see themselves in nascent markets the overall impact of emerging trends in burgeoning markets is expected to mirror the experience of more mature markets though marked differences will exist gaming will become powerful medium playing an important host to range of ordinary human affairs particularly in the online space like the united states and asian experience the line between the virtual and real world will blur for some and become nonexistent for otherslxix however noticeable differences will emerge particularly in consumer usage patterns such as gaming platforms ie personal computers cons oles and handheld devices and access methods ie internet cafes and wire less networks due to the limitations associated with existing infrastructures and costs of deploying new ones the impact of interactive gaming has profound effects beyond the game space evidence can be seen in how gamers learn problem solve and relate to the real world for more information on this trend see will wrights piece dream

to reach and target core audiences while forthcoming trends in the gaming space have been separated into various sections for analysis there is considerable overlap between them in that one trend often enables the other or is dependent on the other to come to fruition broadband diffusion the spread of broadband internet access will be major enabler for online gaming and its expansion into previously untapped markets one of the most reliable historical indi cators for the growth of online gaming is high speed internet accesslxx broadband growth rates in the united states and asia have paralleled similar growth rates in online gaming making the experience in mature gaming markets informative of what can be expected in growing markets european middle eastern and african emea markets are expected to see the biggest growth in online gaming with th increased penetration of high speed internet accesslxxi market analysts expect the number of online game participants in the emea market to more than quadruple from 4 million in 2005 to 18 million in 2010 growing at compound rate of 351 lxxii the projection of broadband access is major reason industry analysts see the emea as the fastest growing market in the gaming industry increasing by compound annual rate of 13 surpassing us76 billion in 2005 and reaching us139 billion by 2010lxxiii emea markets will mirror the expansion of broadband internet access and online gaming in more mature markets however its adoption will have some marked differences industry analysts expect the growth of high speed internet to initially be more limited to internet cafes in the middle east and africa as opposed to individual households due to the expense ssociated with deploying fixedline or wired infrastructures consequently industry analysts expect broadband wireless solutions to play larger role in driving gaming in these markets particularly with the launch of third generation 3g wireless services games look at emerging trends

gigabyte per second while static lxxviii such speeds would enable user to download dvd within one minute major inhibitor of deploying 3g networks has been the emergence of too many standards within the industry leading some countries to cooperate on one standard japan and china recently signed memorandum to cooperate on games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 49 developing and rolling out common standard with goal of deploying 4g network by 2010 lxxix wireless gaming will be more predominant than wired gaming in some markets where existing cellular infrastructures are more prevalent wireless networks are faster and cheaper in europe and asia where cellular networks are more abundant than fixed line infrastructures leading many industry experts to project significant growth in the wireless gaming industry as such many countries will build upon exis ting cellular networks taking market share from declining fixedline markets this trend can already be seen in parts of the middle east especially in saudi arabia oman and qatar where they are testing 3g services following its successful introduction in bahrain and israellxxx the emergence of wifi hot spots are also an important development for gaming in many parts of the world cities are deploying wifi hot spots to increase network connectivity and in some instances gaming companies are partnering with telecommunications firms for instance nintendo recently partnered with bt openzone to establish hot spots in the uk to enable mobile gaminglxxxi the maturation of the mobile platform rapid growth of the mobile market in ma ture and emerging regions will expand the reach of the mobile gaming space exponentially strong growth is expected in the mobile sector with expansion rates ranging from 30 to 35 year bringing the industrys value to an estimated worth of us6 billion by 2010lxxxii rapid growth in the mobile industry will continue to be spurred by the explosion of data app lications ie text ring tones streaming video to include gaming and the furthe r convergence of these applications transforming the cellular phone into an integrated mobile platform moving well beyond voice lxxxiii such growth will expand both the mobile market and in turn the mobile gaming space gaming has already become major player in the mobile space competing with other popular data applications last year marked the first time consumers spent more downloading games than ringtones significant milestone considering the popularity of ringtones worldwidelxxxiv the expansion of the gaming industry in emerging and new regions is also expected to drive the growth of the mobile gaming sectorlxxxv games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 50 the penetration of next generation game enabled devices with internet access capabilities and enhanced graphics will fac ilitate the growth of wireless gaming the number of game enabled devices is xpected to grow rapidly from about 40 of the 2 billion devices available worldw ide today to about 97 of all mobile devices sold in 2008lxxxvi there were 600 million mobile devices sold last year alone compared to 300 million consoles sold in the 25year history of the videogame industrylxxxvii the increasing sophistication of new handsets will make for more enjoyable and immersive gaming experience thereby expanding wireless gaming currently most mobile games are simple and are similar to games developed for consoles decade ago because the graphics capabilities of handsets are still relatively limited however next generation devices are now being designed and marketed to highlight their gaming features like the samsung sghb450lxxxviii in addition to mobile phones portable gaming consoles like the nintendo ds dual screen nd sony psp will increasingly become an important part of the mobile gaming space the expansion of the game space will be dr iven in large part by mobile gaming huge latent demand exists for mobile gaming with only 5 of people who own phone ever downloading game and 50 actually ever playing gamelxxxix such percentages suggest huge unta pped market segment that is very encouraging to the future of mobile gaming given the number of subscribers and handsets available worldwide evidence of the how the game space will be driven by mobile gaming occurred recently when for the first time more games were played on mobile devices than on console games in 2006xc in terms of revenues of course console gaming is far greater but the importance of this event in mobile gaming cannot be underestimated given that the gaming i ndustry is largely driven by console gaming more games being played on mobile devices represents shift in what factors will drive the expansion of the game space in years to come the significant difference in the mobile gaming market as oppose to the personal computer and console sectors is that the would be gamer already owns and carries the platform on which they can play the game mobile devices also tend to be more intimate devices to their us ers always available and always onxci as newer more advanced technologies ar deployed market analysts expect traditional sectors like the personal computer to lose ground to mobile platformsxcii exhibit 45 samsung sghb450 games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 51 the availability and range of mobile gaming content will increase in the coming years the industry is now moving away from pr eloaded games to models where games are required to be downloaded over the internet from carriers and third party providers such move should enable mo re third party mobile game providers and distributors to enter the market space increasing both the availability and range of mobile gaming content moreover it will allow organizations to directly market mobile games to end users an examination of more mature market s suggests that gaming will move beyond casual gaming leading to further growth in the industry japan represents the current benchmark where many users are pl aying more than just casual games on their mobile devicesxciii an exceptionally large number of games are aimed at what would be considered console and hard core gamers making the mobile phone in japan as much games platform as any consolexciv some gaming experts suggest that multiplayer games are the next big thing in mobile gaming as they attempt to recreate virtual worlds for mobile devices while other analysts suggest that the ne xt big breakout game would be mobile game that leverages the power of mob ile networks and vices integrating features like voice and gps into the gamexcv while industry leaders have different views all are searching for the mobile game that will drive the mobile platform similar to how the halo madden football and zelda franchises drove sales of the xbox play station 2 and nintendo gaming consoles respectivelyxcvi such game would prove invaluable to expanding the mobile gaming market the skills required for successful mobile game programmer are not insurmountable and include knowledge of java and j2me brew symbian opengl andor mophun while skilled programmer would currently be required to develop mobile game using one of the aforementioned programs the introduction of middleware or game modification software in the coming years should enable broader group to create compelling content for mobile games the rise of virtual worlds virtual worlds will provide the greatest opportunities to support terrorist operations particularly in the areas of communication coordination recruitment and fundraising activities as virtual worlds expand terrorist opportunities to exploit them will also increase for more in depth look at the various ways terrorist organizations can exploit the game space see an earlier paper produced in this series exploitation and function of games an interactive influence medium saic september 2006 games look at emerging trends uses threats and opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 52 virtual worlds will become powerful medium in nascent markets mirroring adoption and consumption patterns in more mature markets as virtual worlds expand they will increasingly play an important host to range of ordinary human affairs in which participants may communicate coordinate socialize train learn simulate experiment build proselytize and even barter virtual goodsxcvii the emergence of virtual worlds has significant consequences because events within the virtual space at times cannot be isolated from the real world leading some to suggest that the line between the virtual and real world is blurring even becoming nonexistent this phenomenon can best be seen in virtual worlds social interactions experimental learning and value of virtual goods and services social interactions occurring in virtual worlds are not simulations of human interactions rather they are human interactions merely extended in new forum virtual worlds are places people identify with and where real and lasting bonds form for many becoming an important source of material and emotional well being avatars become representation of ones identify and immersion into the virtual world increases the identity that one feels to the virtual self this connection with the virtual world invokes many of the same psychological triggers as in the real worldxcviii for instance reciprocity and liking extensively come into play in relationship formationxcix and the process of developing ones avatar seems to invoke exactly the same risk and reward structures in the brain that are invoke d by personal development in the real worldc as virtual worlds become more immersive and expand into newer markets the number of gamers who identi fy with and form relationships within these spaces will expand the expansion of virtual worlds will provide space for experimental learning to develop knowledge or hone pa rticular skill set with practical applicability in the real world for instance becoming an effective leader of guild amounts to totalimmersion course in leadership guild leaders are required to be adept at many skills to include attracting evaluating and recruiting new members creating apprenticeship programs orches trating group strategy and adjudicating disputesci absent the virtual surroundings these skills are prerequisites to managing and leading any organizationcii virtual goods services and currencies ve real world value exceeding us100 million globally trades occur in games among players between players and the preset game vendors and on third party sites like ebay ige and numerous other sites current estimates indicate that large demand for intangible goods exists within the digital world valued in the range of us1 2 billion making the value of virtual goods quite real for instance world of warcraft wow gold piece is edward castronova originally makes this point in regards to communication occurring the virtual space however it is appropriate to extend his argument to all forms of social interaction that occur within virtual worlds games look at

in virtual worlds during the coming years with more than 10 million online game players in the us approximately the size of new york city and 30 million gamers worldwide approximately the size of shanghai bombay and karachi combinedcv the biggest market for virtual worlds rema ins asia closely followed by the united states however it is only matter of time before other markets become more active in online gaming the expansion of virtual worlds and the gr owth rate of its populations lead some to suggest that virtual worlds may soon become the primary venue for all online activitycvi the immersive persistent and interactive characteristics of virtual worlds would enable communication soci alization and coordination in more effective ways then other mediums the explosion of user

opportunities in influence activities fouo not for public distribution page 62 countering ingame propaganda countering extremist propaganda in the game space can be achieved in part by being an active game player establishing an ingame presence allows for virtual interfacing information exchanges and deve loping influential relationships with both adversaries and allies ingame interaction also can help shape reallife attitudes and perceptions establishing an ingame presence would enable identification of influential players their guilds and other common interest groups these relationships can be exploited to facilitate viral message spread or ingame dialogue for counterpropaganda purposes establishing an ingame presence also would enable identification of important propaganda efforts in the game space identification of propaganda allows for working with the game producer to eliminate harmful or misleading information from the game space andor for devel oping counterpropaganda campaign establishing an ingame presence would aid the determination of optimal message placement areas cued by wh ere propaganda is surfacing and how it is spreading ingame for example in some games there are large bulletin boards or other communication areas that are exploited ingame assets might form partnerships with celebrity avatars or popular game design companies for ingame public service announcements such as anti violence campaigns generating ingame public service announcements backed by game producers ngos or other public interest groups is popular phenomenon in some game spaces for
