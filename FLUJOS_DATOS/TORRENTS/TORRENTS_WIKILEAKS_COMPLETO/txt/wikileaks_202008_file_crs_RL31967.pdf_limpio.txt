government can increase in two ways first debt increases when the government sells debt to the public to finance budget deficits and acquire the financial resources needed to meet its obligations this increases debt held by the public second debt increases when the federal government issues debt to certain government accounts such as the social security medicare and transportation trust funds in exchange for their reported surpluses this increases debt held by government accounts the sum of debt held by the public and debt held by government accounts is the total federal debt surpluses generally reduce debt held by the public while deficits raise it statutory limit has restricted total federal debt since 1917 when congress passed the second liberty bond act congress has raised the debt limit five times since 2001 deficits each year since 2001 and the persistent increases in debt held by government accounts repeatedly raised the debt to or near the limit in place at the time congress raised the limit in june 2002 and by december 2002 the us department of the treasury asked congress for another increase which was passed in may 2003 in june 2004 the treasury asked for another debt limit increase after congress recessed in midoctober 2004 without acting the secretary of the treasury told congress that the actions he was taking to avoid exceeding the debt limit would suffice only through midnovember congress approved debt limit increase in postelection session which the president signed on november 19 2004 in 2005 congress included debt limit raising reconciliation instructions in the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 appr oval of the budget resolution in april 2005 triggered the automatic passage of debt limit increase in the house with action having been taken by december 2005 the secretary of the treasury sent several letters warning congress that the treasury would exhaust its options to avoid default by midmarch 2006 congress passed an increase in midmarch which the president signed on march 20 the houses adoption of the conference report on the fy2008 budget resolution in the spring of 2007 automatically created and deemed passed legislation hjres 43 raising the debt limit by 850 billion to 9815 billion the senate approved the resolution on september 27 2007 and it was signed by the president two days later the 2008 economic slowdown has led to sharply higher estimates of the fy2008 deficit raising the prospect of another debt limit increase the budget resolution conference report sconres 70 passed by the senate on june 4 2008 and the house the next day recommends spending levels that would require an increased debt limit in fy2009 house passage of the fy2009 budget reso lution automatically created and deemed passed

obligations used by the us department of treasury treasury can be hobbled when federal debt nears its legal limit if the limit prevents the treasury from issuing new debt to manage shortterm cash flows or to finance an annual deficit the government may be unable to obtain the cash needed to pay its bills or it may be unable to invest the surpluses of designated government accounts federal trust funds in federal debt as generally required by law in either case the treasury is left in bind the law requires that the governments legal obligations be paid but the debt limit may prevent it from issuing the debt that would allow it to do so the governments income and outlays vary over the course of the year producing monthly surpluses and deficits that affect the level of debt whether or not the government has surplus or deficit for the entire year the government accounts holding federal debt also can experience monthly deficits and surpluses even if most of them currently show annual surpluses g25g145g162g561g10g138g159g142g561g138g561g6g142g139g157g561g14g146g150g146g157g501g561 the debt limit as noted above can hinder the treasurys ability to manage the federal governments finances in extreme cases when the federal debt is very near its statutory limit the 1 about 08 of total debt is excluded from debt limit coverage as of april 2008 total public debt outstanding was 9368 trillion debt subject to limit was 9289 trillion or 992 of total public debt outstanding the treasury defines total public debt subject to limit as the total public debt outstanding less the unamortized discount on treasury bills and zerocoupon treasury bonds old debt issued before 1917 and old currency called united states notes as well as debt held by the federal financing bank and guaranteed debt 2 although there are hundreds of trust funds the overwhelming majority are very small the 12 largest trust funds hold 988 of the federal debt held in government accounts 3 other means of financingincluding cash balance changes seigniorage and capitalization of financing accounts used to fund federal credit programshave relatively little effect on the changes in debt held by the public 4 in future years when some trust funds are projected to pay out more than they take in funds that the treasury would use to redeem those intergovernmental debts must be obtained via higher taxes or lower government spending 5 trust fund surpluses by law must be invested in special federal government securities

to meet federal obligations6 while the debt limit has never caused the federal government to default on its obligations it has at times caused great inconvenience and has added uncertainty to treasury operations the debt limit also provides congress with the strings to control the federal purse allowing congress to assert its constitutional prerogatives to control spending7 the debt limit also imposes form of fiscal accountability which compels congress and the president to take visible action to allow further federal borrowing when the federal government spends more than it collects in revenues in the words of one author the debt limit expresses national devotion to the idea of thrift and to economical management of the fiscal affairs of the government 8

bond act of 19179 which helped finance the united states entry into world war i10 by allowing the treasury to issue longterm liberty bonds which were marketed to the public at large the federal government held down its interest costs11 before world war i congress authorized specific loans such as the panama canal loan or allowed the treasury to issue specific types of debt instruments such as certificates of indebtedness bills notes and bonds12 in other cases congress provided the treasury with limited discretion to choose debt instruments13 with the passage of the second liberty bond act congress enacted aggregate constraints on certificates of indebtedness and on bonds that allowed the treasury greater ability to respond to changing conditions and more flexibility in financial management debt limit legislation in the following two decades also set separate limits for different categories of debt such as bills certificates and bonds 6 us general accounting office gao

and on other types of debt which created the first aggregate limit that covered nearly all public debt14 this measure gave the treasury freer rein to manage the federal debt as it saw fit in particular the treasury could choose to issue debt instruments with maturities that would reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks stemming from future interest rate changes given the conditions in financial markets15 on the other hand although the treasury was delegated greater independence of action the debt limit on the eve of world war ii was much closer to total federal debt than it had been at the end of world war i for example the 1919 victory liberty bond act pl 65328 raised the maximum allowable federal debt to 43 billion far above the 255 billion in total federal debt at the end of fy1919 16 by contrast the debt limit in 1939 was 45 billion only about 10 above the 404 billion total federal debt of that time

1945 when it was set at 300 billion 17 after world war ii ended the debt limit was reduced to 275 billion because the korean war was mostly financed by higher taxes rather than by increased debt the limit remained at 275 billion until 1954 after 1954 the debt limit was reduced twice and increased seven times until march 1962 when it again reached 300 billion its level at the end of world war ii since march 1962 congress has enacted 69 separate measures that have altered the limit on federal debt 18 most of these changes in the debt limit were measured in percentage terms small in comparison to changes adopted in wartime or during the great depression some recent increases in the debt limit however were large in dollar terms for instance in may 2003 the debt limit increased by 984 billion

growth reduced debt held by the public as percentage of gdp when large deficits returned and gdp growth slowed in the early 2000s debt held by the public as share of gdp again increased smaller

surpluses fy1998fy2001 the increases in federally held debt and decreases in debt held by the public produced net increase of 405 billion in total debt subject to limit at the beginning of fy2002 october 1 2001 debt subject to limit was within 217 billion of the existing 595 trillion debt limit 23 between then and the end of may 2002 debt subject to limit increased by another 217 billion

appendix shows monthbymonth debt totals and accumulations from september 2001 through may 2008 in the fall of 2001 the administration recognized that deteriorating budget outlook and continued growth in debt held by government accounts were likely to lead to the debt limit soon being reached in early december 2001 it asked congress to raise the debt limit by 750 billion to 67 trillion as the debt moved closer to and reached the debt limit over the first six months of fy2002 the administration asked congress repeated ly to increase the debt limit warning of adverse financial consequences were the limit not raised on april 4 2002 the treasury held debt below the limit by invoking its legislatively mandated authority to suspend reinvestment of governme nt securities in the gfund of the federal employees thrift savings plan tsp this allowed the treasury to issue new debt and meet the governments obligations on april 15 debt subject to limit stood at 5949975 million just 25 20 the

2002 this allows the treasury to suspend or redeem investments in two trust funds which will provide flexibility to fund the operations of the government during this period 26 the treasury reduced federal debt held by these government accounts by replacing it with non interestbearing nondebt instruments which enabled it to issue new debt to meet the governments obligations the treasury claimed these extraordinary actions would suffice at the latest through june 28 2002 without debt limit increase by that date the treasury indicated it would need to take other actions to avoid breaching the ceiling by june 21 the treasury had postponed regular securities auction but took other actions with large payments and other obligations due at the end of june and at the beginning of july the treasury stated it would soon exhaust all options to issue debt and fulfill government obligations putting the government on the verge of default during may and june 2002 congress took steps to

leadership expressed strong reluctance to include debt limit increase in the supplemental appropriation bill instead on june 11 the senate adopted bill s 2578 without debate to raise the debt limit by 450 billion to 64 trillion at that time 450 billion debt limit increase was thought to provide enough borrowing authority for government operations through the rest of calendar year 2002 if not thr ough the summer of 2003 with the possibility of default looming over it the house passed the 450 billion debt limit increase by single vote on june 27 the president signed the bill into law on june 28

raised to avoid serious financial problems by february 20 2003 the treasury as in 2002 used legislatively mandated measures to manage debt holdings of certain government accounts to avoid reaching the debt limit these actions included the replacement of internally held government debt with nondebt instruments in certain government accounts and not issuing new debt to these accounts these actions allowed the treasury to issue additional debt to the public to acquire the cash needed to pay for the governments commitments or to issue new debt to other federal accounts 26 us department of the

economic forecasters has led to sharply higher estimates of federal deficit spending in fy2008 and fy2009 the slowdown began with rapid dece leration of housing prices and rise in interest rate spreads between private lending rates and benchmark federal reserve rates indicating an increasing reluctance of major financial institutions to lend to each other as well as to firms and individuals the effects of this slowdown will depend in large part whether market difficulties remain concentrated in the housing and financial sector or whether the downturn spreads more widely through the economy an economic recession affects the federal deficit in several ways first falling prices of many assets and equities can sharply reduce federal revenues from capital gains taxes and from the corporate tax second more difficult economic conditions may reduce tax revenues on earned income and other income sources third automatic stabilizers such as unemployment insurance and income support programs pay out more money as unemployment rises and the number of households eligible for meanstested benefits rises an increase in deficit spending provides fiscal stimulus to the economy if the output levels of goods and services produced in the nation are below their potential levels deficit spending however can help accelerate inflation if output levels are near or at potential levels and in addition exacerbates longterm fiscal challenges several economists have expressed concerns that inflation which had been relatively low since the early 1980s could accelerate due to rising prices of food energy and primary commodities while inflation would reduce the market value of the federal deficit it would require treasury to pay higher nominal interest rates on federal debt

federal deficits accelerated the growth of total debt increases in the debt limit would be necessary much sooner than previously expected early in 2003 the fy2003 deficit and the persistent rise in
