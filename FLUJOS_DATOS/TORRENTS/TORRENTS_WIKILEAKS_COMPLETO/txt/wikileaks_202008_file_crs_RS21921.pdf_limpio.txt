be updated as events warrant background the national defense authorization ac t for fy1996 called on the department of defense dod to emba rk upon an initiative to develop cruise missile defense cmd programs emphasizing operational efficiency and affordability advanced cruise missiles cms those designed with stealthy capabilities to evade detection were noted as prominent threat prompting the need for effective cmd this cmd initiative was to be coordinated with other air defense effort s that is with cruise missile defense programs and ballistic miss ile defense programs mutu ally supporting each other1 three years later in conjunction with th national defense au thorization act for fy1999 the senate armed services committee noted the committee does not believe that the department of defense has adequately integrated its various cruise missile defense programs into coherent architecture and development plan2 dod has indicated commitme nt to developing cmd capabilities within its larger strategy of air defe nse requirements that demons trate operational effectiveness unlike past approaches to cmd that critics assert were stovepiped individually driven by the services respective objectives current and future programs are meanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21921crs2 3 for more information see crs report rl30427 missile survey ballistic and cruise missiles

plans to point of effective interoperability is an important question many analysts believe that mission area will rely more on jointness than detection and intercept of advanced cms an examination of cmd development therefore offers some insigh t into the progress dod is making in terms of increased joint warfighting capability cmd today is primarily an issue of force protection for us troops deployed in theater of conflict the cm threat to the united states appears lower than the theater cm threat but it also seems likely to grow give n ongoing proliferation challenges there is general consensus that cm tec hnology will continue to spread3 many claim that the united states dominance of manned military av iation will drive many countries to adopt cms as the poor mans air force by 2015 the cia estimates that up to two dozen nations will be able to pose serious cm thr eat primarily in theater but also through forwarddeployed weapons platforms4 also the us failure to detect several iraqi cms launched against american assets during op eration iraqi freedom has led some in dod to now deem cmd critical mission area5 cms present many ope rational challenges6 effective cmd requires rapid and accurate performance of seri of military tasks collectively known as the kill chain first surveillance radars must detect manned and unmanned aircraft including cms the second major step involves continuously trackin g the aircraft along its course process complicated by what may be an elusive flight path next the aircraft must be identified it must be concretely determined whether th airborne object is cm or friendly or neutral aircraft this process called combat identification is vital to lowering the chances that friendly or neutral aircra ft might be erroneously iden tified as threat and attacked scenario that unfortunately played out several times during operation iraqi freedom once cm threat is identified decision on how to engage the cm must be made which defense assets naval ground or airborne platforms will be used to try to intercept the cm the final step of th kill chain involves actually intercepting or neutralizing the cm with weapons miss iles and gunfire being the only two current options other technologies such as di rected energy weapons are being studied7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21921crs3 8 major examples of these platforms are as follo

serviceoriented cmd systems independent land air and seabased weapons platform s with cmd applications8 although this strategy has yielded fairly effective point defense capabilities against conventional airborne threats most analysts agree that an advanced cm threat will require more effective defenses the north am erican aerospace defense command norad for example is attempting to augment its sensor coverage capabilities and link with service weapons systems for target engagement of low flying cms9 efforts are also underway to marry military sensors and rada rs employed by the federal aviation administration faa to provide comprehensive air surveillance of the united states10 increased effectiveness against advanced cms will require improved joint surveillancetracking and combat identification cap abilities and increased weapons range key dod cmd efforts the pentagons efforts to improve cmd capabilities are addressed through multiple offices and strategies some of the

data collection and evaluation from these exercises aids in determining how to address the advanced cm threat jciet efforts aided combat identification capabilities and can therefore contribute to clearer air picture integrated fire control ifc ifc attempts to decouple servicespecific and platformspecifi c fire control radars from their w eapons to create overthehorizon and joint cmd intercept capabilities presently fi re control radars control specific weapons the navy for example can intercept cm with surfacetoair missile guided by the ships aegis radar patriot missile can intercept cms based on its radars information and an f15s radar would guide its ai rtoair missiles to intercept cm ifc would enable an airborne surveillance platform such as an e2c hawkeye e3 awacs or the joint land attack cruise missile defense elevated netted sensor jlens to relay cm tracking information to either ground or airbased assets for engagement16 furthermore once groundbased wea pons for example have been sent to intercept the cm radars external to the launch platform will be able to direct the weapons towards the cm these objectives of ifc would remove the horizon or lineof sight limitations that currently exist for cmd thus increasing the time and distance for intercept decoupling the fire control radar from the weapon c ould improve capabilities against stealthy cms by providing numerous and supporting surve illance perspectives combined with the goals of single integrated air picture ifc would create much wider and more defensible ar ea of coverage against advanced cms ifc

prepared testimony of us secretary of fense donald h rumsfeld before the senate appropriations committee defense subcommitt ee may 12 2004 dod was not able to provide more contemporary estimates for the update of this report 18 report of the defense science board summer study on cruise missile defense undersecretary of defense for acquisition technology washington dc january 1995 p14 19 information provided to crs by jtamdo 20 estimates provided to crs by jtamdocongressional considerations generally at issue is whether or not dod has adequately res ponded to congressional directives on cmd this question is best addressed by examining the three main parts of the 1996 congressional cmd initiative itable coordination of cmd with ballistic missile defense bmd efforts the development of cmd for nearterm as well as advanced cm threats and affordability and operational effectiveness for all cmd efforts congress directed dod to undertake bmd nd cmd efforts in mutually supportive fashion some argue that pentagon efforts on cmd have taken back seat to bmd efforts in terms of resource allocation much more fo cus has been placed on ba llistic missile defense than on cmd in its budget request for fy2005 for example dod sought 92 billion for the missile defense agency the office tasked with bmd and asked for 239 million toward the development of cmd17 on the one hand it can be argued that bmd must remain paramount given the known ballistic missile threat nuclear missiles are already targeted at the united states and enemy ballistic miss iles have already take n toll on us troops during wartime on the other nd some contend that the current level of prio ritization may be too lopsided as noted by the defens science board the cm threat is highly unpredictable and advanced cms coul d emerge quickly and unexpectedly18 in relation to the congressional directive to address nearterm and future airborne threats dod has stressed effective theater nd air missile defense as prime objective in addition to upgrading many of the serv ices individual cmd w eapons platforms dod is working toward many of the strategies relevant to future cmd single integrated air picture better combat id entification and integrated fire control among them dod anticipates that such building blocks will enable the employment of joint engagement zone jez for theater war fighting between 2015 and 202019 currently theater commanders try to reduce the chance of fratricide by separating cmd forces into distinct zones missile engagement zones and figh ter engagement zones this separation however also reduces effectiveness jez is intended to enable interoperability among the services sensors and weapons systems for offensive and defensive operations will the cmd challenges inherent to creating jez really be overcome by 2010 to do so would require adequate inve stments of time and effort by the pentagon however jtamdo for example estimates that as little as 20 of its time and ma npower is currently going toward cmd efforts at the same time it estimates that upwards of 40 of its resources are being put toward suppor t of the initial defens ive operations of bmd20 moreover jtamdo resources are being expended toward homeland air security coordination force protection and wmd defense requirements although some measure of action toward addressing th cm threat is being taken the level of urgency remains an issue as dod may now deem other defense activities more pressing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21921crs6 21 kathy gambrell senate begins 2nd day of debate on fiscal 05 defense budget aerospace daily defense report may 19 2004congress noted that cmd measures s hould be undertaken with operational effectiveness as core criterion since inter operability of resources remains the paramount feature in the pentagons activities to develop effective cmd consequences associated with jointness are key factor to monitor further several cmd objectives will likely enable other mission areas an effective siap for example not only will offer cmd applications but also will enab counterair opera tions and battlefield interdiction efforts increased jointness associated with cmd efforts may also create some level of organizational friction and congress may come under pressure to provide oversight to resolve service turf battles as cmd efforts become more integrated service control over traditionally clear boundaries may get cloudier with enhanced ifc for example air force or navy assets may be able to dir ect groundbased weapons that are currently under army control it is possible that narrow service interests may hinder the implementation of and thus effectiveness of future joint cmd capabilities moreover will the services cmd operational overlap lead to reorganization of which services control and are funded by congress for certa in weapons systems and programs the congressional directive to develop ffordable cmd measures is an important issue in terms of procurement current co stexchange ratios associated with cms favor attackers over defenders cruise missiles can be cheap and defenses are costly for example patriot missiles bought at r oughly 25 million apiece can be effective interceptors for incoming cms but those cms may be simple designs costing only couple hundred thousand dollars apiece21 moreover intercept co sts are only one of many kill chain expenditures that can make cmd forces much more expensive than the cm threat on the whole the pentagon seems to have promoted the pursuit of advanced cmd programs to combat sophisticated cm attacks in terms of simple cm threats however more resources may be needed to produce ss costly but nonethele ss effective defenses dods defense advanced research projects agency darpa has lowcost cruise missile defense program that focuses on c ountering lowtech cms by reducing the cost of interceptors darpa hopes to develop cmd interceptors that would cost as little as 40000 even cheaper intercept technologies may be required for costeffective cmd especially if faced with largescale attacks by cheap cms inexpensive but proven jamming technology eg highpower mic rowaves that can disrupt cm guidance systems might be potentially useful appro ach also point defense weapons such as radarguided machine guns with high rates of fire could be employed against less sophisticated cms final consideration pertains to the deactivation of jciet combat identification remains and is likely to remain one of the most challenging aspects of cmd overseers of dods activities may wish to ask why the department deactivated the only organization dedicated specifically to improving joint cmd combat identification capabilities it is not evident that other organizations such as jtamdo have increased their work on cmd combat identification issues to make up for jciets demise nor is it clear that improvement in other facets of cmd will make up for ineffective combat identification if friendly or neutral manned aircraft is in advertently shot down by us cmd platforms in the future dods deci sion to deactivate jciet may come under intense scrutiny
