among experts in and outside the us government about the magnitude of the threat to us national interests posed by the qaeda organization virtually all experts agree that qaeda and its sympathizers retain the intention to conduct major attacks in the united states against us interests abroad and against western countries in assessing capabilities many believe that the qaeda organization and its leadership are longer as relevant to assessing the global islamic terrorist threat as they were on september 11 2001 some believe us and allied counter efforts have weakened qaedas central leadership structure and capabilities to the point where qaeda serves more as inspiration than as an actual terrorism planning and execution hub according to this view the threat from qaeda has been replaced by threat from number of loosely affiliated cells and groups that subscribe to qaedas ideology but have little if any contact with remaining qaeda leaders those who take this view believe that catastrophic attacks similar to those on september 11 2001 are unlikely because terrorist operations on that scale require high degree of coordination an alternate view is that the remaining qaeda leadership remains in contact with and possibly even in control of numerous islamic militant cells and groups that continue to commit acts of terrorism such as the july 7 2005 bombings of the london underground transportation system according to those who subscribe to this view qaeda as an organization has not been weakened to the degree that some administration officials assert and the global effort against islamic terrorism would benefit significantly from finding and capturing qaeda founder osama bin laden and his top associate ayman alzawahiri subscribers to this view believe that coordinated attack on the scale of september 11 should not be ruled out because the remaining qaeda structure is sufficiently wellorganized to conduct an effort of that magnitude this paper will focus on the qaeda organization and its major affiliates but not the full spectrum of likeminded islamist cells or groups that might exist this report will be updated as warranted by developments see also

organization the state departments report on international terrorism for 2004 deems the organization as the most prominent component of global movement of islamic militants that has adopted the ideology and targeting strategies of qaeda founder osama bin laden and other senior qaeda leaders1 this report will not analyze all qaedainspired movements worldwide but it will address qaedas

seventeenth of twenty sons of saudi construction magnate of yemeni origin many saudis are conservative sunni muslims and bin laden appears to have adopted militant islamist views while studying at king abdul aziz university in jeddah saudi arabia there he studied islam under muhammad qutb brother of sayyid qutb the key ideologue of major sunni islamist movement the muslim brotherhood 2 another of bin ladens instructors was dr abdullah alazzam major figure in the jordanian branch of the muslim brotherhood azzam is identified by some experts as the intellectual architect of the jihad against the 19791989 soviet occupation of afghanistan and ultimately of qaeda itself he cast the soviet invasion as an attempted conquest by nonmuslim power of sacred muslim territory and people 3 bin laden went to afghanistan shortly after the december 1979 soviet invasion joining azzam there he reportedly used some of his personal funds4 to establish himself as donor to the afghan mujahedin and recruiter of arab and other islamic volunteers for the war in 1984 azzam and bin laden structured this assistance by establishing network of recruiting and fund raising offices in the arab world europe and the united states that network was called the maktab alkhidamat services office also known as khifah many experts consider the maktab to be the organizational forerunner of qaeda another major figure who utilized the maktab network to recruit for the antisoviet jihad was umar abd alrahman also known as the blind shaykh the spiritual leader of ra dical egyptian islamist group jihad bin laden apparently also fought in the antisoviet war participating in 1986 battle in jalalabad and more notably 1987 frontal assault by foreign volunteers against soviet armor bin laden has said he was exposed to soviet chemical attack and slightly injured in that battle 5 during this period most us officials perceived the volunteers as positive contributors to the effort to expel soviet forces from afghanistan and us officials made apparent effort to stop the recruitment of the nonafghan volunteers for the war us officials have repeatedly denied 1 us department of state country reports on terrorism 2004 april 2005 pp 78 2 the muslim brotherhood was founded in 1928 in egypt and it has since spawned numerous islamist movements throughout the region some as branches of the brotherhood others with new names for example the palestinian islamist group hamas traces its roots to the palestinian branch of the muslim brotherhood in 1966 sayyid qutb was tried and executed for treason for his opposition to the government of egyptian president gamal abd alnasser 3 gunaratna rohan inside qaeda columbia university press 2002 4 the september 11 commission report says that us officials obtained information in 2000 indicating that bin laden received 1 million per year from his family from 1970 two years after his fathers death until 1994 when his citizenship was revoked by the saudi government final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states july 22 2004 p 170 5 gunaratna p 21

states did covertly finance about 3 billion during 19811991 and arm via pakistan the afghan mujahedin factions particularly the islamic fundamentalist afghan factions fighting soviet forces by almost all accounts it was the afghan mujahedin factions not the arab volunteer fighters that were decisive in persuading the soviet union to pull out of afghanistan during this period neither bin laden azzam nor abd alrahman was known to have openly advocated undertaken or planned any direct attacks against the united states although they all were critical of us support for israel in the middle east in 1988 toward the end of the soviet occupation bin laden azzam and other associates began contemplating how and to what end to utilize th islamist volunteer network they had organized us intelligence estimates of the size of that network was about 10000 20000 however not all of these necessarily supported or participated in qaeda terrorist activities 7 azzam apparently wanted this qaeda arabic for the base organizationas they began terming the organization in 1988to become an islamic rapid reaction force available to intervene wherever muslims were perceived to be threatened bin laden differed with azzam hoping instead to dispatch the qaeda activists to their home countries to try to topple secular pro western arab leaders such as president hosni mubarak of egypt and saudi arabias royal family some attribute the bin ladenazzam differences to the growing influence on bin laden of the egyptians in his inner circle such as abd alrahman who wanted to use qaedas resources to install an islamic state in egypt another clos egyptian confidant was dr ayman alzawahiri operational leader of jihad in egypt like abd alrahman zawahiri had been imprisoned but ultimately acquitted for the october 1981 assassination of egyptian president anwar sadat and he permanently left egypt for afghanistan in 1985 there he used his medical training to tend to wounded fighters in the antisoviet war in november 1989 azzam was assassinated and some allege that bin laden might have been responsible for the killing to resolve this power struggle following azzams death bin laden gained control of the maktab s funds and organizational mechanisms abd alrahman came to the united states in 1990 from sudan and was convicted in october 1995 for terrorist plots related to the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center in new york zawahiri stayed with bin laden nd remains bin ladens main strategist today g22g145g142g561g22g145g155g142g138g157g561g23g151g143g152g149g141g156g561 the august 2 1990 iraqi invasion of kuwait apparently turned bin laden from defacto us ally against the soviet union into one of its most active adversaries bin laden had returned home to saudi arabia in 1989 after the completion of the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan that february while back home he lobbied saudi officials not to host us combat troops to defend saudi arabia against an iraqi invasion arguing instead for the raising of mujahedin army to oust iraq from kuwait his idea was rebuffed by the saudi leadership as impractical causing bin ladens falling out with the royal family and 500000 us troops deployed to saudi arabia to oust iraqi forces from kuwait in operation desert storm january 16 february 28 1991 about 6000 us forces mainly air force remained in the kingdom during 19912003 to

confined to saudi military facilities bin laden and his followers painted the us forces as occupiers of sacred islamic ground and the saudi royal family as facilitator of that occupation in 1991 after his rift with the saudi leadership bin laden relocated to sudan buying property there which he used to host and train qaeda militantsthis time for use against the united states and its interests as well as for jihad operations in the balkans chechnya kashmir and the philippines during the early 1990s he also reportedly funded saudi islamist dissidents in london including saad faqih organized as the movement for islamic reform in arabia mira8 bin laden himself remained in sudan until the sudanese government under us and egyptian pressure expelled him in may 1996 he then returned to afghanistan and helped the taliban gain and maintain control of afghanistan the taliban captured kabul in september 1996 bin laden and zawahiri apparently believed that the only way to bring islamic regimes to power was to oust from the region the perceived backer of secular regional regimes the united states during the 1990s bin laden and zawahiri transfor med qaeda into global threat to us national security culminating in the september 11 2001 attacks by this time qaeda had become coalition of factions of radical islamic groups operating throughout the muslim world mostly groups opposing their governments cells and associates have been located in over 70 countries according to us officials the preseptember 11 roster of attacks against the united states that are widely attributed to qaeda included the following in 1992 qaeda claimed responsibility for bombing hotel in yemen where 100 us military personnel were awaiting deployment to somalia for operation restore hope one was killed growing body of information about central figures in the february 1993 bombing of the world trade center in new york particularly the reputed key bomb maker ramzi ahmad yusuf suggests possible qaeda involvement as noted above abd alrahman was convicted for plots related to this attack qaeda claimed responsibility for arming somali factions who battled us forces there in october 1993 and who killed 18 us special operations forces in mogadishu in october 1993 in june 1995 in ethiopia members of qaeda allegedly aided the egyptian militant islamic group in nearly successful assassination attempt against the visiting mubarak the four saudi nationals who confessed to november 1995 bombing of us military advisory facility in riyadh saudi arabia claimed on saudi television to have been inspired by bin laden and other radical islamist leaders five americans were killed in that attack the september 11 commission report indicated that qaeda might have had hand in the june 1996 bombing of the khobar towers complex near dhahran 8 on december 21 2004 the treasury department designated faqih as provider of material support to qaeda and bin laden under executive order 13324 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33038g3g149g561g19g138g142g141g138g497g561g18g155g152g143g146g149g142g561g138g151 g141g561g22g145g155g142g138g157g561 g3g156g156g142g156 g156g150g142g151g157g561

administration began to exert pressure on qaedas host the taliban regime of afghanistan on august 20 1998 two weeks after those attacks the united states launched cruise missile strikes against an qaeda camp in an attempt to hit bin laden but the strike apparently missed him by few hours 9 in july 1999 president clinton imposed ban on us trade with talibancontrolled afghanistan and froze taliban assets in the united states on december 19 2000 security council resolution 1333 banned any arms shipments or provision of military advice to the taliban the clinton administration also pursued number of covert operations against bin laden during 19992000 and the bush administration considered some new options prior to september 11 including arming anti taliban opposition groups 10 the september 11 attacks instilled greater urgency in the us effort against qaeda although us officials say that the postseptember 11 struggle against qaeda uses all aspects of us national power legal economic diplomatic as well as military cornerstone of the post september 11 us effort has been the military effort in afghanistan the usled war succeeded in ousting the taliban regime there december 2001 and replacing it with prous moderate government approximately 18000 us troops remain in and around afghanistan searching for remaining qaeda and taliban leaders and fighters however bin laden and zawahiri are not widely believed to be in afghanistan proper they reportedly escaped from their redoubt in the tora bora mountains near the city of khost during the war and according to most assessments fled into pakistan central intelligence agency paramilitary officers and other us personnel some as contractors in pakistan are dedicated to this search 11 assisting pakistani forces and agents acting on the assumption that bin laden and zawahiri are in remote areas of pakistan rather than in or around urban areas in march 2004 pakistan deployed about 70000 troops against suspected

operations are centered around north waziristan there are very few indications of their whereabouts but in time magazine s june 27 2005 issue director of central intelligence porter goss said that the united states had an excellent idea where bin laden was but he did not specify any exact location white house spokesman scott mclellan subsequently clarified the goss comment to reflect less certainty than goss indicated12 some experts believe the two might be in settled areas perhaps even large pakistani city the videotaped statements by the two released over the past six months appear to demonstrate that they have access to technology and physical infrastructure many of the 15 top qaeda operatives captured or killed since september 11of the 37 such operatives identified after september 11have been found in urban areas these include number three leader mohammad atef killed in kabul afghanistan by us pr edator september 11 planner khalid shaikh mohammed arrested by pakistani agents near rawalpindi key recruiter and planner abu zubaydah arrested by pakistani agents in faisalabad september 11 plotter ramzi bin alshibh arrested by pakistani agents in karachi and abu faraj allibbi arrested by pakistani forces near peshawar in may 2005 libbi is perceived as an operative who has risen in the organization since september 11 but some question allibbis seniority and importance to recent qaeda plotting 13 other senior qaeda leaders have been found out side pakistan or afghanistan hanbali riduan isammudin key operative of qaeda affiliate jemaah islamiyah was arrested in thailand abdul ali alharithi key plotter was killed by us predator strike in yemen in the aggregate since the september 11 attacks about 3000 suspected qaeda members have been detained or arrested by about 90 countries of which 650 are under us control some other senior figures are apparently beyond us reach qaeda spokesman suleiman abu ghaith operations planner sayf aladl and bin ladens saad are believed to be in iran iran has acknowledged publicly that it has some senior qaeda figures in custodywithout naming them specificallybut iran has refused to transfer them to their countries of origin for interrogation and trial14 many doubt the degree of constraint if any that iran has placed on them and the bush administration has publicly alleged that the three were responsible for planning the may 2003 suicide attacks on housing complex in riyadh saudi arabia if true this would suggest that the three are in contact with qaeda operatives outside iran some might argue that if these three senior figures are able to communicate with bin laden and zawahiri major portion of the core of the qaeda leadership as it existed on september 11 2001 is still operating and possibly in control of ongoing operations 15 those who take this view tend to believe that the united states should exert greater efforts to capture bin laden and zawahiri on the grounds that they remain pivotal leadership figures and that their capture would greatly deflate the organization another view is that the qaeda organization as it still exists is less central to the overall islamic terrorist threat faced by the united states than it was at the time of the september 11 12 white house bin ladens exact location isnt known dow jones newswire june 22 2005 13 lamb christina and

department report on terrorism for 2004 p 7 says as do many experts that the core of alqaida has suffered dama ge to its leadership organization and capabilitiesat the same time alq aida has spread its antius antiwestern ideology to other groups and geographical areas it is therefore longer only alqaida itself but increasingly groups affiliated with alqaida or independent ones adhering to alqaidas ideology that present the greatest threat of terr orist attacks against us and allied interests globally qaedas evolution since september 11 could change the nature of the threat posed by the organization many believe that the weakening of central direction renders qaeda less able to conduct catastrophic attacks inside the united states because its diffusion limits its ability to orchestrate complicated coordinated plots similar to the september 11 2001 attacks the bush administration asserts that the absence of attacks inside the united states since september 11 demonstrates that the main thrust of administration policy is succeeding however it could be argued that more autonomous affiliates might be better able to adapt attacks to local conditions and goals making them major collective threat younger qaeda figures some of whom fled the afghanistan battlefield are said to be emerging as major planners and these activists apparently see qaeda as inspiration rather than as structured organization according to this view bin laden and zawahiri are far less operationally relevant than they were at the time of september 11 and us and allied counterterrorist efforts might be better spent on countering the ideology that is promoted by qaeda experts have advanced some ideas for doing so including enhanced us public diplomacy and stepped up efforts to engage moderate islamic clerics in the islamic world to enlist them in an effort to delegitimize qaedas tactics

diffuse than it was prior to the september 11 attacks qaeda has always been more coalition of different groups than unified structure many argue and it has been this diversity that gives qaeda global reachthe ability to act in many different places and to pose multiplicity of hardtopredict threats in most cases the degree of involvement if any by bin laden zawahiri or other known qaeda leaders in the operations of these diverse groups has never been precisely known some major groups were part of the qaeda coalition before september 1116 and most remain active and still associated with qaeda today to varying degrees are as follows the islamic group and jihad egypt zawahiri was the operational and political leader of jihad before he merged it with qaeda in 1998 the armed islamic group and the salafist group for call and combat algeria the islamic movement of uzbekistan imu this group has been less active since its military commander juma namangani was killed by us airstrike on fighters at konduz afghanistan in november 2001 16 the groups listed are all named by the state department as foreign terrorist organizations

been established or publicly identified and they have been active one notable example is the qaeda jihad organization in mesopotamia headed by abu musab alzarqawi 38yearold jordanian arab who reportedly fought in afghanistan the group which is designated as foreign terrorist organization fto consists of foreign volunteers fighting alongside iraqi insurgents against usled and iraqi forces it is an offshoot of another group called ansar alislam which is named as an fto and was based in kurdishcontrolled northern iraq prior to the usled war to oust saddam hussein ansar alislam which consists of both islamist kurds and arabs is said to be continuing to operate in iraq under the banner of group called ansar alsunna although some see this as distinct group although zarqawi reputedly sees himself as potent ial leader of islamic forces in his own right in 2004 he formally swore fealty to bin laden and affiliated with qaeda 19 some maintain that zarqawi is successfully stoking muslim opposition to the us intervention in iraq to recruit muslim fighters not only for combat in iraq but possibly also for terrorist operations in other western countries and in other middle eastern countries including his native jordan 20 in this view which reportedly is shared by the central intelligence agency in recent assessment the us involvement in iraq has strengthened ra ther than weakened groups connected to or influenced by qaeda the reputed cia assessment says that iraq is now playing role similar to that of afghanistan during the soviet occupation training ground for islamic militants who might travel elsewhere after the iraq conflict winds down 21 zarqawis formal affiliation with bin laden gives some support to the view that the remaining qaeda leaders might be trying to rebuild the organizational structure of qaeda before its leadership was ousted from afghanistan in late 2001 g17g157g145g142g155g561g3g143g143g146g149g146g138g157g142g156g561 range of other

outcome of investigations so of the bombings and attempted bombings of the london transportation system in july 2005 might support the belief in the administration and among some outside experts that there is growing qaeda presence in east africa two of the suspects arrested in the failed july 21 bombings were of east african origin and there had been longstanding fears among western intelligence agencies that qaeda might be recruiting or controlling cells consisting of east africans for operations in europe or elsewhere 23 qaeda was allegedly responsible for the bombing of an israeliowned hotel and the related firing and near miss of shoulderfired missiles at an israeli passenger aircraft both in mombasa kenya in november 2002 reflecting administration fears about qaedas expansion in africa the us military has begun program to train the militaries of nine african nations to prevent infiltration by terrorist groups particularly qaeda24 it is not yet known to what extent if any the july 21 bombers might have had links to the bombers who set off the july 7 explosions in london that killed 52 persons some of those alleged perpetrators who died in the bombings were britishborn but of south asian origin but some press reports indicate that the july 7 and the july 21 bombers might have visited pakistan simultaneously suggesting possible tie between them and perhaps to the qaeda

g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the assessment of the degree and character of the threat posed by the qaeda organization might suggest strategies for combating it those who believe that qaeda as an organization is marginal to the overall global islamist threat might focus on such policy objectives as addressing regional conflicts promoting democracy in the arab world cooperating with regional governments to prevent terrorism financing and terrorist infiltration and improving public diplomacy to better explain us policies in the middle east on the other hand some who believe that qaeda remains central to the islamist terrorism threat might tend to recommend policies that focus on finding combating and arresting qaeda leaders and operatives that are still at large many believe that matter the structure and capabilities of qaeda stabilizing iraq will likely be crucial to reducing the recruitment of militants willing to conduct acts of terrorism against the united states and its allies others believe that the qaeda and global islamic terrorist threat is difficult to assess matter how much intelligence is shared and gathered and that combating qaeda and its affiliates abroad could have only partial success those who take this view tend to believe that us counterefforts should focus more intently on homeland security stressing such measures as improving airline security establishing enhanced security measures for passenger train travel and expanding security of us ports some tend to favor additional powers for law enforcement to investigate potential islamist cells in the united states the latter suggestions often trigger debate from civil liberties and american muslim organizations who believe that such measures will inevitably impinge on the civil liberties of arab and muslim americans through profiling and other investigative techniques
