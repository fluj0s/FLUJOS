made or until enactment of another interim cr f ullyear cr provides final funding am ounts for the rema inder of fiscal year in lieu of one or more regular appropriations acts anomalies may be included in an interim cr to prevent what parties to cr negotiations perceive as ma jor problems that would be caused if an otherwise uniform approach were used to provide funding and impose related restrictions the president office of ma nagement and budget omb and agencies often are involved with congress in the pr ocess of formulating negotiating and implementing interim crs an implication of their involvement is that they may influence the potential impacts of interim crs interim crs typically are intended to both 1 preserve congressional prerogatives to make final decisions on fu llyear funding levels and 2 prevent funding gap and corresponding government shutdown consequently interim crs provide relatively restrictive funding levels for agencies and usually prohibit projects or activities that were not funded in th previous year sometimes called new starts interim crs also impose some paperwork burden on federal agencies two other potential impacts might be identified fi rst the restrictive funding level of an interim cr may impact upon an agencys ac tivities compared to the situation of receiving fullyear appropriations for example agency personnel may reduce or delay variety of actions in cluding hiring award of cont racts and travel second an agency funded by an interim cr may ex perience some uncertainty about what its final funding level w ill be uncertainty may cause an agency to alter its operations rates of spending and spending patterns over time with potential ripple effects for internal management of the agency and its programmatic activities whether any potential impacts manifest themselves in actual cases would depend on specific circumstances including how the interim cr is crafted the time of year and an agencys or programs par ticular operations omb and agency documents as well as government accountability office gao reports provide additional perspectives on potential impacts of interim crs related issues for congress may include

continuing resolutions crs potential impacts on agency operations introduction continuing appropriations acts comm only known as continuing resolutions crs have been an integral component of the annual appropr iations process for decades1 when congress and the president do not reach final decisions about one or more regular appropriations acts they often negotiate and enact cr two general types of crs are used an i nterim cr provides agencies with stopgap funding for period of time until final ppropriations decisions are made or until enactment of another interim cr fu llyear cr by contrast provides final funding amounts for the remainder of fis cal year in lieu of one or more regular appropriations acts if inte rim or fullyear appropriati ons are not enacted funding gap and government shutdown occur fo r affected agencies and programs2 this report analyzes potential impacts that interim crs might have on agency operations3 crs have become commonplace in th federal budget process with crs occurring in some form in all but 3 years out of 57year period from fy1952fy20084 however studies of the impacts of interim crs are quite limited aside from anecdotal accounts furthermore interim crs are formulated differently from time to time and may affect highly diverse agencies and programs in varying ways without indepth analysis of sp ecific circumstances therefore it may be difficult or in many cases impossible to make generalizable statements about the impacts of interim crs on particular agencies at particular timeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs2 5 in this report the impacts of interim crs are addressed as perspectives on potential though not necessarily actual or representative impacts close study of specific circumstances is typically necessary to have confidence in claim of impact this report does not verify or validate specific claims of actual impacts nor does it assess whether claims of impact in some agencies were representative of other agencies experiences 6 for more extensive discussion of potential impacts of interim crs including potential impacts on the federal budget process and handf ul of specific agencies and programs see crs congressional distribution memorandum potential impacts of interim continuing resolutions crs on agency operations and the functioning of the federal government july 8 2008 coordinated by clinton t brass 7 some observers might argue that the category of fullyear crs is limited to those measures that include formulaic provisions that provid for rate for operations through the end of fiscal year others sometimes have referred to measures as fullyear crs when they include or refer to full text in regular appropr iations act for example see neal devins appropriations redux critical look at th fiscal year 1988 continuing resolution duke law journal vol 1988 apriljune 1998 pp 389421 according to such perspective fullyear crs have included four types of funding provisions 1 full text of regular appropriations act 2 language that in corporates regular acts by reference to the continuedit is possible however to identify some potential impacts of interim crs prospectively utilizing several approaches5 this report uses three first the report discusses how an interim crs provisions and require ments may impact directly upon an agency based on what an interim cr explicitly is formulated to do second the report analyzes office of management and budget omb and agency documents that have provided guidance or requireme nts for how an agency should navigate through periods of interim crs the exis tence and emphases of such documents may suggest the occurrence or at least the risk of occurrence of interim crrelated impacts on the operations of agencies thir d the report analyzes brief mentions of claims of impact contained in govern ment accountability office gao reports from the last 20 years typically made by agency officials w ithout independent gao validation6 the possibility of interim crrelated impacts may raise issues for congress it should be noted for example that the pres ident omb and agencies may play roles in the formulation negotiation and impleme ntation of interim crs an implication of executive branch involvement is that the president omb and agencies may influence the potential impacts of interim crs in addition claim about the impact of an interim cr may rest on implicit assumptions viewing interim crs as product of negotiation helps explain why differing assumptions sometimes may be plausible such assumptions may be important because claims of impacts may generate arguments that changes in crs budg et priorities or the budget process are necessary to avoid some pur ported impacts given the hi ghstakes nature of budget deliberations and the potential for changes in the budget process to change power relationships among its participants claims of impact might be viewed as similarly significant in nature the reports final section discusses these and other topics fullyear crs occur less frequently than interim crs historically the term cr has been used in different ways in the context of providing fullyear appropriations amounts7 in any case fullyear crs effectively become regularhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs3 7 continued latest stage of congressional action usually the conference agreement if one has been reached 3 formulaic provisions that pr ovide for rate for operations or 4 combination of the previous three types wh fullyear crs have included the full text of one or more regular appropriations acts they also have included all the myriad general and administrative provisions that typically are incl uded in regular acts consequently they may be hundreds of pages in length whereas interim crs may be few pages or less 8 this section draws in part on crs report rl30343 continuing resolutions fy2008 action and brief overview of r ecent practices by sandy street er and crs

1962 and crs report rl34424 trends in discretionary spending both by d andrew austin 10 form of interim cr is the longterm cr which extends appropriations for outstanding regular appropriations bills temporarily from one calendar year into the next but does not extend funding to the end of the fiscal yearappropriations acts for the fiscal year comp lete with the certainty of final funding decisions for this reason fullyear crs ge nerally are not discu ssed in this report interim crs and their requirements usage of the term continuing resoluti on like other budget terms has varied sometimes to reflect evolving budget practices this section of the report discusses several aspects of how interim crs typically have been formulated and implemented in order to identify how interim crs may impact upon the operations of agencies8 some related terms also are highlighted in order to distinguish between interim cr related provisions and other provisions that sometimes appear in the context of crs contexts and purposes of stopgap funding the federal fiscal year begins october 1 for agencies and programs that are funded through annual appropriations acts appropriati ons must be enacted by this date if many governmental activities are to continue opera ting these funds pay for most of the routine operations of federal agencies including salaries contracts and grants9 final action on some of the regular appropriations acts is frequently delayed beyond october 1 delay may occur for example when negotiations between congress and the president ve not resulted yet in final decisions when action on one or more regular appropria tions acts is incomplete after the beginning of fiscal year congress often provides temporary funding for affect ed agencies by using an interim cr the stopgap funding is av ailable until date specified in the cr enactment of new interim cr or enactme nt of fullyear appr opriations whichever occurs earliest in this sense the term continuing has been used to indicate that appropriations will continue at certain level and subject to certain conditions pending further decisions10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs4 11 according to one observer interim crs might be seen as devices that set spending levels high enough to let agencies function but not so high that they removed the incentive for congress and the president to agree on regular authorization and appropriations bills joe white the continuing resolution crazy way to govern brookings review vol 6 summer 1988 p 30 gao also has discussed how incentives for policymakers to negotiate seriously and reach agreement may be affected by proposals for budget process changes like an automatic continuing resolution see us gao budget process considerations for updating the budget enforcement act gao01991t july 19 2001 p 12 for further analysis see crs report rl30339 preventing federal government shutdowns proposals for an automatic continuing resolution by robert keith 12 for related discussion see g richard shell bargaining for advantage pp 156175interim crs usually are enacted in th context of ongoing and highstakes budget negotiations between congress and th president and within congress in general interim crs typically are intended to 1 preserve congressional prerogatives to make final decisions on fullyear funding levels and 2 prevent funding gap and corresponding government shutdown conse quently interim crs provide relatively restrictive funding levels for agencies in addition an inter im cr may be structured purposefully as less than optimal from the perspective of many stakeholders in order to retain sufficient incentive for negotiating parties to come to an accord for final decisions11 participants in negotiation also may find it necessary to compromise purposefully accepting what they perceive as some undesirable impacts in an interim cr eg temporary constraint s on funding in order to achieve what they perceive as more important desirable impacts eg achievement of budget policy goals or avoidance of government shutdown12 in other words some impacts of interim crs may be product of inte ntional concessions in nego tiations in order to achieve other impacts provisions and agency requirements rate for operations formula interim crs have remained fairly constant in form and structure in recent years in contrast to regular and supplemental appropriations acts an inte rim cr generally does not provide specific amounts of budget authority for an appropr iations account instead an interim cr uses formula to calculate the funding amounts that are ava ilable for continuing appropriations during period of time specifically an interim cr typically provides such sums as are necessary to continue funding at specified rate for operations over specific period of time for accounts in bills covered by the cr these rates which are based on annual am ounts or levels of spending may be set in various ways for example funding has been based on formulas such as 1 the lower of the amounts provided in the housepassed versi on or senatepassed version of the bill assuming both houses have acted 2 the amounts provided in particular committeereported bill or 3 th funding levels available for the previous fiscal year interim crs frequently provide rates that vary among the regular appropriations bills funded an agency that hopes to receive an increase in its full year funding level compared to the previous year typically would be subject to rate restrictions and would not r eceive the increased level of funding for the duration of an interim cr unless speci exceptions were made httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs5 13 for example see us executive office of the president office of management and budget hereafter omb omb bulletin 0705 pportionment of the continuing resolutions for fiscal year 2008 sept 28 2007 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovombbulletinsfy2007b0705pdf this bulletin directed agencies how to operate during the interim cr for the period oct 1 2007 through nov 16 2007 as provided for by pl 11092 110th cong 121 stat 989 14 the antideficiency act 31 usc 13411342 15111519 requires the president to apportion in writing an executive agencys appropriation by specific time periods activity or combination of time periods and ac tivities in order to prevent the agency from spending at rate that would exhaust the appropriated funds before the end of the fiscal year omb implements the requirement on the presidents behalf during an interim cr congress may provide some flexibility on the timing requirements in apportioning funds for example see sec 108 of pl 11092 121 stat 990 15 for example see sec 112 of pl 110 92 121 stat 991 and omb bulletin 0705 p 4 attachment sec 6 omb might apporti on funds at essentially greater than daily rate as the period of time covered by an interim cr elapses however congress may require that the authority provided under this section shall not be used until after the department or agency has taken all necessary actions to reduce or defer nonpersonnelrelated administrative expenses sec 112 of pl 11092 16 for example see sec 104 of pl 11092 121 stat 990apportionment after enactment of an interim cr omb provides detailed directions to executive agenci on the availability of f unds and how to proceed with budget execution typically in bulletin13 the bulletin includes announcement of an automatic apportionment of funds that will be made availa ble for obligation as percentage of the annualiz ed amount provided by the cr14 under typical omb bulletin part of the annualized amount is apportioned and ma available for obligation funds usually ar apportioned either in pr oportion to the time period of the fiscal year covered by the cr or according to the historical seasonal rate of obligations for the period of the year cove red by the cr whichever is lower 30 day cr might therefore provi 30 days worth of funding derived either from certain annualized amount that is set by form ula or from historical spending pattern in an interim cr congress also may provide authority for omb to mitigate furloughs of federal employees by appor tioning funds for personnel compensation and benefits at higher rate for ope rations albeit with some restrictions15 interim crs impose some paperwork burden on agenci as result of these procedures restrictions on new starts and other activities congress has used interim crs to protect its prer ogative to set fullyear funding levels by restricting and guiding agency activities in other ways as well for example an interim cr may prohibit an agency from initiating or resumin g any project or activity for which funds were not available in the previous fiscal year ie prohibit new starts16 i n addition congress has included provisi ons like the following in interim crs concerning programs that have high initia l rates or distributions of funds see sec 109 below and concerning projects nd activities generally see sec 110 sec 109 notwithstanding any other provision of this joint resolution except section 106 for those programs that would otherwise have high initial rates of operation or complete distributi on of appropriations at the beginning of fiscal year 2008 because of distributions of funding to states foreign countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs6 17 secs 109 and 110 of pl 11092 121 stat 990 gao previously reported that provisions like these had been included in crs ever since fy1996 see us gao principles of federal appropriations law 3rd ed vol ii gao06382sp pp 816 817 18 house standing rules xxi clause 2 and xx ii clause 5 prohibit legislative provisions or unauthorized appropriations in general appr opriations measures but these restrictions do not apply to continuing resolutions the h ouse typically adopts special rules restricting amendments to continuing resolutions in part for this reason comparable senate restrictions on legislative provisions and unaut horized appropriations located in senate rule xvi do apply in the case of continui ng resolutions see crs report rl30343 continuing resolutions fy2008 action and brief overview of recent practices by sandy streetergrantees or others such high initial ra tes of operation or complete distribution shall not be made and grants shall be awarded for such programs funded by this joint resolution that would im pinge on final funding prerogatives sec 110 this joint resolution shall be implemented so that only the most limited funding action of that permitted in the joint resolution shall be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities17 anomalies congress the president and agencies sometimes negotiate for the inclusion of anomalies to the formulas and restrictions in cr to accommodate what they perceive as exceptional circumst ances for an agency program or policy anomalies typically are included to prevent wh at some or all stak eholders and parties to cr negotiations perceive as major programmatic operationa l or management problems that would be caused if an othe rwise cookie cutter approach were used to provide funding at uniform rate and with uniform restrictions however when measured against the typical coverage of interim crs anomalies tend to be rare substantive legislative provisions crs do not necessarily provide only stopgap or final funding some interim and fullyear crs have included substantive gislative provisions that is provisions under the jurisdiction of committees other th an the house and nate appropriations committees covering wide range of subjects crs are attractive vehicles for such provisions because they are consider ed mustpass legislation on which congress and the president eventually must reach agreement18 clean crs cr that contains rate for operations but does not contain any anomalies or substantive legislative provisions is sometimes referred to as clean cr however cr has at times been described as clean if it includes limited number of such provisions that an observer views as acceptable the level of cleanliness of cr is typically in the eye of the beholder therefore types of potential impacts as discussed above provi sions and requirements of interim crs may impact upon the operations of agencies in many ways if impacts were viewed in morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs7 19 for discussion see crs report 95906 shutdown of the federal government effects on the federal workforce and other sectors by james p mcgrath archived and available upon request 20 crs report 89579 shortterm continuing resolutions the department of defense experience by alice c maroni archi ved and available upon requestgeneral categories an interim cr might be characterized as having several types of potential impacts on the operations of agencies avoidance of government shutdowns in the absence of agreement about fu llyear appropriations among the house senate and president an interim cr may have the impact of preventing funding gaps and shutdowns of government agencies historically shutdowns prior to fy1996 generally were of short dura tion and were seen as having relatively modest effects especially when they occurred over week end partial shutdow ns of the federal government in fy1996 however were more farreaching in their effects 5day shutdown in november 1995 resulted in th furlough of an estimated 800000 federal employees second 21day shutdown occu rred month later resulting in the furlough of nearly 300000 federal employee s large but unspecified number of federal contractor employees we re also furloughed or laid off as result of suspended contracts19 the shutdowns also had pervasive effects on the delivery of services compliance with administrative requirements because an interim cr imposes its own tig ht restrictions on obligating funds for its duration an interim cr may impact upon an agencys administrative work as one study of the potential impacts of in terim crs on dod summarized the most visible effect of shortterm cr is its impact on the time and paperwork necessary to manage the distribution of funds20 as consequence comments from agency budget officials about the impacts of inter im crs might focus on or be colored by this experience funding level an interim cr determines th funding level that is av ailable for the duration of the cr at least three funding scenarios ppear to be possible for an agency that is funded by an interim cr 1 less funding than otherwise would have been provided under fullyear appropriation or essentially lower ra for operations during the crs duration 2 more funding or 3 the same amount for example suppose an agency anticipated an increase in its full year budget because of apparent consensus on higher prospective funding level among the house senate and president further suppose however that the agency s budget is included in legislative vehicle that is the subject of some cont roversy due to budget or programmatic issues elsewhere in the legislation if the level of policy conflict among the house senate and president were such that an inter im cr were used to provide funding until disagreements were resolved the agency might receive considerably lower rate for operations than was anticipated for the dur ation of the cr assuming final fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs8 21 for related discussion see crs report rs227 74 federal research and development funding possible impacts of oper ating under continuing resolution by dana shea and daniel morgandecision were made at the anticipated level an agency might or might not be able to catch up with what it had planned to do by contrast if an agen cy expected lower fullyear amount than the rate that was pr ovided by an interim cr the agency might experience more flexibility than previously had been anticipated for the duration of the cr finally if an agency expected fl at funding from one year to another there might be little or impact associated with an interim crs funding amount in the face of restrictive funding level agency personnel may reduce or delay variety of actions including hiring award of contr acts and travel whether any potential impacts manifest themselves in actual cas would depend on sp ecific circumstances including how the interim cr is crafted the time of year and an agencys or programs particul ar operations restrictions on new pr ojects and activities prohibition on new projects and activities may delay or disrupt an agencys ability to undertake planned activities for agencies with little need to engage in new starts this prohibition may not be significant in its implications for agencies that typically engage in new projects or change their funding priorities from year to year however the prohibition may have more significant impacts on operations21 funding uncertainty uncertainty related to fullyear fundi ng levels may impact upon an agencys ability to follow its plans uncertainty may have two dimensions concerning 1 the level of fullyear funding that ultimate ly will be available and 2 the timing of when the fullyear amount will be available if one or both kinds of certainty were needed for an agency to make decisions eg when to begin critical sequence of actions or events an interim cr might cause an agency to alter its operations rates of spending and spending patterns over time with potential ripple effects for internal management of the agency and its programmatic activities additional perspectives on potential impacts other sources of information may suggest more specific ways in which an interim cr prospectively might impact or retrospectively ma have impacted upon an agencys operations omb and agency documents omb and agencies have extensive ex perience operating under interim crs it seems plausible that they have learned many related lessons in recent decades perhaps as consequence of such lessons omb and agencies have provided to their personnel written guidance and requirements for how to ope rate under an interim crhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs9 22 even in the face of such potential impacts however it is not clear that absence of an interim cr would substantially reduce the need for similar guidance or requirements under regular appropriations act further study w ould be necessary to make determination 23 omb circular a11 pre paration submission and ex ecution of the budget june 2008 sec 123 p 1

without close omb supervision and guidance both circular a11 and ombs occasional bulletins devote the majority of their attention to cr formulas and apportionment amounts in compliance with th antideficiency act and the cr imposed direction to operate at minimal level until after your regular appropriation is enacted26 there is some risk that an agency may undertake new project oractivity contrary to an interim crs requirements both circular a11 and ombs occasional bulletins address this point 27 during cr of extended duration there is some risk of major disruptions to essentia l government services if care is not taken to conduct acquisitions using certain practices and basic steps28 according to omb these practices and steps include determining the availability of funding

an agency may have the tools and policies to award grants in timely way when operating under an inter im cr and even improve the timeliness of awards to states under current policies it is nevertheless more difficult to make timely awards while the agency operates under series of short continuing resolutions but it is still possible37 there is some risk that stakeholders and grant recipients will notknow that grant awards may not be fully funded until enactment of fullyear appropriations theref ore stakeholders and grant recipients must be notified or reminded 38 gao reports

startups of an office pilot initiative and process reengineering51 in the absence of validation studies it is not clear what conclusions can be drawn about the potential or actual impact s of interim crs however the claims of impact contained in the gao publicati ons may suggest number of hypotheses including the following impacts of interim crs may occur in many or all of the cited activities in some agencies and circumstances some or all of the cited activities may be at risk of impacts frominterim crs unless an agency undertakes focused planning and execution or requests that relevant anomalies be incl uded in interim crs and agencies that anticipate large fundi ng increases may be at particular risk of impacts from interim crs52 potential issues for congress the possibility of interim crrelated impacts may raise issues for congress notably claims of impacts may genera arguments that changes in crs budget priorities or the budget process are nece ssary to avoid or m odify some purported impacts given the highstakes nature of budget deliberations and the potential for changes in the budget process to change pow er relationships among its participants claims of impact might be viewed sometimes as similarly significant managing potential impacts of crs with anomalies if congress considers pursuing an inter im cr the subject of anomalies usually arises anomalies may be included among the provisions of an interim cr in order to modify or eliminate potential impacts of an interim cr depending upon how an anomaly is structured an anomaly may cau the funding for an agency to behavehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs14 53 pl 13 67th cong 42 stat 20 now codified in title 31 united states code 54 for the relevant provision see 31 usc 1108e 55 administrations and omb

legislative drafters deskbook practical guide alexandria va thecapitolnet 2006 p 291exactly like it would under regu lar appropriations act at l east for the duration of the cr however anomalies fre quently are not included for many programs in interim crs potential explanation for the rarity of anomalies is that the granting of too many anomalies would reduce incentives to negotiate seriously and come to final agreement on fullyear appropriations nother related explanation is that an anomaly could in effect constitute concession and reduce stakeholders leverage during negotiations unless there were consensus the anomaly was necessary in situations when an agency expects higher level of funding in an upcoming fiscal year or if an agency needs aut hority to undertake new projects or activities in order to achieve task the agency could request an anomaly for executive agencies such request can be made through the president and omb if the white house elected to propose the anomaly to c ongress alternatively an agency might make such request directly to congress either formally or informally an agency could make request to the president or omb but have th request denied in such case an agency might or might not info rmally make its view s or concerns known directly to congress the possibility of direct communications between agencies and congress has sometimes been contentious issue in congressionalexecutive relations both generally and in budgetary context in budgetary context most executive agencies have operated under stat utory requirements since 1921 that require budgetrelated request s to be submitted through the president as noted below access to agency information and employee views the president omb and agencies of ten are involved with congress in the process of formulating ne gotiating and implementing interim crs therefore they may influence the potential impacts of interim crs some influence may come from the bargaining power of the president another source of influence however may stem from the issue of acce ss to information from agen cies and views of their employees because agencies and their employees are in the trenches implementing and formulating public policy they may have considerable access to information about the potential impacts of an interim cr congress may not always have ready access to such information under the budget and accounting act 1921 as amended and recodified53 congress has prohibited most executive branch officers and employees from submitting budget requests to congress except through the president and subject to presidential modification54 however congress has statutorily exempted some agencies from such restrictions through provisions sometimes referred to as bypass authority55 omb regulations governing the budget process also direct agency offi cers and employees to avoid volunteering opinions to members and committees of congress that are inconsistent withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34700crs15 56 omb circular a11 june 2008 section 22 pp 12 for example the circular directs employees when testifying before any congressional committee or communicating with members of the congress to give frank and complete answers to all questions but also to avoid volunteering personal opinions th at reflect positions inconsistent with the presidents program or appropriation request 57 the concept what otherwise would have ppened is called counterfactual in the program evaluation field for discussion see crs report rl33301 congress and program evaluation an over view of randomized controlled trials rcts and related issues by clinton t brass blas nuñezneto and erin d williams 58 for example suppose an observer characteri zed an interim cr as having caused high level of uncertainty for an agencys program planning or execution this statement claims that the cr caused the stated impact ie high level of uncertainty which otherwise would not have happened all other things being equal in this case the claim of impact implicitly assumes scenario under which in the absence of an interim cr fullyear appropriations would have been passed by october 1 passage of fullyear appropriations in turn would have eliminated uncertainty about funding ho wever it also may be plausible that absence of cr might instead cause an impasse in negotiations and government shutdown rather than enactment of fullyear appropriations rende ring the observers claim contestable the reverse argument may also be made suppose another observer characterized an interim cr as having prevented government shutdown however it may be plausible that absence of cr might cause negotiators to reach agreement on fullyear appropriations thereby avoiding the shutdown without need for cradministration policies56 therefore the extent to which information and views flow from agencies and their personnel to cong ress about the potential impacts of interim crs both formally and informally may vary role of assumptions in assessing potential impacts claim about the impact of an inte rim cr may rest on implicit assumptions the term impact implies comparison between the described change that is caused by an interim cr on one hand and an assumption about what otherwise would have happened wit hout the interim cr on the other hand57 the assumption or estimation of what otherwise would have happened is crucial for any claim about the impact of an interim cr58 claims of an impact or lack of impact can be debatable therefore and become subjects of scrutiny or even controversy some observers for example might question the validity of an assumption an observer might be partly motivated to raise such objections because claims of impacts may generate arguments that changes in budg et priorities or the budget process are necessary in order to avoid or modify some purported impacts viewing interim crs as product of negotiation in which parties may come to the table with different underlying values and assumptions helps ex plain why differing perspectives may be plausible it is conceivable for example that participants in negotiation may hold opposite perspectives about the impact of an interim cr in pa rticular situation each participants views might be base d both on his or her aspirations for the outcome of negotiations and the negotiating leverage the participant believes he or she could wield in other words because there typically is some uncertainty about the outcome of any negotiation contras ting viewpoints may be plausible until decisions are made
