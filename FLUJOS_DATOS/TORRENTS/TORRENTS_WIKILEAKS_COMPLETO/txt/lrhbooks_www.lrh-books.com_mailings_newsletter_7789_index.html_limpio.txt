bridge publications inc newsletter date the time track and ones own universe now therefore we have this memory record which can be used as memory record but which is basically havingness bankmass if you chase somebodys time track all the way back it would open out from the time track which you seea record of the environmentand would become some vestige of his own universe and then would become his own universe in other words somewhere way back along the track he departed from something that was pretty good called his own universe and he went into this universe and then we see more and more and more that he only copied what he saw in other words he was obsessively in communication with universe that was held in agreement with one and all l ron hubbard excerpted from the power of simplicity lectures the anatomy of the time track an article by l ron hubbard from the power of simplicity lectures now the anatomy of time track is of extreme interest since it is mechanism by which thetan seeks to defeat time ill go over that again very slowly time track is mechanism by which thetan seeks to defeat time and recover the havingness which the automaticity of time repeatedly costs him follow this pocketapocketapocketa there goes time the walls now are not the walls then the walls then are not the walls now boppetaboppetaboppeta fellow gets married losses wife in the final analysis what cost him wife time he hasnt got her he did have her thats that obviously the villain is time fellow buys new car runs into dc or london driver havingness what cost him car time fellow was rich now hes poor what cost him his wealth obviously time obviously he had it didnt he he can remember having had it he hasnt got it therefore the wealth was in the past so he was cost wealth by time quite obvious fellow has beautiful game going he has planet with everybody in revolt beautiful game people getting shot in all directions electrocardiograph catches up with himhe has spoken from the heart once too oftenand he has beautiful game gone all that lovely confusion what cost him that time time is an agreedupon consideration by which we get rid of the things we dont want time is an agreedupon consideration by which we inherit things which we dont have yet time is beautiful consideration and is of course the heart of motion motion is simply motion time is time we record the postulate time by the change of particles in space we record time by the change of position of particles in space thats all thats all we do we could say that time is the change of position of particles in space but thats not really true that is the mechanics definition and as such it does process in the field of mechanics it does process in the field of mechanics but of course above the field of mechanics we have the entire field of postulates and all these changes of position in spaceall they are is proven record of the passage of time not only is the postulate time there but we have convinced everybody that it is there and then we prove it by changing the position of car from to b and we say see time has went time is basically postulate or consideration as all things are and that consideration came into being in order to produce motion randomity havingness game and other such basic considerations but weaving through all of these other considerations we do have this one consideration of time now it would be possible to have without time that is the one single exception in the field of mechanics and so thetan tries to defeat this as the lastditch effort and he makes time track and he has pictures on the time track and these pictures are the shadows of what has happened now actually that is an inverted universe that is not his own universe usually that is the universe he has created by taking pictures of the stuff as it has gone by and that is time track the time track is the last vestige he has of his own universe all he has left of his own universe is an ability to make picture of other things that have been made now that is the final analysis of what time track is it is that mechanical activity of taking pictures of what already exists and storing these in some orderly or disorderly fashion in order to have yesterdayat least have picture of what has gone by that is what most people call their own universe l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture time track click here for more information on the power of simplicity lectures success story from listening to these lectures the data learned on getting out of the trap as thetanknowing what to dowas worth an eternity all in itself and with it came radically different viewpoint and understanding of the time track the common denominator to all understanding is simplicity and the material contained on these lectures is utterly simple my awareness and willingness to confront is out the roof and higher perception with knowingness is only part of the abilities i gained from the data in these tapes gb the time track and ones own universe the anatomy of the time track the power of simplicity lectures success the power of simplicity once upon time there was little thetan and he was happy little thetan and the world was simple thing it was all very very simple and then one day somebody told him he was simple and ever since that time hes been trying to prove that he is not l ron hubbard thetan in his native state is utterly simpleand powerful but colliding with the seemingly endless and intricate complexities of living in the mest universe being can find himself unable to hold position unable to perceive unable to duplicate or act as well as he knows he truly can in this series ron covers in detail the factors of simplicity and complexity relating them to such
