result they believe that now is not the time to make changes based on cost savings three systems different retired pay calculations there are three separate and distinct but related retirement systems within dod one for active duty members one for the reserve components and one for those who become disabled and are generally unable to complete normal 20year military career due to their physical disability each of these retirement systems includes provision for an annual costofliving allo wance cola that will be discussed later active component retirement5 for active duty military personnel there ar three methods of calculating retired pay the final basic pay systemhigh threeand redux the applicable retirement calculation is based on the date when the servicemember first entered active duty and their basic pay6 at the time of retirement7 and in the case of redux voluntary election regarding 30000 bonus the activ and reserve component retirement systems vest after 20 years of service vesting for the disability retiree occurs at their disability retirement da and in some cases at the personal choice of the servicemember final basic pay system for persons who entered military service before september 8 1980 the retired pay computation base is final mont hly basic pay being received at the time of retir ement multiplied by 25 for each full year of service and prorated by 112th for each complete month less than full year8 the minimum amount of retired pay to which member entitled under this formula is therefore 50 of the retired pay computati on base 20 years of service x 25 servicemember who retires at 25 years receives 625 of th computation base 25 years of service x 25 historically the maximum reached at the 30year mark has been 75 of the computation base 30 years of service x 25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34751crs4 9 section 601 pl 109364 october 17 2006 10 section 642 pl 109364 october 17 2006 11 department of defense valuation of the military

additional longevity raises9 and provided additional retirement credit for service bey ond 30 years at the rate of 25 per year10 as result servicemember who retires with 40 years of service will

otherw ise calculations are the same as under the final basic pay method redux reductions in retired pay for future retirees were enacted in the military retirement reform act of 198612 now referred to frequently as the redux military retirement system because it was thoug ht that the preredux system was too generous the repeal of compulsory re dux in late 1999 by the fy2000 national defense authorization act indicated that many in congress believed the preredux system was the appropriate way to compensate retirees congress began taking notice of potential recruiting and retention problems related to redux13 in 1997 well before the executiv branch addressed the issue during the fall of 1998 the administr ation announced that it supported redux repeal the fy2000 national defense aut horization act contai ned provisions for repealing compulsory redux it allows fo r postaugust 1 1986 entrants to retire under the preredux high three system or opt for redux plus an immediate 30000 cash payment personnel who first enter service on or after august 1 1986 are required to select one of these two options for calcu lating their retired pay within 180 days of reaching 15 years of service option 1 preredux they can opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the preredux formula described above as high threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34751crs5 option 2 redux they can opt to have their retired pay computed in accordance with the redux formula and receive an immediate 30000 cash bonus called career status bonus which can actually be paid in several annual installments if the recipient so wishes for tax purposes those who select the career status bonus csb must remain on ac tive duty until they complete 20 years of service or forfeit portion on the bonus the redux formula redux is different from the high three formula in two major ways under age 62 retirees first for retirees under age 62 the retired pay multiplier will be reduced by one percent fo r each year of creditable service less than 30 years under this new formula therefor 20year retiree will receive 40 of his or her retired pay comput ation base upon retirement 2 0 years of service x 25 minus 10 and 25year retiree will recei ve 575 of the computation base 20 years of service x 25 minus 5 30year retiree however will receive 75 of the retired pay computation base 20 years of service x 25 minus 0 the same as the high three retiree the redux formula therefore is skewed much more sharply in favor of the longerserving military careerist theoretically providing an incentive to remain on active duty longer before retiring retirees 62 and older second when retiree reaches age 62 his or her retired pay will be recomput ed based on the old formula straight 25 of the retired pay computation base for each year of service thus beginning at 62 the 20year retiree receiving 40 of the computation base for retired pay according to the new formula will begin receiving 50 of his or her original computation base the 25year retirees annuity will jump fro m 575 of the original computation base to 625 and the 30year retirees annu ity already at 75 of the original computation base under both the old and ne w formulas will not change note this change is an increase in monthly re tired pay not lump sum at age 62 summary of these three retirement methods is portrayed in table 2

retirement system also accrues at the rate of 25 per equivalent year of qualifying service explained below at retirement eligibility third the reserve retirement system uses either final basic pay or the high three to calculate retired pay redux is not an option for reservists the primary differences between the two systems is the point system used to calculate qualifying years equivalent years of

aggregate of 90 days of specified duty performed after january 28 2008 the date of enactment of the fy2008 ndaa this authority was not made retroactive to september 11 2001 the retired pay eligibility age cannot be reduced below 50 and eligibility for medical benefits remains at age 60 one point for each period of funeral honors duty one point for every three satisf actorily completed credit hours of certain military corre spondence courses with multiple opportunities to earn points it is relatively easy for reserve component member to accrue the requis ite 50 points per year and thus earn qualifying year for retirement the max imum number of points per year exclusive of active duty has varied over time but is currently capped at 130 points19 when active duty points are added to this total the reservist cannot earn more than 365 points year the number of points is cr itical in determining both the number of years of qualifying service and the number of equivalent years of service for retired pay calculation purposes reservist may retire after completing 20 years of qualifying service there is minimum age upon retirement the indi vidual is normally tr ansferred to the retired reserve and is entitled to number of military benefits to include commissary and exchange privileges access to morale welfare and recreation programs and facilities and limited space available travel on military aircraft reservists in the retired reserve and not yet retired pay eligible generally age 60 are referred to as gray area retirees since they are in the retired reserve but not yet eligible for retired pay or retiree dical benefits time spent in the retired reserve counts for longevity purposes and u ltimately results in higher retired pay for example lieutenant colonel ltc who transitions to the retired reserve at age 45 will have their retired pay at age 60 calculated on the basic pay of lieutenant colonel with an additional 15 years of longevity the reservist will usually become eligible for retired pay at age 6020 and also then becomes eligible for military medical care the date the reservist became member of the armed forces determines whether their retired pay is calculated based on the final basic pay or high three system those entering before september 8 1980 w ill retire under the final basic pay system while those entering after septembe r 8 1980 will retire under the high three system the actual calculation parallels the active duty system but requires separate calculation for each individual for example reserve co mponent lieutenant colonel with

multiply the years of service by the 25 multiplier 1389 x 025 3472 using the final basic pay option the 2008 base pay for lieutenan t colonel with 20 years of service is 737280 per month multiply earlier sum by the base pay 3472 x 737280 to determine that the monthly retirem ent annuity will be 2560 per month disability retirement servicemembers determined to be unfit for continued service and who have permanent and stable disqualifying phy sical condition may qualify for disability retirement commonly referred to as chapter 61 retirement eligibility is based on having dod disability rating of 30 or gr eater and at least 6 months or more on active duty and the disability was not noted at the time of entrance on active duty21 as result some disability retirees are retired before becoming eligible for longevityretirement while others have complete d 20 or more years of service servicemember retired for disability may select one of two available options for calculating their monthly retired pay 22 1 longevity formula retired pay is computed by multiplying the years of service times 25 and then time s the pay base either fina l pay or high three as appropriate 2 disability formula retired pay is computed by multiplying the dod disability percentage by the pay base the maximum retired pay calculation under either formula cannot exceed 75 of basic pay23 retired pay computed under the disa bility formula is fully taxed unless the disability is the result of combatre lated injury retired pay under the longevity formula is taxable only to the extent that it exceeds what the individual would receive for combat related injury under the disability formula military retired pay and social security military personnel do not contribute porti on of their salary to help pay for retirement benefits however they have paid taxes into the social security trust fund since january 1 1957 and are entitled to full so cial security benefits based on their military service military retir ed pay and social security are not offset against each other military retirees receive full social s ecurity benefits in addition to their military retired payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34751crs10

the amount that the defense departme nt must contribute each year to cover future retirement costs is determined by an independent presidentially appointed partment of defense retir ement board of actuaries which decides how much is needed to cove r future retirement costs as percentage of military basic pay once milita ry personnel retire paymen ts to them are made not from the annual department of defense budget but from the accumulated amounts in the military retirement f und estimated future retiremen t costs are arrived at by making projections based on the past ra tes at which active duty military personnel stayed in the service until retirement and on assumptions regarding the overall us economy including interest rates in flation rates and military pay levels approximately 30 of military basic pay costs must be added to the dod personnel budget each fiscal year to cover the futu re retirement costs of those personnel who ultimately retire from the military dod budget authority and outlays in each fiscal year th at pay for the estimated cost of future retirees are transferred in paper transaction to military retirement fund located in the income security f unction of the federal budget the military retirement fund also receives paper tr ansfers from the general fund of the treasury to fund the initial unfunded liability of the military retirement system this is the total future cost of military retired pay that will result from military service performed prior to the implementation of accrual accounting in fy1985 money is disbursed from this military retirement f und to current retirees individual retirees receive their retired pay from the defens finance and accounting service dfas technically however because this money paid to individuals comes not from the dod budget but from the fund it is paid out of the income security function of the federal budget function actual payments to current retirees thus show up in the federal budget as outlays fro m the federal budget as whole not from dod under accrual accounting therefore total federal outlays for each fiscal year continue to reflect only costs of payments to military members who have already retired as was the case before accrual accounting began accrual accounting only changes the manner in which the federa l government accounts for milita ry retired pay it does not affect actual payments to individuals in any way unfunded liability current debates over both federal civilian and military retirement have included some discussion of the unfunded liability of both as noted above the military retirement systems unfunded lia bility consists of future retired pay costs incurred before the creation of the military re tirement fund in fy1985 these obligations are being liquidated by the payment to the fund each year of an amount from the general fund of the treasury and will be fully paid ba sed on current calculations by fy2033 the unfunded liability at th end of fy2003 was 6283 billion the estimated liability for fy2004 was 6483 billion for fy2005 6661 billion and for fy2006 6842 billion28 these figures are between 83 and 92 billion higher than the estimated unfunded liability for the same years at the end of fy2003 thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34751crs13 increase is due almost entirely to the enactment of concurrent receiptrelated retirement benefits since both combat related special compensation csrc and concurrent retirement and disability payments crdp are paid from the military retirement fund but fully funded by the treasury contribution some concerns have been voiced bout the amount of unfunded liability however 1 the hundreds of billions of do llars of unfunded liab ility is cumulative amount to be paid to retirees over the next 50 years not all at once 2 by the time some persons first become eligible fo r retired pay under the preaccrual accounting system many others will have died and 3 unlike the private sector there is way for employees to claim immediate payment of their future benefits an analogy would be that most homeown ers cannot afford to pay cas h for house so they get mortgage if the mortgage had to be paid in full almost homeowners could afford to do so however spread out ove r 30 years the payments are affordable similarly the unfunded liability of federal retirement progra ms is deemed affordable when federal retirement outlays are spread over many decades military retirement cost trends because military retirement is an entitle ment rather than discretionary program its costs to the total federal budget payments to current retirees and survivors have been rising modestly each year due to predictable slow rise in the number of retirees and survivors and cost of living increases the cost to dod estimated future retirement costs of current personnel declined after fy1989 the beginning of the postcold war drawdown as the size of the force and therefore the number of people who will retire from it in the future declined as the drawdown stabilized so did the dod budget costs of retirement table 4 indicates the costs of military retired

tenth quadrennial review of m ilitary compensation august 2 2005 reforming the military retirement system every four years the president is required by law29 to initiate comprehensive review of the military compensation system and to forward the review along with his recommendations to congress the most recent effort the 10th quadrennial review of military compensation qrmc30 was convened in au gust 2005 and submitted the final portion of its report in july 2008 one of the directed areas of assessment was the implications of changing expect ations of present nd potential members of the uniformed services relating to retirement31 number of previous studies have noted that the military retirement system should be more flexible equitable and efficient to accomplish this the qrmc suggested major revision of both the active and reserve retirement systems highlighted by 1 defined benefit plan similar to th current high three system but that would vest at 10 years of service and not be payable until age 60 for those who retired with less than 20 years of service or at age 57 for those with 20 or more years of service retirees could opt to recei ve the retirement annuity immediately upon retirement but the annuity would be re duced by 5 for each year under age 57 2combined with the above defined benefit plan would be defined contribution plan that would require the rvices to contribute up to 5 of annual base pay into retirement account for each servicemember th contribution would start at 2 for those with two years of service and increase incrementally until it reached 5 for those with five or more years of service this plan would also vest at 10 years of service but withdrawals could not begin until age 60 3 system of gate pays would be established at specified career points to retain selected personnel in specified skill areas 4 separation pay would be used to encourage personnel in over manned skills to separate prior to qualifying fo r normal 10 to 30 year retirement somewhat unique aspect of this retir ement proposal is that it would apply equally to active and reserv component members apparently recognizing that the reserves have transitioned from strategic reserve to an operational force to test the feasibility of this retirement option th qrmc recommends five or more year demonstration project that would use volunteers who would ultimately have the option of remaining in the demonstration or reverting to the current retirement system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34751crs15 while not stipulated it is assumed that personnel currently in the active and reserve components would be grandfathered and remain eligible to retire under the current system or until the new system is thoroughly tested and evaluated for implementation the qrmc did not address the disability retirement system in their review
