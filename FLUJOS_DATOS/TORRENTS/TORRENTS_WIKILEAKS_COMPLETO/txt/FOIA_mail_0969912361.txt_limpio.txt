from michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re date mon 25 sep 2000 160601 0400 cc tosbornueaacuk pjonesueaacuk srutherfordvirginiaedu hi keith et thanks for your message this sounds fine i do have to warn that with full teaching courseload this semester my own free time will necessarily be somewhat limited thus scotts involvement here will be key scott has been dealing w the new methodology and analyses and hence my concern w any plans that expect new analyses w our old methodology the code is not especially user friendly though tim is welcome to use it scott will be able to devote decent share of his time to these activities during tims visit though this will necessarily have to be split with time devoted to activities that scott is explicitly supported for by our noaa grant ie the development of synthetic proxy network from model data and waveletbased calibration methods as detailed in my previous email so im sure well be able to find common ground tim will have free access to our data and codes and can make the comparisons indicated below we of course appreciate your willingness to make available to us the tree ring density data it may be interesting to do highly preliminary analysis of both proxy datasets with our expectation maximization ridge regression scheme and that would certainly fit in well w both our agendas your nerc grant and our noaa grant hopefully our 4processor dell server running linux will be back up and running so scott can use our sun server while tim will have the dell server to himself if he needs it i hope the above all sounds good best regards mike at 1016 am 92500 0100 keith briffa wrote dear mike i know tim has communicated with you about plans for his visit to virginia we have discussed ideas here and i for one am excited about the prospects of joint work thank you for agreeing to his visit and for taking the trouble to arrange things the purpose of this brief message is simply to reiterate what we said in our brief discussions in venice namely that it is our intention to work with you rather than in any sense of competition our motivation for wanting to do some of the detailed comparisons between the results of our work and your own is to understand the sources of uncertainty in both we are also committed to doing some of this work by the terms of our current nerc grant we wish to involve you as much as possible get your advice and solicit criticisms of our approach especially in relation to the palaeomodel comparisons our ec proposal was not funded but we wish to follow it up with another to prescient nerc thematic programme of research along the same lines and again we would be happy to collaborate with you better two way communication between here and there would be major help it is my feeling that the relatively short time tim has with you might be best spent getting to grips with the finer details of your old and new approaches including the details and results of your other work that is only partly described in the publications seasonal runs different data sets etc and most importantly discussing approaches and philosophies for datamodel comparison work that way he could come away with some concrete plans and the means of fulfilling them on his return any time you can spare to discuss and liaise along these lines would be much appreciated he has discussed the specifics of your suggestions and i am happy with the approach and prioritization he has expressed while he is with you we can always exchange emails if any issues need wider discussion very best wishes keith dr keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj united kingdom phone 441603592090 fax 441603507784 _______________________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of virginia charlottesville va 22903 _______________________________________________________________________ email mannvirginiaedu phone 804 9247770 fax 804 9822137 httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannhtml
