ractors with 50 or more empl oyees and contracts in excess of 50000 to refrain from discr imination and to take affirm ative action with respect to the employment of racial and ethnic minorities women and religious adherents section 503 of the rehab ilitation act of 19732 as amended requires contractors to take affirmative action and make reasonable acco mmodations in hiring qualified individuals

and dvance in employment di sabled veterans and qualified veterans of the vietnam era3 the central premise of eo 11246 is that absent discrimination the racial gender and ethnic composition of contractors work force will come to reflect that of the qualified labor pool from which the contractor recruits and selects its employees4 accordingly contractors written affirmative action plan must include an analysis of the composition of its workforce in comparison to that of the relevant labor pools plan of action with appropriate goals and timetables to address underu tilization of minorities and women in the contractors workforce is another element the remainder of the plan outlines good faith affirmative action activities the contractor intends to take in order to meet its goals and timetables and to remedy any other ine qualities found to exist5 thus an acceptable plan includes provisions for outreach and positive recruitment of underutilized groups as well as internal and external procedures for communicating and acting upon the contractors commitment to equal employment opportunity including audit and reporting systems6 in the aftermath of hurricane katrina the invoked regulatory exemption to relieve contractors of the ob ligation to develop the affirm ative action program prepare the reports or provide the notices usually required by dol regulations under

and perhaps other proactive hiring and recruitment methods the memorandum indicated that federal contractors would remain subject to the ba sic antidiscrimination bans under those laws which presumably could continue to be forced by individual complaint or agency compliance review in addition according to of ccp director james covered contractors would continue to be subject to federal

originally the waiver and exemption were set to expire after three months but the memorandum made clear that th ey were subject to an exte nsion should special interests in the national interest so re quire accordingly opponents of the waiver argued that the memorandum amounted to an exemption of indefinite dura tion pertaining to range of contracting opportunities th full scope of which were neither defined nor explicitly limited by its terms it was uncertain for example how broadly or narrowly the agency considers covered contracts tered into to provide hurricane katrina relief and what categories of contracts were to be exempted or for how long in particular it was unclear whether the waiver and exemption related onl to contracts directly performed in the katrina destruction areas or could extend as well to proc urement of goods and services by fema or other agencies that aid the relief effort from offsite locations others argued however that given the ur gent demand for relief goods and services posed by the disaster and the possibly temporary or onetime nature of at least some contract procurements full compliance w ith all affirmative action planning and reporting requirements prescribed by departmental rules and regulations11 were not practicable in every case for example ve ndors supplying goods or services to the government whether by purchase order or formal written contract are apparently viewed as contractors for executive order purposes re gardless of duration of the transaction if other jurisdictional requirements are met12 on the other hand

relief activities and because smaller contractors ie those with less than 5000000 contracts or subcontracts or fewer than 50 employees are not subject to written affirmative action requirements the waiver and exemption would presumably not apply to them ultimately despite the fact that the waiver was subject to an extension s hould special interests in the national interest so require the exemption does not appear to have been extended beyond the initial threemonth period as result the written affirmative action requirements that were suspended for federal contract s in the wake of hurricane katrina appear to have been reinstated
