shsbc 83 routine 3d lecture given on 14 november 1961 thank you aw i didnt think youd be glad to see today after this bulletin change and so forth maybe it was mary sue you were glad to see is that right okay now the first talk on routine 3d and im going to go over the information letter with you which is undated because i typed it this is now complete except for commands now lets take up the history of clearing tremendously smooth interested job of auditing in the days when we didnt have rudiments could make clear tremendously smooth job of auditing that took up persons engrams that were quite visible that brought him into condition where he could see his pictures and where he could confront his track and that was long time ago very long time ago and only could do this now the world of psychiatry has never at any time or psychology believed otherwise than that i was quite practitioner what they dont like is that i wanted somebody else to be able to do it that was the unforgivable well it was not only an unforgivable it is almost an insurmountable problem it was actually something on the order of except for here and there here and there i suppose you could have counted them on the fingers of one hand an auditor isolatedly would make clear that was somewhere from 1940 well others auditing them from somewhere around 1950 to about 1958 wasnt that acc 58 all right now on that acc i did assessments based on dynamic assessment went down the line and working directly at circuits and machinery and so forth assessed that whole class we got something i dont remember how many were on that class i think there were about fiftyfive or something like that it was quite large size class in washington and we got fifteen people who went clear i didnt do any of the auditing all i did was some assessment on the thing now that was rather fabulous average but for the first time somebody else auditing had made clear that was the milestone there but remember i had done the assessments well time went on and trying to teach somebody how to assess trying to put into communication frankly the various factors trying to make them relayable had to bring any knowledge connected with this out of the realm of the intuitive where i was concerned into the realm of the cold mechanical part well expressed so that it would communicate now thats been the roughest part of this and trying to bring about condition in an auditor where through training and so forth his auditing was sufficiently smooth to keep the pc from balling up on arc breaks and other rudiments and so forth trying to develop technology which would teach and technology which would apply auditing has been very tough run but if you look at the actual number of years involved its not very long the first auditors i tried to teach was in 1949 that was before there was any foundation and they made dogs breakfast out of it you know i mean they really did and it began to dawn on that they werent doing something i was doing only this really didnt dawn on at all until 1955 when chap in the organization in phoenix had been watching audit on television and he made very interesting observation he says you know you acknowledge everything pc says and by george you know id never thought to remark it now it was that kind of differences so we had to get together and assemble all these parts what did constitute an auditing session see what did put this together now it wasnt that i was so wonderful it was the fact that i could do it this was something i could do and trying to find ways and means of getting somebody else to do it was quite interesting because i myself down through the years have enormously improved my own auditing i am not doing something and then teaching you to do what i am doing that is not whats been happening ive had to find the actual parts necessary to make auditing occur and then ive used them all myself as matter of fact my auditing right here at this instant is sort of shot its in very bad shape because ive been rewriting the end rudiments and when i do model session now i dont use the old model session i really havent learned the new model session and you havent even got it yet so thats sort of the way its been going i started this originally on the cchs i sat down and tried to do perfect tone 40 job to find out whether or not this could be done if it was doable and so forth and had to retrain myself to this new skill tone 40 job of auditing as done on the cchs and that was quite revelatory to because i found out with great personal reality for the first time that i could myself do these things with definite improvement of my own auditing in other words by knowing how to do these things my own auditing got better so as time went on we developed the model session of course the trs were developed the model session the other parts of auditing and frankly we were learning things about the emeter as short time ago as three months ago we were learning things about the emeter for instance the last thing which turned up about the emeter was instant read theres some possibility that something else could be learned about an emeter but i decided about june that we knew practically everything there was to know about an emeter and i wrote textbook which you have as emeter essentials and theres only one real datum in that missing and that datum is simply instant read versus latent read and thats all thats missing in that textbook now i learned lot about this meter in experimental runs and so forth but basically trying to teach people how to use the meter and it was unbelievably tough and to this day instructors do not believe what they see in people learning how to use an emeter and on the us courses instructors have developed mechanism of using of how to use the emeter which is kind of drill and they have an auditor and pc mockup session with the auditor actually asking the pc questions on the cans and then they have third student who stands back of the auditor and studies the reaction of the meter and an instructor is there and says what reaction was that and this is drill which is actually teaching people to use an emeter they apparently an enormous percentage of people in reading meter just dont ever see the needle move this is sort of buggy but it is fact and something that you should remember in teaching people to use the emeter now where you have an instrument of as precise character as the emeter and where you have thing as intricate as the human mind you have to have very skilled operator in order to carry something through as far as the meter is concerned the person really has to know what hes doing and although you could probably get away innocently in earlier years with sitting there watching the emeter wobble and being learned about it and not really knowing what it was saying or doing you had this as protective factor if you please there were technologies of sufficient bulldozer quality to actually plow somebody up the technology itself was not up to total massed battery sort of an action but today that is different now the technology which im about to go over with you here and which you as class are already using this technology this is wild stuff i mean it is definitely of high bulldozer quality you realize that if you miss in running routine 3 if you miss in running routine 3 you could practically bury the pc what you are using in essence is so strong and so heavy is so powerful that if you choose the wrong items on any one of this sequence of items and then audit the final result on the pc and then if you dont check the number of levels coming alive and dont find out youre wrong you can practically plow him under almost as surely as roosevelt plowed under pigs can practically wipe him out the bank becomes more solid any tone level the pc is in will get more and more so it wont relieve it just gets more so the pc feels little bit sad and the next thing you know the pc feels sadder not downscale sadder but more volume at that tone level and if you keep it up the pc feels much sadder and much much much much much sadder get the idea the whole case is becoming stronger on the aberrated manifestations of the case all right there are techniques now which we sought to classify as the relatively unskilled technique but what do you know routine 1 similarly can cause mess how the security checking if person does bad metering job and misses one security check question or one rudiment hes had it hes had it i mean that becomes dogs breakfast at once so routine 3 itself provided means by which you could quickly spot whether or not the pc was running right because if you got the goal and you got the terminal assessed it on the prehav scale and ran it for while and then went back to the prehav scale dont you see and checked it again well more levels were alive so youd better do something and it was wrong well that was all right as remedy but the truth is that the errors being made with it were far more gross than that one error run level only so long as the tone arm is moving well and as soon as you get the tone arm moving well you assess for new level and run that and let tell you if you do that to pc he feels like hes going crazy hes got two levels live simultaneously which is quite remarkable as mental sensation if you yourself have had that as mental sensation you know what im talking about and of course here youve been rounced off one process onto another and so forth and sometimes the other process wasnt flat and for day or so you feel zzzzzzz well its much worse than that if you grossly mishandle these things there is whole body of technology now lost in the yesterdays which could be applied by an auditor and we put that under class i type auditing and actually lot of that auditing is relegated to coaudit and some of you will as soon as you get the new coaudit processes on which i am working at this particular moment as soon as you get these new coaudit processes youll see what im talking about but old rising scale processing if you please is going to be run in coaudits by the veriest amateurs they just come in they sit down what is pc pc is policeman you know they dont know thing about it and here you have it that they can actually get away with rising scale processing its quite remarkable what they can get away with we will have whole body of skills there which are still meter proof pc proof and that wont overwhelm pc but what were dealing with right now when we moved into the zone and realm of clearing small percentage of people that is to say the technique was adequate for clearing small percentage of people we were on the edge of things which required only the greatest technical accuracy and when we have moved into routine 3d let assure you that you are not just on the edge of technical accuracy you had certainly better know your parts of auditing your emeter and the whole ruddy lot and anybody fool enough to permit himself to be audited on routine 3d by somebody who has to continually fumble with the directions and lets see what do i do now and so forth out in the public of course hes just trying to commit suicide i mean its at that level of magnitude because you have here body of technology which is actually stronger than the human mind the pc has chance of resisting the error thats something for you to think about in earlier days yes you could say well go ahead and audit anybody on anything you want to itll settle out in three to ten days see well weve moved into body at the same time that we start clearing broadly clearing any large percentage of the pcs who sit down in the pc chair as soon as we move into that we have of course moved into technology which in itself looks like massed bazookas and atomic rockets and so forth thats the way it looks to the fellow in the human mind in the first place hes sitting there insession the technology you have just about sessions and that sort of thing puts him insession willynilly he cant do anything else but to go into session if the auditor knows his business and then you go and run this there isnt any way he can say so the responsibility an auditor takes for the use of this particular routine is very great his responsibility however should not be on the basis of being cautious and trembling and chewing his fingernails and all that sort of thing his responsibility factor should be simply on the side of knowing his business feeling comfortable in session being able to conduct session in very efficient and effective way its relatively easy to do that today but it is something to do and therefore i adjure you when people ask you about routine 3 or clearing or shouldnt they use clearing you know and shouldnt they do this and shouldnt they do that i ask you for your support in telling them quite firmly quite firmly well when you are perfect class ii auditor when youre perfect as class ii auditor and when you have studied assessing very hard why yes but right now were thinking about you being perfect class ii auditor thats what were thinking about and if you can reach that classification youre fine practically any technology that existed from 1949 straight through to let us say 1955 1956 is total bait for class i auditor now if fellow wants to audit with training and sloppy and just do it any old way and so forth remember those techniques were designed in large degree to be mishandled but i want to impress upon you the fact that the techniques which were talking about at this moment even security check can go wrong you understand you can upset the living daylights out of pc by just misreading one question on security check from that point forward particularly through the clearing routines now we have passed into another world we have passed into world of high effectiveness and your auditing must be as effective as the techniques which you are administering and the techniques which you are administering are fantastically effective all right the birth of routine 3d came about on pressure basis because i could see very clearly that on lot of cases it was going to require another two months on what we were doing to round them up and i had to cut that down and ive been doing nothing since february of 1961 but cut down the amount of time necessary to audit case and increase the percentage of wins thats all ive been interested in and i had lot of this data in the background and when it became obvious to that having released the modifier and seeing what the modifier had been doing and how that had actually buried goals out of the way and made the student upset in you know in session you know its hidden thing that tells him to be upset so he goes on and hes upset and every time you audit the terminal why it kicks little bit harder and so on it takes long time to wear this thing out well i decided we didnt have time to wear it out and released the techniques about the modifier all right the discovery of the modifier was handed on to you very rapidly and you promptly took 1212 hours to find modifier i never dreamed it i considered that modifier would require thirty minutes you see theres this slight difference of estimate here almost everything that you complain about in scientology is based on that same error however you should understand it im not trying to hide the error my optimism is based entirely upon what i can do or what auditors can do who are auditing exactly what i tell them you know right under the gun and these are out as soon as that technique drifts out beyond this perimeter that i just named you see something else happens to it so we must take very good precautions that that doesnt happen to routine 3d youve got to be able to do routine 3d here and youve got to be able to do routine 3d anyplace you go and be able to do it well and with confidence so theres pressure on the training line youre feeling that pressure youre getting arc broke by being posted and if you study twice as hard as the highest student and get five times as many passes as you did last week if you get the fire company to lift you up on one of their ladders you will get into the failed category you know i mean this kind of super pressure thats why youre getting this pressure but lot of you are leaving here in the middle of december all right that gives something on the order of five auditing weeks im going to make the grade in five auditing weeks over my dead body or your dead body just so we dont make it over the top of any dead thetans so therefore i went to work on this promptly i studied all the folders involved and found out that here was twelve hours to find modifier and some of the modifiers werent even found and everybody was busy stumbling around about this well i first thought the best thing to do was just turn around and educate you thoroughly on the subject of dianetic bouncers callbacks denyers all that old technology haul it out of the grab bag and reeducate you into the thing and teach you how to use repeater technique on the pc to wear out phrases and all this sort of thing but thats not very advantageous is it so all of sudden i realized that the only reason modifier was there was because the goal was opposed ah well lets get modifier in an entirely different way lets take all of the parts that oppose the individual and get them first and then come back to the modifier and the thingll fall into your lap and at the same time youve got the opposition and youve got opposition goals and you have finally achieved the anatomy of the problem which is the goal of the pc he thinks of it as goal actually it is not it is problem it is his effort to do something opposed and those two have hung in balance one against the other for eons were not dealing now with problem that lasted since last tuesday were dealing with problem which has lasted probably the last hundred trillion years weve got the goal locked up against all accumulated opposition and theyre equally opposed one to the other and having that we then have the whole thing laid out before us as to why pc is hung up as he is hung up the data on prior confusion has unlocked number of doors on this that is why you dont have any commands yet laid out for this because there are some versions of command which i am checking out while you find these parts i know we can do it its just how fast can we do it that counts all right so i went ahead and worked out and tested this entire routine over one short weekend thats fantastic but it was tested straightened out taped and everything and at once into my lap fell the answers as to why only small percentage of people go clear and why in finding goal you have such difficulty keeping the rudiments in because of course the goal is opposed by an opposing idea and is susceptible to instant invalidation and so disappears like that and therefore we have the hardest part of routine 3 being the first part of routine 3d rather being the first part of routine 3d and its the same old part of routine 3 and they have missed missed missed missed missed throughout this year on doing goals assessment i have seen some of them just become endless ive seen people get up to thousand goals ill give you some idea of how much improvement has been along this line right here very well known instructor auditing pc i am looking at went through weeks and weeks of goals assessment and ran up to some astronomic number of goals and so forth just this last summer and with lot of experience under his belt that same instructor got the goal and terminal routine 3 style on pc in i think from what ive seen on the cable must have been weekend oh thats an improvement someplace it looks like weve found some of the missing parts already before we moved into 3d it looks like we found how we actually can do goals assessment we can do goals assessment by doing perfect model session perfect emetering and keeping the rudiments in in in in in if it gets as bad as doing five minutes worth of assessing and fifteen minutes worth of rudiments in thats the way youd have to do it but you can do it now it is doable action so in go the rudiments and there goes the goal and weve got it now the first part then of routine 3d is as difficult today as it ever was in routine 3 but the technology today of exactly how you find them although it hasnt changed we know exactly why they cant be found is the rudiments go out and its just that simple the rudiments go out so the goal cant be found and lot of you right here were into that rat race utterly unbelievable the south african acc i dont think it took us i dont i was around there scolding one day because we had several students i mean i think we were almost week deep in the course or something like that we had several students who didnt have terminals yet didnt seem to to be reasonable and poor peter and mary sue said well we apologized and got to work and they themselves then shoved the emeter down the pcs throat practically and straightened him up and got the goal and terminal on high duress basis poor peter goes back to australia from south africa and he sits down with great big class of people and nobody could find any goals and what had happened and right here this was happening we just werent able to find goals and then finally i sorted this whole thing out and came down to just one conclusion auditors were in sort of games condition with one another and it was all matter of rudiments if you kept the rudiment in thered be the goal and the goal usually appeared in the first 150 goals that the pc had given you and the terminal usually appeared in some similar number now you dont have to find the terminal now that way but that goal finding that first goal requires just that same amount of technology it requires that accuracy it requires the effectiveness and efficiency necessary to make the pc just sit there and deliver and you get the pcs goal now that is the toughest hump of routine 3d is finding the pcs goal and when youre over that hump you are on easy street because your next foremost action its unfortunate you see that we couldnt have it first you see why cant we have the opposition before we get the goal well maybe itd work out but i havent done any research in that particular line and i think all wed do is key the person in with thousand motivators is my first idea of it i know we can do this other and weve got this thing taped and that that goal is accurate our next immediate step is to find the opposition terminal now this explains great deal auditors floundering around here and there auditors looking for somebodys terminal have here and there assessed the opposition terminal as the pcs terminal very interesting and there was preventive for knowing that we really did have the pcs goal and not an opposition goal of some kind or another that has come up too the auditor has failed to say is that something you you know you you sitting there in that head is that something that you ever wanted to do has just neglected that little tiny part in doing the goals assessment assessing things the pc really wanted to do and not having met that part they put down just things that appear to the pc and the pc can have these implant goals and things like that appear to him you know and they just sort of appear out of the blue sky you know in front of their face they suddenly see this they get out of bed in the morning this actually happened get out of bed in the morning and they sort of see it printed on the ceiling so they know what it is not anything they really wanted to do its just something that occurred to them and of course somebody they come back and that naturally assesses as goal it assesses as goal because it simply assesses its all chocked in there one way or the other as part of some implant now you remember that in problems intensive which you all went through and i appreciate your cooperation on that because we really got that one whipped out and you know that central orgs are getting marvelous results with this thing right now theyre doing marvelously with it we were just looking over stacks of stuff upstairs up there and id say for something new brassy new in their hands to do this well with it was marvelous we notice you arent doing these thats because its merely keyout its short look it makes person happier it changes their profile it just does better than anything weve ever had but it doesnt clear them now if you noticed there selfdetermined change and dont run the problem were the two things that we learned at once when you started doing problems intensives selfdetermined change thats all you must list you mustnt ever list anything but selfdetermined change the person decided to change and thats all we want because if we take what changed your life the person gives us his appendectomy his tonsillectomy and so forth and of course they assess his engrams because they are engrams we want the highest powered change not the highest powered engram the person has and theyre making that mistake right out there in various parts of the world right this minute theyre assessing anything but the selfdetermined change so that mistake can be made on 3d too you can get list of things that the pc had never wanted to do but that the pc is simply upset about and then of course you dont get the pcs goal because it isnt on the list but this will occur to you as you go along and you will be fascinated with this in running 3d that the pcs goal the opposition terminal the opposition goal the pcs modifier the goals terminal which is the terminal for g plus m and the prehav level will all read exactly alike on their needle action they will all read exactly alike thats not necessarily true in patching up case hes got his goal almost gone on routine 3 weve got that almost out and all we need are the other parts you see to blow the thing completely well youll have the goal see going kind of tick you know very sick sort of tick you know and the original needle action of that particular goal was rock slam half dial wide you see so you get this little tiny tick on the goal i want to grow apple trees you see and you get this tick and then you find the opposition terminal to it which is termites or something and you get termites and you get half dial wide rock slam see its never been touched its sitting there virgin pong and you get this bluthubongbongbongbongbong and you get down and you get the opposition goal termites to gnaw to gnaw everyone something like that and you get this opposition goal and its going bang half dial wide you see crash crash crash its all registering like the original goal you see you get back in there you find the modifier and there that goal goes with very sick little tick see and we find the modifier and to never be audited right to grow apple trees and never be audited right and we get half dial wide rock slam on never to be audited right and for moment the goal just reads gorgeously its just the most gorgeous reads you ever saw and you say with huge sigh of relief you say well we finally got the goal back in and then we read the modifier and then we look back at the goal and its going with very sick tick then we go and try to find the rest of the parts and we try to assess something and we cant find rock slam anymore and we go back and theres sick tick left thats it we just blew the rest of the goal but there was that part of the goal lasting now this is why you heard few not too many days ago making crack i should never make crack at clears but i made crack id said well clear is first dynamic clear and you want to know why they act little bit selfcenteredly thats why do you realize that sitting on every one of those cases to clear up the rest of the dynamic although the needle is floating although the persons in perfect good shape and still stable is all the rest of these parts theyre still there on that case were pretty damn clever to get around them that far and have the person walking straight up but where the clear got cleared got perfectly free needle everything was gorgeous they were in wonderful shape and walked outside and the bank caved in on them what was it it was just the modifier or some other undisclosed part and then they didnt quite know what had happened well what does it take to straighten them out well just run them through 3d on each one of their goals and these things will go boom boom blow blow blow blow boom boom out out out out out out and theyll come up to dynamic clear but you got to go through all the steps of 3d with them whether you ever get chance to audit anything on them or not like on the prehav scale thats beside the point because there are just these little tag ends still hidden in the bank when you get those things out then they go up there now the reason ive used the word dynamic clear is simply to bring up that point not to make clears feel that theyre dynamic people just to bring up that one point yes clear will be clear on the first dynamic and can be cleared on the first dynamic and hell stay with free floating needle and be in bit of games condition on the remaining dynamics and that this is hardship on one and all the guy is now much more able to shoot you in the eye with skyrockets you see supposing the first goal that the clear had was to climb the eiffel tower and somebody ran that and they got mountaineer or something you see and they ran that and the rest of it and it cleared all the way through it and everything else still sitting there is the modifier at least you see which is to fire off skyrockets down at them and kill them all interesting thing to omit on case isnt it so you see where this is now you see about where were sitting but this is different type of clear that were making here because were trying to clear this person up on all dynamics and youll find as you go through that they will clear up on all dynamics that works out as an automaticity because you go back and start reaching for earlier earlier goals and all that sort of thing and youll start picking up the aberrations on the other dynamics and youll get them worked out these things will show up more rapidly all right so much for the background music on the thing your hardest point is finding the pcs goal and that must be done with very perfect auditing and it must be done with all rudiments in and the various laws of finding goals completely unchanged and oddly enough those same laws that govern the finding of goals govern the finding of every one of these parts so actually youre not doing anything new at all youre just using the same technology to find different part you learn the technology of finding goal of course you can always find the technology of finding an opposition terminal and so on theres two exceptions to that in here theres two exceptions is 1 the modifier doesnt come down to just one phrase youll find that two or three phrases may stay in the list and you do jigsaw puzzle with them and all of sudden theyre the modifier makes sense to the pc and clang youve got the modifier the next point that isnt quite exactly the same as your other assessment actions is that the pc the more you find the less the pc arc breaks so progressive discoveries on the assessment make an easier assessment each one in other words youre assessing more easily once youve got the center pin the goal to assess from there on youll find much more much simpler now but you just go on hammering and pounding these things out and you just do an assessment now all of you are getting some security on the subject of assessing i found out that you can assess that you do good job of assessment that youre occasionally knuckleheaded as hell but you can all overcome it and then you smarten up and everything straightens out and so forth but you arent having really hard job doing an assessment so i feel very secure in being able to teach that particular process and people to do it well you have some command of your trs and model session and reading the meter and know how to keep your rudiments in and know the activities connected with doing an exact assessment and you wont have any trouble with it those things known are resulting in rather easy discovery of goals now to get an opposition assessment is done the same way and to get your opposition goal well thats done the same way and to get your modifiers done the same way and to get terminal from the pcs goal terminal plus modifier is done the same way and your prehav scale is specialized type of assessment but its done just as it always has been done so although you may look at this as formidable new package of stuff oh my god what has he done to us now oh pages of it you know ive just shown you how you can cut about 80 percent of the charge about 80 percent of the charge off goal before you ever run it so the time invested on assessment is enormously beneficial because it subtracts something on the order of four or five to one off of the final runs in other words one hour spent on this 3d assessment is worth maybe five and may be worth much more in terms of hours on the final run so its all it all cuts your time back now assessment can be done rapidly assessment should not be done slowly and pokily and sticking your feet in the mud and so forth assessment is something could be done one right after the other bang if you just really know that pc will read if pcs rudiments are in and you say it your instant read occurs after youve said whatever the items is that youre checking the instant read occurs bang right there and you dont have to sit around and wait for it and the pc doesnt have to say anything and your rudiments stay in you know you can just do an assessment on almost machine gun basis its the fastest thing you ever cared to look at doing an assessment so these assessments are backed up by the fact that at first it may look to you because it takes so long it takes maybe twelve twentyfive hours to find pcs goal then the remainder of this may look to you as being equally lengthy but it isnt equally lengthy and the more assessments you do the shorter length of time it does so now the assessment becomes this important and so forth well we can analyze and break it down and teach you to do assessments on brrrrrrt basis you see as matter of fact i wrote most of you notes in your pcs folders on how to do rapid assessment aw i can just state those very briefly right now just bang 1 get your rudiments in 2 i dont care if you have list already in existence before the session began or you have list at all whatever list you were working with or obtain you then of course you dont have to attain list on an emeter youre just saying well what would and so forth well dont bother dont necessarily make him lay down the cans but youre not paying any attention to the emeter you just write the list down you know cats kings coal heavers you know just bang bang bang bang write it down number them bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang you dont have to read anything and you can note tone arm occasionally and find out if tone arm is wobbling but thats just crosscheck if youre on the right track you got to get little tone arm motion while the persons assessing all right and you bleed that list down with the meter sensitivity cranked all the way up to the top and you ask some very pertinent question like are there any more terminals that you feel would oppose growing apple trees and remember that growing apple trees is going to react on the meter so youve got to be smart enough to get your reading off are there any more terminals instant read after this there arent any more and that is it you see you bleed that meter down and you add without argument anything the pc wants to put on the cottonpicking list chinchin about it halfway through the assessment and read off the pc all of sudden says ooooh oooooh coal heaver oh yes yes we were looking for heavy men who handle shovels coal heaver i just had this terrific cognition yes coal heaver well dont shut him up its just youre halfway through the assessment there are two schools of thought on this either one is right add it to the bottom of the list to be checked later or add it right under what you were just adding but of course it goes out of number if you add it right on after what youre just assessing but the more stylized one the more perfect one is to write it down at the bottom of the list and give it number thats all as much as that its those he adds on anything he wants to add on any time let him add it to anything we dont care what it is and we dont care when he wants us to add it in were halfway through rudiments and he thinks of another goal well write the goal down and go on with what youre doing there you see never argue with pc as to whats going to be written down theres another preventer in here about this by the way if the pc in giving you quote goals unquote is only giving you difficulties to get rid of my lumbago to get rid of my skull to get rid of my stomach to get over this terrible feeling that every time i see cat its going to jump through my right ear and out through my left ear and so forth all right write them down by all means write them down but write them down on processing goal list the pc wont object to this you say well all right thats you write it down processing goal you say were interested in goals in life and livingness you know look at all these difficulties there we are in processing see and so on we write that down when we come to audit well take that up the pc is perfectly happy about it as long as you write it down the only thing pc blows up about is you just wont accept his goal so if you have to split it out here with five lists finally because amongst the opposition terminals hes given you is all the friends he has and all the enemies he has and its just total confused mishmash and so forth well write it all down but not necessarily on the opposition terminal list thats good rule see because it keeps the pc from getting busted up arc broke see all right the next thing you do is you get that list complete so that theres additional falls on it now one of the ways of completing goals list of course and standard way the standard way of completing goals list is to add secret goals withheld goals antisocial goals unworthy goals discreditable goals that sort of thing you know youre used to asking for all those things well now remember that on these other parts we also have unworthy things and discreditable things that the pc doesnt want to have there person says well heres this list and theres five yeah theres five opposition terminals five opposition terminals huh early in the case five opposition terminals oh you ask him any more terminals that would oppose this goal and so on actually you dont get much of fall on the meter either you have to ask for unworthy opponents or opponents it would be unworthy to oppose and opponents that would be discreditable to fight huhuhuhu you find this hulking brute of man has as his opposition terminal baby he very possibly will never come up with it and tell it to you because its just not worthwhile you get some fellow whos very upset on the subject of wives because he kept burying them and shoving them into vaults where other people were already buried and that sort of thing well wife isnt proper opposition terminal see but it is and youve got to point it out by asking unworthy discreditable so forth goals so you shake all these things down on that type of nomenclature in other words you dont only get your antisocial goals you see sort of thing as the additional type you see you get the unworthy or discreditable opposition terminal you dont get an antisocial opposition terminal because the pc will tell you theyre all antisocial ministers everybody knows that theyre the most antisocial people alive and so forth theyre all antisocial terminals to the pc you see so that youre wasting your time asking for an antisocial opposition terminal thats silly theyre all antisocial to some degree or another theyre destructive let put it that way now we come down the line here and we find the opposition terminals the pc lists or goal or any other type of assessment weve got to get the list complete weve got to make sure that theres nothing hes dodging weve got to use any kind of wording necessary to make sure that he has understood exactly what we are doing and what we exactly want and we watch the meter and we make sure that that whole list is bled that meter is just bled of any reaction on the subject of another terminal we want the instant read on another terminal not on repetition of the goal thats about the only thing thats going to get in the road of somebody of course every time you say the pcs goal you get reaction on the needle every time you say the pcs modifier youre going to get reaction on the needle well dont get it all mixed up with what youre asking for learn to ask for what you want you say now on this goal to grow apple trees of course youre going to get reaction its perfectly all right for you to say that dont you see now on this goal to grow apple trees is there anybody else who would oppose it bang well who was that see well of course that oppose apple trees let us say had little rock slam and when you say now on this goal to oppose apple trees and youre liable to get little rock slam there you see because every time you repeat the goal you get reaction on the needle you know that so you dont pay any attention to that and you just say are there any more terminals that would oppose it oh pang see you get your instant read on the question you want learn to read meter instantly on the basis of what you want to know and you learn to stress the word that you want to know and get your reading only on those words if youre very clever you can actually read meter this way now what would oppose wanting to grow apple trees well you know darn well youre going to get rock slam on wanting to grow apple trees but right there what would oppose you get your instant read right there see actually take an interim middle of the sentence read what would oppose wanting to grow apple trees of course youre going to get rock slam over here as soon as you say want to get apple trees see naturally but you just take your read right out of the middle of the sentence you see how clever you can get on that all right now having completed your list utterly you get the rudiments in and while completing the list if the pc is upset you get your rudiments in but you certainly get your rudiments in at sensitivity 16 cranked way up and you really get those rudiments in bang and then you take the thing down to one dial drop because thats all youd want for an assessment its too crazy trying to assess with your sensitivity knob too high oh man its just all over the place particularly if some guys had lot of auditing you know his needles very loose anyhow at zero its one dial drop what do you think it will read like what do you think mine reads like every now and then i mean somebodyll turn it up here to sensitivity 16 and i breathe you know breaks the pin on both sides you cant read it see so you want one dial drop if you can possibly manage to get that and then with one dial drop you take your long feathered plumed pen in hand nib already sharpened youll more delays there see and you go straight down the list you say now were going to assess this list or you can say is it all right with you if we assess this list and you go right down the list and you read three times bang bang bang now i found out that it doesnt much matter whether you read and acknowledge and read and acknowledge and read and acknowledge or read read read and acknowledge it doesnt much matter which one you do but in view of the fact that with technical perfection each one is theoretical question see even though you have just said the terminal you have theoretically asked the pc question like is this it see only you havent said is this it youve just said the item but theoretically that registers as is this it see is apple tree it you know and i suppose with total perfection you could lay it down as bit of rule that every time you said one you acknowledged the pc and then nobodys going to get mixed up all right and you just say it and acknowledge say it and acknowledge say it and acknowledge just about that fast soldier soldier soldier see would be the spacings necessary to read it so if you fill the interim in with the acknowledgment it sounds like one straight line you say soldier thank you soldier thank you soldier thank you it doesnt sound like theres any pause there but of course thank you is not going to get reaction but soldier is so the instant read is going into your acknowledgment now you read all of these things off while looking at the meter now total perfection requires that you lift your eyes from the meter to the pc when you give the acknowledgment but factually speaking to the pc to really know whether or not hes being acknowledged you would have to be in the action of lifting your eyes while you were saying ank in order to have caught the instant read before you did so in other words dont go so goofy on this one that you miss your instant reads just to be looking at the pc you got it when you get this real down pat youll flick your eyes at the pc or lift your head and say thank you to the pc directly every time see even though youre picking it up on the meter youre saying it to the pc now the funny part of it is is the pc your eyes arent necessarily necessary in order to convey the thank you to the pc and its not really necessary to go through lot of gymnastics on this sort of thing im just trying to lay it down so you get picture of how it looks if you can get three repeats of the item in thorough acknowledgment to the pc and tell the pc whether it is still in or is now out and go on to the next one and do the same thing without entering into chitchat oddities or anything else or discussion with the pc and with time being lost in the middle i will be very happy with you if you can get that far ill be very happy with you what does that look and sound like it sounds like something on this order soldier soldier soldier thank you thats still in woman woman woman thank you thats out george george george thank you still in now i can assess faster than that if you run it that fast youve got it made in the shade now you tell the pc at the beginning you dont have to say anything the pc can just sit there in the most gorgeous state of irresponsibility as mary sue raised it less elegantly once and the whole assessments perfectly accurate pc doesnt have to say anything pc in the middle of your saying soldier soldier pc says i just thought of another one gargantua well thats all right thats fine good you got another one write it down here on the end of the list and go back and say all right thank you soldier soldier soldier thank you still in got the idea now you get assessing down to this type of basis and youre not doing twenty questions session youre doing something on the order of hundred an hour that sounds little bit different in the same lick of speed well all right as long as were going to do this much assessing we might as well learn the most optimum swift accurate method of assessment now why only three times well frankly if you go over the list more often you will find out that the number of times youve had to repeat is lessened going over the whole list and coming back to the beginning again scrubs more terminals than going or goals or items than trying to scrub one out eight or nine times apiece we had slightly different system we used earlier if after three times it seemed like it was staying in we went ahead and scrubbed it out for an actual test this isnt necessarily useful you just give it three times its still in and go on to the next one yes itll leave an awful lot of marks down the line that apparently are still in and still live but youd be surprised how many of those will disappear on the next pass over because in going over the list you havent permitted then the pc to sink back on the track the pc is still with you and the pc is still is asising more rapidly because the pc hasnt been driven into point of the track and restimulating chronic somatics and that sort of thing which was liability to the other type of assessing is avoided you never repeat him back into the middle of the operation and then try to go on to the next level huhuhu try that sometime tonsillectomy tonsillectomy what did the doctor say during the tonsillectomy hold still all right hold still hold still hold still hold still hold still hold still hold still hold still hold still it isnt it it isnt out yet hold still hold still hold still hold still ho well it finally disappeared all right hold still yeah its not there now all right now were going on to the next item on this particular list and the pcs sitting there you know you can repeat him right back into the incident so once thrice over lightly youll find holds good now theres something else that id call your attention thereto that its an equality i dont care if you speak these things forcefully lightly or otherwise as long as they reach the pc with clarity if you vary from terminal to terminal or item to item your volume and expression youll throw the assessment somewhat you have decided for instance its gargantua you see and you get down you say apple tree apple tree apple tree well thats out gargantua gargantua gargantua well thats certainly in all right well well come back to that gargantua later because that looks awfully hot and on an exaggerated basis you can throw an assessment by doing just that now youre as you tear down the line you get this item this is your next step in assessing you get the item whatever it is isolated its the only one left in thats reacting now get your rudiments in at sensitivity 16 and check it against the dead items that youve already killed you just read three or four at random off the list and read this item and three or four at random off the list and read this item you found you see the found item and read three or four more nulls off the list and youll find this found item dont be too surprised if theres slight kick still left in some of the things that you thought were null because the funny thing is as you balance the whole terminal line out some things will fall out and then momentarily fall back in dont worry about that if it does that just start worrying about it if what you found falls out its somewhere else its something else if something starts going in and out on you that way because they hold it all right now having found the thing and checked the thing you now check another point let us say its the third item youve found here you realize now youve got to say the goal and note its reaction the opposition terminal and note its reaction and lets say you were working on the modifier or the opposition goal and say the opposition goal and now youll find out that if one did kind of stage four piece of nonsense then the next onell do the same piece of nonsense and the next one will do the same piece of nonsense and the whole assessment will fall exactly alike its quite interesting but the whole assessment every item on the assessment will fall alike now that is not final test you should not throw everything away just because this doesnt happen because it is not final test you get your arc up and get the roughness off the session and they will all fall alike but sometimes roughness at some part of session will cause one to go little bit zzzzz and youll notice this what you want to worry about is that the opposition terminal is different than the goal and all the rest of the list well but the goal youre getting the prehav that falls the same as the goal and youre getting the goal plus modifier terminal that falls the same as the goal and everything falls the same as the goal but the opposition terminal if you check it over you find out that the pc himself got an arc break along about that time and hes kind of hung up and its half pushed out the second you straighten out this could come back right in and read the same as everything else you see without changing it so you see other things than wrong assessment can make these things go little bit haywire but when youve got everything straightened out and all rudiments completely in and all roughness off assessment and any upsets and so forth off they all actually ought to read alike its just complete parade thats perfect textbook solution is the goal and the opposition terminal and the opposition goal and the pcs goal modifier and the pcs goal terminal and the first level of the prehav assessed its just bunch of little martinet soldiers they all read eebong pingpong they all do exactly the same read on the meter they all make the needle do exactly the same thing why theyre all part of the same package theyre all locked up together if one of them is terribly different its not part of the same package now what you want to be aware of in that last checkout is that your goal assesses fine and then your opposition terminal assesses the same as the goal and then the opposition goal doesnt assess the same and the modifier doesnt assess the same and the goals plus modifier terminal doesnt assess the same the prehav level assesses so whats this well it means that where they started assessing differently you got the wrong one its the first one that has the different reaction and the safest thing to do is to go back and do the whole thing from the point where it doesnt get the same reaction because they will go further and further out from the wrong one see you wind up nowhere and that is one of the preventions this checkout is one of the preventions from running wrong goal or something like that its prevention it doesnt so much prevent running the wrong goal but it certainly prevents running the rest of it if you cant get anything to agree with anything on the whole case youd better do another goals assessment and make sure you had the right goal in the first place because thats the one thatll be out nothing falls with it now when youre doing this crosschecking invalidation is one of the grimmest things that you can do but next to that is suggesting and just never suggest anything to pc please dont dont its gotten more and more important that we didnt ever suggest anything to the pc we can have all our own opinions we want to we can talk these things over with the pc but we must never suggest anything to the pc just nothing never suggest thing the pc says well dont you think maybe that to dont you think maybe uh ducklings would be very good opposition on this duckling can you think of something like ducklings and you say youre getting there what is it hahahahaha give him encouragement always give him encouragement never give him any suggestions because you could do yourself more throat cutting and you could mess yourself up more by suggesting an item or two or even seeming to for the pc than any other single way you can do it unless of course its permitting the pc to sell you an item the pc is fond of if you dont think people learn to do this early nineyearold the other day was able to sell wrong goal and wrong terminal to an experienced auditor isnt that fascinating nineyearold pc sold wrong goal and wrong terminal to an experienced auditor sold them they were just wildly out but the nineyearold decided that would be nice goal to have and that would be nice terminal to have so every time came past it had little tiny physical convulsion that threw the meter so next first theres invalidation thats just out we dont even pay this couldnt happen and then theres suggesting things to the pc thats nice big crime and then theres this next crime is buying things the pc is selling were using sell in the category of having body convulsion twitching the little finger suddenly finding out that they can get registry if they suddenly pull their skin tight across their face suddenly well every time you hit that terminal it makes pull this surface across my face you see and of course the emeter will get reaction you say well were going to check that out without you doing that oh but its impossible it always does that you say well it may be impossible but just look around the room for moment now look at the ceiling now look at the floor now look at this now look at that bingo that was the terminal see bingo the person will say belatedly you know ah he missed wasnt able to make it that time little bit late its real stupid auditor that will buy sell of this character thats real stupid because everything then will go out and nothing will check now its an awfully good thing that when youve found part to get it checked by somebody as you get more experienced find package and get it checked by somebody all right now i should tell you perhaps few words on what all these things are but you will find them defined in this unnumbered bulletin youll find them all defined at the back of the stuff of what all these things are and so forth and i dont think i would do you any too much good giving you any more data than you have right in this first page 4 routine 3d i think thats quite adequate to the definitions which are on that but let tell you something the whole theory of it is simply this its very easy to sum up its theory observation the pcs goals are so easily invalidated they disappear and cant be assessed all right now thats an observation now youve got good reality on that one all right whats making this happen it isnt because the auditors mean because i know you youre not mean few trillenia ago when you were making specialty out of burning young girls you had some aberrations alive then but youve recovered from it youre not that mean anymore how come how come this is so uniform well it obviously must be that the thing has an opposition built into it that is easily triggered well what is it there must be part in there someplace and then how come this goal now that weve learned problems will last forever on the track because theyre postulate counterpostulate and therefore become timeless what is this goal if it is timeless which it obviously is what is it but postulate counterpostulate terminal counterterminal situation that must be what goal is and the goal is the little tag that is visible but there must be some other parts of it which are missing which is what opposes the goal how come its hung up in the mind you see if you know the anatomy of problems you know the fellow has goal he wants to get something done and its right there as one little package and so forth well youre crediting this fellow with the extraordinary ability to hold onto this determinism without some mechanical assistance for the last sixteen trillenia you know i mean there it is whats it up against anything nothing theres nothing out in front of it at all theres nothing out in front of this goal to hold it there does that seem reasonable it isnt reasonable at all and by george there is something out in front of the goal all right so its package which composed of the pcs goal is quite visible because thats usually even though its to be firstclass prostitute or something its quite socially acceptable human beings would recognize this as goal see its something that can be remarked on you could mention that and thats all thats in view well thats all thats available really oh yes well i wanted to be wanted to be big boy when i was young quite socially acceptable isnt it of course when we get the parts we find it wasnt quite so socially acceptable but so far so good weve got to be big boy all right whats this opposed against well its opposed against an idea but let tell you that the idea is i think more difficult to find than the terminal its easier to find the terminal and then find the idea than it is to find the idea and then the terminal the most available thing there is the terminal so we find the opposition terminal to the goal ah but its an opposition terminal to the goal see were finding it crisscrossed see so heres this thing to be big boy well who would oppose your being big boy not necessarily this is kind of poor nomenclature poor to keep using your goal and phrases of this kind where youre asking the person why not just ask the person well you found his goal its not going to wear out so you repeat it five thousand more times and it does wear out well that just clears him that much faster so go ahead and use these parts go ahead and use them in your phraseology after youve found them and you say who would oppose your being big boy bigger boys uh cats um fathers mothers here we go on down the list you see who would oppose your being big boy you know and we get something pretty wild that fits exactly what the case is and what would oppose his being big boy naturally is machinery thats what he says and thats what it assesses out and it rocks the same as to be big boy and heres machinery haha good weve got the opposition terminal now lets find the opposition goal all right what would be the idea of machinery now we get lot of things well the idea of machinery is to run wild and to make dog biscuits and its ideas and so forth and well what would what idea would it have there of opposing your goal to be big boy i mean what idea would it have that would oppose your being big boy and so forth well huh well as matter of fact thats cutting people to pieces yeah well theres that one and then theres running wild and theres doing this and theres doing that we assess it out and its to cut people to pieces ah well were getting very interested here all right now weve got machine and weve got its goal weve got the goal of the machine that isnt really the goal of the machinery at all its the goal that the pc thinks the machinery must have that directly opposes him so so far weve got the pcs goal weve got the opposition terminal and now we got the opposition goal is to cut people to pieces all right dandy now weve got to find the pcs goal modifier and this was completely out of sight up to this time but weve done all this assessment work so actually weve eased up the weight of the invalidation just by bringing it to view see so now the modifier should show up far more easily because before we were going through tough route to find it all right well weve taken some weight off of this thing now so the pcs goal modifier is to be big boy or go up in smoke trying and never come down again well thats great thats great thats just fine now lets find what is the pcs goal plus modifier now we want to know who or what would want to be big boy who would go up in smoke trying and never come down again go up in smoke trying and never come down again would be rocket operator yeah and itd be horse jockey and cat whisker and lion tamer see and we get down the line but all of sudden we come back and its rocket operator its rocket operator all right thats what weve got and there it is rocket operator weve got it right there and thats our goals terminal youll find out the further you go on the assessment the plainer the part gets but out of this to be big boy it sort of looked like we had school days charm everything was wonderful going to be sweetness and light isnt it cute you see and we get machinery and the machinerys going to cut you to pieces and so forth and it starts looking peculiar doesnt it and naturally all of this is directing us straight in toward the goals assessment and frankly if you can do an expert job of assessment drdrrrrrr tatattatatattatatattata just sit there get the rudiments in get the thing get the list written get the rudiments in assess the list brrrrrrrrrrr and on down the line youre going to find out that after youve got the first goal that finding the rest of the thing is just leadpipe cinch it all depends on how many times you say ah how many times you say er how many times you sigh and how much space you leave between items and thats all it amounts to because nobodys going to say that you must put the rudiments in rapidly dont think that is necessary i say put the rudiments in effectively if it takes you awhile to get in rudiments all right so it takes you while to get in rudiments nobodys going to argue with you about putting in rudiments or time consumed thereon but i am going to argue with you about soldier or rocket operator mmmmm how do you feel about that hmmm meters little bit out of adjustment here yeah all right well here we go here it is again rocket operator hm yeah mmhm rocket operator well okay that still seems to be in of course its not doing anything in the world but falling on an arc break by this time now i want you to be able to say rocket operator rocket operator rocket operator thank you still in soldier soldier soldier get the idea and boy can you chew up lists you would just be fascinated then your assessment is simply boiled down to the speed you can write because thats the lengthiest activity would just be the activity necessary in simply writing down the terminals which are given nobodys going to say that this is school in penmanship and we teach you how to write fast just get over all those times you wrote the billetdoux to the wrong mans wife and get over those times when you signed those warrants for execution and youll find out your ss goes up terrifically speed just goes right up all right now im going to have to give you more talks on this because we have the whole subject of commands and so forth to go into but so far as youre concerned the reason you find all these parts is to make it easier to find in each case the next part with greater accuracy now thats reason enough for you to find all of the parts strangely enough and later on after youve run the first terminal or so you know off the prehav scale and youre on to your next goals assessment youre going to find youre going to have to get to the prehav scale and run that one probably and then your next one and all of sudden just the finding of these parts goes in sort of an endless circle you find the parts you find goal and you get it down the line as far as you can get it and go back and check it and it all fits and what this basically is best at this particular thing besides making things easier is that it gives you the consecutive release of goals occurs much more rapidly so theres of course enormous amounts of time saved toward the end of clearing this hasnt either that too much to do with it youre going to clear lot more people in this particular way now how are you going to miss clearing people youre going to miss clearing people by doing bad technical job or by not auditing them or by not taking enough time with somebody to find all the parts correctly and so forth and putting it all together and hanging the thing right thats about what the thing amounts to and we already know that if you find the goal and if you find the terminal that matches that goal and it doesnt beef up the prehav scale and you run that on many levels of the prehav scale and it goes down down and disappears out of sight and that lot of people go clear on this if its done enough and if it was accurately enough done in the first place but theres nothing that guarantees the accuracy of the first job there is nothing that takes care of lot of little missing odds and ends of parts the pc stays very remains very hard to keep insession to marked degree and so you get small percentage of people going clear on that particular procedure now this one youve got all the parts that could make any difference to the thing exactly how you speed it up from there depends entirely on the form of the command and if anything can be done with speeding up the actual commands we could just go on and run these terminals as found on the prehav scale and all would be lovely we could go ahead and clear that way and im trying to find out right now if there isnt faster way to beef up that particular formation of commands than weve had to speed it up even more because it now lies in the lap of effective commands the more effective the command is well the faster clearing will occur okay all right well youve got the package there im sorry to dump it on your lap so unannouncedly but i would say after looking it over last night that most of you had weathered the storm very very well and you are to be congratulated on it you recognize that some of the goals are quite null and its going to take little while to finish off that particular goal but itll finish off more or less by assessment and then youll be out in the clear and onto new level actually some of you dont realize it but youre very very close to the point of having the first goalterminal combination flat right this moment so youre starting in with routine 3d the hard way very short way but its the hard way because youll be puzzled why things are disappearing and appearing and so forth and later on when good solidly aberrated case comes along why you will see it work much more smoothly than its working right at this moment so i dont think theres any lack of supply of that type of case just at the moment so thats fine all right thank you very much and i wish you lots of luck with it audience thank you ron
