extent of income inequality is debated periodically one rarely discussed aspect of inequality is its impact on the tax system given the nature of the us federal tax system changes in the distribution of income can have si gnificant implications for who pays the taxes how much they pay and federal tax revenues one common measure to characterize inequality or the dispersion of income is the gini coefficient which varies from 0 to 1 gini coefficient of 0 indicates that income is evenly distributed among the population that is everyone has the same income while value of 1 indicates perfect income inequality that is one individual has all the income between 1980 and 2004 the gini coefficient for household income increased from 0403 to 0466a 156 increase the gini coefficient for earnings increased by 224 from 0331 in 1980 to 0405 by 2004 inequality has therefore increased over the past 25 years the two major sources of federal tax revenues are the individual income tax and the social security payroll tax accounting for almost 80 of total federal tax revenue these two taxes have different tax bases tax rates and adjustments to income furthermore the individual income tax system consists of the regular income tax and the parallel alternative minimum tax amt which have different tax bases and tax rates consequently changes in income and earnings inequality could have very different effects on different parts of the federal tax system many of the parameters of the regular income tax are indexed to inflation nevertheless with income growing faster than prices and with rising income inequality more income falls into higher tax brackets individual income tax re venues as percentage of gdp however do not appear to be associated with rising inequality because the income tax has become less progressive through legislative changes as inequality has increased the parameters of the amt however are not indexed at all consequently the amount of income and the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will increase dramatically over time because of income growth and rising income inequality in the absence of legislative changes the actual increase in amt taxpayers has been limited because of series of enacted temporary patches although the maximum taxable limit of the payroll tax is indexed for average earnings growth rising earnings inequality has pushed more and more of covered earnings above the limit thus the proportion of covered earnings that is taxable has fallen over the past 25 years this report will not be updated

interest sometimes picks up at election time with flurry of newspaper and magazine articles and opinion pieces after the election the issue often disappears from the public consciousness while the extent of income inequality and income growth is debated periodically one rarely discussed aspect of inequality is its impact on the tax system arguments are offered for and against reducing income inequality the classic argument against rising income inequality is the rich get richer and the poor get poorer this can increase poverty reduce wellbeing and reduce social cohesion consequently many argue that reducing income inequality may reduce various social ills in contrast there are those arguing that rising inequality is nothing to worry about and point out that average real income has been rising so while the rich are getting richer the poor are not necessarily getting poorer in addition many argue that some income inequality is necessary to encourage innovation and entrepreneurshipthe possibility of large rewards and high income are incentives to bear the risks of innovation and entrepreneurship therefore they assert the economic costs of reducing or eliminating income inequality may be high some researchers are concerned about the consequences of rising income inequality research has demonstrated that large income and class disparities adversely affect health and economic wellbeing michael marmot has studied health and social status disparities concluding that health follows social gradientpeople higher in the social hierarchy tend to be in better health than people of lower status 1 richard wilkinson provides evidence that high income inequality large income disparitiesand less social cohesion have negative impact on the health of countrys citizens2 robert frank argues that even if all incomes are increasing and rising inequality is due solely to those at the top of the income distribution pulling away from the rest the middle class can be hurt by the pressure to keep up with the upper class 3 several factors have been identified as possibly contributing to increasing income inequality some researchers have suggested the decline in unionization and falling real minimum wage as the primary causes4 others have argued that rising returns to education and skillbiased technological change are the important factors explaining rising inequality5 tax policy especially the tax reform act of 1986 has also been identified as possible cause for rising income inequality6 most analysts agree that the likely explanation for rising income inequality is due to 1 michael marmot the status syndrome how social standing affects our health and longevity new york henry holt and co 2004 2 richard g wilkinson unhealthy societies the afflictions

and norms of which falling minimum wage and declining unionization are part7 research suggests that tax policy while possibly having shortterm effects on inequality does not have much impact on longerterm inequality trends8 given the nature of the us federal tax system changes in the distribution of income can have significant implications for who pays the taxes how much they pay and federal tax revenues furthermore the tax system is one policy instrument used to change the distribution of economic wellbeing which requires an understanding of how inequality affects the various components of the tax system and how the various components interact with each other this report examines how income inequality interacts with the parameters of the us tax system the longterm trend in inequality and how this may be related to taxable income and tax revenues is examined in addition the implications of rising inequality for tax policy are investigated through illustrative tables

between 1980 and 2004 the gini coefficient for household income increased from 0403 to 0466a 156 increase see the top solid line in figure 1 for the most part the gini coefficient increased in each year the earnings of fulltime yearround workers also increased between 1980 and 2004 although earnings inequality is lower than household income inequality the dashed line in figure 1 is below the solid line the gini coefficient for earnings increased by 224 from 0331 in 1980 to 0405 by 2004 earlier research shows that the gini coefficient was fairly steady in the 1970s and sharply increased beginning in 19809 summary measures of inequality such as the gini coefficient while useful in capturing overall changes in inequality are less useful in locating where in the income distribution the changes are occurring consequently more detailed information is required changes in the distribution of household income and earnings are examined separately

percentile the increase in household income inequality between 1980 and 2004 thus arguably appears to be due to those at the top of the income distribution pulling away from the households lowe r down

percentile increased by 15 over the 25year period while agi at the 995th percentile increased by 75 over this period the evidence from figure 2 and figure 3 shows that the steady increase in income inequality since 1980 was due primarily to large income gains at the top of the continued realized capital gains are not annual income flow and are very volatile with large variations from year to year capital gains are not considered in this analysis 12 adjusted gross income includes income potentially subject to tax it includes wages salaries tips dividends business income and income from some government programs unemployment insurance and some social security benefits benefits from other government programs such as temporary assistance to needy families and supplemental security income are not included in agi the unit of observation for tax data is the taxpayer rather than the household there may be more than one taxpayer in household

distribution pulling away from those lower down in the distribution see figure 4 for the trend for men and figure 5 for the trend for women while earnings inequality increased for both men and women there are differences in how inequality increased between the sexes on the one hand for men those at the top of the distribution pulled away from largely static median and 10th percentile the 90th

tax credit since 1984 personal exemptions the standard deduction and the tax brackets have been indexed to inflation although they have also been periodically changed by legislation the ratio of taxable income to agi has fluctuated somewhat since 1980 between low of 65 and high of 71 see the solid line in figure 6 some of the fluctuations are due to the business cycle to changes in tax law and the increasing deferment of income through defined contribution pension plans eg 401ks additionally some the changes in this ratio could be due to changes in income inequality the correlation between this ratio and the income gini coefficient is 0666 suggesting that as income inequality rises so does the proportion of agi that is taxable 16 income tends to grow faster than prices over time combining this income growth with rising income inequality suggests that over time more income will be above the personal exemption and standard deduction and therefore taxable consequently although exemptions and the standard deduction are indexed to inflation taxable income will grow with respect to agi holding other parameters of the tax system fixed 14 not all interest and pension income is taxable for more information on the individual income tax see crs report rl32808 overview of the federal tax system by jane g gravelle and donald j marples 15 see appendix for the key parameters of the regular income tax since 1980 16 this correlation is statistically significant the correlation between this ratio and the 90th10th percentile ratio is 0505 the estimated correlations do not control for other factors that may affect the taxable incomeagi ratio and do not indicate causality

reve nue servic and social security administrati on revenues from the individual income tax have also fluctuated over the past 25 years the solid line in figure 7 displays the 25year trend of individual income tax revenues as percentage of gross domestic product gdp most of the variation in revenues is due to the business cycle and tax law changes individual income tax revenues as percentage of gdp fell in the early 1980s the early 1990s and 2001 because of recessions revenues increased in the 1990s due to tax increases and the long economic expansion with the latter having more powerful effect revenues fell dramatically in the early 1980s because of the tax rate reductions enacted in 19801983 and also fell after 2001 because of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts increasing income inequality appears to have had little association with tax revenuesthe estimated correlation between the gini coefficient and the ratio of tax revenues to gdp is close to zero part of the explanation for this lack of association could be while rising income inequality has pushed more income into higher tax brackets the top marginal tax rates have fallen over the past three decades

taxable limit of 97500 for 200719 covered earnings above the maximum taxable limit are not subject to the social security payroll tax since 1983 the maximum taxable limit has been automatically updated as annual average earnings increase20 the social security payroll tax rate increased periodically between 1980 tax rate of 1016 and 1990 but has been steady at 124 since 1990 18 for more

average earnings the ratio of taxable earnings to covered earnings has fallen from 90 in 1983 to 85 in 2004 see the dashed line in figure 6 the estimated correlation between the ratio of taxable to covered earnings and the gini coefficient is 086021 as earnings inequality has increased greater proportion of covered earnings falls above the maximum taxable limit and is thus not subject to the social security payroll tax social security contributions tax revenues as percentage of gdp have varied between 42 and 51 since 1980 see the dashed line in figure 7 in 2004 contributions were equal to 47 of gdp although this ratio has not followed an upward trend like earnings inequality the estimated correlation between the two is 0676 it would appear that as earnings inequality increased since 1980 payroll tax revenues also increased but not by much

parallel to the regular income tax it has broader tax base but lower tax rate 22 the original rationale for the amt and its predecessor was to make sure high income individuals paid at least minimum of taxes higher income taxpayers calculate their regular tax liability and then their amt tax liability they pay whichever is greater23 unlike the regular individual income tax the parameters of the amt are not indexed to inflation but rather fixed in nominal terms consequently over time the number of taxpayers subject to the amt and amt tax liability will increase due to income growth while the amt was established in its current form by the tax reform act of 1986 congress has made several changes to the amt since then recently enacting temporary patches so as to limit the number of taxpayers subject to the amt 24 amt tax revenue and the number of taxpayers affected by the amt has fluctuated over the past 25 years and has steadily increased since 1988 see figure 8 both the proportion of taxpayers paying the amt and the proportion of individual income tax revenues due to the amt increased after 1982 with the enactment of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 which expanded the individual amt tax base the tax reform act of 1986 substantially modified the amt by changing the tax rate and expanding the tax base among other changes the dramatic reduction in amt taxpayers and tax revenues after 1986 however was due to changes in the tax treatment of capital gains under the regular income tax after 1986 capital gains income was fully taxed under the regular individual income tax and longer taxed as tax preference item 21 the estimated correlation is statistically significant similarly the 90th10th percentile ratio is negatively correlated and

column of the table scenario 2 the income bracket cutoffs ar indexed to inflation in much the same way many of the regular individual income tax parameters are indexed for example by 2004 the cutoff for the first income bracket denoted less than 10000 in the table had increased to 19575 scenario 3 the income bracket cutoffs ar indexed to average earnings growth in much the same way the maximum taxable limit for the social security payroll tax is indexed for example the cutoff for the first income bracket had increased to 24532 by 2004 panel of table 1 shows how income shares have changed between 1982 and 2004 under scenario 1 the share of income to families in the first income category fell from 48 in 1982 to 06 by 2004 27 at the other end of the income distribution the share of aggregate income received by those in the highest income cat egory 120000 or more increased from 52 to 433 between 1982 and 200428 in general income shifted from the lowerincome categories to the

income tends to shift from the lower income categories to the higher income categories but not to the same extent as when the category cutoffs are fixed in nominal terms see panel since income tends to increase faster on average than prices over time the percentage of aggregate income of families in the top income bracket more than tripled between 1982 and 2004 from 52 to 206 29 even when tax parameters such as exemptions and tax brackets for the regular income tax are indexed to inflation income growth and rising inequality will lead to more income being taxed and at higher marginal tax rates over time the results for scenario 3 with the income catego ry cutoffs indexed to average earnings growth are displayed in panel c of table 1 even under scenario 3 there is some evidence of income shifting up to higher income categories most of the shift however appears to be from the middle income categories toward the higher categories the percentage of income in the bottom two categories remained fairly steady at about 20 between 1982 and 2004 the share of income of the next four categories 20000 up to 79999 fell from about 70 in 1982 to 55 by 2004 29 the percentage of

panel of table 2 panel c reports the distribution of earnings among the earnings categories under scenario 3 where the bracket cutoffs are indexed for average earnings growth the proportion of earnings received by workers in the four lowest earnings categories remains almost the same between 1982 513 and 2004 494 the proportion received by workers in the next three categories fell from 375 in 1982 to 261 in 2004 lastly the share of aggregate earnings received by workers in the top earnings category increased from 113 in 1982 to 244 in 2004 overall the share of aggregate earnings received by workers with annual earnings above the maximum taxable limit increased from 295 to 382 between 1982 and 2004 consequently even indexing the maximum taxa ble limit to average earnings growth the proportion of covered earnings that are taxable will fall when earnings inequality is rising g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g20g142g150g138g155g148g156g561 income and earnings inequality have steadily increased since 1980 research has demonstrated that rising inequality is due to those at the t op of the income distribution pulling away from those lower down in the distributionthe rich are getting richer but the poor appear to be holding their own since various federal taxes have different tax bases tax rates adjustments to income and methods for updating the tax parameters over time changing income inequality can have different effects on who pays the different taxes and how much they pay the two major components of the us federal tax system are the individual income tax and the social security payroll tax additionally the individual income tax system consists of the regular income tax and the alternative minimum tax amt in order to help protect taxpayers from bracket creep many of the parameters of the regular income tax are indexed to inflation nevertheless with income growing faster than prices and rising income inequality more income is pushed into higher tax brackets individual income tax revenues as percentage of gdp however do not appear to be associated with rising inequality because the income tax has become less progressive as inequality has increased that is the top marginal tax rates have fallen the parameters of the amt are not indexed but rather are fixed in nominal terms consequently the amount of income and the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will increase dramatically over time because of income growth and rising in come inequality in the absence of legislative changes the actual increase in amt taxpayers has been limited because of series of enacted temporary patches although the maximum taxable limit of the payroll tax is indexed for average earnings growth rising earnings inequality has pushed more and more of covered earnings above the limit thus the proportion of covered earnings that is taxable has fallen over the past 25 years rising income inequality can be ameliorated through the tax system and government transfers transfers to the poor and progressive tax system can help limit rising inequality but given that
