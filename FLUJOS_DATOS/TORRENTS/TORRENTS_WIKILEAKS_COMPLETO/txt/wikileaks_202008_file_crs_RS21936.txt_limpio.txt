protection agency epa has proposed regulations to reduce atmospheric mercury emission from coalfired electric power plants1 as plausible link exists between methylmercury concentrations in fish source of mercuryrelated health effects in humans when consumed and electric utility mercury emissions the final epa regulation will provide either mercury emission rate per generating unit or alternatively national mercury emission cap with tradeable emission credits for more on the epa mercury rule see crs report rl31881 mercury emissions to the air regulatory and legislative proposals by james mccarthy and crs report rl32273 air quality epas proposed interstate air quality rule by larry parker and john blodgett these proposals have led to renewed congressional interest in current post combustion emission control technologies under the proposed regulatory frameworks the required mercury emission reductions would be realized through cobenefits reductions in mercury which arise as side effect from current emission control 1 69 fed reg 46524752 january 30 2004 and 70 fed reg 1239812472 march 16 2004 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 technologies designed for capture of other pollutants this report will discuss these and other current emission control technologies and their application to reducing mercury emissions from electric utilities background the epa under the provisions of the clean air act 42 usc 74017671 has set national ambient air quality standards for six pollutants these six pollutants often referred to as criteria pollutants are lead ozone nitrogen oxides nox sulfur dioxide so2 carbon monoxide and particulate matter the degree to which stationary combustion sources emit criteria pollutants often depends on the fuel used for example combustion of fuels containing larger amounts of sulfurcontaining compounds may lead to greater emissions of sulfur dioxide approaches to reduce these emissions include pretreatment of fuel optimization of combustion and postcombustion control technologies this report focuses solely on postcombustion control technologies the performance of postcombustion emission control equipment depends on many factors including fuel composition the design of the emission system the flow speed of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21936 the flue gases exhaust the completeness of the combustion process and the presence of other complementary emission control technologies thus determining the control efficiencies for different technologies without empirical testing is very difficult control efficiency models for given emission control technology usually contain experimentally determined values specific to particular combustion process companies that own and operate stationary combustion sources may choose to implement different control technologies so long as pollutant emissions meet the limits established in epa regulations companys choice of postcombustion emission control technology may not be based solely on pollutant control efficiency other factors include relative costs both capital and operating production of additional waste streams such as from technologies using liquid solutions to remove pollutants energy use and technology interdependence postcombustion emission control technologies postcombustion emission control technologies are generally designed to remove particular pollutant and may be operated in different combinations an overview of select postcombustion control technologies is provided below selective reduction for nitrogen oxides selective reduction techniques reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides nox present in the flue gas through injection of ammonia gas which reacts with the nitrogen oxides to form nitrogen and water vapor there are two types of selective reduction technologies catalytic and noncatalytic selective catalytic reduction scr employs bed of materials such as specially prepared ceramics which enhances the reaction of ammonia with the nitrogen oxides selective noncatalytic reduction sncr involves the same process without the assisting bed of materials instead operating at higher temperatures scrubbers for sulfur dioxide flue gas desulfurization fgd technologies also known as scrubbers are primarily designed to remove sulfur dioxide from flue gas crs3 scrubbers fall into two general types wet and dry in both cases material typically powdered or dissolved limestone reacts with sulfur oxides present in the flue gas forming compounds which are later removed wet scrubbers spray liquid mixture into the flue gas there are many different configurations of wet scrubbing technology but they operate on the same principles of gasliquid interaction their energy costs control efficiencies and other factors vary by particular configuration because of the use of liquids in wet scrubbers handling and potential treatment of waste liquids is often design concern in contrast dry scrubbers also known as spray dryer adsorbers sda react powdered dry material with the flue gas dry scrubbers usually create significant particulate matter during their operation and are often coupled with particulate matter control technology to remove the additional powdered material the sulfur dioxide emissions reduction in dry scrubber are generally less than in wet scrubber but dry scrubber use avoids generating liquid waste stream particulate matter controls three common technologies specifically for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21936 particulate matter pm control are mechanical collectors electrostatic precipitators and fabric filters the choice between mechanical collectors electrostatic precipitators and fabric filters depends on the amount and size of pm generated pm control is also cobenefit of wet scrubbing mechanical collectors mechanical collectors also known as particle scrubbers ps use gravity or inertia to extract particulate matter from the flue gas baffles and chambers that allow large particles to settle from the flue gas are examples of mechanical collectors also in this category are cyclones in which the flue gas is induced to travel in spiral pattern so that centrifugal force pushes the particulate matter out of the gas onto the walls of the cyclone where it is collected and disposed of mechanical collectors are most efficient for removal of large particulate matter2 in situations where multiple emission control technologies are being used cyclones are sometimes used to remove the majority of large particulate matter with finer particulate matter being reduced subsequently by another technology electrostatic precipitators electrostatic precipitators esp use strong electric field between electrodes to draw particulate matter out of the flue gas the efficiency of this process hinges on several factors including the length of the precipitator longer precipitators have higher efficiencies the strength of the electric field stronger electric fields have higher efficiencies and the electrical resistivity of the particles in the flue gas only particles within range of electrical resistivity are efficiently removed electrostatic precipitators are referred to as coldside csesp or hotside hsesp depending on their location in the flue exhaust stream properly designed electrostatic precipitators are very effective at reducing particulate matter particles removed from the flue gas and collected at the electrodes are later removed3 2 stationary source control techniques document for fine particulate matter us environmental protection agency october 1998 section 51 3 stationary source control techniques document for fine particulate matter us continued crs4 fabric filters fabric filters ff also known as baghouses are large filters of fabric often sewn into long bags which physically sieve particles from the flue gas particulate matter collects on the surface of the fabric and is periodically removed by shaking the filters pulsing gas through them or reversing the air flow through the filter the performance of the fabric filter depends on the type and amount of fabric used and the regularity with which the fabric is cleaned4 high fabric filter control efficiencies have been reported and they can be effective in controlling small particulate matter wet scrubbers wet scrubbing technology form of flue gas desulfurization fgd discussed above has also been used to reduce particulate matter concentrations the impact of the liquid droplets on the particles in the flue gas draws the particles into the droplets which are collected and removed removal of mercury using existing control technologies existing postcombustion control technologies are being assessed for their ability to remove mercury from the flue gas because of the many equipment configuration and coal types already found in electric utilities both the limitations and advantages of these httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21936 technologies are important in considering epas proposed cobenefitsfocused regulation elemental mercury is liquid at room temperature but it evaporates easily and is considered difficult to remove from the flue gas stream in contrast mercury compounds which form ions charged atomic or molecular species present in flue gas are more easily removed in combustion emissions mercury can react with or attach to particles in the flue gas so particulate control can provide mercury removal as cobenefit partly because of the difficulties in predicting mercury capture by existing control technologies the epa in 1998 issued an information collection request to electric utilities to gather information regarding the effectiveness of current control technologies with respect to mercury removal analysis of this data showed wide variation of mercury emission control as cobenefit with significant variation occurring between different coal types for given emission control technology see table 1 the control efficiencies estimated by the epa analysis were based on the technologies currently in use by the electric utility industry these control technologies were not reoptimized for mercury capture but rather operated under normal conditions policy issues several technologyrelated policy issues regarding regulation of mercury emissions include the maximum feasible level of mercury reduction from cobenefits of current emissions control technologies the likely level of mercury emissions reduction using alternative control technologies not currently used by the electric utility industry and the maturity and availability of these alternative technologies 3 continued environmental protection agency october 1998 section 52 4 stationary source control techniques document for fine particulate

protection agency control of mercury emissions from coalfired electric utility boilers interim report including errata dated 32102 epa600r01109 april 2002 note see text for definition of acronyms in use technologies experts disagree over the degree of mercury reduction resulting from cobenefits of existing emission control technologies table 1 shows that average mercury reduction by existing control technologies is highly dependent both on the type of emission control technology being used and the type of coal used as fuel in the electric generating unit varying from 0 to 98 the two negative results are presumably artifacts of the testing procedure the epa has stated that the maximum amount of mercury collection for some existing control technologies has significant uncertainty because of both small sample size and difficulties in measurement5 moreover because these values were obtained without maximization of mercury capture it is unclear whether they should be considered representative of potential maximum mercury capture further optimization of current emission control technologies to enhance the capture of mercury might lead to higher collection of mercury emissions however attempting to optimize mercury capture by already installed emission control technologies might also degrade their ability to control other pollutant levels 5 69 fed reg 46524752 january 30 2004 at p 4698 crs6 new technologies alternative technologies for mercury emissions reduction are under development for use in the electric utility industry6 commercial electric generating unit in the united states has installed mercuryspecific emissions control technology mercury emission reduction technology such as activated carbon injection aci has been used on other combustion systems such as municipal incinerators to achieve substantial mercury emissions reduction performance of activated carbon injection technologies are being assessed in field tests on commercial plants these results show mercury emissions reduction ranging from 60 to 90 depending on coal fuel type and carbon injection rates the use of aci in municipal incinerators along with initial test results with electric generating units and the serious health effects of mercury cause some to argue that the alternative technologies for mercury emissions reduction should be considered when determining the regulatory emissions level for electric generating units however the operating conditions of electric generating units are different than those in municipal incinerators and contention exists among stakeholders over whether equivalent reduction in mercury emissions would be obtained in electric generating units under normal operating conditions supporters of cobenefits approach to mercury regulation argue these technologies are not yet proven nor commercially available for use in the electric generating units and thus their inclusion in rulemaking httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21936 would be inappropriate stakeholders disagree over how much and how fast mercury emissions reduction can be achieved the epa estimates that generating unit specific emission limit based on cobenefits would reduce the mercury emissions 29 by 20087 emissions control technology manufacturers state that it is feasible to reduce mercury emissions 50 to 70 by 2008 using cobenefits and nearterm mercury specific technology such as activated carbon injection8 testing of activated carbon injection and other alternative control technologies by the department of energy indicates that technologies achieving at least 50 to 70 reduction of mercury will likely be available for large scale commercial deployment after 2011 to 20139 other analysts disagree with this time frame asserting that transfer of mercury control technology from municipal waste incinerators to electric generating units is straightforward and therefore commercialization would occur quicker than the department of energy projects10 6 brief
