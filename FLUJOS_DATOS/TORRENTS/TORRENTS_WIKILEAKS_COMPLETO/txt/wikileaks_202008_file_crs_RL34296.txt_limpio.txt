and francis t miko specialists in foreign policy foreign affairs defense and trade division democracy promotion cornerstone of us foreign policy summary the bush administration has viewed democracy promotion as key element in its foreign policy agenda and an instrument for combatting terrorism given unsettled events related to elections in pakistan and kenya and recent landslide election in taiwan for party advocating closer ties with mainland china democracy promotion objectives will continue to be of interest in the american presidential campaigns and in the second session of the 110th congress arguably the lack of clear definition of democracy and comprehensive understanding of its basic elements may have hampered the formulation of democracy promotion policy and effective prioritizing of democracy promotion activities over the years also the lack of definition may have complicated coordination of democracy programs and the assessment of us government activities and funding further without consensus on democracy definition and goals what criteria will determine when if ever country has attained an acceptable level of democratic reform and longer needs american assistance both the us executive and legislative branches of government support democracy promotion in other countries the bush administration has implemented both bilateral and multilateral programs to promote democracy such as the millennium challenge account mca and requested about 15 billion for democracy promotion out of total foreign affairs budget request of 362 billion in fy2008 also the administration identified governing justly and democratically as key objective of its foreign aid policies congress appropriates funds authorizes programs and is responsible for oversight in 2007 congress considered among other democracy promotion bills the advance democracy act of 2007 hr 982 it contains provisions to promote democracy overseas calls for specific state department actions and reports aims to strengthen the community of democracies and authorizes funding for democracy assistance for fy2008 and fy2009 congress is currently carrying out its own program through the house democracy assistance commission hdac which was established in 2005 the commission provides expert advice to fledgling legislatures to date 12 countries have received assistance from the commission the issue among members of congress presidential hopefuls and in the wider policy community is not whether democracy promotion is worthwhile in general but rather when where and how it is to be applied to get the desired results and the most for the taxpayers dollar in addition coordination of democracy promotion activities is lacking among developed countries and within the us government the 110th congress may scrutinize us democracy promotion in iraq and elsewhere whether or not victory in iraq includes establishing an independent democratic iraqi government will be important in evaluating the human and financial costs and benefits of us involvement in iraq and could affect other us democracy promotion agendas this report will be updated as warranted contents introduction 1 background on

cornerstone of us foreign policy introduction democracy promotion has been longstanding element of us foreign policy in recent years however it has become primary component under the george w bush administration efforts to spread freedom to iraq and around the world have been viewed as tool to end tyranny and fight terrorism as the way to promote stability in troubled regions and as mechanism to increase prosperity in poor countries the democracy promotion ideal continues to be under close scrutiny particularly with recent unsettled election events in kenya and pakistan and with landslide victory in taiwan for the opposition party that supports closer ties with mainland china while some observers believe that spreading democracy is key foreign policy priority others argue that democracy promotion is but one of number of us strategic objectives and not necessarily the overriding one the issue among members of congress presidential hopefuls and in the wider foreign policy community may not be whether democracy promotion is worthwhile but rather when where and how to apply it effectively this report provides background information on democracy promotion policy and activities discusses the difficulties involved in such efforts and presents perspectives on the benefits and costs of such efforts it also provides information on congressional efforts to assist other parliaments in democratizing countries this report will be updated as warranted background on the current debate since world war i when the united states fought to make the world safe for democracy administrations have been interested to varying degrees in promoting democracy around the world recent presidents reagan george hw bush and clinton viewed democracy promotion as an important component of their foreign policy efforts more broadly the current bush administration has viewed democracy promotion as an instrument for promoting peace and combatting terrorism he identified it as central focus to the war on terrorism and national security in his second inauguration address on january 20 2005 crs2 now it is the urgent requirement of our nations security so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world also in january 2005 dr condoleezza rice before the senate foreign relations committee listed three top priorities for her administrations diplomacy first we will unite the community of democracies in building an international system that is based on shared values and the rule of law second we will strengthen the community of democracies to fight the threats to our common security and alleviate the hopelessness that feeds terror and third we will spread freedom and democracy throughout the globe that is the mission that president bush has set for america in the world and is the great mission of american diplomacy today1 one of president george w bushs stated reasons for starting the war in iraq was to bring democracy to that country we are committed to strategic goal of free iraq that is democratic that can govern itself defend itself and sustain itself2 the bush administration continued to stress democracy promotion as key element in its foreign policy when secretary of state rice announced her transformational diplomacy plan in january 2006 the secretarys objective of transformational diplomacy is to work with our many partners around the world to build and sustain democratic wellgoverned states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system3 this goal was restated in the state departments october 2006 briefing on the secretarys foreign assistance reform increasingly others are voicing opinions about spreading democracy as key component of us foreign policy in recent survey americans weighed in on us democracy promotion efforts in the 2007 poll american voters reacted to various strategies to fight terrorism options included make america energy independent use diplomacy to bring our allies into the struggle use military force to defeat terrorists and the states that harbor them provide economic assistance to poor countries to prevent them from becoming terrorist havens and promote freedom and democracy in the islamic world the leastsupported option among respondents was to promote freedom and democracy in the islamic world the same poll asked participants to agree or disagree with the following statement the us cannot 1 the secretary of states nomination hearing before the senate foreign relations committee january 18 2005 2 president bush meets with senior us defense officials on iraq december 13 2006 httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200612200612135html 3 remarks by secretary of state rice at the school of foreign service georgetown university january 18 2006 crs3 impose democracy by force on another country eightythree percent agreed with the statement and 15 disagreed4 similar sentiments have been expressed by people in arab countries in 2007 dr james j zogby president of the arab american institute testified before congress that recent years of polling among arab populations indicates that even arabs who value freedom and democracy did not want our us assistance in promoting democracy in their country5 lawmakers and presidential candidates will likely address their views on democracy promotion as they debate us foreign policy issues in the coming months some candidates may feel compelled to reject democracy promotion entirely in reaction to the policy of controversial president who elevated it to high level of importance in his foreign policy however more important question to be answered may be how to determine when where and how democracy promotion should be applied to be most effective defining democracy dating back to about 500 bce democracies existed in both greece and italy the term democracy comes from the greek words demos the people and craits to rule today democracy is an abstract term that is difficult to define and can have different meanings depending on the speaker and context in the most common understanding democracy generally refers to political system with certain minimum elements effective participation by the people either directly or through representation under constitution respect for human rights and political equality before the law for both minorities and the majority the lack of clear definition of democracy and comprehensive understanding of its basic elements may have created multiple problems for us policy making according to some arguably the lack of clear definition has hampered the formulation of democracy promotion policy and effective prioritizing of democracy promotion activities over the years also the lack of definition can complicate coordination of democracy programs and the assessment of us government activities and funding further without consensus on the definition of democracy what criteria will determine when country has attained an acceptable level of democratic reform and longer needs american assistance according to richard haass former state department official and current president of the council on foreign relations democracy is more than elections it 4 penn schoen berland associates report to third way results of national security poll february 7 2006 between january 30 2007 and february 4 2007 penn schoen berland associates conducted 807 nationwide telephone interviews of likely 2008 presidential election voters 5 testimony before the house foreign affairs subcommittee on international organizations human rights and oversight and the subcommittee on the middle east and south asia may 3 2007 crs4 is diffusion of power where group within society is excluded from full participation in political life democracy requires checks and balances within the government among various levels of government national state and local and between government and society elements such as independent media unions political parties schools and democratic rights for women provide checks on government power over society individual rights such as freedom of speech and worship need to be protected furthermore democratic government must face the check of electable opposition and leaders must hand over power peacefully6 one scholar laurence whitehead discusses the various academic attempts to define democracy pointing out that the definition has varied over time and among cultures with even subtle differences in british and american understandings of key elements of democracy and arguing that the outer boundaries of the concept of democracy are to significant extent malleable and negotiable7 democracy has some indispensable components without which the concept would be vacuous but these indispensable elements are skeletal and can in any case be arranged in various possible configurations whitehead posits8 he argues that democracy requires the minimal procedural conditions safeguarding free and fair elections freedom of speech and association and the integrity of elective office as described by other scholars9 yet he cautions these minimal procedures only establish contingently and for the present period rather coherent and broadbased 6 towards greater democracy in the muslim world richard n haass thendirector policy planning staff us department of state remarks to the council on foreign relations washington dc december 4 2002 7 laurence whitehead democratization theory and experience oxford university press 2002 p 14 8 ibid p 20 9 these minimal procedural conditions are outlined by philippe c schmitter and terry lynn karl in an article entitled what democracy is and is not in the global resurgence of democracy by larry diamond and marc f partner baltimore johns hopkins university press 1993 p 45 schmitter and karl add two conditions to the seven minimum conditions for democracy suggested earlier by robert dahl dilemmas of pluralist democracy new haven yale university press 1982 p 11 as cited by whitehead these nine conditions are 1 control of government decisions about policy is constitutionally vested in public officials 2 elected officials are chosen in frequent and fairly conducted elections in which coercion is comparatively uncommon 3 practically all adults have the right to vote in the election of officials 4 practically all adults have the right to run for elective offices in the government 5 citizens have right to express themselves without the danger of severe punishment on political matters broadly defined 6 citizens have right to seek out alternative sources of information moreover alternative sources of information exist and are protected by law 7 citizens also have the right to form relatively independent associations or organizations including independent political parties and interest groups 8 popularly elected officials must be able to exercise their constitutional power without being subjected to overriding albeit informal opposition from unelected officials 9 the polity must be selfgoverning it must be able to act independently of constraints imposed by some other overarching political system ibid pp 1011 although whitehead pins his definition of democracy on these procedural conditions later in his book he indicates in his immediate discussion of them that they are at once too precise and too incomplete to constitute the entire definition ibid p 11 crs5 exposition of the predominant view he notes that the meaning of democracy is likely to remain contested and even to some extent unstable as current processes of democratization unfold10 democratization he thus writes is best understood as complex longterm dynamic and openended process it consists of progress towards more rulebased more consensual and more participatory type of politics like democracy it necessarily involves combination of fact and value and so contains internal tensions11 lack of generally accepted view of democracy is evident in multilateral organizations such as freedom house and the community of democracies dedicated to the cause of good governance freedom house an independent nongovernmental organization ngo founded in the 1940s supports freedom worldwide rating countries level of freedom rather than defining or measuring democracy freedom house rates countries as free partly free or not free via numerical assessments of countrys political rights and civil liberties political rights enable people to participate freely in the political process including the right to vote freely for distinct alternatives in legitimate elections compete for public office join political parties and organizations and elect representatives who have decisive impact on public policies and are accountable to the electorate civil liberties allow for the freedoms of expression and belief associational and organizational rights rule of law and personal autonomy without interference from the state12 freedom house states that it is not enough that country has elections to be considered free it must have competitive multiparty political system universal adult suffrage for all citizens regularly contested elections with secret ballots and public access to major political parties according to the freedom house mission statement freedom is possible only in democratic political systems in which the governments are accountable to their own people the rule of law prevails and freedoms of expression association belief and respect for the rights of minorities and women are guaranteed13 the community of democracies consists of over 100 nations that first met in 2000 to form coalition of countries that are committed to promoting and strengthening democracies worldwide this organization does not define democracy but does provide criteria for participation in the community see appendix for its stated criteria congress has demonstrated its concern for the lack of consistent definition for democracy the senate foreign operations appropriation committee report for fy2006 srept 10996hr 3057 stated the committee remains concerned that the state department and usaid do not share common definition of democracy 10 ibid p 26 11 ibid p 27 12 freedom house website methodology page at httpwwwfreedomhouseorgtemplate cfmpage351ana_page333year2007 13 freedom house website at httpwwwfreedomhouseorgtemplatecfmpage2 crs6 program for the purposes of this act democracy program means technical assistance and other support to strengthen the capacity of democratic political parties governments nongovernmental institutions andor citizens in order to support the development of democratic states institutions and practices that are responsive and accountable to citizens14 the following year the senate appropriations committee report for fy2007 srept 109277hr 5522 asserted to ensure common understanding of democracy programs among united states government agencies the committee defines in the act the promotion of democracy to include programs that support good governance human rights independent media and the rule of law and otherwise strengthen the capacity of democratic political parties ngos and citizens to support the development of democratic states institutions and practices that are responsible and accountable to citizens15 democracies real or in name only further complicating defining democracy are the various designations for differing types of systems that call themselves democracies while numerous and at times overlapping labels exist typical references among the various terms for limited democracies include electoral democracies liberal democracies pseudo democracies and semiauthoritarian governments adding confusion to the debate on democracy promotion is whether recipients of democracy promotion assistance attain what is judged to be complete or incomplete democratic transition electoral democracy according to larry diamond is civilian constitutional system in which the legislative and chief executive offices are filled through regular competitive multiparty elections with universal suffrage16 electoral process is minimum requirement for government to be referred to as democracy most experts agree however that elections are not enough liberal democracy has all of what an electoral democracy has plus constitution that directs government institutions rule of law and civil liberties equally to all citizens including the state and its agents it also has an independent judiciary that protects liberties freedom house uses this set of requirements to describe its category of free pseudodemocracies nondemocracies and illiberal democracies are categories of governments that are minimally democratic they are marginally different from authoritarian regimes as they contain some aspects of electoral democracies such as 14 senate appropriations committee srept 10996 hr 3057 department of state foreign operations and related programs appropriations fy2006 june 30 2005 15

consolidation hereafter referred to as developing democracy johns hopkins university press 1999 p 10 crs7 the existence of multiple parties but hold little real competition for power among those political parties pseudodemocracies include hegemonic party systems in which relatively institutionalized ruling party makes extensive use of coercion patronage media control and other features to deny formally legal opposition parties fair and authentic chance to compete for power17 nondemocracies include semi authoritarian and authoritarian regimes these types of governments may have certain level of freedom or may even appear to hold elections conversely however they may be totalitarian regimes rigidly closed governments illiberal democracies have free and fair elections but do not provide civil liberties and political rights to the masses some critics and democracy experts argue that past democracy promotion efforts were focused too heavily on free elections ignoring some of the necessary underpinnings of democracy such as tolerance for minority views rule of law and freedom of the press why promote democracy when us administrations have encouraged democratic reform they have claimed that benefits for the country its neighbors the united states and the world will result many experts believe that extending democracy can reduce terrorism while encouraging global political stability and economic prosperity in its 2006 national strategy for combating terrorism the george w bush administration cites democracy promotion as longterm solution for winning the war on terror18 in contrast others claim that in some instances promoting democracy can be destabilizing factor in country as well as its region and have documented backlash to democracy promotion including restrictions on freedom in some countries where democracy promotion has taken place19 the benefits and costs of democracy promotion may vary depending on the circumstances in which the programs are carried out for example costs could be starkly different if democracy is militarily imposed on country as opposed to the country itself taking the initiative on the other hand some scholars believe that democracy promotion can succeed even in seemingly inhospitable environments while whitehead points out the difficulties of achieving democracy he also notes the widespread aspirations for democracy comparative evidence he states is clear that in surprisingly wide range of countries and regions both elite and popular opinion can be energized by the democracy promotion programs of the established powers of the postwar international system the desire to participate can generate democratizing aspirations that extend beyond the boundaries of any single nation and that may drive cumulative longterm change even in the face of intervening disappointments 17 diamond developing democracy p 15 18 white house release of updated strategy national strategy for combating terrorism september 5 2006 at httpwwwwhitehousegovnscnsct2006sectionihtml 19 national endowment for democracy the backlash against democracy assistance june 8 2006 crs8 and distortions20 durable democracies he concludes can be regarded as regimes that have slowly evolved under pressure from their citizens and that have therefore been adapted both to the structural realities and to the social expectations of the societies in which they have become established21 assessment of perceived benefits common rationale offered by proponents of democracy promotion including former secretary of state madeleine albright and current secretary of state condoleezza rice is that democracies do not go to war with one another this is sometimes referred to as the democratic peace theory experts point to european countries the united states canada and mexico as presentday examples according to president clintons national security strategy of engagement and enlargement democracies create free markets that offer economic opportunity make for more reliable trading partners and are far less likely to wage war on one another22 some have refined this democracy peace theory by distinguishing between mature democracies and those in transition suggesting that mature democracies do not fight wars with each other but that countries transitioning toward democracy are more prone to being attacked because of weak governmental institutions or being aggressive toward others states that made transitions from an autocracy toward early stages of democracy and were involved in hostilities soon after include france in the mid1800s under napoleon iii prussiagermany under bismarck 18701890 chile shortly before the war of the pacific in 1879 serbias multiparty constitutional monarchy before the balkan wars of the late 20th century and pakistans military guided pseudodemocracy before its wars with india in 1965 and 197123 the george w bush administration asserts that democracy promotion is longterm antidote to terrorism the administrations strategy for winning the war on terror asserts that inequality in political participation and access to wealth resources in country lack of freedom of speech and poor education all breed volatility by promoting basic human rights freedoms of speech religion assembly association and press and by maintaining order within their borders and providing an independent justice system effective democracies can defeat terrorism in the long run according to the bush white house24 another reason given to encourage democracies although debated by some experts is the belief that democracies promote economic prosperity from this 20 ibid p 267 21 ibid p 268 22 president william j clinton the national security strategy of engagement and enlargement 1996 p 2 23

crs9 perspective as the rule of law leads to more stable society and as equal economic opportunity for all helps to spur economic activity economic growth particularly of per capita income is likely to follow in addition democracy under this scenario may be more likely to be viewed by other countries as good trading partner and by outside investors as more stable environment for investment according to some experts moreover countries that have developed as stable democracies are viewed as being more likely to honor treaties according to some experts25 potential downsides according to some critics pushing democracy promotion as primary objective of us national security and foreign policy has reduced support and generated skepticism around the world for democracy promotion activities according to one study the rhetorical conflation by the bush administration and its allies of the war in iraq and democracy promotion has muddied the meaning of the democracy project diminishing support for it at home and abroad some of those opposed to the invasion of iraq americans and others appear to have been alienated from democracy promotion more generally and this is to be regretted26 while most us democracy promotion does not involve the military the high military and opportunity cost of some activities currently associated with democracy promotion is criticized by many observers especially when democracy is imposed by outsiders rather than initiated by local citizens27 democracy promotion expenditures compete with domestic spending priorities critics note that using the various tools to promote democracy abroad foreign aid military intervention diplomacy and public diplomacy can be very expensive and may provide little assurance that real longterm gains will be made they add that it involves high probability of sustaining costly longterm nationbuilding programs down the road at some point americans could view the opportunity cost of spending these funds overseas rather than on domestic programs or other pressing global concerns such as infectious disease and extreme poverty as being too great 25 see for example diamond developing democracy p 7

on national security september 2005 p 1 27 president clinton in his national security strategy for engagement and enlargement said democracy and economic prosperity can take root in struggling society only through local solutions carried out by the society itself 1996 p ii crs10 another concern about democracy promotion is that it can have destabilizing effect on an entire region 2005 harvard study concluded that our research shows that incomplete democratic transitions those that get stalled before reaching the stage of full democracy increase the chance of involvement in international war in countries where governmental institutions are weak at the outset of the transition28 at times the region can become unstable because the transitioning country initiates crossborder attacks or may be the victim of these attacks particularly if it has weak democratic institutions or weak military29 while many democracy promotion proponents assert that democracies dont war with each other critic on the democracy peace theory joanne gowa of princeton contends that this theory has more to do with the alignment of interests and the bipolar balance in the world after world war ii than democracypeace characteristics that many today claim exist she says that democratic peace is cold war phenomenon that is the available data show that democratic peace is limited to the years between 1946 and 198030 she additionally points out that there are nondemocracies that do not war with each other and may be able to constrain their leaders from embarking on military actions abroad about as effectively as democracies31 some view democracy programs as inappropriately interfering in the domestic politics of foreign countries often producing backlash sometimes citing russia against the organizations both foreign and domestic that carry them out in recent years the united states has invested effort and money in democracy promotion in russia eastern europe and the middle east the recent backlash against democratic reform in russia the elections of antiamerican governments in the palestinian territories and the rise to elected office of hezbollah in lebanon have caused some to question the value of us democracy promotion investments while recent usaidcommissioned study concluded that us democracy and governance assistance does have positive effect on democracy growth worldwide the democracy gains were modest32 at the same time us government and ngo assistance for civil society strengthening can lead to human rights repercussions triggering some governments to react by clamping down on ngo activities and on the local citizens 28 edward d mansfield and jack snyder electing to fight p 4 29 ibid pp 33 34 30 joanne gowa ballots and bullets princeton university press 1999 p 113 31 ibid p 111

determinants of success perfect democracy where all citizens have equal say in their government and where the government is responsive equally to each of its citizens does not exist just as democracies can evolve and grow more democratic so too can they devolve and become abusive corrupt unresponsive and unaccountable to their population moreover populations can become disinterested in working to maintain democracy at what point can country be declared successful democracy achieving success means measures and challenges small number of successful transitions to democracy that began in the 1980s and that have endured provide promise and hope for the success of ongoing and future efforts for example four transitions chile the philippines poland and south africa are often cited as full successes33 the first two of which were transitions from authoritarian regimes the third from communist regime and the last from racial apartheid other successful cases are sometimes characterized as democracies still tainted by their state corporativist legacies for instance taiwan and south korea34 these and other perhaps less longstanding examples for instance mozambique and mali illustrate the variety of circumstances from which democracy can emerge in addition several transitions from conflict have been recently viewed by some experts as demonstrating fair degree of success ie algeria bosnia salvador liberia serbia and sierra leone although interpretations differ depending on the factors emphasized despite the successes democratization has proved to be highly uncertain venture one recent study showed that only 23 of transitions from authoritarian governments over the three decades from 1972 to 2003 resulted in democratic governments while the great majority 77 resulted in another authoritarian regime35 often as in the cases listed above as demonstrating some success transitions are incomplete and subject to backsliding under adverse political and economic strains indeed there are several countries where backsliding has been notable including russia and countries in central asia december 2007 post election violence in kenya also demonstrates backsliding there is some evidence that democratization across the globe has slowed or stagnated over the past decade 33 thomas carothers aiding democracy abroad the learning curve hereafter referred to as aiding democracy abroad washington dc carnegie endowment for international peace 1999 p 104 34 diamond developing democracy p 250 35 axel hadenius and jan teorell pathways from authoritarianism the journal of democracy vol 18 8 january 2007 the authors conclude that certain types of authoritarian regimes those with limited multiparty participation are more likely to democratize than others ie monarchies pure military regimes pure oneparty states and multiparty states with one dominant party crs12 and that many countries in transition are now resisting international democratization efforts36 the united states provides democracy assistance to many countries in variety of circumstances and with mixed degrees of success analysts categorize country circumstances and affects of assistance in different ways generally analysts have viewed us democracy aid as facilitating transitions either from authoritarian or communist rule as in latin america and central europe or from conflict as in bosnia and african nations such as sierra leone and liberia37 the range of us democracy promotion activities and programs also varies greatly from assistance for elections to aid in developing institutions and to funding of civil society groups these types of assistance are discussed below thus far there is little agreement among experts and practitioners on the circumstances in which democracy promotion success may be achieved the appropriate emphasis sequencing and mix of programs to achieve it and the time frame necessary for an enduring democracy to take hold beyond the lack of consensus on what programs work best in certain circumstances the countries themselves have obstacles preventing their success in attaining democratic government many interests and emotions come into play during such political transitions thomas carothers of the carnegie endowment for international peace warns of some fundamental impediments the truth that politics involves harshly competing interests bitter power struggles and fundamentally conflicting values not to mention greed stupidity and hatred is downplayed until it asserts itself unwanted at some later stage38 generally postconflict situations are considered more difficult and the success rate is considered lower although even where transitions have been seen as relatively smooth and successful as in central europe recent events suggest that democratic change in post authoritarian circumstances can be difficult backsliding in some countries such as kenya increases the difficulty of determining not only when success has been achieved but consolidating lessons learned to refine the means of achieving success 36 arch puddington freedom in the world 2007 freedom stagnation amid pushback against democracy p 10 accessible through the freedom house website httpwwwfreedomhouseorguploadspress_releasefiw07_overview_finalpdf this article found pushback against democracy to be major obstacle to the spread of freedom in 2006 it cites the number of electoral democracies in 2006 as 123 or 64 of 193 countries and the same number as in 2005 in contrast an article by another author cited the rapid rise both in number and as proportion of all independent states of electoral democracies during the 15 years from 19872002 electoral democracies grew from 69 in 1987 41 of all 167 states to 121 63 of

or moving backwards and 3 countries that have not achieved significant democratic opening or breakthrough carothers aiding democracy abroad p 304 38 carothers aiding democracy abroad p 102 crs13 means elections institutions and civil society the view that democracy would be achieved if political leaders could be persuaded to govern democratically or when reasonably free and fair elections are held has given way to range of other conditions that must be met for country to be considered sustainable democracy the idea that elections are sufficient measure of success was discarded as analysts realized that this measure ignores the degree to which multiparty elections even if they are competitive and uncertain in outcome may exclude significant portions of the population from contesting for power or advancing and defending their interests or may leave significant arenas of decision making beyond the control of elected officials39 subsequently two other means to establish democracy have become recognized as essential although opinion is divided as to which is the more important one is the promotion of strong democratic institutions diamond argues that the political institutionalization the establishment of capable complex coherent and responsive formal institutions of democracy is the single most important and urgent factor in the consolidation of democracy40 if it is liberal democracy that we have in mind then the political system must also provide for rule of law and rigorously protect the right of individuals and groups to speak publish assemble demonstrate lobby and organize he lists full range of institutions ie political parties legislatures judicial systems local government and the bureaucratic structures of the state more generally41 carothers points to troubled political parties as an ubiquitous institutional deficiency in the global landscape of attempted democratization examines their problems and suggests new approaches to political party assistance42 democracy assistance efforts may well face wide range of impediments to the establishment of viable institutions however according to carothers those promoting transitions may often encounter entrenched concentrations of political power deeply rooted habits of patronage and corruption mutually hostile socioeconomic or ethnic groups ie the underlying interests and power relationships that are most often resistant to change43 he suggests that democracy assistance programs will be more effective by building the underlying interests and power relationships into them but warns that effective programs require much deeper knowledge about the recipient society than most aid providers have or want to take the trouble to acquire44 39 diamond developing democracy p 9 for

aiding democracy abroad pp 107108 crs14 the other means to promoting democracy is the creation of vibrant civil society which many argue is the sine qua non for functioning democracy karatnycky views an active and dynamic civil society as the crucial agent in ensuring durable democratic outcome the evidence from dozens of post conflict and postauthoritarian transitions shows that the best way for advanced democracies to increase the chances for successful support of democratic openings is by maximizing the resources devoted to the development of civic nonviolent forces45 in study published in 2002 he cited east timor as case of international intervention where it appears that things are going right with major credit because of the international communitys major investment for independent civil life which bodes well for the future reinforcing his judgment on the importance of civil society is his view that civic empowerment appears to be more significant in determining democratic outcomes than whether or not society suffered wrenching violence although some experts such as carothers and diamond believe that political institutionalization is more critical diamond points to civil society as promoting not only transition to democracy but also its deepening and consolidation once democracy is established46 while in diamonds view civil society does not play the central role initially the more active pluralistic resourceful institutionalized and internally democratic civil society is the more likely democracy will be to emerge and endure47 lack of funding is often viewed as the most significant obstacle for the creation of civil society nongovernmental organizations in developing and even middleincome countries many of these countries including the uppermiddle income countries such as chile and argentina where international donors are likely to withdraw support are weak in the social capital and publicspiritedness which enable civil society organizations to raise substantial funds from the private sectors of their own countries according to diamond48 without help from abroad the only recourse for such organizations is to turn to the state for funding which creates its own problems the importance of any one of these three means to democracy is subjective judgment as analysts opinions can differ and may well vary by type and even over time in comparative study karatnycky views two countries torn by conflict in the 1980s ie nicaragua and salvador as two success stories which are now relatively stable democracies with competitive multiparty systems49 although he attributes success to strengthening of democratic civil society in nicaragua and to centrist and reform movements in salvador that helped build vibrant civic sectors karatnycky also judges another factor as important ie that both countries 45 karatnycky making democratization work p 54 46 diamond developing democracy p 233 47 diamond developing democracy p 260 48 diamond developing

eventual national reconciliation50 continuing challenges democracy promotion is highly uncertain art in an era of constrained resources the policy and budgetary implications of identifying the most appropriate modes and settings for democracy assistance and the means to success can be profound even basic concepts are far from settled many analysts for instance view transitions from conflict as much greater challenge than the transition from authoritarian regimes while transitions from authoritarian and communist regimes involve creating an entirely new political order and in communist regimes in particular new economic order postconflict transitions involve overcoming bitterly divided societies and economic devastation many analysts suggest that postconflict settings have special needs especially because ethnic loyalties and divisions may complicate the implementation of peace settlements for instance the danger of holding elections too early in peace process the need to blend them with broader negotiations setting the political rules and the importance of avoiding winnertakeall scenarios are important considerations in postconflict transitions according to carothers who argues that democracy promotion should be supplemented by other efforts aid providers are also focusing on reconciliation as an essential element of democratization in such situations an element that should be supported by aid efforts that consciously combine democracy and conflict resolution methodologies51 some analysts suggest that success and difficulties in democracy promotion in postconflict settings can vary by the nature of the conflict however success in such settings tends to be found in situations where the conflict is based on politics rather than on ethnic or religious differences according karatnycky who cites salvador and nicaragua as two successes of the former sort52 in addition to the widespread view of ethnic differences as an impediment to democracy building most analysts believe that democracy is more likely to succeed in areas with previous experience in and cultures adapted to democracy it is clear that countries with history of democracy with desperate economic conditions and powerful internal divisions are having much harder time making democracy work than countries with some pluralistic traditions growing economy and cohesive social and cultural makeup according to carothers democracy promoters are just beginning to relate democracy aid to the full range of factors bearing on democracy beyond the political institutions and immediate problems of political life including economic conditions educational levels historical traditions and social and cultural divisions53 democracy promoters are gaining an appreciation of the varied political paths each requiring different approaches for democracy aid54 50 karatnycky making democratization work p 53 51 carothers aiding democracy abroad p 111 52 karatnycky making democratization work p 52 53 carothers aiding democracy abroad p 114 54 carothers aiding democracy abroad p 113 crs16 other analysts however discount ethnic differences and cultural factors as special impediment to democracy promotion 2003 rand study on nation building concluded that it is the level of effort the united states and the international community put into the democratic transitions of germany japan bosnia and kosovo that led to relative success versus somalia haiti and afghanistan not the latters levels of western culture economic development or cultural homogeneity55 nationbuilding is time and resourceconsuming effort the authors contend the united states and its allies have put 25 times more money and 50 times more troops on per capita basis into postconflict kosovo than into postconflict afghanistan this higher level of input accounts in significant measure for the higher level of output measured in the development of democratic institutions and economic growth56 the rand analysts argue that democracy promotion efforts may succeed in spite of specific difficulties the spread of democracy in latin america asia and parts of africa suggests that this form of government is not unique to western culture or to advanced industrial economies democracy can indeed take root in circumstances where neither exists57 differences in expectations and opinion regarding the circumstances and causes of success may reflect the time frame as well as factors examined bosnia herzegovina is prime example of the many lenses through which transition can be viewed and the factors that come into play in bringing about success for instance in study published in 2002 karatnycky views democracy promotion in bosnia an ethnically divided country as unpromising and faulted the 1995 dayton accord that ended the civil conflict there as freezing the country in an ethno political deadlock58 on the other hand the rand study published year later views bosnia as achieving number of important successes including helping to ensure united multiethnic bosnia59 it cites this outcome as evidence for its conclusion that ethnic divisions and lack of democratic antecedents and democratic 55 james

santa monica ca rand 2003 p xix 56 ibid 57 ibid 58 karatnycky making democratization work p 5354 the specific provisions he referred to granted the high representative the top international official charged with carrying out the dayton accord provisions the right to remove bosnian public officials if they are deemed to be obstructing the peace process right exercised frequently and often to the detriment of democratic procedure and the sovereignty of citizens and to impose laws and regulations on the country when local officials are unable to agree on important matters frequent outcome given the unworkable system of ethnic checks and balances that emerged from the dayton accords he judged that the international communitys inability to extract itself from bosnia points to the deficiencies of overly intrusive international micro management of postconflict transitions 59 dobbins americas role p 95 this study also notes in the same paragraph however that bosnia continues to be held together by the presence of steadily decreasing number of us and international troops and civilians crs17 culture are not necessarily impediments to transition to democracy60 in addition to the level of international effort that the study pointed to bosnias geographic neighborhood may contribute to its relative success some analysts have cited the prospect and requirements of european union eu and the north atlantic treaty organization nato membership as encouraging democratization in the balkans and central europe61 and some believe that bosnias proximity to and the prospect of membership in the european union is an important incentive to democratization there difficulties of defining and measuring the success of democracy projects and efforts actual measurement of the effect of democracy promotion projects on democratization is in the words of the national endowment for democracy ned an overwhelming if not impossible task62 in march 2006 report to congress the ned pointed out that success could have many definitions ranging from whether the democratization of country was the result of efforts made by particular action or set of actions to whether single action moved forward one building block within much larger democratization effort63 ned notes that it does not believe that democratic progress can be quantified in any meaningful way64 and even if it were possible to reliably assess outcomes quantitatively the cost would be prohibitive even qualitative measures can be misleading according to the ned report if they do not take into account wide variety of criteria on casebycase basis among other factors even qualitative assessments must take into account whether case is highrisk whether sponsored groups operate under limiting or deteriorating conditions and whether projects are sponsored as longterm investments in countries where democratization is not expected to occur for many years measuring the effects of democracy efforts as whole however necessary can be even more problematic in an appendix to the 2006 ned report to congress stanford universitys michael mcfaul points to the need for comprehensive assessment of the global results of democracy promotion and suggests detailed project design for such study the lack of such an assessment as well as lack of derivative materials for practitioners is in his judgment an important policy problem 60

promotion business go to work without training manuals or blueprints in hand even published case studies of previous successes are hard to find in the public domain which means that democracy assistance efforts are often reinventing the wheel or making it up as they go along as was on vivid display in both afghanistan and iraq even basic educational materials for students seeking to specialize in democracy promotion do not exist65 us government activities to promote democracy for years the us government has supported numerous bilateral and multilateral activities that promote democracy around the world both the executive and congressional branches of government are involved executive branch activities the bush administration has been heavily invested in promoting democracy to other countries theme in secretary rices transformational diplomacy announced in january 2006 is her plan to reform us diplomacy and foreign assistance activities with key objective of promoting democracy in other countries66 bilateral programs specific executive branch bilateral government activities that support democracy reform include providing aid to support election procedures and good governance practices assisting in building the legal system assisting in military and police training and teaching the importance of free press public diplomacy programs such as us international broadcasting exchanges and international information programs promote democracies overseas by showcasing american democracy and culture some exchanges provide foreign participants with training and experience in broadcast or print media techniques the millennium challenge account mca foreign assistance program proposed by president bush in 2002 and authorized by congress in 2004 was designed to provide foreign aid to countries that make progress toward democratic and economic reform the department of state is considered to be the lead agency for democracy promotion activities others involved

of american states oas an indication of the level of importance secretary rice places on democracy promotion is her announcement to establish the advisory commission on democracy promotion to help us think about the issues of democracy promotion to from time to time give us constructive criticism on what it is that were doing as well as constructive suggestions about what more we might do what the commission will not do however which many foreign policy observers say is needed is coordinate all the many facets of democracy promotion activities in which the us government is involved coordination mechanism experts say would contribute to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of ongoing programs and would help to minimize the possibility of democracy promotion programs and us tax dollars working at cross purposes furthermore some observers note there is lack of global coordination among developed countries supporting democracy promotion throughout the world from their perspective improved communication among developed democracies and letting each specialize in its area of comparative advantage whether economic cultural or geographical could further democracy promotion effectiveness worldwide while keeping costs down congressional involvement congress also plays role in democracy promotion setting funding levels and providing oversight of administration democracy promotion programs are typically how congress influences us democracy promotion programs the house of representatives also created the house democracy assistance commission hdac to help other governments legislative branches evolve see below and appendix b for history of congressional democracy promotion activities from the 101st congress through the first session of the 110th congress numerous pieces of legislation were introduced and passed to authorize and appropriate funds for democracy promotion in specific countries and regions and to press governments of nondemocratic countries to begin process of democratization significant sums were appropriated for democracy programs through the annual state department and foreign operations appropriations in fy2006 congress created the democracy fund in the foreign operations appropriations for fiscal year 2006 pl 109102 title iii which provided 941 million for various democracy promotion activities in fy2006 and the same amount for fy200767 in addition congress passed the implementation of the 911 commission act pl 11053hr 1 which includes title xxi advancing democratic values subtitle activities to enhance the promotion of democracy 67 money in this fund is spread across the numerous programs included in the foreign operations budget and is included in table 1 funds crs23 in the first session of the 110th congress several bills involving democracy promotion were introduced the advance democracy act of 2007 hr 982 introduced on february 12 2007 by representative tom lantos dca and others contains provisions to promote democracy in foreign countries calls for specific state department actions and reports with regard to nondemocracies aims to strengthen the community of democracies and authorizes funding for democracy assistance for fy2008 and fy2009 other bills introduced in the 110th congress address democracy in individual countries including the ukraine venezuela afghanistan vietnam and serbia building on long tradition of supporting the development of democracies and democratic institutions around the world in many ways68 congress currently carries out its own program to support legislatures in new democracies the house democracy assistance commission hdac was created in march 2005 in effect the successor effort to previous congressional legislative assistance programs in the 1990s hdac was established to enable members officers and staff of the house of representatives and congressional support agencies to provide expert advice to fledgling legislatures on subjects such as committee operations oversight constituent relations parliamentary procedures and the establishment of support services to date the hdac has assisted legislatures of 12 countries throughout the world69 considerations for congress the democracy promotion rubric encompasses wide range of policies and activities as noted in the previous section on measuring success experts have yet to carry out the type of comprehensive studies that can reliably establish causeand effect relationship between efforts and outcomes nevertheless there is general sense that some types of situations are harder to influence than others and require considerable debate over the appropriate balance of us interests and risks to the domestic populations in the high costhigh stakes cases the following provides an overview of perceptions of different types of cases and the debate about the circumstances in which assistance is appropriate at the low costlow risk end of the spectrum are programs whose distinctive feature is that assistance is targeted to countries that have already embarked on democratic transitions independently and with strong domestic popular support as in central europe the baltic countries and some countries of latin america asia and africa such assistance has been requested and embraced by the receiving countries most of these countries were committed to democratic reforms with or without foreign assistance and might have succeeded without it it is difficult to document and quantify the value added of us and other assistance programs however the general belief in donor and recipient countries alike is that democracy promotion activities largely consisting of training and technical assistance have had positive impact at relatively modest cost even where governments have 68 see appendix for syntheses of these activities since world war ii 69 for more detail on this program see appendix crs24 seemingly retreated from their democratic course as many would argue is the case in russia today such programs are seen as worth the investment and possibly having longerterm positive impact medium costmedium risk efforts include programs to help bring stability and democracy to postconflict societies in which an intrastate conflict has resulted in brokered peace agreement the challenges are often greater and the prospects more uncertain because the populations have only begun process of reconciliation often new systems are being imposed from outside as part of peace settlement without buyin necessarily from all parties these transitions frequently require international enforcement and monitoring with civilian officials and military forces on the ground making such efforts much more costly but with the potential for substantial payoff if they can bring stability to crisis region bolster potential failed states and deny terrorist sanctuaries the road to success may be significantly longer and the outcome much less certain than where democracy was launched from within under relatively stable circumstances such efforts have been seen as achieving positive results in countries of the former yugoslavia east timor and elsewhere the debate among policy makers has centered on the highcost highrisk high stakes cases ie efforts to foster domestically driven transitions from authoritarian regimes and the imposition of regime change through military intervention experts and policy makers are still wrestling with the challenges of whether and how to promote democracy in authoritarian states that are key allies and of strategic importance to the united states in these cases applying principled approach consistent with our rhetoric by pressuring governments to ease repression and instituting real democratic reform could unleash forces far worse than what now exists in these countries some believe often authoritarian governments that the united states needs and that need the united states especially in the fight against terrorism are unwilling to liberalize and warn that to do so would risk bringing extremist forces to the fore on the other hand some argue the failure to oppose regimes viewed as corrupt and ruthless by their own people has been pointed to as one of the major factors impeding us success in the larger battle for hearts and minds especially in the islamic world from which terrorists seek to draw recruits and support the imposition of democracy through military intervention with the ultimate goal of imposing new democratic system is if possible even more problematic regime change through military force has worked in some cases such as grenada in 1983 and panama in 1989 where the goal was to restore preexisting constitutional order in more recent military interventions in afghanistan and iraq to oust existing despotic regimes the goal of building democracy initially was secondary but later became primary the difficulties of establishing democracy in those cases is reminiscent of other cases of military intervention by the united states and other countries such as somalia lebanon and vietnam where questions were raised as to whether the cultural or institutional basis for democracy exists and crs25 whether such conditions could be fostered through intervention70 while some doubt that even limited democracy is possible in such cases others argue that us interests in promoting democracy in afghanistan and iraq as models for middle eastern development is so high that the united states would be making serious error if it did not try even if democracy becomes clearly defined can administrations investing in democracy promotion ever rest assured that country transitioning toward democratic reform will not backslide according to leading democracy expert democracy can deteriorate at any point in its development its quality and stability can never be taken for granted71 some question if once the united states has been involved in democracy promotion in particular country it can ever withdraw and others wonder how many countries can the us government push toward democracy before the american taxpayer says enough by clearly identifying targeting and coordinating assistance to countries that have the greatest potential for succeeding to become democracies72 the us taxpayers stand the best chance of benefitting from foreign policy that includes funding democracy reform overseas 70 see crs report rl30184 military interventions by us forces from vietnam to bosnia background outcomes and lessons learned for kosovo

labour standards is required crs28 appendix b background on congressional democracy promotion activities history congressional interest in us policies aimed at protecting strengthening or reestablishing democracy in other parts of the world has long history after world war ii congress was at first skeptical about further aid to europe but eventually supported administration policies to help wartorn western europe and japan on bipartisan basis the marshall plan and other economic aid programs were endorsed in the belief that us security and prosperity would be furthered by the emergence of stable and prosperous democracies in western europe and japan74 during the cold war this approach was not always followed authoritarian regimes were supported by both congress and the executive branch for example during certain periods in spain portugal greece and turkey as perceived bulwark against the expansion of communism at the same time congress took strong interest in us policies aimed at fostering liberalization and advancing individual freedom and loosening moscows control in sovietdominated communist countries through the 1950s and 1960s much of this support was rhetorical as containment of soviet power within its existing sphere of influence remained the dominant us strategy75 however by the detente period of the 1970s congress saw real opportunities for fostering liberalization in eastern europe following the conclusion of the conference on security and cooperation in europe csce and the signing of the csce final act in 1975 congress established commission the commission on security and cooperation in europe or helsinki commission in 1976 as joint congressional executive body to oversee us efforts to implement provisions that would help to ease government repression and enhance human rights in the soviet sphere76 today the renamed organization for security and cooperation in europe osce has core mission to support democratic development in all 56 member states including the countries of the caucasus and central asia members of congress are directly engaged in that effort through their participation in the osce parliamentary 74 for

particular regard to human rights see httpwwwcscegov crs29 assembly established in 199177 the csce continues to function as largely congressional organization to support and monitor the activities of the osce78 with the fall of communism in central and eastern europe and the collapse of the soviet union between 1989 and 1991 members of congress took strong interest in the evolution of the region they supported and promoted us government democracy assistance programs through the authorization appropriations and oversight process first in poland hungary and czechoslovakia and then in the baltic states and other countries of central and eastern europe major legislation supporting democratic assistance to the region included the support for east european democracy seed act of 1989 pl101179 and the freedom support act fsa of 1991 pl 102511 the latter directed at the newly independent countries of the former soviet union portion of the assistance provided under these acts has gone to the strengthening of democratic institutions as the democratic tide spread to other parts of the world from the early 1990s on congressional interest in democracy promotion also became more universal in some instances congress has supported democracyfocused conditionality in international agreements measures granting trade benefits to foreign countries and admission to certain multilateral organizations so called democracy clauses have been included in number of treaties and international agreements the use of democracy clauses while not widespread has generated growing interest in recent years with the expansion of the number of democracies in the world some of the most effective regional security and trade organizations include democracy criteria among their explicit or implicit membership requirements the most farreaching democracy clauses are contained in provisions of north atlantic european and interamerican organizations enforcement mechanisms vary few explicitly require expulsion of country that abandons democracy community of democracies ministerial conference of 107 nations in warsaw poland june 2000 had on its discussion agenda the topic of incorporating democracy clauses in charter documents for multinational organizations and assessing the value of enforcement mechanisms against member states where democracy is overthrown79 nato was established in 1949 with strong congressional backing as security alliance of countries with shared values beyond this statement of principles specific criteria for membership were spelled out and not all members were democracies throughout the history of the organization however in the nato enlargement process and the nato partnership for peace established in the 1990s commitment to democracy became an explicit criterion for participation with the approval of congress when the first new countries were formally accepted as full members in 1999 poland hungary the czech republic and slovenia it was on the 77 for information on the activities of the assembly see the official website at httpwwwoscepaorg 78 the commission has always been primarily congressional body with executive branch members playing secondary role 79 httpwwwdemocracyconferenceorgcommuniquehtml crs30 basis that they were recognized as fullfledged democracies the european union eu requires implicitly that member countries be democracies given the level of political and economic integration the eu probably could not function if member countries did not have real convergence of political systems democracy criteria are more clearly spelled out in the requirements for accession of new members80 the eu also has stressed principles of democracy in its agreements with other countries and regions thereby using its significant economic leverage to strengthen democracy and human rights in other countries81 one factor widely credited for the relatively smooth and successful democratic transitions of the countries of central and eastern europe is that the associations they sought to ensure their future security and prosperity namely nato and eu membership were attainable only with the consolidation of democratic institutions and processes with this benefit in mind many members of congress are pressing for further nato enlargement and urging the eu to accept other new members similar bills introduced in the house and senate hr 987 and s 494 the nato freedom consolidation act of 2007 seek admittance of new nato members relations with other parliaments congress has history of relations with other democratic parliaments members of congress have attached importance to maintaining legislative dimension to us relations with key neighbors allies and organizations the us congress has long been involved in multilateral parliamentary groups that hold regular exchanges and meetings current groups in which congress participates include the nato parliamentary assembly the parliamentary assembly of the organization for security and cooperation in europe and the transatlantic dialogue the us congresseuropean assembly interparliamentary group formal and regular bilateral parliamentary exchanges have long been held between the us congress and the parliaments of canada mexico and britain other congressional groups have been formed to focus on relations with other individual legislatures including germany japan south korea china and the baltic states interparliamentary meetings have given members an opportunity to establish contacts with their counterparts to compare best practices and to address specific issues of concern to the congress and constituents including human rights in particular the united 80 at its 1993 meeting the eus european council set out very explicit conditions for new states to become eu members these became known as the copenhagen criteria the first condition is that the country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy the rule of law human rights and respect for and protection of minorities each year the european commission prepares report on progress toward accession by candidate countries providing strong incentive to eager candidates to stay on democratic course 81 number of other bilateral and multilateral agreements make reference to democratic principles beginning with the charter the universal declaration on human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights senate approved us mutual defense agreements with countries such as japan 1960 spain 1988 greece 1990 and turkey 1980 make democratic principles foundation of their relations as do number of bilateral economic and scientific agreements the charter of the organization of american states oas affirms as basis the effective exercise of representative democracy see httpwwwoasorgjuridicoenglishcharterhtml crs31 states was founding member of the worldwide organization of parliaments the interparliamentary union ipu although it withdrew from the organization in 1999 after not having participated in meetings since 199482 over the years congress has taken particular interest and on occasion become directly involved in democracy programs to strengthen legislatures in new democracies after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 and the democratic transitions that began in poland and hungary many members of the house and senate traveled to central europe to see developments firsthand several members came back with sense that the us congress should do something as body to show solidarity with and to help strengthen democratic parliaments in the region83 in 1990 congress took the unprecedented step of establishing its own program to assist new democracies develop strong legislatures the first congressional initiative to help the new democratic parliaments of central and eastern europe was directed to poland by the us senate senate concurrent resolution 74 101st congress 1989 established congressional gift of democracy to poland the program provided computers library materials and training from the us senate to the polish senate with the help of the congressional research service crs library of congress and other support agencies the second such initiative was launched by the house of representatives in april 1990 house speaker thomas foley appointed bipartisan task force of members of congress to provide support for the new democratic parliaments of central and eastern europe on the initiative of representative martin frost dtexas he appointed representative frost as chairperson representative gerald b solomon rny became the ranking minority member the house special task force on the development of parliamentary institutions in eastern europe initially focused its efforts on poland hungary and czechoslovakia in 1991 the task force began program of 82 the ipu was established in 1889 as an association of individual parliamentarians and the worlds first permanent multilateral political forum the united states was one of the original participants in ipu activities begun in 1889 and formally joined in 1935 when the house and senate enacted statutory authority for us participation in the ipu 49 stat 425 congressional participation in the ipu gradually diminished in july 1997 congress through the clerk of the house and secretary of the senate notified the ipu that given the diminished congressional participation the us congress could longer justify the annual us contribution of almost 1 million or 15 of the ipu annual budget and had decided to reduce its membership status and proposed to make an annual donation of 500000 to support the aims of the organization the ipu executive committee did not accept the offer so in 1998 congress passed legislation to end us participation on october 1 1999 ultimately attached to pl 105277 sec 2503 it would presumably require new legislation to restore us membership 83 in 1989 the world was surprised by the sudden collapse of the communist regimes throughout central and eastern europe and the equally sudden dissolution of the soviet empire two years later while the process of transition toward multiparty system and market economy had already started in poland and hungary there had been indication of how fast or how far this process would go while the pace and direction of change varied the overwhelming consensus in central and eastern europe favored establishment or restoration of parliamentary democracy and integration with the western countries of the euroatlantic region crs32 assistance to the bulgarian national assembly estonia latvia and lithuania were added to the program in 1992 albania was included in 1993 as were the czech republic and slovakia after the czechoslovak split and romania with the backing of congressional leadership and the joint committee on the library the congressional research service undertook additional programs of cooperation with the russian and ukrainian legislatures us foreign assistance to developing legislatures at the time of these congressional initiatives there were few us foreign aid programs directed at developing legislative infrastructures congress initiated its parliamentary development efforts in eastern europe without any preconceived notion of what was needed the intent was to offer practical assistance without trying to impose american or other models or suggesting specific solutions to given problems the objective was to provide comparative information on how the united states and other countries have approached legislative tasks and solved particular problems it was understood that west european parliamentary models were more relevant to many of the new democracies than was the american congressional model particularly with regard to structures and procedures the task force established legislaturetolegislature program on nonpartisan basis the programs provided technical assistance to strengthening parliamentary infrastructure especially the research and information services streamlining work with modern automation and office systems and providing training to members of parliament and staff the programs aimed to help improve the efficiency of the legislatures enhance the professionalism of members and staff and increase transparency and accountability these programs conceived from the start as shortterm jump starts for nascent democratic parliaments were completed by the end of 1996 by that time legislative strengthening programs had become major focus and priority of other usaidfunded projects building on the frost task force program the us house of representatives program was judged by outside observers including aid evaluators and recipients of the aid in the assisted parliaments to have played unique and important role in helping to strengthen the legislatures of new democracies perhaps most importantly the program provided the direct involvement of members of congress with mps that was seen as giving recognition and boost to the new legislatures at critical time in the recipient parliaments and among the public in those countries there was awareness and appreciation that the us congress was the first legislature to immediately reach out with gesture of support and practical help to the new parliaments the programs were seen as bringing considerable good will toward the united states the house democracy assistance commission after hiatus of many years members of the 109th congress

subjects like committee operations oversight constituent relations parliamentary procedure and the establishment of services like the crs and the congressional budget office cbo this effort will be
