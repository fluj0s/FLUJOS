incentives to address the economic plight of inner cities nd poor rural areas the enterprise zone concept originated in great britain in the mid1970s and emigrated to the united states few years later enterprise zone legislation was introduced in congress as early as 1980 but it was at the state level where experimentation with the concept flourished by the late 1980s over twothirds of the states had embraced the c oncept enacted legislati on and started programs1 contemporaneous with progra m experimentation by the states congress continued working to develop comprehensive federal program of enterprise zones support for some type of federal government initiative increased but there was lack of agreement over whether the enterprise zone approach would produce the economic and social effects sought as well as over how such program should be designed throughout the period the fundamental concept of various enterprise zone legislation remained much the same provide tax incentives and regulatory relief to firms willing to locate in economically distresse d communities so too did the goal to increase investment business formation and em ployment in depresse d areas in order to generate broader economic nd social revitalization wh at changed over time was the approach2 over the years republicans generally we re the chief proponents of the enterprise zone concept they called
