28confidential our investment management research incorporates our proprietary projections of the equilibrium returns and volatility of each asset class over the long term as well as equ ilibrium estimates of the co rrelations among asset classes clearly financial firms ca nnot predict how markets will perform in the future but we do believe that by analyzing current economic and market conditions and historic market trends and then most critically making projections of fu ture economic growth inflation and real yields for each cou ntry we can estimate the equilibrium performance for an entire asset class the equilibrium return is simply the central tendency ver very long period of time around which market returns will tend to fluctuate because it represents the value inherent in that m arket it is possible indeed probable that actual returns will vary cons iderably from this equilibrium even for number of years bu t we believe that market returns will always at some point return to the equilibrium trend we further believe that these kinds of f orward looking assessments are far more accurate than historical trends in deciding what asset class performance will be and how best to determine an optimal asset mix in reviewing this material please understand that all references to expected return are not promises or even estimates of ac tual returns one may achieve they simply show what the equilibrium return should be according to our best estimates also note tha t actual performance may be affected by the expertise of the person who actually manages these investments both in picking indiv idual securities and possibly adjusting the mix pe riodically to take advantage of asset clas s under valuations and overvaluations cau sed by market
