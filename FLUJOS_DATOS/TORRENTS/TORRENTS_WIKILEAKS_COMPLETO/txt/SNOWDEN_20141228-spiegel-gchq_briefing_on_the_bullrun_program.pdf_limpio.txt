top secret strap1 comint bullrun col briefing sheet introduction 1 the ability to exploit targets encrypted communications is extremely fragile and is often enabled through sensitive ec i programmes the need to take additional measures to protect that capability haslongbeen recognised currently virtually all decryption is carried out by ptd processing with decrypts going to the mb in the nocon col some decrypts are placed in the endue col due to the sensitivity or fragility of the exploitation capability 2 in recent years there has been an aggressive effort lead by nsa to make major improvements in defeating network security and privacy involving multiple sources and methods all of which are extremely sensitive and fragile these include computer network exploitation cne collaboration with other intelligence agencies investment in highperformance computers and development of advanced mathematical techniques several ec i compartments may apply to the specific sources methods and techniques involved 3 making the best use of these new capabilities requires that decryption processing be widely deployed beyond ptd and the results of that processing be available to wide range of analysts this inevitably makes it harder to protect this sensitive and fragile capability and we need to counterbalance tin is by introducing measures to control access to this material and heighten awareness of the sensitivities amongst those who have access 4 to achieve this nsa has introduced the bullrun col to protect our abilities to defeat the encryption used in network communication technologies this covers both the fact of capability against specific technology and resulting decrypts which may be either plaintext or metadata events gchq is also introducing bullrun csec dsd and gcsb are expected to do likewise control authority 5 the bullrun col is owned by the deputy director for penetrating target defences ptd authority to manage thecojisdelegated to the ptd

their sigint partners have capabilities against specific network security technologies as well as the number and scope of successes these capabilities are among the sigint communitys most fragile and the inadvertent disclosure of the simple fact of could alert the adversary and result in immediate loss of the capability consequently any admission of fact of capability to defeat encryption used in specific network communication technologies or disclosure of details relating to that capability must be protected by the bullrun co i and restricted to those specifically 1 of 4 this information is
