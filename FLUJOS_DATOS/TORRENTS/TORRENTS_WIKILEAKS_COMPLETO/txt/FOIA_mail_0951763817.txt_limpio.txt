from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to michael mann mannmultiproxyevscvirginiaedu subject re newest reconstruction date mon feb 28 135017 2000 cc kbriffauea tosbornuea at 1156 250200 0500 you wrote i need your newest northern hemisphere densitybased treering reconstruction and appropriate reference for updating ipcc please send in ascii format as soon as possible so we can incorporate i hope all is well thanks hi mike keith asked to get back to you on this the reconstruction is the same as the one i sent on the 5th october 1999 but im sending it again in case that email isnt handy the reconstruction has now been published in the following paper briffa kr 2000 annual climate variability in the holocene interpreting the message of ancient trees quaternary science reviews 19 87105 this paper does not however give full details about how the reconstruction was obtained the details are not yet published but will soon be submitted briffa kr osborn tj schweingruber fh harris ic jones pd shiyatov sg and vaganov ea 2000 lowfrequency temperature variations from northern treering density network in preparation to be submitted to journal of geophysical research details about the file im sending you repeated from 5th oct 99 the data are attached to this email they go from 1402 to 1994 although we usually stop the series in 1960 because of the recent nontemperature signal that is superimposed on the treering data that we use i havent put 40yr smoothing through them i thought it best if you were to do this to ensure the same filter was used for all curves the data ive sent are calibrated over the period 18811960 against the instrumental aprsep tempratures averaged over all land grid boxes that have observed data that are north of 20n as such the mean of our reconstruction over 18811960 matches the mean of the observed target series over the same period since the observed series consists of degrees c anomalies wrt to 196190 we say that the reconstructed series also represents degrees c anomalies wrt to 196190 ive already truncated the series at 1960 because of the problems with the recent period best regards tim
