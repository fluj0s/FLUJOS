registration and disclosure requirements of the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 as amended by the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 pl 11081 s 1 110th congress the foreign agents registration act the issue of the propriety of contingency fees for lobbying restrictions on lobbying with federal funds postemployment revolving door lobbying activities by former federal officials and house and senate ethics rules relevant to contacts with private lobbyists the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 was enacted to replace nearly 50year old lobbying registration law that was seen as vague and inadequate the current lobbying registration and disclosure provisions establish clearer criteria and thresholds for determining when an organization should register its employees or staff as lobbyists or when lobbying firm or individual lobbyist needs to register and identify clients the act is directed at professional lobbyists that is those who receive payments to lobby for an employer or client and requires the registration and reporting of certain identifying information and general broad financial data in addition to the lobbying disclosure act the foreign agents registration act requires the registration and reporting from those who act as agents of foreign government or foreign political party and who engage in lobbying or other similar political advocacy activities on behalf of their foreign principal various provisions of federal law have been enacted and regulations promulgated to restrict the use of any federal funds for lobbying purposes either by the agencies of the federal government or by federal contractors or grantees in attempts to limit what has been perceived to be potential undue or improper influence in governmental processes restrictions have been adopted to limit the postemployment lobbying of certain high ranking officials of the federal government for period of time after they leave government service revolving door laws additionally to deal with similar perceptions of undue or improper influence and access both houses of congress have adopted internal rules regarding the acceptance of gifts and favors by members officers or employees of the house or senate from private sources particularly from registered lobbyists or agents of foreign principals or their clients gifts may be accepted by members officers or employees except as permitted in the rules of the respective chamber and thus even small gifts as well as more significant travel expenses for conferences or fact finding events provided to congressional members and staff from private parties such as lobbyists and their clients are regulated and restricted by the provisions of house and senate rule under the new ethics and lobbying law pl 11081 registered lobbyists must be familiar with these restrictions and regulations on gifts to members of congress in house and senate rules and must certify to the government that they have not offered gifts or things of value to members or staff which would violate these rules httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31126g14g152g139g139g162g146g151g144g561g5g152g151

the activities involved in lobbying are intertwined with fundamental first amendment rights of speech association and petition1 and may facilitate the exchange of important information and ideas between the government and private parties2 for those who act in representative capacity for client lobbying the legislature for change in the state of the law may be an important part of the services provided to the client however because of the substantial potential for undue or wrongful influence from those who are paid to influence the legislative process there has developed body of law and rules to regulate lobbying activities as well as to regulate the activities of public officials in their interactions with those who lobby particularly with reference to the potentially corrupting effect of large sums of money on the legislative process3 there are several federal statutory laws as well as rules of the house and senate which either apply to lobbying directly or which are relevant to congressional lobbyists because the provisions bear upon members or congressional employees dealings with those who attempt to influence the legislative process although the internal house and senate rules apply directly only to those who come with in their respective jurisdictions the new statutory provisions amending the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 require registered lobbyist to be familiar with the house and senate ethics rules on gifts and reimbursements prohibit lobbyists from offering gifts the receipt of which would violate those congressional rules and require lobbyists to certify that gifts have been offered to members of congress or staff which would be in violation of the chambers rules 4 1 united states v harriss 347 us 612 1954 united states v rumely 345 us 41

amendment protections and guarantees the federal regulation of lobbying activities engaged in by private citizens principally takes the form of disclosure and reporting of such activities and the financing behind those activities as opposed to any specific limitations or restrictions on advocacy even when regulation on lobbying merely requires disclosures and reporting such regulation in the area of political and publicpolicy advocacy may still be subject to careful scrutiny by the courts court decisions in this and related areas have looked to determine whether there exists any chilling of or deterrent to the exercise of citizens first amendment rights caused by such required disclosures and if so whether any theoretical or indirect chilling of speech is counterbalanced by important governmental and societal interests promoted by the regulations such as transparency and openness in government and the protection of basic governmental processes from undue influences 5

completely rewrote the 50year old law the federal regulation of lobbying act of 1946 which had required certain registrations and disclosures of lobbying activities directed at members of congress the lobbying disclosure act of 19956 now provides more specific thresholds and clearer and broader definitions of who is lobbyist and what lobbying activities and contacts will trigger the requirements for the registration and reporting of persons who are compensated to engage in lobbying the lobbying disclosure law was amended substantially in 2007 in the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 7 to provide further and more frequent disclosures information and reporting from those professional lobbyists covered by the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 the new reporting and disclosures will generally apply to the information which is required to be filed in the calendar quarters beginning after january 1 2008 8 other information to be included in reports concerning particularly the interaction of covered lobbyists and government officials in the making or offering of gifts donations payments or contributions from such lobbyists and their clients to or on behalf of federal public officials will be filed semiannually concerning those sixmonth periods after january 1 20089 the 2007 amendments to the lobbying disclosure laws were not intended primarily to increase the number of persons who are required to register and report as lobbyists under the lda thus the definitions of who is covered lobbyist and of what are lobbying contacts and lobbying activitiesand therefore who must register and report under the lawwere not substantively amended by the 2007 act10 rather the amendments in 2007 were substantially directed at 5 united states v harriss 347 us 612 1954 mcconnell

those who are compensated to engage in certain lobbying activities on behalf of client or an employer 11 in addition to covering only those who ar paid to lobby the initial triggering provisions of the law cover only the conduct of lobbying which involves direct contacts with covered officials the laws registration requirements are not separately triggered by grass roots lobbying activities that is an organization which engages only in grass roots lobbying regardless of the extent of grass roots lobbying activities will not be required to register its members officers or employees who engage in such activities12 for purposes of discussing the lda requirements it is useful to recognize two general categories of lobbyists 1 in house lobbyists of an organization or businessemployees of that organization or business who are compensated at least in part to lobby on its behalf and 2 outside lobbyistsmembers of lobbying firm partnership or sole proprietorship that engage in lobbying for outside clients when registration is required from paid lobbyist under the lobbying law such registration is done by the organization employing that individuallobbyist or by an outside lobbying firm including an individual sole practitioner who is lobbyist for outside clients business or organization which has employees who engage in certain amount of lobbying on its behalf in house lobbyists must thus register and identify its employeelobbyists 13 lobbying firms or entities including sole practitioners who lobby or have employees partners or associates who continued pl 11081 to conform to the new quarterly rather than semiannual filing but the thresholds are not otherwise lowered with the intention of covering more persons as lobbyists assuming pro rata expenditure of time and money more persons will not necessarily qualify as l obbyists under the amended law but the new provisions do have the effect of lowering by half the thresholds for minimum or sporadic lobbying efforts 11 see hrept 104339 104th cong 1st sess at 2 1995 12 once an organization has met the threshold requirements for direct lobbying and is registered certain background activities and efforts in support of its direct lobbying contacts which may include activities which also support other activities or communications which are not lobbying contacts such as grass roots lobbying efforts may need to be disclosed generally as lobbying activities 2 usc 16027 note hrept 104339 104 th cong1st sess lobbying disclosure act of 1995 1314 1995 the instructions of the clerk of the house and secretary of the

the previous lobby registration statute which had been enacted in 1946 as interpreted by the supreme court in united states v harriss supra was criticized for employing general and equivocal test for registration and reporting concerning whether lobbying was ones main or principal purpose and for providing specific thresholds or clear measures to trigger the requirements of the law the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 as amended however provides more specific thresholds triggering measures and minimis amounts there is minimis expense and minimis income threshold below which the requirement for registration by organizations and by lobbying groups or firms will not be triggered any organization which uses its own employees as lobbyists inhouse lobbyists will not need to register if the organizations total expenses for lobbying activities do not for the quarterly reporting period beginning january 1 2008 exceed the statutory amount of 10000 or if past adjustments are considered 12225

subject to the contingency prohibitions46 contingency fees are also prohibited for lobbying the congress by persons who must register as agents of foreign principals under the foreign agents registration act the prohibition is upon agreements where the amount of payment is contingent in whole or in part upon the success of any political activities carried on by such agent47 the covered political activities of such agents under the foreign agents registration ac t include any activity which the agent intends to in any way influence any agency or official of the government of the united states with reference to formulating adopting or changing the domestic or foreign policies of the united states and thus includes the activities of lobbying members and staff of congress on legislation or appropriations48 although there is general federal law expressly barring all contingency fees for successful lobbying before congress there is long history of judicial precedent and traditional judicial opinion which indicates that such contingency fee arrangements when in reference to lobbying and the use of influence before legislature on general legislation are void from their origin ab initio for public policy reasons and therefore would be denied enforcement in the courts49 explaining the reason for such policy justice oliver wendell holmes writing for the court noted that it was the tendency in such contract agreements to provide incentives towards corruption as such agreements invited and tended to induce improper solicitations intensified by the contingency of the reward 50 it should be noted that the laws of 39 states prohibit outright and the laws of 40th state limit the amount of contingency fees for successful legislative lobbying51 and this may further limit the probability of judicial enforcement of contingency fee contract even one for lobbying the congress while the tradition and practice have been for the courts to look disfavorably upon contingency fee arrangements for successfully influencing public officials in performing discretionary actions it should be noted that in some instances contingency fee contracts based on the success of legislation have been upheld and enforced in few courts when the duties contracted for were professional services that did not involve traditional statutorily defined lobbying or the use of 46 the reason for this contingency fee ban has been explained as follows contractors arrangements to pay contingent fees for soliciting or obtaining government contracts have long been considered contrary to public policy because such arrangements may lead to attempted or actual exercise of improper influence nash schooner obrien the government contract reference book comprehensive guide to the language

they used to obtain such federal program monies or contracts57 charitable organizations including religious organizations which are exempt from taxation under section 501c3 of the internal revenue code organizations to which contributions may be tax deductible for the donor under 170c2 are limited in the amount of lobbying in which they may engage if they wish to preserve this preferred taxexempt status from the federal government 58 section 18 of the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 places statutory restrictions upon the lobbying activities of certain nonprofit organizations whic h are taxexempt under section 501c4 of the internal revenue code this provision which is commonly called the simpson amendment prohibits section 501c4 social welfare organizations from engaging in any lobbying activities even with their own private funds if the organization receives any federal grant loan or award 59 the legislative history of the provision clearly indicates however that 501c4 organization may separately incorporate an affiliated 501c4 which will not receive any federal funds and which could engage in unlimited lobbying60 the method of separately incorporating an affiliate to lobby which was described by the amendments sponsor as splitting was apparently intended to place degree of separation between federal money and private lobbying while permitting an organization to have voice through which to exercise its protected first amendment rights of speech expression and petition if they decided to split into two separate 501c4s they could have one organization whic h could both receive funds and lobby without limits 61 it may also be noted that while 501c4s which receive certain federal funds may not engage in lobbying activities the term lobbying activities as used in that prohibition is expressly defined in that law to include only direct lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts such as preparation planning research and other background work intended for use in such contacts 62 organizations which engage only in grass roots lobbying and public advocacy and do not make direct contacts or communications with covered officials would therefore not appear to be engaging in any prohibited lobbying activities as defined under this provision 57 31 usc 1352b see common agency regulations implementing byrd amendment at 55 fr 67356756

rights by denying benefits to those who exercise them lobbying activities are not one of the contemplated exempt functions of these organizations for which they have received the preferred tax status

supervisory ethics office to promulgate in rules and regulations exceptions to the general statutory prohibition and to set out the circumstances in which it would be permissible for employees to accept certain pa yments gifts or reimbursements from outside private sources77 it should be noted however that since the exceptions in the house and senate gift rules allow for the receipt of gifts in certain circumstances but do not authorize the solicitation of any such gifts members officers and employees are still prohibited by law from soliciting any gifts from those doing business with or seeking action from the congress members officers and employees of the house and the senate have since 1995 been under restrictive rules on gifts and travel reimbursements somewhat similar to the current rules put in place in 200778 the 2007 changes implemented further restrictions on the interaction of registered lobbyists or their clients with members and staff of congress particularly with reference to minimis gifts and travel reimbursements but perhaps even more significantly also instituted procedures and requirements which will allow for more oversight disclosure and enforcement of

from outside private sources unless specifically permitted by the rules of the respective body79 although the general rule is that the receipt of all gifts is generally prohibited unless authorized by the rules the house and senate rules list over 20 express exceptions to the gift prohibition 23 in the house and 24 in the senate including an additional category of exception for the receipt of travel expenses or reimbursements in certain cases for officially connected travel the limitations and prohibitions in these rules apply not only to gifts given directly to the member officer or employee of the house or sena but also gifts to family member of the member officer or employee if the gift is given with the knowledge and acquiescence of the member officer or employee and if the member officer or employee has reason to believe the gift was given because of his or her official position 80 g9g146g143g157g156g561g143g155g152g150g561g14g152g139g139g162g146g156g157g156g561 while gifts from all private sources are generally covered by the prohibitions and restrictions of the house and senate gift rules the congressional rule provisions may apply to gifts from lobbyists on an even more restrictive basis certain exceptions to the general prohibitions might allow members and staff to receive particular kinds of gifts from the general public but will not exempt such gifts if they are from registered lobbyists from agents of foreign principals registered under the foreign agents registration act or from their clients for example the under50 exception in the house and senate gift rules which allows members and staff to generally accept gifts from private sources if gift is valued under 50 and which had in the past allowed members and staff to accept gifts such as bottle of liquor or wine tickets to certain sporting or entertainment events and meals regardless of the source of such gifts will longer allow the receipt of such gifts under this exception if the gift is provided by lobbyist foreign agent or private client of the lobbyist or foreign agent 81 additionally while lobbyist or foreign agent may be relative or personal friend of member officer and employee and may thus fit within one of those two exceptions to the gift ban the personal hospitality of lobbyist or foreign agent is not separately exempt from the rules prohibitions and thus members and employees may not accept meals or lodging in the home of lobbyist solely under the personal hospitality exemption 82 similarly while contributions to an authorized legal defense fund are generally permitted as an express exemption to the gifts rules such contributions may not be received from lobbyists or foreign agents under that exemption83 79 house rule 25 cl 5a1ai senate rule 35 1a1 80

prohibited from receiving anything from lobbyists and agents of foreign principals for an entity or organization that is maintained or controlled by member officer or employee84 are prohibited from directing or designating charitable contributions from lobbyist or foreign agent other than contribution in lieu of an honorarium if properly reported within 30 days85 and may not accept financial contribution or expenditure from lobbyist or foreign agent for conference or retreat or the like sponsored by or affiliated with an official congressional orga nization for or on behalf of members officers or employees 86 under recent amendments members of the house and senate are not allowed to participate in any event honoring that member during the national political convention of that members political party if the event is sponsored by registered lobbyist or private entity retaining such registered lobbyist87 regarding the provision of travel expenses or reimbursement for such expenses to members officers and employees of congress the general exception which allows in certain limited circumstances and under particular guidelines members and staff to participate in officially connected travel activities conferences factfindings and symposia paid for by outside private sources will not apply and the receipt of such expenses or reimbursements will be prohibited if registered lobbyist foreign agent or client of such lobbyist or foreign agent pays for such travel or where lobbyist is involved in the planning of or participation in the event this and the other exceptions to the general prohibition on receiving gifts from outside private sources are discussed in more detail following

gifts from private sources and allow for the acceptance of gift including the gift of meal if the gift has value of less than 5088 gifts aggregating 100 or more in year from any one source however may not be accepted any gift of 10 or more will be counted toward the yearly aggregate but specific accounting or formal record keeping for all such gifts of 10 or more is expressly required by the rules although this exception generally allows acceptance of under50 gifts from many sources this general exception for gifts of under 50 is not available to allow such gift from registered lobbyist an agent of foreign principal or their private clients 89 this does not necessarily mean that absolutely gifts may be given or offered to or accepted by member or employee of congress from registered lobbyists or their clients but rather that any such gift to be permitted must be given offered or accepted under another exception different than the under50 exception to the gift rule for example certain items of nominal value or with little intrinsic value such as greeting cards baseball caps and tshirts are also expressly exempt from the gifts limitation and there is limitation of this exception for gifts of nominal value or little intrinsic 84 house rule 25 cl 5e1 senate rule 35 3a 85 house rule 25 cl 5e2 and f senate rule 35 3b and 4 86 house rule 25 cl 5e4 senate rule 35 3d 87 pl

exemption from the strict gifts prohibitions are gifts from ones relatives and gifts from personal friends the ho use and senate gift bans seeking not to unduly interfere with normal family and personal relationships allow the receipt and exchange of gifts from and between family members and from broadly defined category of relatives 91 similarly members officers and employees may c ontinue to exchange gifts with or receive gifts from personal friends92 if gift from personal friend is to exceed 250 in value however the member officer or employee must get written determination from the house committee on standards of official conduct in the house or the senate select committee on ethics in the senate that the exception still applies 93 in an effort not to create too large potential loophole within the gifts rules by allowing one to merely claim that any giftgiver is friend the rules establish more objective criteria to be considered in determining whether one qualifies as personal friend including whether the member officer or employee has history of personal friendship and gift exchange with this individual whether the individual in question paid personally for the gift or was reimbursed or claimed tax deduction for it and whether the member officer or employee knew that similar gifts were given by this individual to other members officer or employees 94 person who is lobbyist by profession but is also relative or personal friend as defined of member of congress or of congressional staffer may therefore continue to participate in normal gift giving and gift exchanges based on that personal relationship with his or her relative friend or fiancee

officer or employee and may not be accepted unless it meets other specific exceptions 95 since there is general exemption for gifts of less than 50 however meal may generally be accepted as long as the value of the meal is below that amount and does not exceed the 100 yearly aggregate from that one source and is not offered by lobbyis t foreign agent or private client of the 90 house rule 25 cl

offered simultaneously same time and place to both member officer or employee and his or her spouse or dependent only the food provided to the member officer or employee will be considered gift for the purpose of figuring the amount of such gift under the rules97 it should be noted also that under both the house and senate rules refreshments and food of nominal value when not part of meal are so expressly exempt from the gifts restriction and may be accepted without violation of the gift rules98 this exception would appear to allow one to partake of refreshments appetizers hors doeuvres and drinks commonly served at receptions and parties without regard to the gift prohibition and without regard to whether the sponsor is lobbyist lobbying organization or an entity which employs lobbyists although meals are generally included in the defi nition of gift and although free meals from private individuals or organizations are not in themselves exempt from the gift ban there are number of situations and instances where member officer or employee may accept such meal under the house and senate gift rules even without regard to the 50 minimis limitation members officers and employees would be able to accept such gifts of meals when in connection with attendance at political fundraising event sponsored by political organization99 from family and personal friends100 in connection with outside private business employment activities employment discussions wi th prospective employer or when provided by political organization in connection with campaign event sponsored by the political organization101 in the course of permissible training events when served to all attendees as an integral part of the event102 when an individual provides personal hospitality at his or her personal or family residence but registered lobbyist or agent of foreign principal does not qualify for the personal hospitality exemption103 in connection with the permissible attendance at widely attended gatherings including charitable events when taken in group setting104 or in connection with the acceptance of necessar expenses for approved factfinding or other officially connected travel or conference expenses under the specific rules and restrictions for such officially connected events105 96 in the house gift rule change in 2003 provides that the value of food sent by an outside private source to congressional office for the staff will be prorated among the em ployees sharing the items to determine if such value is less than 50 per staff employee rather than having the entire amount attributable to the employing member as previously done house rule 25 clause 5a1b hres 5 108 th congress january 7 2003 the house committee on standards of official conduct has noted certain caveats in this provision including the direction that food must be refused entirely if the person offering it has direct interest in the particular legislation or other official business on which staff is working at the time and that any such gifts may not be solicited recent gift rule amendment memorandum april 11 2003 at 12 even minimis under50 gifts however may longer be accepted from

rule and that lobbyist or foreign agent has requested or arranged for the travel to be provided 121 exceptions for certain organizations to restrictions on sponsorship of trips there are two exceptions made to the congressional rules restrictions on sponsorship of or payment for officially connected travel by certain organizations these two exceptions are relevant to an organization or group which would otherwise be prohibited from paying for or sponsoring such travel because the group employs or retains one or more persons who lobby on behalf of that organization educational house or charitable senate groups groups or organizations that employ lobbyist or foreign agent may provide sponsorship or payment of officially connected travel if in the house the group is an accredited institution of higher education or in the senate the group is in the broader category of 501c3 charitable educational or scientific organization approved by the senate select committee on ethics 122

the united states and seven days for foreign travel124 under the house exception which allows institutions of higher education employing lobbyists to provide travel expenses it appears to be

apparently permitted for lobbyist to be involved in the planning organization request or arrangement of travel sponsored by an institution of higher education127 while under senate rules the senate

oneday events must in the house be only minimis133 in the senate the senate select committee on ethics is instructed to issue regulations identifying when activities of lobbyists are to be considered minimis and not in violation of the restriction on lobbyists participation in the planning organizing or arranging of such events134 necessary and reasonable expenses recreation entertainment expenses the permission to accept necessary travel expenses for events in connection with the duties of member officer or employee as an officeholder permits members and staff to accept reasonable expenses for such travel as described in congressional rules such expenses would generally cover items such as transportation lodging conference fees and materials and food and refreshments135 the permission to accept necessary and reasonable expenses does not allow however nor had it previously allowed for the acceptance of travel expenses for any events which are substantially recreational in nature136 nor does the permission extend to the acceptance of expenses for any recreational activities or for expenditures for entertainment other than that provided to all attendees as an integral part of the event137 thus even on legitimate officially connected travel the expenses for ones recreational activities during ones free time such as golfing green fees or for recreational equipment rentals are subject to the under50 gift limitation or other restrictions and prohibitions in the house and senate rules on gifts and would in most cases be required to be paid out of pocket by the individual

mind that in addition to express written rules either the house or the senate may exercise its constitutional authority for the selfprotection and integrity of the institution by disciplining member or employee of that body for conduct which violates express house or senate rule or law but which is found contrary to acceptable ethical norms andor which tends to bring the institution into dishonor or disrepute 154 for example the senate has censured senator for placing paid lobbyist for trade association w ith interests in particular tariff legislation on the staff of the committee considering that legislation with access to the confidential committee material in this censure of senator bingham in 1929 for conduct which violated express rule or law the resolution noted that the action of the senator while not the result of corrupt motives on the part of the senator from connecticut is contrary to good morals and senatorial ethics and tends to bring the senate into dishonor and disrepute 155 the house of representatives has disciplined members based in part on violations of provisions of the code of ethics for government service which states among other provisions that an elected or appointed official in the government should not accept favors or benefits under circumstances which may be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his government duties 156 members staff and those who deal with them on professional basis must thus be cognizant not only of express ethics rules regulations and statutory provisions but must also be sensitive to

whenever things of value are offered to public official consideration should be given to the federal criminal law provisions that concern bribery and illegal gratuities and to those provisions of federal criminal law proscribing fraudulent deprivation of the honest services of public official under the bribery law federal official may not corruptly receive or solicit and one may corruptly offer or give anything of value in return for being influenced in the performance of any official act 165 the corrupt nature of the transaction is part of the required intent which is characteristic of bribe this element of the offensea corrupt agreement or bargainhas been described as requiring some express or implied quid pro quo involved in the transaction that is something given in exchange for something else166 the bribe under these circumstances must be shown to be the thing that is the prime mover or producer of the official act performed or 157 2 usc 441g 158 2 usc 441b 441c 159 2

the thing of value given as bribe since the recipient public official need not benefit personally from bribe that is received by third party such as campaign committee in united states v anderson 168 the court upheld the conviction of registered lobbyist for mailorder company for bribing senator with campaign contributions to vote on certain postal rate legislation when the evidence was sufficient to indicate corrupt intent to influence by means of such payments as opposed to the permissible activity of merely giving campaign contributions inspired by the recipients general position of support on particular legislation 169 in addition to the bribery clause the socalled illegal gratuities section of the same statute prohibits the giving or the receipt of something of value other than as provided by law for or because of an official act done or to be done170 campaign contributions given for political candidate who is federal officeholder are unlikely to be involved in the case of illegal gratuities since the thing of value given in the case of an illegal gratuity unlike for bribe must be received for the official personally or for himself171 however as to personal gifts to public official it should be noted that the illegal gratuities clause is less exacting than the bribery clause as to the required intent the illegal gratuities section does not require specific corrupt intent nor corrupt bargain or quid pro quo such that the gift or other thing of value is the motivator or the influence for the official act as is required in the bribery provision 172 rather the illegal gratuities provision requires merely that the thing of value given or received was other than as provided by law and was given or received for or because of some identifiable official act since the illegal gratuity need not be the motivator of an official act nor is it required that the illegal gratuity be intended to influence an official act an illegal gratuity may even be given after an act has already been performed as thank you or in appreciation for the official act the supreme court explained the differing intents required in the two clauses as follows the distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent element bribery requires intent to influence an official act or to be influenced in an official act while illegal gratuity requires only that the gratuity be given or accepted for or because of an official act in other words for bribery there must be quid pro quo specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act an illegal gratuity on the other hand may 167 united states v brewster supra at 72 82 168 509 f2d 312 dccir 1974 cert denied 420 us 991 1975 169 id at 330331 political contributions to entities do not in themselves constitute bribes even though many contributors hope that the official will act favorably because of their contributions united states v tomblin supra at 1379 170 18 usc 201c 171 united states v brewster supra at 77 the statute was amended in 1986 pl 99646 46fg 100 stat 3601 3604 to provide technical amendments to the criminal code including changing the terms for himself to personally there is indication of an intent to change the substance of the elements of the offense if facts are developed that contributions ostensibly made to third party or entity for or because of official acts done or to be done by public official were in fact used or expended in manner to financially enrich or financially benefit the official personally then it might be argued that such funds were received personally or for himself contributions to campaign committee therefore which are wrongfully converted to personal use and are used for example to pay for personal living expenses of public official or other personal expenses such as transportation clothing or food might arguably be considered payments received personally for or by the official 172 brewster supra at 72 united

official will take and may have already determined to take or for past act that he has already taken173 although specific illegal bargain or corrupt intent in giving or receiving an illegal gratuity need be shown there is nevertheless criminal intent requirement embodied in the characterization illegal gratuity the criminal receipt of payment as distinguished from mere gift unrelated to any official act that intent has been described as knowingly being compensated or rewarded or intending to compensate or reward an official other than as provided by law for ones salary for an official governmental act already performed or to be performed in the future by the official 174 while some cases in the circuits had gone so far as to find that specific official act need not be contemplated or identified for payment or gift to constitute an illegal gratuity as long as the payment or gift was given to recipient who is in position to use his authority in manner which could affect the gift giver 175 the supreme court in the sundiamond case confirmed that such socalled status gifts unconnected to any identified official act were not violative of the criminal illegal gratuities provision176 such so called status gifts without the requisite criminal intent of connection to any official act are regulated and controlled by federal regulations and administrative provisions for executive branch officers and employees 177 and in the case of members and employees of congress are governed by the house and senate rules discussed above it should be noted that congress in 1988 amended the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes to expressly include within the scope of those criminal laws scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services178 under the current mail fraud and wire fraud statutes therefore when member of congress r eceives something of value such as gift from lobbyist or another private individual an d there can be shown some connection between the gift and public services provided or some influence intended by the donor or recipient on the performance of an official service by the member of congress then violation of this law might be established the exact parameters of the prohibition the required connection or nexus of the gift to particular service and the precise kinds of official acts that would constitute the services contemplated by the law are however not entirely settled as matters of federal law 179 173 united states v sundiamond growers supra at 404405 174 united states v brewster supra at 81 82

attorneys may be called upon more often than others to provide legislative representational services for clients when lobbying the congress as in providing other professional services for client there are certain ethical rules guidelines and considerations which are unique to and need to be recognized and observed by attorneys the american bar association has promulgated model rules of professional conduct which have been adopted in one form or another within the various jurisdictions these rules discuss ethical considerations and norms for attorneys in not only representing clients before courts but also in representing clients in nonadjudicatory matters such as before legislature rule 39 advocate in nonadjudicative proceedings lawyer representing client before legislative or administrative tribunal in non adjudicative proceeding shall disclose that the appearance is in representative capacity and shall conform to the provisions of rules 33a through c 34a through c and 35 comment 1 in representation before bodies such as legislatures municipal councils and executive and administrative agencies acting in ru lemaking or policymaking capacity lawyers present facts formulate issues and advance argument in the matters under consideration the decisionmaking body like court should be able to rely on the integrity of the submissions made to it lawyer appearing before such body should deal with the tribunal honestly and in conformity with applicable rules of procedure 2 lawyers have exclusive right to appear before nonadjudicative bodies as they do before court the requirements of this rule therefore may subject lawyers to regulations inapplicable to advocates who are not lawyers however legislatures and administrative agencies have right to expect lawyers to deal with them as they deal with courts the ethical rules referenced in rule 39 concern among other items duties of attorneys not to knowingly make false statements or to fail to disclose material fact to tribunal when such nondisclosure may further fraud or criminal act of the client rule 33 as well as specific prohibitions on improper and undue influence of an officer rule 35 the model rules of professional conduct also note that it is professional misconduct for lawyer to state or imply an ability to influence improperly government agency or official rule 84e attorneys should also be aware that in addition to federal postemployment revolving door laws under the american bar association model rules after lawyer leaves public employment he shall not represent private client in connection with matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as public officer or employee unless the appropriate government agency consents after consultation180 this may in some instances limit the representational activities of attorneys for clients before congress when the attorneys have left public employment the issue would most likely not arise in the context of general lobbying 180 aba model rules of professional conduct rule 111 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31126g14g152g139g139g162g146g151g144g561g5g152g151
