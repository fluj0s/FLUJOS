6206c14 shspec157 listing in 3ga you can form up the wording for an ordinary goal quite easily for instance if the goal is to catch catfish you would use ___ ___ 1 want to catch catfish 2 not want who or what would ___ 3 oppose catching catfish 4 not oppose note that we had to change the wording of the goal to fit in the oppose and not oppose lines if there is any doubt about the acceptability of changing the wording of the goal just put the words the goal after want etc this has to be done frequently with negative goal in order to avoid an awkward double negative this procedure is still imperfect but there is way to get it perfect see p 285 for an amendment on the wording the goal is prime postulate that has accumulated onto itself number of identities by which the purpose could be executed the goal or the pc in taking on this goal as prime postulate has assumed these identities because there were people who didnt want the goal who were stupid and incomprehensible see p 247 so one had to prove to them that the goal was ok there were other people who desperately opposed this goal there were bunch more who were somehow associated with it if you cant express these four flows on your listings the process wont go clean to change wording in midflight can be quite upsetting to the pc so after you have done the prepcheck and the goal is reading beautifully be sure of that wording it should register be certain that it is the wording for the four flows for that goal this is not to say that you will never change the wording of listing sometimes you have to when you find that the line never has listed you will probably list on low sensitivity to get reads on the tone arm easily every fifth session prepcheck she whole subject of goals listing and auditing newly just as in goals assessment and run middle ruds every time you stop running list whether they are needed or not there is period of action for each list that decreases the length of time list is active before you leave it becomes progressively shorter ta action will be good then it will get slow do midruds then go to the next list establish pattern we cant tell where this prime postulate the goal will sit on the pcs crack or what gpm cycle this thing precedes we dont know that so we dont know how much bank we are relieving in running this goal but normally half an hour of listing on list seems overly long when starting off on muckedup pc you would probably only be able to do one list per session to get all the ta out this procedure is not necessarily recommended since it is unbalancing and impractical so you had better do the listing by count of stems or by minutes at first however if you stop pc in the middle of an automaticity he gets suppression so allowing for automaticities you should more or less list an arbitrary number of items for each list listing say fifteen minutes for each list none of those lists will be exhausted by doing it this way if the pc gets into an automaticity for heavens sakes dont stop him in his tracks because he will do suppress if pc is listing rapidly and freely let him go on listing none of these automaticities will go for more than 150 items more or less on listing it is very bad form to 1 tell the pc to wait while you write down an item 2 fail to write down an item either one is crime you pays your money and you takes your chance learn to write faster than is about all you can do pcs can be encouraged to common lag but this is not advised either your four lists should be kept to approximately equal lengths one may tend to be shorter eg not oppose if this happens list the short one as extensively as possible and list the others as briefly as you can in the first part of listing you list by arbitrary number it doesnt matter too much what the number is since there is so much mass to get into however later on you will find yourself running into free needle and it is crime to continue to list line on which free needle has appeared because you are running process that is not producing change when you get the fn you test the next line if it doesnt disturb the fn test the next line and so on when you have all four flows fning that goal is dead go find the next goal if line does stop the fn list it to fn or for awhile until you see that it is not going to fn then go on to the next line this evens out all the charge so that at the end all the lists will be equal not in length but in amount of charge blown i must caution you against the sins of overlisting listing flat process is an auditors code break see the auditors code of 1954 13 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer this is in the creation of human ability p 3 it will upset the pc but that is not why you shouldnt do it the goal you are operating with on this pc is not the prime postulate by which he entered this universe it is only the beginning of some cycles that you have laid your paws on by goals assessment it has some harmonic against an earlier goal so if you overlist you push the pc back into an earlier gpm or pull up earlier track out of place so just list the lines to fn not beyond fn it is relief to talk to you about what you do with free needle toward the end you will find the time so short on each list that putting midruds in every time you change lists is too frequent so do it after the pc has listed ten to fifteen items however many lists that may be the only reason pc stops listing is that he has some middle rudiment out this is true for both goals listing and lines listing pc can accumulate enough charge between sessions that the middle ruds have to be prepchecked to clean it all up never get the idea that the pc can run out of items pcs dont think of items they deal them off the bank if he had more items to deal off he would have more gpm so the pc stops listing only when the midruds are out and he therefore cant get into communication what do you do when you have brought one goal four lists to fn in earlier days you would have called him clear you could still call him clear and get his fn back with little cleanup of ruds any time watch your acknowledgements in listing writing the item down is acknowledging you can also go mhm and make little encouraging noises dont give fullstop ack that ends cycle and acts as an inval an auditor listing can feel so much like secretary with all that inflow that he loses control of the session so when you have stopped listing give good acknowledgement and do brisk middle ruds looking like proper auditor in listing you must look like an auditor during ruds because you look so little like an auditor the rest of the time then when the midruds are clean you go back to listing with good auditing command it is the last command you will give until you stop listing that list it is an awfully long auditing answer the pc lists for two pages then you go mhm any more you repeat the question gently who or what makes for plurality of answers the pc doesnt lose the command if he runs down you can give the command again to get more if he simply refuses to go on get middle ruds in also get them in at the end of the list give the pc the rfactor that you are going to do midruds before we go on with this list get them clean and get more items an item is very delicate it is easy to squash one or to glum one up it is also tempting to fake understanding an item but if you do it enters missed withhold into the session which will blow up right then when you didnt understand something admit it i didnt get that tr2 says you understand if you dont falsity enters in which will destroy the session do good admin on lists keep parity you will notice when an actual goal is listed out that an item will transfer from list to list when an item has been in all four lists that is just about the way is is the item has been or all four flows when all four flows are discharged the item is fully discharged against other items and lies null after listing is complete find new goal the list will be shorter the time to find it is less you get dwindling quantity of everything eventually you will wind up with theta clear it is my guess youll find type of goal you find in the basics of scientology these things will suddenly register is there one basic goal for all pcs oh yes but they cant reach it and its not real you want the goal that registers now not the perfect goal theyll get back earlier and earlier on the track and eventually hit the prime postulate clear is as stable as you cant find prior prime postulate as the gpm is listed the repetition of the items gets the discharge off the prime postulate that you call goal the definition of goal is basic postulate for which the individual has taken full responsibility as the bricks the items built up on the postulate tend not to resist the postulate anymore the postulate runs out you get the thing diminishing and getting thinner the pc is now sitting there with all the experience accumulated along the line and none of the mass because there is alteris connected with it
