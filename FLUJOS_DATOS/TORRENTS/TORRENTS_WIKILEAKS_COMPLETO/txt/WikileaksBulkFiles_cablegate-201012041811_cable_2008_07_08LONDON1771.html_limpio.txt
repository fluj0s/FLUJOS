foreign policy classified by political minister counselor maura connelly for reasons 14 b and d 1 sbu summary nick clegg mp and leader of the liberal democrats called for the uk to adopt the uns responsibility to protect doctrine in his first major foreign policy address in his speech titled terms of intervention and delivered at chatham house on june 23 clegg enumerated criteria that should dictate britains overseas military involvement and reasserted his support for more cohesive european union he explained that despite his personal support for the lisbon treaty the eu should not ignore the treatys referendum defeat in ireland and plow on with its implementation but neither should the eu let the vote stand as an obstacle to the development of stronger eu clegg attacked the labour government on variety of issues alleging that it had misallocated defense spending and it had lacked candor with the british people about commitments required in iraq and afghanistan he added that it is time for the uk to reassess its military policies with regard to both countries and called for an immediate withdrawal of british troops from iraq and increased military and technical support for afghanistan bio info at 8 end summary criteria for liberal interventionism 2 sbu cleggs primary message was the uks need to adopt doctrine of what he called liberal interventionism similar to the uns concept of responsibility to protect this doctrine explained clegg calls for the uk to become involved in foreign conflicts only if the cause is just and as last resort b intervention is well intentioned c military action is proportional and sanctioned by legitimate authority and d there exists reasonable chance of success clegg argued that the uk must adapt its military and strategic resources to the postcold war world and mentioned the need to focus more on supporting troops in the field as opposed to spending money on outdated weapons systems such as the typhoon fighter jet and trident missile system iraq and afghanistan 3 sbu clegg briefly touched on iraq and reaffirmed the liberal democrats position that troop levels must be drawn down he said that the unjustified invasion of iraq has severely damaged the uks moral authority and will make it difficult to institute his liberal interventionist8 policy proposals 4 sbu clegg argued for more aid and assistance to be sent to afghanistan underscoring his belief that failure there would lead to greater instability in the region and proliferation of narcotics production moreover he called for the brown government to be more forthright with the british people about the costs and length of involvement that will be required to secure stable afghanistan zimbabwe 5 sbu clegg also touched on zimbabwe and explained that despite the pressing humanitarian concerns western military involvement would be counterproductive in part because there is regional support for intervention instead he supported involvement and called on south african president thabo mbeki to curtail electricity supplies to the country europe 6 sbu clegg argued that the uk must take stronger role in europe he sees in french president nicolas sarkozy an unlikely ally in the development of stronger frenchuk military coordination and explained that while the development of an eu military capability cannot be allowed to undermine nato the eu should still possess military force strong enough to act unilaterally if necessary he also said that despite the now gloomy prospects for ratifying the lisbon treaty the eu can still move forward it is time he explained to stop tinkering with the machine and put it to use and called for britain to be more involved in major eu decisionmaking instead of merely criticizing such decisions from the sidelines london 00001771 002 of 002 comment 7 cnf since becoming leader of the liberal democrats cleggs general foreign policy tone has softened his earlier hardline rhetoric against the war in iraq and on extraditionrendition issues has given way to slightly more thoughtful and measured approach these issues have lost some of their domestic votegetting potency and therefore clegg and others have turned to new topics in taking the reins of the liberal democrat party clegg is restrained by the responsibilities that his leadership role imposes on his rhetoric though he has not yet succeeded in imposing complete discipline on the members of his own party when it comes to their public comments on foreign policy subjects 8 cnf clegg himself spoke confidently and passionately in his address about the uks need to become involved in more unified eu he appeared quite knowledgeable in response to questions about the international criminal court and uk military spending though slightly less sure of himself when asked about darfur and burma having only assumed the leadership of the lib dems last year he appears to still be broadening his understanding of and comfort level with international issues bio note 9 cnf clegg like many liberal democrats is individually articulate charismatic and personable since taking over the leadership of the lib dems he has become more nuanced and realistic in his approach to domestic and foreign affairs while he used to focus on iraq and rendition in parliament earning quick applause from his lib dem colleagues he now focuses on domestic issues that matter more to the voting public 10 u clegg serves as the member of parliament for sheffield hallam he was first elected to british parliament in 2005 and was elected the leader of the liberal democrats in october 2007 from 1999 until 2004 clegg was member of european parliament and served as trade and industry spokesman for the alliance of liberal democrats for europe prior to working in politics clegg worked as journalist and as an aidrelief project manager he has academic degrees from cambridge the university of minnesota and the college deurope visit londons classified website
