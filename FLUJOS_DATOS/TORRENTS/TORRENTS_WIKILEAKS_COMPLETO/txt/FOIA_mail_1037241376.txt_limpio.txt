from ronald m lanner pinetree30earthlinknet to itrdbforlistservarizonaedu subject the great controversy date wed 13 nov 2002 213616 00 replyto grissinoutkuxutccutkedu dear forumites since i am neither dendrochronologist nor tree physiologist i have different take on this little brushfire we have going ideally tree phys people should be producing information among other things that dendrochronologists find useful and dendrochronologists should use the information within its limits and with enough understanding to get it right i dont think either of those things is occurring with as much frequency as we would all like i can understand rods annoyance at the massaging of numerical data that dendrochronologists do i am basically nonmathematical biologist mystified by such stuff and i prefer handling measurements to deriving indices or whatever when i run up against such derived data i generally turn skeptical because i cannot verify the results from my own experience or intuition on the other hand when i read papers by cambial physiologists like rod i also get annoyed thats because my biology wants to integrate upwards and all i get from cambial labs is biochemistry so im in the middle where it gets lonely i try not to get mad at anybody though i do wish i didnt find myself alone on the margins i find it frustrating that some dendrochronologists stubbornly see tree ring characteristics as being affected by climate they are not they are affected by cambial activity cambial activity is affected by internalities of tree behavior mainly hormonal and nutrient fluxes in the crown those things are largely influenced by climatic factors so there is quite bit of slack between the climatic factor and the ring characteristic is this just negligible static i doubt it i see this as an oversight by dendrochronologists that weakens their credibility tad among those knowledgable about tree growth i also have quarrel with the dogma of dendrochology that the cambium changes as the tree becomes senescent i know of data that trees senesce that is that they undergo changes due solely to aging this started as forestry dogma and was accepted by treeringers who then corrected for it im practically the only one who has systematically looked for evidence of senescence with phd student and we could not find any in young to ancient bristlecones but tree physiologists do not generally look at such issues because they have become progressively more reductionist nor do they try to produce theory of tree growth based as it must be on evolutionary theory such theory would be simple and general and it would allow treeringers to approach rings with more sympathy and understanding that might not get you further but it would improve your character im certain and it would put all that assorted mishmash of tree phys data that have accumulated since 19th century germany into context at last and maybe liberate the minds of all those tense physiologists out there with their everincreasing inventories of electronic sensors and analyzers the world would be better place with more people having fun in the woods ronald m lanner 1pinetree30earthlinknet earthlink its your internet references 1 mailtopinetree30earthlinknet
