recommendations ii audit objectives 6 the overall objective of the audit was to advise directorgeneral unon on the adequacy of the arrangements for ensuring that travel was being carried out in compliance with regulations and rules this included assessing the internal control systems for managing travel services and b compliance with regulations and rules iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit followed up on the findings nd recommendations raised in the oios audit undertaken in 2001 aa20010103 audit of unon travel shipping and transportation unit tstu and focussed on activities in 2004 it involved interviewing staff reviewing available documents and using audit software to sample and analyse data 8 tsvu processes approximately 6500 travel requests year during 2003 the total volume of travel business amounted to approximately us7 million iv audit findings and recommendations management of consultants 9 unon entered into consultancy agreem ent with corporate travel partnership to undertake review of the travel arrangem ents over the period june 2004 march 2005 at the cost of approxim ately us61000 oios in cooperation with support services services sss reviewed the arrangem ent for managem ent of the consultants with view to identifying whether there were any areas were consultancy m anagem ent m ight be strengthened for the future oios was pleas ed to note that the arrangem ents for the selection and paym ent of the consultants appeared to be adequate and areas for improvem ent were identified however oios is of the opinion that current arrangem ents for m anagem ent of consultants place too m uch trust in consultants and there would be benefit in developing general guidance to assi st managers who do not use consultants on regular basis som exam ples of areas where further strengthening of existing arrangem ents m ay give unon greater control over consultants are given below work plans im plem entation schedules should contain m ore detailed inform ation on m ethodology criteria scope of work and the m ilestones and timefram within which work will be done b work plans should include provision for how progress will be reported and the identification of m ajor decision points were m anagem ent review m ust take place before further work is undertaken c focal points are required to channel requests to keep m anagem ent inform ed of progress and to keep records of m eetings and decisions agreed upon recommendation to enhance arrangem ents for m anagem ent of consultants unon should draw up guidance to assist unon m anagers in optim ising the benefits from use of consultants rec 01 10 unon commented that it accepted the recommendation oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of copy of the guidance to assist unon managers in optim ising the benefits from use of consultants b planning 11 oios noted that travelling by air of ten required lengthy approval and clearance procedures before tickets could be conf irmed and bought the consequence of these procedures was that tickets were usually bought in the last two weeks before departure when cheaper ticket options were usually not available inf ormation to quantif the additional cost of the current procedures wa s not readily available preventing both oios and tsvu from calculating the cost im plications the lack of this inf ormation m eant that unon unep and unhabitat m anagers did not have access to inform ation to assist them in determ ining the cost im plications of delaying purchasing and to assist them in changing internal procedures to enable early purchase of tickets 2 12 in response to the above observationsun on commented that it had contacted the airlines to see how it could make an analysis on possible savings that might be realized as result of early purchase of tickets the ai rlines informed unon that although cheaper tickets are usually available in certain classes there is guarantee that these reduced fares will be maintained due to changes in th travel market conditions as result of variables such as competition seasonality fuel prices and taxes on travel furthermore major carriers also have worldwide inven tory control mechanism ie number of seatsfare structureclasses whereby the numbe r of seats available in the cheaper classes for travel out of nairobi may be reduced based on demand as result of the above procurement travel and shipping section could not make any substantial analysis however the following measures have been undertaken an announcement guiding the sta ff members on early booking and ticketing has been posted on the ebulletin board other announcements will be posted as and when new issues arise or changes occur tsvu credit card solely for payme nt of tickets will be available and used shortly and fast track ticketing system is be ing developed for emergency unplanned urgent travel and will be implemented shortly 13 in view of the m easures already taken recom mendation is raised c processing travel requests and travel claims travel request 14 oios noted the following weaknesses in cu rrent arrangem ents for processing travel requests which need to be reviewed to im prove effectiveness and efficiency according to the m emorandum issued by chief division of adm inistrative services das in 2001 entitled procedures for making travel arrangem ents under the new contracts for the provision of travel agency services w ith acharya travel and bunson travel services i when cost estim ate is required prior to approval by the substantive office copy of pt8 should be subm itted ii individual travellers or requesting offices shall not directly contact any of the official travel agencies for prelim inary bookings however current practice is that cost estim ate is obtained by the substantive office for planning purpose prior to the approval by chief tsvu and the substantive office did not subm it pt8 now imis tvrq to tsvu for obtaining quotation b whilst arrangem ents for processing the fare quotation form appeared adequate in the absence of perform ance indicators and m anagem ent inform ation to track processing tim tsvu was unable to dem onstrate that the processing times observed at the tim of the audit of around five working days was reasonable unon commented that five days is the maximum number of days required to provide fare quotation it refers especially to meetings and this benchmark has been indicated in the sla with unep and unhabitat however the norm for quotations for normal travel is 2 3 days only current arrangements were not clear at what point the ticket price charged to client was fixed which is important for budgetary control and current procedures for closure of the travel request after processing of the travel claim were not clear 3 if this closure is not done any unused portion of the funds committed as part of the travel request may not be released for further use 15 in response to the above observations unon commented that fare quotation request form had been developed and implem ented electronically and had proven to be effective and efficient in addition periodica l meetings are held with the management team of the travel agency to address i ssues arising and tsvuptss will consult and coordinate with bfms on the timely processing of travel claims and closing of travel requests in imis 16 in view of the m easures already taken recom mendation is raised b travel claim 17 guidelines for the preparation and subm ission of the travel claim f10 appeared adequate and were supported by the introducti on of an electronic version of the f10 however unon collected m anagem ent info rmation on the tim taken to process and settle travel claim s to determ ine ef ficiency of current arrangem ents w hilst oios appreciated the reasons why unon currently us ed m anual activation of recovery action had been taken to put the f10 subm ission into imis to m onitor tim eliness of subm ission in accordance with stai200020 official travel nd to assist in tracking tim it takes to process travel claim s within two calendar week s after com pletion of travel as stated in stai200020 recommendation to enable unon to m onitor the efficiency of arrangem ents for processing travel claim s chief tr avel shipping and visa unit should discuss and agree with chief pa yment unit of budget and financial managem ent service what inform ation is required to track processing of travel claim s and discuss with inform ation technology service the feasibility of collecting this inf ormation f rom imis and the possibility of storing the f10 subm ission date in imis to track com pliance with stai200020 official travel rec 02 18 unon commented that ptss intended by the end of 2005 to put in place mechanism to improve coordination between payments unit and tsvu with respect to processing of travel claims and jointly with accounts section to discuss with the imis coordinator measures to improve th tracking of the travel claims oios notes the response and will close the recom mendation upon recei pt of details of the actions taken to improve arrangem ents for processing of travel claim s d monitoring and reporting 19 whilst there had been an im provem ent since the last audit in the quality and nature of m anagem ent inform ation oios was c oncerned that it was not clear i what managem ent inform ation was required ii who should provide it and iii when how often and in what form it should be pr ovided in response to these concerns unon explained that the consultant prepared management information document format that the travel agency must fill in quarterly and which allows tsvuptss to monitor travel 4 operations and trends oios was pleased to note this developm ent and recom mendation is therefore m ade financial management com mission earned under the travel agency services contract 20 in 2001 oios had recom mended aa 20010103002 that unon recover from the travel agent approxim ately us 600000 unon undertook reconciliation exercise which resulted in recovering approxim ately us 250000 the audit team reviewed the exercise and has closed the recom mendation and recorded an actual recovery of us 250000 b com mission earned on override arrangem ent 21 in 2001 oios had recom mended aa 20010103003 that unon establish the amount payable by the travel agents relating to the override com mission and initiate action to recover this am ount unon commented that it had received an amount of us3364 as override commission for 1999 and 2000 unon tried its best to determine the exact amount payable but was not successful in doing so it had discussed this issue with various parties and it was confirmed that the travel agencies receive override commissions as reward for the exceeding their sales target with particular airline this amount is confidential between the airline and the travel s ales agent the travel agent may in turn pass percentage of that amount to the c lients as the amount is discretionary ptsstsvu cannot judge whether it is appropriate or not in view of this payment of override commissions was excluded in subsequent travel agency contracts oios has closed the recom mendation and further ac tion is proposed beyond inclusion of this amount in the total recovery figure to be reported in the oios annual report c com missions earned from the preferred airline arrangem ents 22 in 2001 oios had recom mended aa 20010103005 that unon determ ine the amount due under the preferred airline agr eement for the years 1999 to 2001 and initiate action to recover these funds unon commented that similar to the explanation provided above regarding override commissions it c ould not determine the exact commission payable to unon since the calculation of the preferred airline agreement discounts was made by the respective airlines based only on their respective flown revenue this refers to the portion of travel flown by the preferred airline and excludes the portion of ticket flown on airlines which have agreement w ith the travel agent or unon to pay commission the only supporting documentation prov ided by the airlines was list of tickets issued relating to the revenues earned by the airlines at the time of making the payment in view of this subsequent agreemen ts with the airlines have clause indicating that the discounts on the segmen ts flown on the preferred airline only will be deducted by the travel agent at the point of saletime of issuance of the ticket in view of this inform ation and the action taken to prevent reoccurrence oios has closed the recom mendation d sharing airline and travel agent com missions 23 in 2001 oios had recom mended aa20010103007 that unon conduct review of all com missions received from the tr avel agent and the airlines and ensure an 5 equitable distribution of these revenue s between unon unep and unhabitat as with the previous section travel shippi ng and visa unit and budget and financial managem ent service were unable to decide who was responsible for im plem entation and so appropriate action was taken the recom mendation therefore rem ains open paym ent processing 24 whilst arrangem ent for m aking paym ents appeared adequate oios has concerns about the adequacy of the control system in place over processing in the paym ent unit described below the current process is undocum ented and not understood by all those involved for exam ple the account database m aintained by paym ent unit for monitoring outstanding invoices did not utilise downloadable imis data b the basis for reconciliation of the invoiced am ount provided by the travel agency is flawed as it is not done against any independent records m aintained by unon c com pleteness of data could not be confirm ed by paym ent unit which never received the list of invoices sent by the travel agent paym ent unit had idea how m any invoices they were processing
