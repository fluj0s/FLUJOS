the years however the use of this identifying number has been expanded by government entities and the private sector to keep track of many other government and private sector records in the view of

jurors2 the social security act of 1935 the original social security act of 19353 did not expressly mention the use of ssns but it did authorize the creation of some type of recordkeeping scheme section 807b of the act stated such taxes shall be collected and paid in such manner at such times and under such conditions not inconsistent with this title either by making and filing returns or by stamps coupons tickets books or other reasonable devices or methods necessary or helpful in securing complete and proper collection and payment of the tax or in securing proper identification of the

social security card was not meant to identify the bearer from 1946 to 1972 the legend not for identification was printed on th face of the card as warning that proof of identity was required to get

employee covere d by the social security program4 executive order 9397 although the ssn was originally establis hed for the social security program5 other government agencies soon realized that it could be used as convenient identifying number for tracking other govern ment programs use of the ssn as federal government identifier was based on executive order 93976 issued by president franklin roosevelt which provided as follows whereas certain federal agencies from tim to time require in the administration of their activities system of numerical identification of accounts of individual persons and whereas it is desirable in the interest of economic and orderly administration that the federal government move toward th use of single unduplicated numerical identification system of accounts and avoid the unnecessary establishment of additional systems now therefore it is hereby ordered as followshereafter any federal department establis hment or agency shall whenever the head thereof finds it advisable to establish new system of permanent account numbers pertaining to individual persons utilize exclusively the social security account numbers

year the taxpayer identification number is the persons social security number in most caseshowever as social security adminis tration staff pape r indicated it was not until the 1960s that federal agencies be gan to adopt the ssn as general government identifier in other contexts7 the impetus for the executive order came from consideration the civil service commission was giving to establishing numerical identification system for all federal employees using the ssn as the identifying number however in spite of the executive order there was little program use of ssns within the federal government in the 1940s and 1950s because there was real incentive for those agencies which kept individua l records eg civil service commission the armed forces irs etc to change their record keeping systems the potential for expanded use of the ssn wa s increasingly recognized during this period though after its adoption in 1961 by the civil service commission for federal employees the next major use of the ssn for other than social security purposes occurred in 1962 when the irs adopt ed the ssn as its official taxpayer identification number while the use of the ssn by irs has relationship to the social security system as such this step was nevertheless considered entirely appropriate citizenship and social security numbers even though individuals are require d to disclose their ssn under many circumstances in dealing with governmental entities possession of ssn is not condition of united states citizenship this is why regulations issued by the social security administration regarding obtaini ng ssn state that an individual needing social security number may apply for one by filing signed form ss5 application for social security number card8 each individual determines when he or she needs number based upon federal and state statutes requiring disclosure of an ssn in reality it would be very difficult to work or engage in many activities in this country without ssn virtually all tax matters require the disclosure of ones ssn9 as does participation in ma ny government programs and obtaining drivers license while one may choose not to disclose ssn in some circumstances one may have to forgo benef it for example parent can refuse to provide ssn for child on an income ta x form but then the parent cannot claim that child as dependent on the tax

that ssns were displayed on millions of cards issued by federal agencies including 42 million medicare cards 8 million department of defense identification cards and insurance cards and 7 million

ficiaries who already have cards restrictions on governmental collection and use of ssns as early as the 1970s concerns regardin g increased uses of the ssn by both government and private entities prompted studies and subsequent congressional action limiting government uses of the ssn the social security administration created task force in 1970 to investigat nonprogram uses of the ssn and the task forces report the following year stated19 any examination of ssn policy must begi n with the recognition that the number has ceased to be merely social security number especially in the past few years the number has come into increasingly wide use as numerical identifier throughout society to the point where th adult american citizen is beginning to need number to function effectively even if he is among the very small minority of people who never work in covered employment in 1973 the department of health edu cation and welfare secretarys advisory committee on automated persona l data systems proposed 1 that an individual whose ssn is requested should be informed as to whether or not divulging his number is legally required and 2 that individual should be denied benefit because of his refusal to divulge his ssn for purposes other than those required by federal law20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30318crs6 20 continued 1973 chapter vii 21 p l 93579 88 stat 1896 5 usc 552a note 22 s

continuedthe privacy act of 1974 when congress passed the privacy act of 197421 it took the first statutory step toward establishing federal policy limiting compulsory divulgence of the ssn in its report accompanying s 3418 which became the privacy act the senate committee on government operations stated that the extensive use of the ssn as universal identifier was one of the most serious manifestations of privacy concerns in the nation22 citing its fear of harm to individual privacy through misuse of information systems23 congress intended in the privacy act to curb government use of ssn as personal identifier section 7a1 of the pr ivacy act provides that it shall be unlawful for any federal stat or local government agency to deny to any individual any right benefit or privilege provided by law because of such individuals refusal to disclose his social security account number however the effectiveness of the privacy act in restricting ssn use was somewhat limited by the exemptions in section 7a2 of the privacy act the provisions of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not apply to any disclosure which is required by federal statute or b the disclosure of social security number to any federal state or local agency maintaining system of record s in existence and operating january 1 1975 if such disclosure was required unde r statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual in any situation where government agency asks for persons ssn the agency under section 7b of the privacy ac t is required to tell the person whether the request is mandatory or voluntary and what uses the agency will make of the ssns that are collected while section 7 of the privacy act does not explicitly provide remedies for its violation courts have held that it would be illusory for section 7 to provide that persons have the right to have their ssn free from compulsory disclosure with judicial remedy thus courts have

from congress to require submission of the ssn and the agency cites such authorizing authority if neither of those two conditions is satisfied then the government entity ma still ask an individual to submit his or her ssn voluntarily in either situation where ssn is requested the agency must fully disclose what uses will be made of the number the tax reform act of 1976 in 1976 congress further weakened the protections of the privacy act by authorizing the states to use the ssn for wide range of purposes and by codifying the use of the ssn for federal tax purposes first section 1211ci of the

addition in bowen v roy48 the united states supreme court held that requiring applicants to provide their ssns as condition of eligibility for federal benefits such as afdc or food stamps does not violate the first amendment to the united states constitution since such requirement is neutral in religious term s thus person may need to make choice between receiving government benef it and

the courts specific holding in this case was that the public availability of ssns is unconstitutional only because it burdens another fundamental right the right to vote not because it is per
