ago rich whats going on is pretty much self explanatory in the email isnt it i mean its on the an site that belongs to you guys your address is on there as contact as matter of fact it was on there when i talked to you on the phone the other day when you claimed you were coming to the identity conference in georgia i believe you stated that you had not talked to rick and didnt know what he was going to do about website why did you feel it necessary to lie to about that that really hurt the domain namearyannationorg which i might add has been in ricks name since april of 2004 now thats screwed up since pastor had so much trouble with jeremy parker in august of 2004 and jonathan took over as webmaster from scratch pastor needed his website up and running and rick could have saved the day rick told us that he convinced jeremy to give him that domain name last year well we found out that its belonged to rick since april 2004 this information can be accessed via the web look it up anyway this is all movement related drama we are church so what do you not understand yahweh bless laslo on 41007 r s aryannationspahotmailcom wrote wtf would someone please call and tell what is going on this is bs from laslo patterson laslocgmailcomto rick fifthprofession_57hotmailcom aryannationspahotmailcomsubject interesting front page date wed 28 mar 2007 005119 0600 the following is off the wwwaryannationsorg website i had idea pastor williams and i were looked at with so much disrespect and unappreciation let it be known that i was member for 15 years and i was asked to be on the council and i wouldnt be sending this out except for the matter of the following crap being talked about was during my tenure on the council maybe i should write book about the true chaos that i had to put up with from supposed leaders of an it would be an enlightening read my comments are in red laslo patterson these wolves in sheeps clothing tried to usurp aryan nationsso are you saying that jonathan and i are wolves that tried to usurp an they managed to cause bit of chaos factionalism that is somewhat still with us today in the following days after pastors death in 2004so we caused chaos and factionalism too these renegades do not share the late pastors ideals visionwell i guess we are renegades now too how exactly did we not share pastor butlers vision by not wanting to have nonchristians yoked with us we do they do not share the original mission of aryan nationsto spread the christian identity message to our racial kindredthats funny being that we tried to do that with everyone for over two years we do we are legitimate are carrying on the churchs banner of folk faith there has been lot of restructuring reorganizing going on in recent days the reason for this is of utmost importance it is time to get back to the basics aryan nations is getting back to its roots back to pastor butlers vision it is getting back to what it always was intended to be white christian theopolitical movement that reflects the church that had birthed it white christian community for white christians by white christians we will gladly work with other kinds of white nationalists that share common goals respect our stance but we will remain must remain christcentered on the truth of yahwehgods lawword if you are antichristian then we have business with you well you just screwed up then because you are saying two different things in the last two sentences you say you will work with other kinds of wn and in the next sentence you have dealings with anti christians which by the way most other wn are for us being god first is being race first we cannot nor will not separate our race yahweh our godi assure you you wont have to separate anybody yahweh will do that for you if you want to visit true church website where there is more going on than bashing people that actually worked for yahweh and his people then visit wwwucoyorg interest rates fall again 430000 mortgage for
