senate on september 18 but motion to invoke cloture failed by vote of 5742 these two approaches appear to raise separate but related constitutional issues as to hr 1905 it is difficult to identify either constitutional text or existing case law that would directly suppor t the allocation by statute of the power to vote in the full house to the district of columbia delegate further that case law that does exist would seem to indicate that not only is the district of columbia not state for purposes of representation but that congressional power over the district of columbia does not represent sufficient power to grant congressional representation in particular at least six of the justices who participated in what appears to be the most relevant supreme c ourt case on this issue national mutual insurance co of the district of columbia v tidewater transfer co authored opinions rejecting the proposition that congresss power under th district clause was sufficient to effectuate structural changes to the federal government further the remaining three justices who found that the congress could gr ant diversity jurisdiction to district of columbia citizens despite the lack of such jurisdiction in article iii specifically limited their opinion to instances where the gislation in question did not involve the extension of fundamental rights or substa ntially disturb the political balance between the federal government and the states to the extent that hr 1905 would be found to meet these distinguishing criteria all nine justices in tidewater transfer co would arguably have found the inst ant proposal to be unconstitutional hres 78 on the other hand is similar to amendments to the house rules that were adopted during the 103rd congress and survived judicial scrutiny at both the district court and the court of appeals leve l it would appear however that these amendments were upheld pr imarily because of the provision calling for revote by the full house when the vote of the delegates was decisive in the committee of the whole in conclusion although not beyond question it would appear likely that the congress does not have authority to gran t voting representation in the house of representatives to the delegate from the di strict of columbia as contemplated under hr 1905 as the revote provisions provided for in hres 78 would render the delegates vote in the committee of the whole largely symbolic however the amendments to the house rules would be likely to pass constitutional musterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824contents proposed legislation

question is raised as to whether such representation can be achieved without constitutional amendment as noted previously resolution similar to the hres 78 was adopted in the 103rd congress it was soon challenged but it was upheld at both the district court18 and the court of appeals19 level it would appear however that the proposal was upheld primarily because of the provision calling for revote when the vote of the delegates or residents was decisive in the committee of the whole the meaning of the term state in the house representation clause as congress has never granted the delegate from the district of columbia vote in the full house or senate the constitutionality of such legislation has not been before the courts the question of whet her the district of columbia should be considered state for purposes of having vote in the house of representatives however was considered by threejudge pa nel of the united states district court of the district of columbia in the case of adams v clinton20 in adams the panel examined the issue of whether failure to provide congressional re presentation for the district of columbia violated the equal pr otection clause in doing so it discussed extensively whether the constitution as it st ands today allows such representation the court began with textual analysis of the constitution article i 2 clause 1 of the constitution the house re presentation clause provides the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the severa l states and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature the court noted that while the phrase people of the several states could be read as

supported by most though not all commentators23 the plaintiffs in adams v clinton however suggested that even if the district of columbia is not strictly state under article i 2 clause 1 that the citizens of the united states could still have representation in congress the plaintiffs in adams made two arguments 1 that the district of columbia although not technically state under the constitution should be treated as one for voting purposes or 2 that di strict citizens should be allo wed to vote in the state of maryland based on their residua l citizenship in that stat the first argument was based primarily on cases where the suprem court has found that the district of columbia was subject to various constitutional provisions despite the fact that such provisions were textually limited to states24 the second argument is primarily based on the fact that residents of the land ceded by maryland continued to vote in maryland elections during the period betw een the act of july 16 1790 by which virginia and maryland ceded lands to congre ss for formation of the district and the organic act of 180125 under which congress assumed jurisdiction and provided for the

and depr ived of their political rightsadams examined the constitutions language history and relevant judicial precedents to determine whether the cons titution allowed for areas which were not states to have representatives in the house the court determined that finding that the district of columbia was state for purposes of congressiona l representation was not consistent with any of these criteria first the court indicated that construing the term state to include the district of columbia for purposes of representa tion would lead to many incongruities in other parts of the constitution one of severa l examples that the court noted was that article i requires that voters in house elections have the qualifications requisite for the electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature27 the district as pointed out by the court did not have legislature until home rule was passed in 1973 so this rule would have been ineffect ual for most of the districts history28 this same point can be made regarding the clause providing that the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof29 similar issues arise where the constitution refers to the executive branch of state30 the court went on to examine the debate s of the founding fathers to determine the understanding of the issue at the time of ratification the court concluded that such evidence as exists seem s to indicate an understanding that the district would not have vote in the congress31 later when congress was taking jurisdiction over land ceded by maryland and virginia to form the district the issue arose again and concerns were apparently raised precisely because district residents would lose their ability to vote32 finally the court noted that othe r courts which had considered thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824crs7 33 hepburn dundas 6 us 2 cranch 445 452 1805 district of

by th court was whether residents of the district should be permitted to vote in congressional elections through maryland based on theory of resid ual citizenship in that state as noted above this argument relied on the fact that resident s of the land ceded by maryland apparently continued to vote in maryland elections for time period after land had been ceded to congress the court noted however that essentially the same argument had been rejected by previous threecourt panel d ecision of the district of columbia court of appeals34 and the supreme court had also c oncluded that former residents of maryland had lost their st ate citizenship upon the sepa ration of the district of columbia from the state of maryland35 the court continued by setting forth the history of the transfer of lands from maryland and virginia to the federal government under the act of july 16 1790 while conceding that residents of the ceded lands continued to vote in their respective states the court suggested that this did not imply that there was an understanding that they would continue to do so after the distri ct became the seat of government it reflected the fact that durin g this period the seat of government was still in philadelphia thus upon the passa ge of the organic act of 1801 maryland citizenship of the inhabitants of these lands was extinguished effectively ending their rights to vote the power of congress to provide representation to political entities that are not states the argument has been made however that the adams case which dealt with whether the equal protection clause compels the granting of vote to the district of columbia can be distinguished from the instant question whether congress has power to grant the district voting representative in congress under

power under the district clause has not been direc tly addressed by the courts the question of whether congress can grant the district of co lumbia representation under different congressional power was also addressed by the united stat court of appeals for the district of columbia in the case of michel v anderson 37 the court considered whether the delegate for the district of columbia could by h ouse rules be given vote in the committee of the whole of the house of representatives the primary objection to the rule in question was that while delegates have long been able to vote in committee only member can vote on the floor of the house the district court below had ag reed with this argument stating that one principle is basic and beyond disput since the delegates do not represent states but only various territorial entities they may not consistently with the constitution exercise legislative power in tandem with the united states senate for such power is constitutionally limited to members chosen by the people of the several states u s const art i 8 cl 138 the court of appeals also agreed39 stating that the language of article i 2 precludes the house from bestowing the characteristics of membership on someone other than those chosen every second year by the people of the several states based on these statements it is unlikely that these courts would have seen merit in an argument that the congress could gr ant the delegate vote in the house an argument might be made however that the decision in michel v anderson can be distinguished from the instant proposal

authority to provi for representation for the district of columbia under the district clause under this line of reasoning the power of the congress over the district re presents broader power than the power of the house to set its own rules at first examination it is not clear on what basis such distinction would be made the power of the house to determine the rules of its proceedings is in and of itself very broad power while the house may not ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights within these limitations all matters of method are open to the deter mination of the house th power to make rules within the limitations suggested is absolute and bey ond the challenge of any other body or tribunal in fact the supreme court has found that in some cases the constitutionality of house rule is not s ubject to review by courts because the question is political and not appropriate for judicial review41 it is true that the power of the congress over the district of columbia has been described as plenary to large extent this is because the power of the congress over the district blends the limited powers of national legislature with the broader powers associated with local legislature42 thus some constitutional restrictions that might bind congress in the exercise of its national power would not apply to legislation which is limited to the district of columbia for example when congress created local courts for the district of columbia it acted pursuant to its power under the district clause and thus was not bound by to comply with article iii requirements which generally apply to federal courts43 or while there are limits to congresss ability to delegate its legislative authorities such limitations do not apply when congress delegates its local political authority over the district to district residents44 it is not clear however that the power of congress at issue in hr 1905 would be easily characterized as falling within congresss

transfer co case appears to provide highly relevant comparison to the instant proposal as w ith the instant proposal the congressional statute in question was intended to extend right to district of columbia residents that was only provided to citizens of s tates in 1805 chief justice john marshall in the case of hepburn v ellzey 47 had authored unanimous opinion holding that federal diversity jurisdiction which exists between citizen s of different states did not include suits where one of the parties was from the district of columbia48 despite this ruling congress enacted statute

on congress exercising power under the distri ct clause justice rutledges opinion the rutledge concurrence joined by justice mu rphy argued that the provision of article iii that provides for judicial authority over cases between c itizens of different states the diversity clause51 permits such law suits even absent congressional authorization justice vinsons opinion the vinson dissent joined by justice douglas and justice frankfurters opinion the frankfurter dissent joined by justice reed would have found that neither the di versity clause nor the district clause provided the basis for such jurisdiction of further concern is that those concurring justices w ho did not join in the three judge plurality opinion were not silent on the issue of congresss power under the district clause consequently it is possible that majority of the justices would have reached differing result on the br eadth of congresss power in addition it would appear that even the threejudge plurality might have distinguished the instant proposal from the legislation which was at issue in the tidewater transfer co thus closer analysis of this case should consider the different opinions how the justices framed the questions before th em and then the reasoning they used to resolve the issue to help understand the issu raised by this case and by the instant bill this analysis s hould focus on four different issu 1 whether the district of columbia is state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction 2 whether the district of columbia is state for purposes of voting representation 3 whether congress can grant diversity jurisdiction under the di strict clause and 4 whether congress can provide for voting delega under the district clause whether the district of columbia is state for purposes of dive rsity jurisdiction as noted the court has held since the 1805 case of hepburn v ellzey52 that federal diversity juri sdiction under article iii does not include suits where one of the parties was from the district of columbia53 presaging the adams v clinton54 case by nearly two centuries this unanimous d ecision briefly considered the use of the term state throughout the constitution the chief justice noted that the plain meaning of the term state in the constitution did not include the district of columbia and further noted that this was the term used to determine representation in the

initial termination that district residents were entitled to jury trial in criminal cases in callan v wilson 127 us 540 1888 rested in large measure on the more inclusive language of article iii 2 the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been comm itted but when not committed within any state the trial shall be at such place or places as the congress may by law have directed but the court noted that cases relied upon by callan were based at least in part on the sixth amendment in reynolds v united states 98 us 145 154 it was taken for granted that the sixth amendment of the constitution secured to the people of the territories the right of trial by jury in criminal prosecutions callan

include the district of columbia in those instances the court found reason that the term should take on different meaning for purposes of diversity in the tidewater transfer co case however the rutledge concurrence took issue with hepburn justice rutledge noted that th term state had been found in some cases to include the district of columbia the main thrust of the opinion was that the use of the term state in the constitution occurred in two different contexts 1 in provisions relating to the organization and structure of the political departments of the government and 2 where it was used regarding the civil rights of citizens55 the rutledge concurrence argued that the tter uses of the term should be considered more expansively in the latter case than th former for instance the court noted that the sixth amendment which provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state wherein the crime shall have been committe d had been held to apply to the citizens of the district of columbia56 next the rutledge concurrence sought to establish that of these two categories access to the federal courts under diversity jurisdiction fe ll into the latter the opinion suggested that the exclusion of the district of columbia from diversity jurisdiction served historical purpose and that the inclusion of the district would be consistent with the purposes of the provision the opinion essentially rested on the premise that such distinction between the citizens of the district of columbia and the states made sense i cannot be lieve that the framers intended to impose so purposeless and indefensib discrimination although they may have been guilty of understandable oversight in not providing explicitly against it57 the opinion of the these two justices how ever was not shared by any of the other seven justices of the court58 the jackson plurality opinion for instance

versed in that subj ect writing for the court within few years of adoption of the constitution so held the question is then whether this is one of those sections of the constitution to which time and experience were intended to give content or provisi on concerned solely with the mechanics of government i think there can be little doubt but that it was the latter that we would now write the

found evidence that the founding fathers gave any thought to the issue of the district of columbia and diversity jurisdiction and that if they had that they would not have included the district by us of the term state nor did the court find this oversight particularly surprising as the district of columbia was still theoretical political entity when the constitution was ratified and its nature and organization had not yet been established the vinson dissent summarily dismissed the argument that the hepburn v ellzey decision be overruled60 the frankfurter dissent ar gued vehemently that the use of the term state in the clause at issue was one of the terms in the constitution least amenable to ambiguous interpretation the precision which characterizes these portions of article iii is in striking contrast to the imprecision of so many other provisions of the constitution dealing with other very vital aspects of government61 this combined with knowledge of the distru st that the founding fathers had towards the federal judiciary left justice frankfurter with little interest in entertaining arguments to the contrary whether the district of columbia is state for purposes of representation while there has been some academic commentary suggesting that the term state could be construed more broadly for purposes of representation than is currently the case62 there is little support for this proposition in case law starting with chief justice marshall in the hepburn case and as recently as adams v clinton and michel v anderson the supreme court and lower c ourts have generally started with the basic presumption that the us of the term state for purposes of representation in the house did not include the district of columbia in fact in hepburn chief justice marshall had referred to the plain use of the term statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824crs14 63 6 us at 452 when the same term which has been used plainly in this limited sense in the articles respecting the legislative and execu tive departments is also employed in that which respects the judicial department it must be understood as retaining the sense originally given to it 64 the two

members of th house of representatives be chosen by the people of the several states id at 619623 rutledge j concurring see adams v clinton 90 f supp 2nd at 55 65 hepburn 6 us at 453in the clauses regarding representation as the benchmark to interpret other clauses using the phrase63 the opinions of the justices in tidewater transfer co appear to be different as noted above seven of the nine justices in that case accepted the reasoning of the hepburn case as regards diversity jurisdicti on and would certainly have been even less likely to accept the argument that the di strict of columbia should be considered state for purposes of the house of representatives it also seems likely that the justices associated with the rutledge concurrence would have similarly rejected such an interpretation as noted that opi nion suggested that the error in hepburn was the failure to distinguish between how the term state should be interpreted when used in the context of the distribution of power among political structures and how it should be interpreted when it is used in relation to the civil rights of citizens64 although justice rutledge found that restric tive interpretation of the term state was unnecessarily narrow in the context of dive rsity jurisdiction there is indication that the justice would have disputed the plain use of the term state in the context of representation for th district in congress whether congress has the authority under the district clause to exte nd diversity jurisdiction to the district of columbia the jackson plurality opinion considered whether despite the courts holding in hepburn congress by utilizing its power unde r the district clause could evade the apparent limitations of article iii on diversity jurisdicti on the plurality noted that the district clause had not been ddressed in chief jus tice marshalls opinion and that the chief justice had ended hi s opinion by noting that the matter was subject for legislative not for judicial consideration65 while admitting that it would be speculation to suggest that th is quote established that congress could use its statutory authority rather than pro ceed by constitutional amendment the court next considered whether such power did in fact exist as noted previously the power of cong ress over the district includes the power to create local courts not subject to article iii restrictions the plura lity suggested that there would be little objection to establishing federal court in the district of columbia to hear diversity jurisdiction instead the concerns arose because the statute in question would opera outside of the geographical confines of the districthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824crs15 66 337 us at 509 67 see odonoghue v united states 289

rutledge j concurring strongly dissenting from the suggestion that congress could use article i powers to expand the limitations of article iii jurisdictionfurther the statute would require that article iii courts be tasked with functions associated with an article i court66 the jackson plurality had little trouble assi gning the tasks of an article i court to an article iii court suggesting that such assignments had been approved in the past including in the district of columbia67 more difficult question was the exercise of diversity jurisdiction by fe deral courts outside of the geographical confines of the district while noting that the congresss power over the district was not strictly limited by territory it admitted that the power could not be used to gain control over subjects over which there had been separate legation of power68 thus the question arose as to whether separate power beyond the district clause was needed here essentially the court held that the nd that the congress sought establishing court to hear diversity cases involving district of columbia citizens was permissible under the district clause and that the choice of means that the congress employed authorizing such hearings in fede ral courts outside of the district was not explicitly forbidden as result the cour t held that it should defer to the opinions of congress when congress was deciding how to perform function that is within its power69 it should be noted that even the plur ality opinion felt it necessary to place this extension in larger context emphasizing the relative insignificance of allowing diversity cases to be heard in federal cour ts outside of the dist rict the court noted that the issue did not affect the mechanics of administe ring justice or involve the extension or denial of any fundamental right or immunity which goes to make up our freedoms nor did the legislation subs tantially disturb the balance between the union and its component states rather the issue involved only whether plaintiff who sued party from another state could require that the case be decided in convenient forum70 the rutledge concurrence on the other hand explicitly rejected the reasoning of the plurality finding that the congress clearly did not have the authority to authorize even this relatively modest authority to district of columbia citizens71 in fact the concurring opinion rejected the entire approach of the plurality as unworkable arguing that it would allow any limitations on article iii courts to behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824crs16 72 the constitution is not so selfcontradictor nor are its limitations to be so easily evaded the very essence of the problem is whether the constitution meant to cut out from the diversity jurisdiction of courts created

district citing both article iii limitations on federal court and separation of powers the vinson dissent argued that the question as to whether congress could use its legislative authority to evade the limitations of article iii had already been r eached in cases regarding whether the congress could re quire federal courts to hear cases where there was case or controversy73 the frankfurter dissent made similar points and also noted the reluctance by which the states had even agreed to the establishment of diversity jurisdiction74 thus considering both the dissent s and the concurrence six justices rejected the pluralitys expansive interpretation of the district clause whether congress has the authority under the district clause to ex tend house representation to the district of columbia the positions of the various justices on the question of whether congress can grant diversity jurisdiction for district of columbia residents would seem to also inform the question as to whether such justices would have supported the granting of house representation to district citizens as noted six justices explicitly rejected the extension of diversity jurisdiction using congresss power under the district clause it is unlikely that the justices in question would have rejected diversity jurisdiction for district of columbia re sidents but would then approve voting representation for those same resident s the recurring theme of both the hepburn and tidewater transfer co decisions was that the limitation of house representation to the states was the least controversial as pect of the constitution and that the plain meaning of the term state in regards to the organization of the federal political structures was esse ntially unquestioned consequently only the three justices of the plurality in tidewater transfer co might arguably have supported the doctr ine that the congresss power over the district of columbia would allow extension of house representation to its citizens however even this conclusion is suspect as noted the plurality opinion took pains to note the limited impact of its holding parties in diversity suits with residents of the district of columbia would have more convenient forum to bring law suit as noted the plurality specifically limited the scope of its decision to legislation that neither involved an extension or denial of any

regulation of local courts under the district clause and the territorial clausedisturbed the balance between th union and its component states75 arguably granting the delegate vote in the hous involves an extension of fundamental right further the possibility that nonstate political entity could cast deciding vote on an issue of national significan ce could well be seen as substantial disturbance to the existing federalism structure thus even the justices in the jackson plurality might distinguish the instant proposal from their holding in tidewater transfer co these three justices might also have had other concerns that would weigh against such an extension of their holding the act before the justices in that case did not affect just the district of columbia but also extended diversity jurisdiction to the territories of the united states including the thenterritories of hawaii and alaska76 although the question of diversity jurisdic tion over residents of the territories was not directly before the court subsequent lower court decisions77 have found that the reasoning of the tidewater transfer co case supported the extension of diversity jurisdiction to the territories beit under the territory clause78 thus concern that the plurality jus tices might have had about the instant proposal would be whether its approval would also validat an extension of house representation to other political entities such as the territories while the extension of diversity jurisdiction to residents of territories has been relatively uncontroversial decision to grant voting delegate to the territories might not under the territory clause the congress has plenary power over the territories of american samoa guam the virgin islands puerto ric and the commonwealth of

significance of limiting delegate voting to the committee of the whole as the above discussion is directed at the full house the question can be raised as to whether it should also apply to the committee of the whole the committee of the whole is not provided for in the constitution and the nature of the committee of the whole appears to have change d over time established in 1789 the committee of the whole appears to be derived from english parliamentary practices it was originally intended as procedural devi ce to exclude the speaker of the house of commons an ally of the king from observing the proceedings of the house84 since that time the committee has evolved into forum where debate and discussion can occur under procedures more flexible than those otherwise utilized by the house at present the committee of the whole is simply the full house in another form85 every legislator is member of the committee with full authority to debate and vote on all issues86 by resolving into the committee of the whole the house invokes variety of procedural devices wh ich speed up floor action instead of the normal quorum of onehalf of the legislator s in the house which is generally more than 200 legislators the committee of the whole only requires quorum of 100 members in addition amendments to bills are debated under fiveminute rule rather than the one hour rule

under article i of the constitution all legislative authority for the united states is to be vested in the senate and the house of representatives88 and under 2 of that article the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen in conformity with the qualifications and requirements of the constitution as the delega for the district of columbia is not member for purposes of article 289 the question arises as to the basis on which delegate could vote in the committee of the whole the constitution does not provide for representatives of the district of columbia or the territories such as the dele gate for the district of columbia or the resident commissioners or delegates for the territories nor does it appear that these delegates and resident co mmissioners are required to meet the qualifications or electoral requirements require d of members of congress90 consequently the constitution does not appear to provide the basis for delegate to exercise the power of members under the constitution91 however the constitution does not specify whether or not all legislative activities which member might engage in are restricted to those members thus leaving open the possibility that delegate may engage in some legislative activities which are not limited to members historically delegates have engaged in number of legislative activities which although preliminary to final passage of legislation and thus arguably advisory appear to involve the exercise of some modicum of legislative authority these activities have included introducing legislation92

it constitutionally distinct th court also found that the operational similarities between the committee and the w hole house were significant enough to raise constitutional issues 97 nonetheless because the revote provision rendered the vote largely symbolic the court held th at we do not think this minor addition to the office of delegates has constitutional significance98 standing the question has arisen as to who might have the ability to challenge statute which provides representative of the district of columbia vote in the committee of the whole or in the full house article iii

voters would have sta nding to challenge house rule from the 103rd congress that provided vote by the district of columbia and territorial delegate in the committee of the whole of the house103 in considering this issue the district court used the fourpart test set forth above to determine the existence of case or controversy in michel the district court evaluated the injury to state voters as

true case or cont roversy for example claim that the alleged unconstitutional action merely diminishes legislators effectiveness but does not actually diminish his legal author ity is generally considered too amorphous an injury to confer standing104 by contrast the court d found previously that the loss of vote or deprivation of particular opportunity to vote to be sufficiently particularized injury to warrant judicial scrutiny105 in michel the district court found that the sp ecific injury alleged was sufficient to confer standing for instance the court noted that the apportionment clause of the constitution provides that members of th house should be apportioned among the states according to the number of inhabitants in the states106 by allowing representation from nonstate the votin g power of each representative would be less than that authorized under the appor tionment clause the court found that the alleged dilution of the representational voting power

court concluded that the state voter plaintiffs could proceed the court of appeals for the district of columbia in reviewing this decision noted that the fact that an injury is widespread is not bar to suit as long as each person can be said to have suffere d distinct and concrete harm108 the court also noted the many times that the supreme c ourt has held that voters who were placed in voting district that had significantly fewer voters than anothe r district oneman onevote had standing because the significance of their vote was diluted109 although in the michel case the vote dilution which occurred was of the representatives vote not the voters the court did not find this distinction was of significance for purpose of establishing injury thus the court concluded that sufficient

representation to the district of columbia111 in addition to the state voters who brought suit in the case of michel v anderson the plaintiffs in that case included members of the house the court

should also be noted that s 1257 does not curren tly contain an explicit right for house members or other plaintiffs to challenge the law in raines v byrd six members of congress who had voted against the line item veto act117 brought suit against the secretary of the treasury and the director of the office of management and budget alleging that the act unconstitutionally increased the presidents power by authorizing him to cancel certain spending and tax benefit measures after he signed them into law without complying with the requirements of bicameral passage and presentment to the president118 the court found that an article iii court s hould have restricted role in resolving disputes between the political branches119 and held that plaintiffs lacked standing because their complaint did not establish that they had suffered an injury that was personal partic ularized and concrete120 the majority was of the view thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824crs24 120 continued their own colleagues in congress in passing the act id at 830 n11 121 see chenoweth v clinton 997 f supp 36 38 39 ddc 1998 personal injury more likely to result in grant of standing but institutional injury is sufficient under raines affd 181 f3d 112 dccir 1999 see also planned parenthood v ehlmann 137 f3d 573 577 78 8th cir 1998 standing of state legislators 122 the court in coleman v miller 307 us 433 1939 held that kansas state legislators had standing to bring suit against state offici als to recognize that the legislature had not ratified proposed amendment to the united stat constitution the plaintiffs in that case included twenty senators whose votes against the measure would have been sufficient to defeat it but whose votes were essentially nullified by the tiebreaking vote of the states lieutenant governor the presiding officer of the senate in favor of ratification the raines court distinguished the injury alleged by the pl aintiffs in that case the abstract dilution of institutional legislative power from the injury asserted in coleman vote nullification and found it unnecessary to decide whether coleman might also be distinguished on other grounds because of the considerable difference between the vote nullification in coleman and the alleged dilution of legislative power in raines it was not necessary for the raines court to determine the precise parameters of vote nullification that must be alleged for members to have standing under the coleman exception to raines campbell v clinton 52 f supp 2d 34 42 ddc 1999 affd 203 f3d 19 dc cir cert denied 121 sct 50 2000 123 plaintiffs alleged that the act injured them i n their official capacities by 1 altering the effect of all votes they might cast on bills containing items that could be cancelled by the president 2 divesting them of their constitu tional role with regard to the repeal of legislation and 3 shifting the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches 521 us at 816 124 id at 821 the case might have been different if the house of representatives had authorized the suit id at 829 125 521 us at 826 126 521 us at 82223 127 521 us at 824a congressional plaintiff may have standing in suit against the executive if it is alleged that the plaintiff has suffered ither personal injury eg loss of members seat or an institutional one121 that is not abstract and widely dispersed but amounts to vote nullification122 in the view of the court the raines plaintiffs alleged123 an institutional injury which damaged all members reduction of legislative and political power generally rather than personal injury to private right which would be more particularized and concrete124 the court in raines was willing to find an institutional injury to be sufficient if that injury amounted to nu llification of particular vote125 and if the plaintiffs votes would have been sufficient to pass or defeat specific bill126 additionally the raines court indicated that it would not find nullification of vote if some means of legislative redress was available to the plaintiffs127 based on the raines case it could be argued that if representative of the district of columbia cast deciding vote then court might find this to constitutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824crs25 128 ins v chadha 462 us 919 93536 1983 alien had standing to challenge the constitutionality of 8 usc 1254c2 under which the house of representatives by resolution sought to invalidate the decision by the attorney general to allow respondent to remain in the united states united states v smith 286 us 6 33 1932 judicial review was available where the senate attempted to revoke the nomination of the plaintiff after he had been confirmed to the board of the federal power commissionvote nullification and thus would represent sufficient institutional injury so as to allow suit for instance if legisl ator was part of group of members whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat the passage of bill because majority had not voted for its passage allowing such bill to go into effect would appear to be nullification of those members votes further an attempt by that group of legislators to overturn the vote by the dist rict representative would also be subject to the risk that the district coul d cast deciding vote on this proposal absent such an example of specific injury however it is less clear that an individual or group of house representatives could bring challenge to vote by district of columbia representative if the vote had not yet had specific effect on the vote of such plaintiffs in particular the fact that the congress could repeal the rule or law granting such vote would indicate th at court might require that legislators seek redress from the congress finally it would seem likely that in the event that representative from the district of columbia were to cast the deciding vote on piece of legislation individuals directly affected by such legisl ation could bring case in this situation plaintiff could arguably monstrate an injury in fact and substantial likelihood that judicial relief could redress the claimed injury the specific injury requirement would be met by noting the application of th statute to particular plaintiff and redress would be accomplished by findi ng of unconstitutionality and the issuance of an injunction128 conclusion in sum it is difficult to identify either constitutional text or existing case law which would directly support the allocation by congress of the power to vote in the full house on the district of columbia delegate further that case law which does exist would seem to indicate that not only is the district of columbia not state for purposes of representation but that congressional power over the district of columbia does not represent sufficient power to grant congressional representation in particular at least six of the justices who participated in what appears to be the most relevant supreme court case national mutual insuran ce co of the district of columbia v tidewater transfer co authored opinions rejecting the proposition that congresss power under the district clause was sufficien t to effectuate structural changes to the political structures of the federal government further the remaining three justices who found that the congre ss could grant diversity jurisdiction to district of columbia citiz ens despite the lack of ch jurisdiction under article iii specifically limited their opinion to instances where there was extension of anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33824crs26 fundamental right nor substan tial disturbance of the existin g federalism structure to the extent that providing di strict residents with hous representation could be so characterized then one could argue that all nine justices would have found the instant proposal to be unconstitutional although not beyond question it would ppear likely that the congress does not have authority to grant voting representati on in the house of representatives to the district of columbia as contemplated by hr 1905 on the other hand because the provisions of hres 78 allowing delegates vote in the committee of the whole would be largely symbolic these amendments to the house rules are likely to pass constitutional muster
