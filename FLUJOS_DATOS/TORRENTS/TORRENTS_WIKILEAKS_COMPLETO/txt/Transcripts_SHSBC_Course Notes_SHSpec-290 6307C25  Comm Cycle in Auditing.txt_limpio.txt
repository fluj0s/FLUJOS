6307c25 shspec290 comm cycle in auditing illustrations for this lecture are contained in hcob 74aug63 lecture graphs most auditors early on get the idea that there are all kinds of pcs good and bad there are pcs who are nervier about comm breakdowns than others but practically pc can stand up against good comm cycle the difficulty an auditor has comes from his own auditing cycle and his impatience there are two comm cycles in the auditing comm cycle one with the auditor at cause one with the pc at cause they are only connected by the fact that the auditor has calculatedly restimulated something in the pc which the pc discharges on his half of the cycle that is the whole game of the auditing cycle see fig 12 figure 12 the basic auditing comm cycle graphics inserted some auditing breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc if the pc doesnt answer the auditing question he never gets rid of the restimulation if the pc alterises eg if he alterises the question or if he alterises the data from the bank then every restimulation gives rise to an alteris the cycle of acknowledgment is another little shadow cycle fadeout see fig 13 another shadow cycle is the auditor seeing that the pc has received the auditing command you can tell by locking at him that he didnt get it or that he is doing something peculiar with it so do look at the pc to find out figure 13 the full auditing comm cycle graphics inserted so there are really seven comm cycles in the auditing cycle the four main ones plus three more 1 observing that the pc is ready to receive the auditing command failure to do this one can cause trouble if the pc is hung up on the previous cycle he doesnt really get the command if he wasnt ready to receive it 2 observing that the pc got the acknowledgment 3 tiny one before the acknowledgment which is seeing whether the pc has or hasnt said all he is going to say if you acknowledge him before he has said all you havent let one line flow to its end so the acknowledgment cant actually go through and the lines jam when you violate one of these comm cycles you will get trouble in which case you might need more cycles to unsnarl it so the auditing cycle can occur theres another comm cycle inside the auditing cycle which is between the pc and the bank see fig 141 you have an effect produced by the auditing command which results in cause the restimulation causing the pc to outflow it is actually two comm cycles there pc to bank and bank to pc then you get pc to auditor the latter is actually the least important of the cycles except when it isnt being done and it is the hardest to detect when it isnt being done figure 14 the expanded basic auditing comm cycle graphics inserted what is mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused some of the comm cycles within it when you are doing complicated action like r2h if you are nervy on handling basic tool like the auditing cycle break it down and work on it while doing something simple on an easy pc then you will find out where it is jammed up there is different auditing cycle inside the regular auditing cycle which occurs when the pc originates see fig 15 just handle it as its own drill it handles any origin including the pc throwing down the cans the pattern of causedistanceeffect is reversed because the pc is now being cause at the start of the cycle what the pc causes has to be understood so there can be some little comm cycles where the auditor gets it clarified what the auditor uses to clarify it mustnt just cause the pc to repeat himself tell some more about that is good approach but whatever you use isnt rote once the origination has been clarified the auditor acknowledges and can then resume the regular cycle if the pc is ready for it also at the beginning of the pcs origination cycle the auditor should observe that the pc is about to originate and shut up and make the comm cycle of im listening figure 15 the preclear origination comm cycle graphics inserted the fact that duplication is part of the comm cycle carries it over into r c and u this makes the auditing comm cycle different from the military comm cycle which doesnt require understanding military cycle causedistanceeffectcompliance auditing cycle causedistanceeffectunderstanding hence the auditing comm cycle involves and r too there has to be and r at the effect point because of duplication and there had better be and r at the cause point also so there should be arc at both the cause point and the effect point the trs handle comm cycles from one side or another full auditing cycle would need fulldress tr above what is covered in trs 04 and r come into tr1 it is one thing to enunciate syllables clearly and another to have an understandable communication r is involved it has to be duplicatable an accent can get in the way of duplication it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible from the point of view of accent diction and sense since if the auditor is not comprehended by the pc tr1 is out and comm cycle or auditing takes place then there is the pc who doesnt want to be audited at all here you have to establish comm cycle with some trick like tell why you shouldnt be audited or if the pc ia misemotional and the is out you can do an arc break assessment in order to pick up what is awry with the comm cycles between the pc and himself where the bpc lies repetitive auditing cycle is specialized activity it gets you in trouble if you dont realize that there is point beyond which you shouldnt be trying to complete the cycle that point is an ability regained that ep is of senior importance the major auditing cycle has as its ep ability regained junior to that is the process cycle which in turn is made up of single auditing cycles repeated as needed so the cycles that exist in auditing are 1 single auditing cycle 2 process cycle 3 major auditing cycle indications of flatness in process cycle are 1 three equal comm lags with the pc confidently doing the process 2 minor cognition win 3 ta flat 4 major cognition 5 ability regained the above eps are given in ascending order of seniority 1 and 2 are both absolute minimums the first real flat point is when all the ta has been run out of process major cognition takes precedence over the ta criterion to continue over major cognition invalidates the pc the senior ep is ability regained which is also the ep of major auditing cycle
