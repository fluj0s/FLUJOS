expedited procedures in the senate if the legislation is introduced in either house within 30 days of continuous session after congress receives the presidents certification arms export control act aeca 102b4bc the waiver authority allows the president to waive any sanction that must otherwise be imposed under 102b2 if he determines and certifies in writing to the speaker of the house and the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee that the imposition of the sanction would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of united states nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security aeca 102b5 the certification must include statement setting forth the specific reasons for the waiver the authority would be limited to the country that has engaged in the proscribed conduct 7for example 102b applies to country that has detonated nuclear explosive device when it had the status of nonnuclearweapon state an act whose character cannot be modified were that status subsequently to change 8legislative history of pl 103236 does not appear to address the termination of 102b sanctions see 140 cong rec s411s413 daily ed january 31 1994 and hrept 103482 103d cong 2d sess 261266 1994 section 102b may be compared however to 824 continuedgthe authorities of section 6 of the export administration act of 19795 shall be used to prohibit exports to that country of specific goods and technology excluding food and other agricultural commodities except that such prohibition shall not apply to any transacti on subject to the reporting requirements of title v of the national security act of 1947 relating to congressional oversight of intelligence activities while the statute requires that the president impose the sanctions forthwith it does not specify date by which they must be imposed the president may delay their imposition for maximum of 30 days of continuous session of congress however if he first transmits to the speaker of the house of representatives and the chairma n of the senate foreign relations committee certification that he has determined that an immediate imposition of sanctions on that country would be detrimental to the national security of the united states 102b4b this section permits only one certification to be transmitted to the congress for country regarding the same detonation transfer or receipt of nuclear explosive device section 102b does not allow the president unilaterally to waive one or more of the sanctions when they are originally imposed but does provide for the enactment of legislation on an expedited basis that would permit such waiver6 the statute does not provide for the possible removal or suspension of one or more of the sanctions once certain conditions are met7 nor does it provide for their termination thus in the absence of other provisions of law that may be invoked legislation must seemingly be enacted to achieve these ends8httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98486crs5 8continued of the nuclear proliferation prevention act which like 826a the section enacting 102b is also contained in part b of the act section 824 which provides for the imposition of sanctions on persons found to have assisted nuclear proliferation through the provision of financing requires that sanctions continue in effect for 12 months and provides that they will cease to apply after that period only if the president makes certain determinations it should also be noted that while the president has independent powers in the area of foreign relations the power of the president or other entities of the executive branch to engage in the activities covered by the sanctions eg providing foreign assistance licensing arms exports and to prohibit the particular transactions listed in the act is based on statutory grants of delegated authority in areas where congress has exercised its express constitutional powers the president may not use his

loans which apply to the government of that country neither of these terms is defined in the statute however and thus it is not clear whether they are intended to include subnationa l or governmentowned entities compare for example 2b4 of the exportimport bank act see supra note 3 which provides that the term country is to have the meaning given to the term foreign state in 28 usc 1603b provision of the foreign sovereign immunities act under this provision the term foreign state is to include political subdivision of foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of foreign state other terms for example humanitarian aid also remain undefined the legislation does not contain contract sanctity provision which would bar the president from prohibiting transactions in performance of contracts entered into before the date of the sanctionsinvoke that part of 102b allowing 30day delay of sanctions by doing so the president appeared to forego the possible expedited enactment of joint resolution authorizing him to waive any sanction with respect to india or pakistan as provided in 102b4b congress could choose to enact separate legislation however authorizing such waiver or version thereof the presidents determination regarding india was the first invocation of 102b at the time regulations had been issued governing its implementation while the executive branch has implemented many forms of sanctions legislation in the past and could draw on this experience in implementing 102b it had prior regulatory precedents for administering this specific statute the absence of certain definitions in 102b could present problems for agencies but could also afford them flexibility in implementing these measures11 agencies involved in administering the sanctions
