request and eliminated f unding for this program8 top was competitive meritbased matching grant program that was st arted in fy1994 to provide emerging telecommunications and information technol ogies to grant recipients in new and innovative ways9 the bush administration and congress agreed that this program had successfully served its purpose of creating ne w pilot programs in areas not served or underserved by telecomm unications and internet technologies while some policymakers have called for new funding for this pr ogram new legislation authorizing appropriations has been introduced to date conclusions policymakers continue to examine the proper role of ntia in supporting its programs and policies as well as the ove rall budget for ntia to support its mission according to some the telecommunications act of 1996 set into law deregulatory environment that requires less not more fe deral direction of lecommunications and information technology use the explosive growth of the internet since the mid1990s has reach ed nearly every part of america nd internet access is virtually ubiquitous therefore beyond budget issues the role of ntia has changed in some policy areas two important issues facing ntias ad ministration of public telecommunications policy are domain name registration and use of spectrum regarding domain names the expiration of the departme nt of commercentia mou with icann on september 30 2006 has led to speculation over whether and how the mou might be renewed it also has raised concerns over the extent to whic h if at all ntia might ultimately relinquish control over icann and the domain name sy stem second some are concerned that ntia is seeking to develop larger and broader policy role in spectrum management as result of losing funding in other progra m areas such as the top program and perhaps eventually the ptfpc program because spectrum and its use is an important alternative to terrestrial communications transmission and reception fede ral policy regarding its usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21469crs6 10 to alleviate these concerns the bush ad ministration has announced that the assistant secretary of ntia will chair an interagency comm ittee the policy and plans steering group which will seek to implement the president s november 30 2004 spectrum policy initiative httpwwwntiadocgovntiahomegalleryppsg01242005htm viewed june 27 2007 11 the last mile is term that applies when an entire telecommunications network is in place except for the final connection or last mile to the user and applications is an importa nt national issue some stion whether ntias evolving role in spectrum management is being fully coordinated with other federal institutions such as that of the federal communications commission10 second important issue is the role of ntia in the auction and management of spectrum the third ntia program that is administered by ntia but not directly funded by appropriated money comes out of the 2005 deficit reduc tion act that law pl 109 171 called for the creation of digital tran sition and safety pub lic fund which would provide funding for further us of the electromagnetic spect rum by offsetting receipts received from the auction of licenses to use the older analog spectrum for other purposes the initial auction was held on january 24 2008 the receipts from the auction will fund the following programmatic functions at ntia perhaps the most notable and receiving the most public attention is digitalanal og converter box progra m to assist consumers in meeting the february 2009 deadline for r eceiving television broadcasts in digital format congress is watching this transition period and ntias role in it very closely concerns about changes in ntias missi on and objectives also has been raised regarding the bush administrations elimina tion of funding for the top program and reducing funding for the ptfpc program th administration contends that the efforts of the former will be picked up by the private sector and the latter by the corporation for public broadcasting some still contend that it is not clear whether all of the possible areas of information infrastru cture development have been saturated through the top program or if not yet saturate d whether industry will find it pr ofitable to provide the last mile11 of telecommunications and internet conn ections in areas not yet served for public telecommunications and facilities planning and construction an issue may arise as to whether the corporation for public broadcasting has the resources to administer facilities construction program the ultimate question may be whether this change will fundamentally affect the pace at which nati onal broadcasting is converted to digital transmission
