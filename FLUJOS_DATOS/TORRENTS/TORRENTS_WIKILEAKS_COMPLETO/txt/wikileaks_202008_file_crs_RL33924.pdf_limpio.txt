reorganization is the requirement that the municipal debtor and majority of its creditors reach an agreement on plan to readjust the municipalitys debts the outcome of any reorganization cannot be predicted with certainty several basic principles may provide guidance as one considers the likely course of major m unicipal reorganization first the policy underlying chapter 9 is unlike that of ot her chapters municipalities are not subject to liquidation or strict judicial control municipal authorities do not need judicial permission to exercise governmental functions second development of the reorganization plan is largely the initiative of municipal authorities even though the us bankruptcy code is designed to give the cashstrapped municipal debtor breathing room and an opportunity to marshal its assets nothing in the law relieves it from th requirements of applicable nonbankruptcy law filing bankruptcy does not lift from the municipa lity the burdens imposed upon it by myriad state and federal laws re organization and u ltimately repudiation of debt may be facilitated by chapter 9 but the manner in which the municipal debtor reaches its goal for rehabilitation will still

objections in ashton and held the act constitutional in united states v bekins 13 the court acknowledged that the federal measure was necessary because th constitutions contract clause14 prohibits the states but not the federal government from enacting any law that alters contractual obligations and therefore severely limits the ability of the states to afford adequate relief to an insolvent municipality the court also recited those factors retained and incorporated into present chapter 9 which it deemed vital to protect state autonomy state consent to the municipal filing for reorganization judicial restraint from interference with the fiscal or government affairs of the political subdivision and prohibition of involuntary proceedings15 chapter 9s modern genesis is in legislation enacted in the wake of new york citys financial crisis in 1975 although ne w york city did not file in bankruptcy the procedural mechanisms of old chapter ix were generally believed to be totally inadequate to govern the reorganization of major municipality like new york among the procedural obstacles was the requirement that the petitioning municipality obtain the prior consent of owners of fiftyone percent of its outstanding securities before the bankruptcy court could approve the petition as properly filed the petitioning municipality was thus required to locate its creditors draw up plan and negotiate and obtain the required c onsents before it could even file its reorganization until the case was file d the municipality could not even ask the court to issue stay of all pending litigation the usual first critical rehabilitative procedure in bankruptcy hence in 1976 congress enacted major substantive revisions pursuant to pl 94260 to chapte r ix of the bankruptcy act of 1898 the procedures effected by pl 94260 were inco rporated as chapter 9 of the current law the bankruptcy reform act of 1978 pl 95598 as amendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33924crs4 16 bridgeport

chapter 9 since its enactment in 1978 even so this chapter of the code has been amended twice since enactment in 1988 congress passed amendments ge nerally concerned with the definition of municipal insolvenc the rights of creditors as general obligation bondholders and special revenue bondholders and the status of municipal financing leases17 chapter 9 was again amended by 402 of the bankruptcy reform act of 1994 pl 103394 these amendments require that municipality be specifically authorized by the state to file in bankrupt cy and is discussed below the reform act of 1994 also created national bankrupt cy review commission to study the bankruptcy code and make recommendations for change its report made only passing reference to chapter 918 likewise the bankruptcy abuse prevention

proposes one that cannot be legally conf irmed or that creditors do not accept the courts sole remedy is dismissal28 dismissal operates to restore the debtor and creditors to thei r procedural and substantive rights under applicable nonbankruptcy law the automatic stay among the greatest advantages to the chapter 9 municipal debtor are the automatic stay and the opportunity to acqui re postpetition financin g petition filed in bankruptcy operates as an automatic stay of all actions including judicial and administrative ones intended to enforce claim against the debtor including its officers and inhabitants29 the stay does not operate to delay or waive application of noncommercial or nonbankr uptcyrelated laws ordinarily the automatic stay operates to protect debtors property which may be held by third party subject to certa in express exceptions hence third party holding property of the debtor would be pr ohibited by the stay from disposing of it even under colorable legal claim to it one important area of exceptions to the automatic stay is for actions for the setoff of wide variety of financial instruments and agreements such as forward contracts and repurchase agreements30 amendments to the code added in 1984 1990 and 2005 apply to municipalities and are designed to protect the smooth functioning of i nvestment marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33924crs7 31

the debtor to others creditor who may have lawfully received money from the debtor within specified time prior to the filing may be compelled by the court to disgorge and return it to the debtor for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate the purpose of requiring creditors in specified situ ations to disgorge monies received from the debtor legally prior to bankruptcy is to maxi mize the estate to

municipal debtor unlik one under chapter 11 does not need bankruptcy court approval to borrow nd spend money indeed there is not separate bankruptcy estate in chapter 9 case so the debtor is free to control property without regard to restrictions gene rally applicable to estate property although municipal debtor retains autonomy the code does impose some affirmative obligation on it to act to reorganize its debt an initial requirement is that the debtor file its petition in good faith31 while finding of good faith reposes great deal of discretion in the court it is protective criterion for the creditors in addition to the automatic stay chapter 9 debtor may avail itself of wide array of bankruptcy powers including the right to avoid preferences32 to set aside fraudulent conveyances33 to borrow money on the security of liens senior to existing liens of record34 to reject executory contracts35 and to bind all creditors by confirmed plan36 the fundamental character of chapter 9 is defined by the jurisdictional constraints imposed upon the court discussed supra narrower provisions tailored to municipal reorganization most of wh ich were added by the 1988 amendments include special protections for leases to the municipality37 and requirements for the segregation separation and pr otection from avoidance actions of municipal revenues dedicated to general bondholders ve

relations in 1984 the united states supreme court in national labor relations board v bildisco 39 allowed chapter 11 debtor to unilaterally abrogate collective bargaining agreement cba finding the labor contract to be an executory contract under 11 usc 365 subject to rejec tion by the debtor upon presentation of evidence that the agreement burdens the estate and that the equities favor rejection in 1984 congress overturned the bildisco holding by enactment of new 1113 of the code which requires chapter 11 debtor to negotiate proposed modifications of cba with the authorized representative of the employees covered by such agreement many steps are required of the debtor and ultimately court approval is necessary for debtor rejecti on or modification of cba this provision of the code applicable to chapter 11 debtors however is not expressly applicable to chapter 9 debtor section 1113 was enacted to reconcile the conflict between the national labor relati ons act and the bankruptcy code labor relations for state and local public employees are covered exclusively by state law40 hence chapter 9 municipal debtor does not have to comply with 1113 and may enjoy greater latitude than private debtor under chapter 11 with respect to modification or rejection of labor agreem ents in bankruptcy collective bargaining agreements may be subject to rejection under chapter 9 like other executory contracts with damages treated as prepetition debt however bildisco has been held to apply to municipal debtors the ba nkruptcy court overseeing the orange county reorganization found that the county had not satisfied standards established by the bildisco decision and state case law to establish the necessity for unilateral abrogation of its employee cbas the labor coalition further argues that before impairing its contractual rights on the basis of an emergency the county must satisfy the following fourpart test 1 declared emergency must be based on an adequate factual foundation 2 the agencys action must be designed to protect basic social interest and not benefit particular individual 3 the w must be appropriate for the emergency and obligation and 4 the agency decision must be temporary limited to the immediate exigency that caused the acti on in my view any unilateral action by municipality to impair contract with its employees must satisfy these factors if not as legal matter cer tainly from an equitable standpoint41 the ability and standards by which chapter 9 debtor may modify or abrogate cbas with public employees are likely to vary from state to state httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33924crs9 42 11 usc 1129b1 the standards imposed by these terms of art though not fully tested in chapter 9 are supported by large body of judicial case w and cannot be

reduced to its bare essen tial debt adjustment under chapter 9 simply requires the debtor and its creditors to reach some agreement on an acceptable reorganization plan the municipality need not actually negotiate the plan with its creditors it may file debt adjustment plan or modifications to the plan unilaterally but the plan must ultimately be approved by creditors in order to become effective if consensus is reached the court reviews the plan to determine that it does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with resp ect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under and has not accepted the plan42 the code also provides that an exchange of new securities for claim covered by the plan regardless of whether the exchange occurs before or after the filing of the petition does not limit or impair the effectiveness of the plan for purposes of accepting or rejecting the plan creditor w ho participates in an exchange will vote according to the number and amount of cl aims held prior to the exchange43 11 usc 943 directs the court to confirm plan if it complies with code requirements expenses incurred in connec tion with the case and the reorganization plan are disclosed and are reasonable the debtor is not prohib ited by law from taking any action necessary to carry out the plan holders of administrative expense claims receive cash

fina nce and oversight among others but the state of californias policy allowing its municipalities to avail themselves of relief under chapter 9 app ears to be prudent one and the code itself as applied by the bankruptcy court appears to have been sufficiently flexible to accommodate the operational needs of the county and the interests of its creditors conclusion the paramount feature of municipal reorganization is the requirement that the municipal debtor and majority of its creditors reach an agreement on the plan to readjust the municipalitys debts th outcome of any reorganization cannot be predicted with certainty given the many variables including applicable state law and the underlying reason for the insolvency the parties involved including the court may take an expans ive and dynamic approach to reorganization or narrow more limited view of remedial possibilities several basic principles may provide guidance as one considers the likely cour of major municipal reorganization first the policy underlying chapter 9 is like that of other chapters municipalities are not subject to liquidation or strict judicial control second development of the reorganization plan is largely the initiative of municipal authorities who do not need judicial permission to exerci governmental functions conversely even though the code is designed to give the cashstrapped municipal debtor breathing room and an opportunity to marshal its assets the code does not relieve the debtor from the requirements of applicable nonbankruptcy law filing bankruptcy does not lift from the m unicipality the burdens imposed upon it by myriad state and federal laws reorga nization and ultimately repudiation of debt may be facilitated by chapter 9 filing but the manner in which the
