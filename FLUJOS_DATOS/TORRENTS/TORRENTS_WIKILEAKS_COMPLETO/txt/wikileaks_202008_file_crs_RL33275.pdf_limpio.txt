and current law summary the low income home energy assist ance program liheap provides funds to states the district of columbia us territories and commonwealths and indian tribal organizations collectively referred to as grantees primarily to help low income households pay home energy expens the liheap statute provides for two types of funding regular funds some times referred to as block grant funds and emergency contingency funds regular funds are allocated to grantees based on formula while contingency funds may be re leased to one or more grantees at the discretion of the secretary of the department of health and human services based on emergency need regular liheap funds are allocated to the states according to formula that has long and complicated history t ribes receive funds based on their number of federally eligible liheap households compared to the total number in the state whereas territories receive set percentage of total liheap regular funds in 1980 congress created the predecessor program to liheap the low income energy assistance program lieap as part of th crude oil windfall profits tax act pl 96223 because congress wa s particularly concerned with the high costs of heating funds under lieap were distribut ed according to multistep formula that benefitted coldweather states in 1981 congress enacted liheap as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act pl 9735 replacing lieap however the liheap statute specified that states would continue to receive the same percentage of regular funds that they did under the lieap formula when congress reauthorized liheap in 1984 as part of the human services reauthorization act pl 98558 it changed the programs formula by requiring the use of more recent population and energy da ta and requiring that hhs consider both heating and cooling costs of lowincome households change from the focus on the heating needs of all households the effect of these changes meant that in general funds would be shifted from coldweather stat to warmweather st ates to prevent dramatic shift of funds congress adde d two holdharmless provisions to the formula the result of these provisions is current law threetiered formula sometimes referred to as the new formula the application of which depends on the amount of regular funds that congress appropriates the tier i formula is used to allocate funds when the total liheap regular fund appropriation is less than or equal to the equivalent of hypothetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion above this level funds are allocated according to tier ii of the formula wh ich includes holdharmless level to prevent certain states from losing liheap funds finally tier iii applies to appropriations at or bove 225 billion and includes second hold harmless provision the holdharmless rate since fy1986 liheap regular fund appropr iations have exceeded the equivalent of an fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billi on on three occasions in fy2006 when the regular fund appropria tion was 248 billion in fy2008 when appropriations slightly exceeded the trigger and in fy2009 when congress directed that 840 million be distributed according to the new liheap

and current law introduction the low income home energy assistance program liheap is block grant program administered by the department of health and human services hhs under which the federal government gives nnual grants to states the district of columbia us territories and commonwealth s and indian tribal organizations to operate multicomponent home energy assistance progra ms for needy households1 established in 1981 by title xxvi of pl 9735 the omnibus budget reconciliation act liheap has been reauthorized and amended number of times most recently in 2005 when pl 10958 the energy policy act authorized annual regular liheap funds at 51 billion per year from fy2005 through fy20072 the federal liheap statute has very broa d guidelines with almost all decisions regarding the programs operati on made by the states recipients may be helped with their heating and cooling costs receive crisis assistance have weatherizing expenses paid or receive other aid designed to reduce their home energy needs households with incomes up to 150 of the federal pove rty income guidelines or if greater 60 of the state median income are federally eligible for liheap benefits states may adopt lower income limits but household with income below 110 of the poverty guidelines may be considered ineligible the most current hhs data show that an estimated 53 million households r eceived winter heating or winter crisis assistance in fy2005 the majority of liheap funds pay for heating assistance3 the liheap statute provides for two ty pes of program f unding regular funds sometimes referred to as block grant f unds and emergency contingency funds regular funds are allotted to states on th basis of the liheap statutory formula which was enacted as part of the human services reauthorization act of 1984 pl 985584 the way in which regular funds ar allocated to states depends on the amount of funds appropriated by congre ss the second type of liheap funds emergency contingency funds may be released and allotted to one or more states athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs2 5 depending on how congress appropriates them contingency funds may remain available for

at any point in the fiscal year to meet additional home energy assistance needs created by natural disaster or other emergency6 the remainder of this report discu sses only the history and methods of distributing regular liheap funds predecessor programs to liheap the mid to late1970s time marked by ra pidly rising fuel prices also marked the beginning of federal energy assistan ce funding for lowincome households the first national program to help lowinco households was created in early 1975 to assist families with energy conservation primarily through home weatherization this assistance was provided through new em ergency energy conservation program eecp enacted as part of the headst art economic opport unity and community partnership act of 1974 pl 93644 the funds were administered by the community services administration csa the successor agency to the office of economic opportunity which wa s responsible for many of the programs created as part of the 1964 war on poverty beginning in 1977 funds were so made available through the csa to help fa milies directly pay for fuel as opposed to weatherization expenses via variety of programs each of these programs had in common focus on the need for heating assistance versus cooling assistance congress continued to appr opriate funds for energy assistance programs through fy1980 at which point new program the low income energy assistance program lieap was enacted as part of the crude oil windfall profits tax act of 1980 pl 96223 lieap which was ad ministered by the departme nt of health and human services hhs was funded for one year fy1981 before the creation of liheap like the csa programs lieap emphasize d heating over cooling needs this preference was reflected in both the csa program formulas and the lieap set of formulas which used variables that benefitted coldweather states to determine how funds would be distributed the lieap set of formulas continue s to have relevance for the way in which liheap funds are di stributed this section of the report describes these predecessor programs to liheap and their di stribution formulashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs3 7 community services

insulate the homes of lowincome families 9 for example if southern state experiences 700 heating degree days in year and northern state experiences 7000 the northern st ate has 10 times as many heating degree days as the southern state however if both numbers are squared the northern state has 100 times as many heating degree days as the southern state 10 community services administration

president ford signed into law the headstart economic opportunity and community partners hip act of 1974 pl 93644 which contained funds for new program ca lled the emergency energy conservation program eecp the program was to be administered by the community services administration csa and its purpose was to enable lowincome individuals and fa milies including the elderly and the near poor to participate in energy conservation programs designed to lessen the impact of the high cost of energy and to reduce energy consumption the law governing eecp listed number of eligible activities in which states could participate including energy conservati on and education prog rams weatherization assistance loans and grants for the purch ase of energy conservation technologies alternative fuel supplies nd fuel voucher and stamp prog rams despite the variety of activities that could be funded through the program the first csa funding notice regarding the program limited eligible activities to winterizing homes and to giving emergency assistance to prevent hardship or danger to health due to utility shutoff or lack of fuel7 during the four years the eec p was funded the ma jority of funds were used for weat herization expenses8 eecp funds were distributed to states vi formula that be nefitted those states with high heating costs one formula variable in particular measure of coldness called heating degree days benefitted coldweather states heating degree days measure the extent to which days aver age temperature falls below 65 fahrenheit for example day with an average temp erature of 50 results in measure of 15 heating degree days because heating degree days are higher in cold weather states including the heating degree day variable in formula favors states with greater heating needs squaring the heating degree days magnifies this effect9 the eecp formula took the number of populationweight ed heating degree days in each state squared them and multiplied the result by the number of households in poverty that owned their homes to determine how funds would be allocated10 t h c s ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs4 10 continued 47096 11 federal register vol

three fiscal years that followed the first appropriation for the eecp from fy1976 through fy1978 the csa changed somewhat the way in wh ich it allocated funds to the states however the factors continued to favor co ldweather states through use of either heating degree days or h eating degree days squared12 the first year that congress specifically appropriated funds for direct assistance to help lowincome households those at or below 125 of poverty pay their energy costs instead of funds that went prima rily for weatherization and conservation activities was fy1977 the fy1977 supplem

the low income energy assistance program lieap lieap the direct predecessor pr ogram to liheap was established as part of the crude oil windfall profits tax act of 1980 pl 96223 the program was introduced in the senate as the home energy assistance act s 1724 and was incorporated into hr 3919 the bill that would become the crude oil windfall profits tax act on the senate floor like the energy assistance programs of the late 1970s such as the special crisis intervention program and the low income supplemental energy allowances lieap allo cated funds to states in order to help lowincome households pay their home ener gy costs also like these predecessor programs lieap allocated f unds to states us ing method that put more emphasis on the heating needs of coldweather states than it did on cooling needs during the 1970s home energy costs had increased substantially while wages failed to keep up according to the re port from the senate committee on labor andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs7 19 senate committee on labor and human resources home energy assistance act report to accompany s 1724 96th cong 1st sess srept 96378 october 25 1979 p 2 20 ibid p 3 21 also discussed at the hearings was the need for some level of assistance to be provided to certain eligible households where excessive heat is factor in threatening life and health ibid p 5 this did not figure prominently into the formula however 22 ibid p 12 23 the bls determined the lower living standa rd income level through its annual family budgets which it maintained from 1947 to 1981 at the time the lieap program was enacted the bls developed annual family budgets assuming three different standards of continuedhuman resources that accompanied the home energy assistance act s 1724 between 1972 and 1979 heating oil prices in creased by 293 natural gas prices by 155 and electricity prices by 91 wh ile wages grew by 59 during the same period19 during 1978 lowincome house holds spent an estimated 184 of their income on average to pay their utilities with expenditures in new england by low income households exceeding 30 of income20 the senate committee on labor and human resources held numerous hearings about the need for energy assistance to address the dramatically ri sing cost of home heating21 the resulting formula in s 1724 reflecte d in part the committees concern that the problem of rising energy costs were most critical in areas with high home heating costs22 although subsequent changes we re made to the lieap formula in s 1724 before it was enacted the need for heating assistance continued to be paramount the formula developed under lieap has been used to distribute liheap funds as recently as fy2007 so the variables used are important in understanding the current formula and the way in which it is used to distribute funds the lieap formula when the home energy assistance act s 1724 was introduced it contained formula that would have distributed funds to the states on the basis of half on reside ntial energy expenditures nd half on heating degree days the heating degree day measure is descri bed in the previous section community services administration energy assistan ce programs however on the senate floor the program formula was amended resulting in multipart formula under which states would receive funds formula under pl 96223 under the final lieap formula in pl 96223 states received funds under one of four lternative formulas us ed to measure home energy need depending on which one benefitted state the most three of the four formulas contained di fferent combinations of severa l factors residential energy expenditures heating degree days or hea ting degree days squared and the number of lowincome households in the state under the first formula alternative half of the allocation was based on residential energy expenditure s and half on heating degree days squared multiplied by the number of households at or below the bureau of labor statistics bls lower living standard23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs8 23 continued living lower intermediate and higher the budget was calculated using costs of consumer goods including food housing transportation cl othing and health care unlike the federal poverty guidelines which are based on the am ount of money needed to buy food the budget was then adjusted for family size and the prices of goods in various cities throughout the country see david s johnson john m rogers and lucilla tan century of family budgets in the united states monthly labor review 124 5 may 2001 2845 24 according to the law the state is authoriz ed to make grants to eligible households to meet the rising costs of cooling whenever the household establishes that such cooling is the result of medical need pursuant to standards established by the secretaryunder the second formula alternativ one quarter of the allocation was based on residentia l energy expenditures and three quarters based on heating degree days squared multiplied by the number of households at or below the bls lower living standard under the third formula alternative half of the allocation was based on residential energy expenditures and half based on heating degree days not squared multiplied by the number of households with incomes at or below the bls lower living standard the fourth option guaranteed states minimum benefit of 120 for each household that received aid to families with depe ndent children afdc or food stamp benefits see table 2 for breakdown of these formulas all formulas in pl 96223 effectively gave preference to states with colder climates due to the variables used as discussed earlier in this report the heating degree day variable is measure of temp eratures below 65 f and therefore favors coldweather states squaring the heating degree day variable magnifies the discrepancy between warm and coldweather states in addition residential energy expenditures of all households rather th an energy expenditures of lowincome households only are higher in coldw eather states because on average the proportion of poor families in warmweather states is higher than that in coldweather states however the lieap law did llow states to provide for cooling when households could demonstr ate medical necessity24 congress authorized lieap for one year fy1981 at 3 billion but funds were not appropriated as part of pl 96 223 formula under pl 96369 before the formula in pl 96223 could be used to allocate funds congress introduced an alternative method for computing the state distribution rates it did so wh it appropriated 185 billion in lieap funds for fy1981 in continuing resolution p l 96369 in october of 1980 six months after enactment of the crude oil windfa ll

did little to erode the defacto coldweather states preference enacted in the original lieap formula the first step in the new set of formulas was to determine each states share of funds using two calculations set out in h rept 961244 and assign states the greater of the two amounts under the first formula alternative half of the allocation was based on the increase in home heating expe nditures and lf was based on the number of heating degree days squared times the population with income less than or qual to 125 of poverty under the second formula alternativ one quarter of the allocation was based on total residential ergy expenditures and three quarters was based on heating degree days squared multiplied by the number of lowincome households in the state the greater of the two percentages calcu lated using the formula in hrept 961244 was then assigned to each state after adjusting state allotme nts proportionately so that the total allocation reached 100 of funds available the second step in the amended formula was to compare these st ate allotments to 75 of the amount each state would receive under the formula in pl 96223 states would then receive the greater of these two amounts although the alternative formulas unde r hrept 961244 used factors similar to those in pl 96223 the original set of formulas was slightly more favorable to warmweather states for example the bls lower living standard was higher than 125 of poverty for most household sizes which benefitted the south where the lowincome population was higher26 the original set of formulas also provided for minimum benefit to states on the basis of the number of afdc and food stamp recipient households unconditioned on thei r household heating expenditures in addition the inclusion of the increase in home heating expenditures in hrept 96 1244 benefitted northeastern states wher heating oil prices had increased substantially27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs10 table 2 distribution of

benefitted coldweather states relative to warmweather states30 this was due to the heatin g degree day variable and the fact that residential energy costs of ll households instead of just lowincome households were used under the various lieap formulas the second debated aspect of the formula centered on the appropriateness and timeliness of the data used in formula calculations in 1983 the energy information used to calculate state allotments was not the most current data available31 for example the most recent data the formula used were the change in the cost of energy between 1978 and 1980 or the cost of energy in 1980 depending on the subformula one chose to apply aspect of the formula took account of increased costs after 198032 legislative sentiment in favor of changing the formula was evident when in september 1983 the house adopted an am endment to the emergency immigration education act hr 3520 that would ve adjusted the li heap formula and resulted in change in

from h r 3520 in conference with the senate introduction of holdharmless level efforts to reauthorize liheap had begun in april 1983 with the introduc tion of the lowincome home energy assistance amendments of 1984 hr 2439 the bill was referred to two committees education and labor and energy and commerce within the energy and commerce committee two subcommittees held markups fossil and synthetic fuels and energy conservation and power as introduced hr 2439 did not contain ch anges to the liheap formula the subcommittees on fossil and synthetic fuels and energy conservation and power worked together to arrive at formula change which d the effect of shifting funds from states in the northeast to the south and west unlike the previous set of formulas developed under lieap the new formula directed the department of health and human services to determine states allotments using data relating to the most recent year for which data is available because the cost of heating oil remained steady between 1981 and 1983 and th price of natural gas rose 33 this meant that states in the northeast where heating oil was the primary source of energy would lose liheap dollars while states in the south and the midwest would gain under this provision34 in addition population growth in the south as well as its higher poverty rates meant that southern states would benefit from the use of more recent population data to offset the losses to certain states resulting from the use of current data hr 2439 also included holdharmless provision or holdharmless vel this provision ensured that if appropriati ons were less than or equa l to 1875 billion states would receive less than their allotment would have been under the old formula at this appropriations level the bill additionally increased the liheap authorization level to 2075 billion for fy1984 226 billion for fy1985 2625 billion for fy1987 and 28 billion for fy1988 introduction of holdharml ess rate after the house energy

when appropriations reached 225 billion states would qualify for this increase if their total allotment percentage at an ppropriation of 225 billion were less than 1 these states would instead receive the allotment rate they would have received at an ppropriation of 214 billion if that allotment rate were higher than the rate at 225 billion in its deba about s 2565 senato rs referred to the

guidance to hhs the liheap statute as enacted in pl 98558 and codified at 42 usc 8623a2 provides as follows states allotment percentage is th percentage which expenditures for home energy by lowincome households in that state bears to such expenditures in all states except that states which thereb receive the greatest proportional increase in allotments by reason of the application of this paragraph from the amount they received pursuant to public law 98 139 the fy1984 appropriation shall have their allotments reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that i state for fiscal year 1985

would receive from total appropriation of 2140000000 the next section of this report describes how funds are allocated to the states according to this statutory language determining liheap regular fund allotments using the new formula current law as enacted in pl 98 558 sometimes referred to as the new liheap formula provides fo r three different methods to calculate each states allotment of regular liheap funds the calculation method used to determine state allotments depends upon the size of the appr opriation for that fiscal year if the annual appropriati on level does not exceed the equi valent of hypothetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion then the llocation rates under the old liheap formula apply this is sometimes referred to as tier i of the liheap formula if appropriations exceed hypothetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion then new formula rates apply and are used to calculate state allotments to calculate the new formula rates the most recent data available are used to determine the heating and cooling costs of lowincome house holds when appropriations exceed the 1975 billion level but are less than 225 billion the new formula rates are used together with the holdharmless level this is sometimes referred to as tier ii of the liheap formula finally if appr opriations equal or exceed 225 billion the new rates apply and both the holdharmless level together with the holdharmless rate are in effect this is sometimes referred to as tier iii of the liheap formula this section describes the steps involved in allocating liheap funds to the states under the three tiers of the formula calculating the new formula rates as mentioned previously when cong ress considered new formula for distributing liheap funds in 1983 nd 1984 one of its concerns was the appropriateness and timeliness of the data used in formula calculations at the time the energy information used to calculate state allotments under the lieap formula did not use the most current data available37 for example the formula used the change in cost of energy be tween 1978 and 1980 but did not take account ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs15 38 states allotment percentage is the percentage which expenditures for home energy by lowincome households in that state bears to such expenditures in all states 42 usc 8623a2 39 the liheap statute consider s households with income at or below 150 of poverty or 60 of state median income whichever valu is greater to be low income 42 usc 8624b2b 40 states heating and cooling degree data are weighted by population in the state increased costs after 1980 in fact the formula factors were fixed rates and the liheap statute at that time had provision for allowing newer information to be incorporated into the determination of state allotments the liheap formula as created by pl 98558 requires hhs to us the most recent data available hhs updates these data periodically the most recent data were provided to crs in september of 2008 as directed by the stat ute as enacted in 1984 the liheap formula uses the home energy expenditures of lowincome hous eholds in each state as first step in determining the proportion of total regular funds that each state will receive38 specifically this means estimating the amount of money that all lowincome households as defined by the liheap statute39 in each state spend on heating and cooling from all energy sources this thod accounts for variations in heating and cooling needs of the states the types of energy used energy prices and the low income population and their heating and c ooling methods the process for capturing the expenditures of lowincome households for the most current year possible involves the following steps total residential energy consumption the first step in calculating new formula rates is determining total residential energy consumption for each heating and cooling source in every state residential energy consumption is usually measured in terms of the total amount of british thermal units btus used in private households and generally captures energy used for space and water heating cooling lighting refri geration cooking and the energy needed to operate appliances the most recent data used in calculating liheap formula rates come from the 2004 energy information administration eia state energy data system consumption estimates temperature variation the next step in determining the formula rates involves adjusting the am ount of energy consumed for each fuel source by temperature variati on in each state this is done by using ratio consisting of the 30year average heating and cooling degree day data to each states share of the most recent years average heating and cooling degree days heating degree day measures the extent to which days average temperature falls below 65f and cooling degree day measures the extent to which days average temperature rises above 65f40 for example day with an average temperature of 50f results in measure of 15 heating degree days day with an average temperature of 80fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs16 41 for more information about the recs the eia website at http wwweiadoegov emeurecs 42 the eias state data tables are availa ble at httpwwweiadoegovemeustates _sedshtmlresults in measure of 15 cooling degree days the purpose of the adjustment to fuel consumption is to account for abnormally warm or cool years where energy usage might attain extreme values this information is collected by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the most recent ears average heating and cooling degree day data are from 2006 and the 30year average was computed from 1971 to 2000 heating and cooling consumption as mentioned above total residential energy consumption encompasses other uses in addition to heating and cooling eg operati on of appliances so the next step in calculating liheap formula rates is to derive the portion of fuel consumed specifically to h eat and cool homes as opposed to other uses the eia as part of the residential energy consumption survey recs uses an end use estimation methodology to estimate the amount of fuel used for heating and cooling among other uses the most recent information on heating and cooling consumption comes from the 2001 recs adjusted for 200341 lowincome household heating and cooling consumption after estimating heating and cooling consumption for all households the next step is to calculate heating and cooling consumption in btus for lowincome households the bureau of the census department of commerce prepares special sample for hhs of the fuel sources used by lowincome households the most recent information on lowincome households and the fuel sources they use comes from the 2000 census in addition lowincome consumption data are adjusted to account for the fact that low income households might use more or less of fuel source than is used by households on average this is done using consumption data from the 2001 recs adjusted for 2003 total spending on heating and cooling to arrive at the amount of money that lowincome househol ds spend on heating and cooling the number of btus used by wincome households that were estimated in the previous step are multiplied by the average fuel price for each fuel source the total amount spent on heating and cooling by lowincome households for each fuel source is then added together to arrive at total spending for each state regional energy price variation can be significant and the formula takes expected expenditure differences into account this information is collected by the eia and published in the state energy data system consumption price nd expenditure estimates42 the most recent price data used to calcula formula rates are from 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs17 43 it is important to understand however that although the new formula rates are always applied to all appropriations when appr opriations are below hypothetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion the result of the current laws holdharmless provisions is that states receive the same allotment percenta ges that they did under the old formula see us department of health and human services low income home energy assistance program report to congress for fy1987 p 133new formula rate finally these expenditure data are used to estimate the amount spent by low income households on heating and cooling in each state relative to the amount spent by lowincome households on heating and cooling in all states the calculated proportion becomes the new formula percentage or rate for each state see table 3 at the end of this section for both old and new liheap formula rates column shows the rates under the old formula while column b shows the most recent new formula rates these new formula rates are used to allo cate liheap funds to the states if the annual appropriation exceeds th equivalent of hypot hetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion however these new fo rmula rates do not represent the exact proportion of funds that states will recei ve under the new formula the ultimate allotments are determined after application of the both the holdharmless level and holdharmless rate described in the next section the new rates are the starting point for determining how funds will be allocated to the states using the new formula rates to allocate funds to the states the liheap new formula rates that hhs calculates using the most current data available do not necessarily represent the pr oportion of funds that states will receive state allotments depend upon th application of the two holdharmless provisions in the liheap statute some states must ve their share of funds ratably reduced in order to hold harmless those states that would but for the holdharmless provisions lose funds other states see gain in th eir share of funds because they benefit from the holdharmless provisions the app lication of the hol dharmless provisions depends upon the size of the appropriati on for given fiscal year these appropriation leve l triggers are described below tier i below 1975 billion current law requires that for fiscal years in which the regular liheap f und appropriati on is equivalent to hypothetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion or less states receive the same percentage of funds that they would have received at that appropriation level under the old liheap formula43 this fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion referred to in the liheap statute is hypothetical because this wa s not the amount actually appropriated in fy1984 the actual fy1984 appropriation was 2075 b illion in additi on the current year appropriation that is equivalent to hypothetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion is not exactly 1975 billion in fy1984 with the exception of funds provided to the terr itories all liheap regular funds were distributed to the states since then two ot her funds have become part of the regular fund distribution these are funds for trai ning and technical ssistance and for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs18 44 this amount is arrived at by adding 27 million and 300000 to 1975 billion 45 states which thereby receive the greatest pr oportional increase in allotments shall have their allotments reduced to th extent necessary to ensure that state for fiscal year 1986 and thereafter shall receive less than the amount of funds the state would have received in fiscal year 1984 42 usc 8623a2aiileveraging incentive grants which includes reach grants to the states this

states do not fall below the am ount of funds they would have received at the equivalent of hypothetical fy1984 appropriation of 1975 billion table 3 at the end of this section shows whethe r state benefits from the holdharmless level this is indicated by in column c while th dollar amount of funds those states receive by being held harmless appears in column d for example alabama is not held harmless while alaska is held harmless the dollar amount of funds that alaska receives pursuant to the holdharmle ss level is 10828 million but for the holdharmless level alaska would receive less than this dollar amount at its new formula rate at certain appropriation levels eventually when appropriations increase sufficiently the allotments for states that are held harmless with exceed their hold harmless amounts this appropriation level varies for each state the holdharmless level is ach ieved by reducing the allo cation of funds to those states with the greatest proportiona l gains under the new formula rates45 f r example under the most recent liheap fo rmula rates states with the greatest proportional gains were nevada texas and florida depending on the appropriation level these states and others with the greatest gains may then have their allotments reduced to hold harmless those states that would otherwise see reduced benefits so although these states with the greates

at or above 225 billion states that would have received less than 1 of total 225 bil lion appropriation must be allocated the percentage they would have receive d at 214 billion ppropriation level46 this assumes the percentage at 214 billion is greater than the percentage originally calculated at the hypothetical 225 billion appropr iation this is not true for all states that receive less than 1 of the 225 billi on appropriation then that state will receive the 214 billion allotment proportion fo r all appropriation vels at or above 225 billion this holdharmless rate ensures state specific share of the total available funds as with the tier ii funding level the llocations to the states with the greatest proportional gains are then ratably reduced again using the methodology described in

to leveraging incentive and reach grants and 300000 to training and technical assistance differing allocations to leveraging incentive and reach grants could change state allotmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33275crs26 appendix b further depiction of how state allotments depend upon appropriation levels figure 1 graphically illustrates state allotments for three typical types of states over range of appropriations from 0 to 51 billion represented are 1 hold harmless level state 2 holdharmless level and rate state and 3 state whose increased allocations are ratably reduced in order to maintain allocations for the hold harmless level and rate states in the figure there are three vertical areas these areas separate the three levels of appropriations tiers iiii that are triggers under current law and were explained previously in this report the figure also graphs the three basic types of states reading from top to bottom of figure 1 these three types of states are as follows holdharmless level only states these states are subject to only the holdharmless level provision they do not qualify for the hold harmless rate because each states share of the regular funds at 225 billion is greater than 1 an example of holdharmless level only state is represented by the line that runs from 0 to point g the holdharmless level is evident from poi nt to point f here despite increases in the appropriations level the state allotment remains fixed in table 3 these are the states that have in the subject to holdharmless level column and n in the subject to holdharmless rate column ratable reduction states these states are subject to ratable reduction their new formula rate is greater than their old fy1984 rate an example of these states is depicted by the line that runs from 0 to point h there is small decrease in state allotments at point d that is attributable to the increased shortfall on the distribution of funds that the holdharmless rate imposes in table 3 these are the states that have n in the subject to holdharmless level column and n in the subject to holdharmless rate column holdharmless level and rate states these states are subject to both the holdharmless level and the hold har mless rate provisions an example of typical level and rate state is shown by the line that runs from 0 to point i the holdharmless level is evident by the fixed state allotment from point c to point however the subtle jump at exactly 225 billion signals that this state is subject to the holdharmless rate provision after the allotment jump at 225 billion the states allotment conti nues to increase at rate lower than the old rate but higher than the new rate in table 3 these are the states that have in th subject to holdharmless level
