humphries analyst in energy policy resources science and industry division outer continental shelf debate over oil and gas leasing and revenue sharing summary oil and gas leasing in the outer continental shelf ocs has been an important issue in the debate over energy security and domestic energy resources the department of the interior doi released comprehensive inventory of ocs resources in february 2006 that estimated reserves of 85 billion barrels of oil and 293 trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas another 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 tcf of natural gas are classified as undiscovered resources congress has imposed moratoria on much of the ocs since 1982 through the annual interior appropriation bills presidential directive issued by president george hw bush in 1990 and extended by president clinton until 2012 also banned offshore oil and gas development in much of the ocs proponents of the moratoria contend that offshore drilling would pose unacceptable environmental risks and threaten coastal tourism industries on june 18 2008 president bush announced his support for lifting the moratoria on offshore oil and gas development however president bush said that he would not lift the executive ban until congress acted to lift its ban first but on july 14 2008 president bush reversed his position and lifted the executive ban on the ocs before congress acted the recent congressional action approving the continuing appropriations act for fy2009 pl 110329 enacted september 30 2008 that continued the funding of government activities through march 6 2009 or until regular appropriations bill is enacted omitted language that provided for the congressional ocs moratoria along the atlantic and pacific coasts those areas may now be made available for preleasing leasing and related activity that could lead to oil and gas development the moratorium however is still in place for most of the eastern gulf of mexico which was placed offlimits statutorily until 2022 under the gomesa of 2006 pl 109432 earlier efforts to lift the congressional ocs moratoria in part or completely were included in legislative proposals the legislation section of this report summarizes several of those bills and proposals including the housepassed hr 6899 several of the bills would allow states using specified criteria to petition the secretary of the interior to lease the ocs adjacent to state waters or to opt out of the ocs leasing program on september 16 2008 the house approved hr 6899 which does not contain revenue sharing provisions by vote of 236189 royalty relief particularly for deepwater projects has come under closer scrutiny since it was revealed in february 2006 new york times article that leases issued during 1998 and 1999 did not contain price thresholds for royalty relief above which royalties apply as part of the deep water royalty relief act dwrra of 1995 leases issued between 19962000 language in the fy2009 interior appropriations bill as passed by the subcommittee and in housepassed hr 6899 would deny new gulf of mexico leases to lessees holding leases without price thresholds however kerr mcgee oil and

leasing and revenue sharing most recent developments president bush announced on june 18 2008 that he would like to open areas of the outer continental shelf ocs for oil and gas development currently under presidential and congressional moratoria discussed in more detail below however the president stated that he would lift the executive branch moratoria only after congress did so legislatively but on july 14 2008 president bush reversed his position and lifted the executive ban on the ocs imposed in 1990 by president george hw bush senator john mccain among others has called on congress to lift the offshore drilling moratoria as well the recent congressional action approving the continuing appropriations act for fy2009 pl 110329 enacted september 30 2008 that continued the funding of government activities through march 6 2009 or until regular appropriations bill is enacted omitted language that provided for the congressional ocs moratoria along the atlantic and pacific coasts those areas may now be made available for preleasing leasing and related activity that could lead to oil and gas development the moratorium however is still in place for most of the eastern gulf of mexico which was placed offlimits statutorily until 2022 under the gomesa of 2006 pl 109432 further the administration proposes to begin planning its next fiveyear leasing program now that would if approved be implemented as early as 2010 two years ahead of schedule the proposed new fiveyear program would supercede the current fiveyear leasing program from 20072012 the administration argues that new fiveyear lease program beginning in 2010 would allow any newly opened ocs areas eg if the congressional moratoria is lifted this year to be offered in lease sale sooner than if they remained on their current schedule since the president lifted the executive ban members of congress have introduced legislation that would lift the congressional prohibition in part or completely against leasing and development of oil and natural gas in the ocs the legislation section of this report summarizes several of those bills and proposals including housepassed hr 6899 on september 16 2008 the house passed hr 6899 by vote of 236189 many in congress however oppose lifting the offshore ban they argue that there are still several million acres leased onshore and offshore but not yet producing and that production from these lands could increase us oil supply how much oil could be brought into production in the shortterm from non producing leased lands or those under the moratoria and its impact on price is uncertain an attempt to lift the offshore moratoria with an amendment to the fy2009 interior environment and related agencies appropriations bill during the house subcommittee markup was defeated by vote of 69 meanwhile on june 26 crs2 2008 under suspension of the rules which requires twothirds majority for passage the house defeated measure hr 6251 that would have increased rental fees on nonproducing oil and gas leases and denied new federal leases to those not diligently developing the leases they have background and analysis oil and gas leasing has been prohibited on most of the outer continental shelf ocs since the 1980s congress has enacted ocs leasing moratoria for each of fiscal years 19822007 in the annual interior and related agencies appropriations bill now the interior and environment and related agencies appropriations bill allowing leasing only in the gulf of mexico except near florida and parts of alaska president george hw bush in 1990 issued presidential directive ordering the department of the interior doi not to conduct offshore leasing or preleasing activity in areas covered by the annual legislative moratoria until 2000 in 1998 president clinton extended the offshore leasing prohibition until 2012 president george w bush lifted the executive branch moratoria on july 14 2008 for oil and gas leasing and development to occur in the moratoria areas the congressional ban also must be lifted proponents of the moratoria contend that offshore drilling would pose unacceptable environmental risks and threaten coastal tourism industries whereas supporters of expanded offshore leasing counter that more domestic oil and gas production is vital for the nations energy security the possibility of oil and gas production in offshore areas covered by the moratoria has sparked sharp debate in congress proposal to require the doi to conduct comprehensive inventory of ocs oil and natural gas resources drew heated opposition although it was ultimately included in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 section 357 opponents of the ocs inventory saw it as first step toward lifting the ocs leasing moratoria the department of the interiors minerals management service mms completed the ocs inventory report to congress in february 2006 as requested but without the authorized threedimensional 3d seismic study congress has yet to fund the 3d seismic study offshore leasing system the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla of 1953 as amended provides for the leasing of ocs lands in manner that protects the environment and returns revenues to the federal government in the form of bonus bids rents and royalties1 ocsla requires the secretary of the interior to submit fiveyear leasing programs that specify the time location and size of the areas to be offered each fiveyear leasing program entails lengthy multistep process that includes environmental impact statements after public comment period final proposed plan is submitted to the president and congress 1 43 usc 1331 et seq crs3 the offshore leasing program is administered by the minerals management service mms an agency within the doi the mms conducted 16 ocs oil and natural gas lease sales during its previous fiveyear program from 20022007 nine of those sales were in the western or central gulf of mexico gom two in the eastern gom and the remainder were around alaska alaskas lease sales were held in the beaufort sea norton basin cook inlet and the chukchi seahope basin see figure 1 two alaskan lease sales that were not held in the scheduled 20022007 leasing program sales 193 and 203 will be superseded by lease sales in the 2007 2012 leasing program sale 193 chukchi sea alaska took place on february 6 2008 crs4 figure 1 mms fiveyear program areas source minerals management service 20022007year leasing program mms defines the ocs as submerged lands subsoil and seabed between the seaward extent of states jurisdiction and the seaward extent of federal jurisdiction crs5 during the summer of 2005 the mms introduced its proposed fiveyear leasing program for 20072012 public hearings on the leasing program have been held and states and interest groups are filing comments on future lease sale areas for the 2007 2012 leasing program2 on april 30 2007 the secretary of the interior announced its proposed final program areas along the atlantic coast ie virginia currently covered by ocs moratoria the north aleutian basin alaska and the central gom are included in the final leasing program small area would be offered for lease in the eastern gom planning area which has been redrawn to provide for more accuracy in boundaries between states and planning areas3 the new fiveyear leasing program began july 1 2007 nineteen lease sales are scheduled for the 20072012 leasing program five lease sales have occurred to date two lease sales were held in 2007 sales 204 and 205 lease sale 193 in february 2008 lease sales 206 and 224 took place in march 2008 revenues from lease sale 224 will be shared with coastal states mississippi alabama texas and louisiana as required by the gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 gomesa pl 109432 discussed further in the appendix section of this report lease sales are conducted through competitive sealed bonus bidding process and leases are awarded to the highest bidder successful bidders make an upfront cash payment called bonus bid to secure lease minimum acceptable bonus bid is determined for each tract offered during the past 13 years annual bonus revenues have ranged from 85 million in 1992 to 14 billion in 1997 bidding on deepwater tracts in the mid1990s led to surge in bonus revenue4 offshore bonus bids totaled 374 million in fy2007 but as result of high oil and natural gas prices and the significant possible resources in the central gulf of mexico record setting bonus bids of 37 billion were accepted by the mms at leases sale 206 held in march 2008 in addition to the cash bonus bid royalty rate of 125 or 167 is imposed on the value of production depending on location factors or the royalty is received inkind5 the rate could be higher than 167 depending on the lease sale for instance lease sale 224 will require royalty rate of 1875 in all water depths according to mms congressional affairs representatives this higher rate 1875 is likely to remain in place for future lease sales annual rents are 5950 per acre with lease sizes generally ranging from 25005760 acres initial lease terms of 510 years are standard and leases continue as long as commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are being produced bonding requirements are 50000 per lease and as much as 3 million for an entire area the secretary of the interior may reduce or eliminate the royalty established by the lease in order to promote increased recovery 2 federal register notice 70 fr 49669 3 federal register vol 71 1 january 3 2006 notices p 127 4 department of the interior fy2002 budget justifications p 63 5 royaltyinkind payment would be in the form of barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas crs6 federal distribution of ocs revenues federal revenues from offshore leases were estimated at 70 billion in fy2007 by the mms during the previous 10 years 19972006 revenues from federal ocs leases reached as high as 76 billion in fy2006 revenues were as low as 32 billion in 1999 higher prices for oil and gas are the most significant factors in the revenue swings of the 70 billion offshore revenue in fy2007 64 billion was from royalties these revenues are split among various government accounts revenues from the offshore leases are statutorily allocated among the coastal states the land and water conservation fund the national historic preservation fund6 and the us treasury for distribution of all revenue from federal leases see figure 2 states receive 27 of ocs receipts closest to state offshore lands drainage tracts under section 8g7of the ocsla amendments of 1985 pl 99272 in fy2007 this share was 676 million out of about 2 billion in total state onshore and offshore receipts dispute over what was meant by fair and equitable division of the 8g receipts was settled by the 1985 ocsla amendments8 revenuesharing provisions in s 3711 pl 109432 allow selected gulf states to receive 375 of the revenue generated from specified federal oil and gas leases off their coasts most of the proposed legislation in the 110th congress that would open moratoria areas of the ocs include similar revenue sharing provisions for the states for onshore public domain leases states generally receive 50 of rents bonuses and royalties collected alaska however receives 90 of all revenues collected on public domain leases9 6 under the national historic preservation act 16 usc 470 etseq the national historic preservation fund is authorized to receive 150 million annually from ocs receipts authorization for this act expired at the end of fy2005 thus funds were disbursed from ocs receipts in fy2006 after reauthorization in december 2006 funding from ocs receipts resumed in fy2007 7 the 8g revenue stream is the result of 1978 ocsla amendment that provides for fair and equitable sharing of revenues from section 8g common pool lands these lands are defined in the amendments as submerged acreage lying outside the threenautical mile statefederal demarcation line typically extending to total of six nautical miles offshore but that include pool of oil common to both federal and state jurisdiction the states share of the revenue 27 was established by the ocsla amendments of 1985 pl 99 272 and is paid directly to the states payments to the states previously had been placed in escrow which were then paid out between 1986 and 2001 8 department of the interior minerals management service mineral revenues 2000 p 95 9 however the manner is which royalties are split between states and the federal government differs for all states except alaska direct royalties under the mineral leasing act mla are divided equally 5050 between the state in which the deposits are located and the federal government the mla also provides that all states except alaska get back 40 from the reclamation fund established by the reclamation act of 1902 in effect giving each state 90 of the royalties and the federal government 10 alaska does not receive allocations from the reclamation fund so to equalize royalty treatment among the states continued crs7 coastal impact assistance states with energy development off their shores in federal waters10 have been seeking larger portion of the federal revenues generated in those areas they particularly want more assistance for coastal areas that may be most affected by onshore and nearshore activities that support offshore energy development proponents of these proposals look to the rates at which funds are given to jurisdictions where onshore energy development occurs within those jurisdictions on federal lands coastal destruction has received more attention in louisiana where many square miles of wetlands are being lost to the ocean each year one of the causes of this loss is thought to be widespread energyrelated development currently the affected states receive revenue indirectly from offshore oil and gas leases in federal waters this is in contrast to the direct revenues to states that have onshore federal leases within their boundaries as noted above on the other hand opponents point out the budget implications as result of the loss of federal revenues there are two fundamental purposes for revenue sharing programs according to the coastal impact assistance working group an mms advisory group 1 to fund projects that will mitigate the environmental and economic impact of ocs energy development including the need for infrastructure and public services and 2 to help sustain development of nonrenewable energy sources11 two federal revenue sharing programs addressed coastal impacts from ocs energy development 1 the nowexpired coastal energy impact program ceip established as an amendment to the coastal zone management act and 2 the section 8g zone program established under ocsla third program the land and water conservation fund has also provided state funding from the ocs revenue stream but the distribution of those revenues has connection with ocs activities even the ceip program was not considered true revenuesharing program because its funding levels were not based on the amount of leasing activity in the ocs new coastal impact assistance program ciap is established under section 384 of the energy policy act of 2005 epact 05 pl 10958 as an amendment to section 31 of the ocsla 43 usc 1356a under this program the secretary of the interior is to disburse revenue from ocs lease activity without further appropriation 250 million per year during fy2007fy2010 to producing states and 9 continued the alaska statehood act and the federal land policy and management act provide that alaskas royalty share is 90 of the direct royalties rather than 50 10 state jurisdiction is typically limited to three nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured however the state jurisdiction off the gulf coast of florida and texas extends nine nautical miles and for louisiana three imperial nautical miles federal jurisdiction extends typically 200 nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured 11 coastal impact assistance report to the ocs policy committee from the coastal impact assistance working group october 1997 crs8 political subdivisions according to specified allocations the states must submit plans on how they will spend these funds for approval by the secretary of the interior among other things the funds are designated for the restoration of coastal areas mitigation of damage to natural resources the implementation of federally approved conservation management plans and for infrastructure projects eligible oil and gasproducing coastal states include alabama mississippi texas louisiana california and alaska on april 16 2007 mms announced allocation amounts available to eligible states for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 before allocations are disbursed states were required to submit plan to mms for approval not later than july 1 2008 according to the mms based on the allocation formula louisiana would receive 526 of the ciap funds texas 2004 mississippi 1276 alabama 1054 california 307 and alaska 1 offshore leasing moratoria the offshore leasing moratoria began with the fy1982 interior appropriations act pl 97100 which prohibited new leases off the shore of california the imposition of other moratoria came about after many coastal states and environmental groups contended that leasing tracts in environmentally sensitive areas might lead to activities that could cause economic or irreversible environmental damage eventually the moratoria were expanded to include new england the georges bank the midatlantic the pacific northwest portion of alaska and much of the eastern gulf of mexico because of environmental and economic concerns congress for the past two decades has supported annual moratoria on leasing and drilling in the ocs congress enacted the moratoria for each of fiscal years 19822008 through the annual interior appropriations bill the most recent continuing appropriation act of 2009 pl 110339 omitted language that had kept the annual moratoria in place this law is in effect until march 6 2009 or until regular appropriation bill is passed president george hw bush in 1990 responding to pressure from the states of florida and california and others concerned about protecting the ocean and coastal environments issued presidential directive ordering the department of the interior doi not to conduct offshore leasing or preleasing activity in places other than texas louisiana alabama and parts of alaska until 2000 prohibiting leasing in the same areas covered by the annual moratoria in 1998 president clinton extended the presidential offshore leasing prohibition until 2012 president george w bush lifted the executive ban on july 14 2008 but in order for oil and gas leasing and development activity to occur the congressional ban must also be repealed there have been attempts to lift the congressional moratoria through the appropriations process the fy2006 interior and environment appropriations act pl 10954 continued the leasing moratoria in other areas including the atlantic and pacific coasts an amendment to lift the moratorium in the eastern gulf of mexico was offered hamdt 174 representative istook on the house floor during debate but was rejected on point of order an amendment representative peterson crs9 that would have lifted the moratoria on offshore natural gas was defeated see roll call vote 192 may 19 2005 congress extended the offshore leasing moratoria through fy2007 and fy2008 however the fy2006 and fy2007 interior appropriations act did not include language to prohibit oil and gas leasing in the north aleutian basin planning area previously in the moratoria the fy2004 law pl 108108 and fy2005 law pl 108447 similarly omitted this language there is reportedly some industry interest in eventually opening the area to oil and gas development as an offset to the depressed fishing industry in the bristol bay area environmentalists and others oppose this effort the north aleutian basin planning area containing bristol bay is contained in mmss current leasing program for 20072012 gomesa placed nearly all of the eastern gulf of mexico egom planning area under leasing and development ban until 2022 once this ban was enacted statutorily it was longer part of the executive ban thus when president bush lifted the executive ban it did not include the egom figure 2 distribution of revenue from

detail below in s 3711 that opened 58 million acres in the gulf of mexico previously under the moratoria crs10 california leases congress has banned additional drilling in the santa maria basin and santa barbara channel areas where there are leased tracts companies unable to develop their existing california lease holdings are seeking compensation from the federal government the companies contend that more than billion dollars has already been spent to obtain the leases12 in previous buyback settlements firms have recouped their bonus bid payments but lost possible future returns that would have been earned if commercial production were achieved13 in the case of the offshore california leases the clinton administration continued to extend the leases through suspensions that were granted between 1733 years ago before the moratoria were imposed the last suspension by mms in 1999 extended 36 of the 40 existing offshore california leases at issue this action was taken to give lease holders more time to prove up oil reserves and for mms to show consistency with state coastal zone management plans as required by 1990 amendments to the coastal zone management act pl 92583 states objection could prevent development of the oil and gas leases on june 20 2001 the us district court for the northern district of california struck down the mms suspensions potentially allowing the leases to expire because it held that mms failed to show consistency with the states coastal zone management plan the bush administration appealed this decision to threejudge panel of the ninth circuit of appeals in san francisco on january 9 2002 and has proposed more limited lease development plan that involves 20 leases using existing platforms and other necessary infrastructure however on december 2 2002 the ninth circuit panel upheld the district court decision14 the department of the interior did not appeal this decision and is currently working with lessees to resolve the issue breachofcontract lawsuit was filed in the us federal court of claims against mms on january 9 2002 by nine oil companies seeking 12 billion in compensation for their undeveloped leases amber resources et v united states after the lawsuit was filed several oil and gas lessees involved in the dispute submitted new round of suspension applications to prevent lease termination and loss of development rights in response the mms prepared six environmental assessments and found significant impact for processing the applications however under the coastal zone management act consistency review by mms and the states response to that review must occur before decision is made to grant or deny the requests the state coastal commission ruled unanimously on august 12 inside energy with federal lands september 3 2001 13 estimating future revenues with limited drilling is difficult at best because it is not possible to determine the extent if any or quality of hydrocarbons according to the mms the leased area contains an estimated 1 billion barrels of oil and 500 billion cubic feet of unproved reserves 14 ninth us circuit court of appeals california v norton 0116637 crs11 11 2005 that the lease suspensions should not be renewed following that decision on august 12 us district court ordered the mms to conduct additional studies under the national environmental policy act nepa of the 36 leases under suspension mms argued that it had presented sufficient evidence for the judge to reach decision on whether to allow mms to grant further suspensions senator diane feinstein of california has urged that the mms conduct additional studies or if not allow the leases to terminate15 in the meantime on november 17 2005 the us federal court of claims made determination in the amber resources lawsuit that the federal government breached its contract with the lessees regarding the 36 offshore california leases although the government was ordered to repay the lessees 11 billion the judge deferred final judgment until additional claims such as recovery of sunk costs are resolved if settlement is reached the mms would automatically terminate the leases this action would then negate any further action on the consistency determinations thus further action will be taken by the department of the interior to address the concerns of the california coastal commission until final judgment is reached the court of appeals for the federal circuit reached final judgement that would pay the lessees 11 billion the companies were unsuccessful in their claim that they should be compensated for additional exploration and development costs of about 727 million royalty relief royalty relief is commonly granted to assure full production of offshore oil and gas ocsla authorizes the secretary of the interior to grant royalty relief in order to promote increased oil and gas production there are generally four royalty relief categories in the gom deepwater shallow water deep gas endoflife and special case royalty relief under the endoflife and special case categories was already in place under ocsla before the deep water royalty relief act of 1995 dwrra the dwrra expands the secretarys authority to use royalty relief as an incentive for leasing federal ocs gulf of mexico deepwater under dwrra the secretary of the interior may reduce royalties if production would otherwise be uneconomic16 threshold price levels were established in 1995 above which the relief is discontinued in 2004 the threshold price was 3355 per barrel for deepwater oil and 419 per million btus for deepwater natural gas the threshold price levels are adjusted annually for inflation17 congressional debate over royalty relief for ocs oil and gas producers has been ongoing on february 13 2006 the new york times reported that the mms would 15 inside energy august 22 2005 16 brief description of royalty relief programs offered by the mms can be found on its website at httpwwwgomrmmsgovhomepgoffshoreroyrelefhtml more detailed analysis of the royalty relief programs is contained in the following report department of the interior mms guidelines for the application

gas can be found on the mms website crs12 not collect royalties on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 because price threshold was included in the lease agreements during those two years without the price thresholds lease holders may produce oil and gas up to specified volumes without paying royalties matter what the price the mms asserts that placing price thresholds in the lease agreements is at the discretion of the secretary of the interior however according to the mms the price thresholds were omitted by mistake from 576 offshore leases during 1998 and 199918 an interior department inspector general investigation acknowledged that mistakes were made but were considered to be blunders and not intentional omissions19 the total value of foregone royalties over the sixyear period is estimated by mms at about 10 billion the fy2009 interior appropriations bill as passed by the subcommittee contains provision that would deny new gulf of mexico leases to lessees holding leases without price thresholds details of recent legislative activity related to the price thresholdroyalty relief issues are below under the new majority leadership in the 110th congress the house passed legislation hr 6 that would offer remedy for the offshore leases without price thresholds under title ii the bill would among other things deny new gulf of mexico oil and gas leases to lessees holding leases without price thresholds or payment or agreement to pay newly established conservation of resources fees the bill would also repeal royalty relief provisions sections 344 and 345 of the energy policy act of 2005 opponents of hr 6 argue that the companies with valid leases even though without price thresholds should not be penalized and that the provision could result in breachofcontracts lawsuits by the companies on july 30 2007 the house introduced hr 3221 containing language on offshore royalties under title vii nearly identical to title ii of hr 6 the house approved hr 3221 on august 4 2007 by vote of 241170 in recent development the house amended and passed the senatepassed version of energy policy legislation hr 6 on december 6 2007 but without the royalty relief remedy in the earlier house passed bills the royalty relief remedy provisions were subsequently not enacted in the final version of energy policy legislation energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 royalty relief provisions are however contained in hr 6899 discussed below kerr mcgee oil and gas corp acquired by anadarko petroleum corp in august 2006 challenged mmss assertion in lawsuit that it had authority to place price thresholds in the dwrra leases 1996200020 on october 18 2007 the us district court western district of louisiana issued ruling in favor of kerr 18 this information is from discussions with walter cruickshank deputy director of mms during april 2006 19 testimony of the honorable earl devaney inspector general for the department of the interior before the united states senate committee on energy and natural resources january 18 2007 20 for more details on this case see crs report rl33404 offshore oil and gas development legal framework by adam vann crs13 mcgee21 meaning that the secretary of the interior did not have authority to impose price threshold levels in leases issued under dwrra the ruling could apply to potentially 30 billion in future ocs royalties but may not affect congressional efforts to impose new fees or establish new lease eligibility criteria discussed above22 for details on title ii of hr 6 see crs report rs22567 royalty relief for us deepwater oil and gas leases by marc humphries lease development in the gulf of mexico the mms reports that there is great potential in the central and western gulf of mexico gom deepwater regions 400 meters23 spurred by the royalty relief act of 1995 significant investment has been made including bonus bids and annual rents by major and independent oil and gas companies overall since 1995 deepwater production of oil has increased from 16 of total gom production to nearly 75 in 2006 deepwater natural gas has risen from 38 of total gom production to about 38 during the same period the deepwater production in the gom is expected to continue growing over the next 20 years there are however limited number of rigs available to drill and there are prospects elsewhere that could make any area available for leasing less likely to get developed in the short term24 moreover very little exploration and development have yet to occur within some of the deepwater regions that were leased since 1995 the amount of development of leases is significantly different in shallow and deep regions in the west and central gulf region at less than 400 meters deep about 40 of the leased tracts have been producing since the 1990s whereas small and declining fraction of currently leased tracts have been explored but did not produce about 40 of the active leases at this depth have not been explored in the narrow region between 400 and 800 meters most of the relatively few leases have not been explored but small and increasing number have begun production this pattern is even clearer in

oil and natural gas resources as required by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 section 357 in the inventory the doi provided mean estimates of 85 billion barrels of known oil reserves and 293 trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas 82 of the oil and 95 of the gas is in the gulf of mexico gom in the undiscovered resource category the doi estimated about 86 billion barrels 51 in the gom and 420 tcf of natural gas 55 in the gom barriers to development the high proportion of deepwater leases that have not been explored in light of the high productivity of those that have been developed raises questions of barriers that may be impeding full development of the regions potential although even developed regions have many leases that are not explored the fact that more than 90 of deepwater leases have not been explored stands out according to mms officials interviewed by crs25 the major factor in determining exploration is the high cost of activity in the deepwater region and also the relatively few rigs that are available to operate there financing oil exploration and development is an extremely complex process frequently involving secondary markets for leases and farming out development to obtain financing according to mms barriers exist to discourage or penalize innovative and flexible financing schemes natural gasonly proposals under current law all ocs lease sales include both oil and gas and lessee is required to develop the gas or the oil once it is discovered natural gasonly leases have been met with much skepticism by many experts in geology who note that most of these offshore fields are likely to contain both oil and gas further industry might be reluctant to bid on leases that did not transfer ownership of all discovered resources proponents argue that production of natural gas only would lessen states concerns 25 crs analysts held frequent telephone conversations with mms officials and on january 18 2005 met in person for conference of several

december 8 2006 and the senate on december 9 prior to its passage representative ed markey and others offered an amendment related to royalty relief for deepwater oil and gas lessees that would have among other things denied new oil and gas leases on federal lands to lessees that did not have price thresholds in their current oil and gas leases that amendment was defeated by vote of 207205 109th congress legislation enacted pl 109432 s 3711 gulf of mexico energy security act of 2006 s 3711 directs the secretary of the interior to offer lease sales within the 181 area primarily in the central gulf of mexico as defined in the bill within one year after enactment of this legislation the 181 area defined in the bill is part of the original lease sale 181 contained in the outer continental shelf ocs 19962001 5year leasing program before the area was scaled back by the secretary of the interior the 181 area as defined in the bill covers about 25 million acres in addition the bill directs the secretary to offer for lease as soon as practicable an area south of the 181 area known as 181 south area this area covers about 58 million acres 181 south area is in its 20072012 5year leasing program the mms estimates that together these two areas covered by the bill contain 58 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 126 billion barrels of recoverable oil the senate passed s 3711 on august 1 2006 by vote of 7125 at the end of the 109th congress provisions contained in s 3711 were attached to crs19 broad tax relief measure hr 6111 which passed the house and senate and was signed into law pl 109432 areas where preleasing and leasing activity would be excluded under the bill and placed under moratorium until 2022 would be east of the military mission line about 230 miles from floridas west coast within 125 miles of florida in the new eastern gulf of mexico planning area and within 100 miles of the state of florida in the new central gulf of mexico planning area current lessees within the prohibited areas in the new eastern and central gulf of mexico planning areas could exchange those leases for bonus or royalty credits valued at the amount paid in bonuses and rents on existing leases for another lease in the gulf of mexico revenue sharing provisions in the bill would allow for gulf producing states defined as alabama mississippi louisiana and texas to receive 375 of revenues generated from leases held in the 181 area and 181 south area beginning fy2007 beginning in fy2017 and thereafter the gulf producing states would also receive 375 of the revenues generated from leases awarded within the 20022007 planning area including historical leases described in sec 5b2c of the bill distribution among the gulf producing states would be determined by the secretary of the interior according to formula to be developed that would accomplish distribution inversely proportional to the respective distances from the coastlines to the center of the lease tracts the minimum amount available to any of the gulf producing states would be 10 of the qualified revenues the secretary would pay 20 of the states share to its coastal political subdivisions the land and water conservation fund currently funded from ocs revenues would receive 125 of the qualified revenues for state programs and the federal general treasury would receive 50 of those revenues an annual net spending cap of 500 million on revenues shared with the states above receipts in the newly opened areas is included in this bill the mms estimates that the states share would total 31 billion through 2022 and increase to total of 596 billion through 2067 lease sale 181 revisited sales in the eastern gulf of mexico gom have been especially controversial bush administration plan originating in the clinton administration to lease 59 million acres in the eastern gom lease sale 181 sparked considerable debate although the area was not under leasing moratorium eastern gom lease sale had taken place since 1988 the lease sale 181 area was considered by opponents to be too close to the shore and to environmentally sensitive areas some tracts were as close as 17 miles from the florida and alabama coastline the major concern of those in florida opposing the sale was impairing the value of tourism to the state if an accident were to occur causing an oil spill it could damage the states beaches and thus the tourist industry it also could severely affect the marine environment opponents contended the original area of 59 million acres estimated to contain nearly 8 trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas and 396 million barrels of oil was reduced to 147 million acres after intense pressure from environmentalists and state officials the reduced lease sale 181 offered 256 blocks containing an estimated 125 tcf of natural gas and 185 million barrels of oil the sale took place december 5 2001 crs20 toward the end of the first session of the 109th congress senator pete domenici chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee expressed an interest in opening up offshore areas now under the moratoria in push to ease the natural gas crisis26 the legislation he introduced s 2253 was limited to offering for lease portion 36 million acres of lease sale area 181 within year of enactment based on revised mms estimates provided to the committee there are about 6 tcf of natural gas and 930 million barrels of oil mbo in the area that would have been leased under s 2253 an alternative bill s 2239martinez would have extended buffer zone around floridas coast out 150 miles and would thus make available much smaller area for lease sale area 181 about 740000 acres the senate eventually passed bill s 3711 discussed below that included 83 million acres and revenue sharing provisions for selected gulf states the mmss fiveyear leasing program 20072012 includes lease sale 181 area that is smaller than the domenici version but larger than the martinez proposal the area recommended by the mms is 2 million acres and estimated to contain 34 tcf of natural gas and 530 mbo industry groups contend that eastern gom sales are too limited given what they say is an enormous resource potential whereas environmental groups and some state officials argue that the risks of development to the environment and local economies are too great 26 inside energy extra
