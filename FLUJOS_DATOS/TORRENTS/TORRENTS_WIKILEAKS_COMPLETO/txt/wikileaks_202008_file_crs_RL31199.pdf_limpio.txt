about the impact of potential payment reductions on patients access to serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199 order code rl31199 medicare payments to physicians updated july 25 2008 jennifer osullivan specialist in health care financing domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199medicare payments to physicians summary medicare law specifies fo rmula for calculating the annual update in payments for physicians services the formula resulted in an actual negative update in payments per service for 2002 additional re ductions were slated to go into effect again beginning in 2003 however cong ressional action has prevented these reductions for 20032009 many members have been cerned about the impact of potential payment reductions on patients access to services medicare payments for services of physicians and certain nonphysician practitioners are made on the basis of fee schedule the fee schedule in place since 1992 is intended to relate payments for given service to the actual resources used in providing that service payments under the fee schedule were estimated at 564 billion in fy2008 about 125 of total be nefit payments including those made under the new prescription drug program the fee schedule assigns relative values to services that reflect physician work ie the time skill and intensity it takes to provide the service practice expenses and malpractice costs the relative values are adjusted for geographic variations in co sts the adjusted relative values are then converted into dollar payment amount by conversion factor the conversion factor for 2008 is 380870 05 above the 2007 level the fee schedule places limit on payment per service but not on the overall volume of services the fo rmula for calculating the annua l update to the conversion factor responds to changes in volume if the overall volume of services increases the update is lower if the overall volume is re duced the update is higher the intent of the formula is to place restraint on overall increases in medicare spending for physicians services severa l factors enter into the calcu lation these include 1 the medicare economic index mei which meas ures inflation in the inputs needed to produce physicians services 2 the sustainable growth rate sgr which is essentially target for medicare spending growth for physicians services and 3 an adjustment that modifies the update whic h would otherwise be allowed by the mei to bring spending in line with the sgr target the sgr target is not limit on expenditures rather the fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in meeting the target if expenditures exceed the target the update for future year is reduced this is what occurred for 2002 it was also slated to occur in subsequent years however several times legislation has prevented this from occurring most recently through 2009 by law the conversion factor was slated to be cut 106 on july 1 2008 however on july 15 2008 the medicare im provements

reflects the statutory reduction in the conversi on factor beginning july 1 2008 as discussed in subsequent sections of this reportmedicare payments to physicians introduction the medicare fee schedule medicare is nationwide program which ffers health insurance protection for 43 million aged and disabled persons currently 80 of beneficiaries obtain covered services through the original dicare program also referred to as fee forservice medicare under this program beneficiaries obtain services through providers of their choice and medicare makes payments for each service rendered ie feeforservice or for each episode of care approximately 20 of beneficiaries are enrolled in manage d care organizations under the medicare advantage program these entities assume the risk for providing all covered services in return for fixed monthly per capita payment medicare law and regulations contain ve ry detailed rules governing payments to physicians and other providers under th feeforservice system payments for physicians services under feeforservice medicare are made on the basis of fee schedule the fee schedule also applies to services provided by certain nonphysician practitioners such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners as well as the limited number of medicarecovered services provided by limited licensed practitioners chiropractors podiatrists and optometrists payments under the fee schedule are estimated at 564 billion in fy2008 125 of total medicare benefits1 the law specifies formul for the annual update to the physician fee schedule part of this update is based on whether spe nding in prior year has exceeded or fallen below spending target the target calculated using the sustainable growth rate sgr is essentially cumulative target for medicare spending growth over time if spending is in excess of the target the update for future year is reduced the goal is to bring spending back in line with th target application of the update formula would have led to negative update for each year beginning in 2002 the update for 2002 was negative 54 however congress overr ode the application of the formula for 2003 2004 and 2005 each of these years saw slight increase the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 enacted february 8 2006 froze the 2006 conversion factor at the 2005 vel the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 enacted december 20 2006 froze the 2007 conversion factor at the same level for an additional year further for the sixmonth period beginning july 1 2007 physicians who voluntarily

law the conversion factor was slated to be cut 106 on july 1 2008 however on july 15 2008 the medicare im provements for patie nts and providers act of 2008 mippa b ecame law pl110275 this law freezes physician fees at the june 2008 level until january 2009 in january 2009 the fees will increase by 11 in 2010 fees will revert back to current law levels resulting in 21 reduction to medicare physician fee levels according to cbo2 on june 27 2008 prior to passage of mippa the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announ ced plans to instruct its contractors not to process any physician and nonphysician practitioner claims for the first 10 business days of july according to existing law electroni c claims are not to be paid any sooner than 14 days 29 days for paper cla ims and not later than the 30th day they are submitted otherwise cms must pay interest on those claims cms stated that by holding claims for services that were delivered on or after july 1 it would not be making any payments on the 106 reduction until july 15 at the earliest it was hoped that prior to that date congress would be able to take final acti on on measure addressing the physician payment issue on july 18 2 008 after enac tment of mippa cms notified payment contractors that the fee levels should be corrected within 10 business days any claims processed at the lower levels would automatically be reprocessed cms also notified physicians and other practitioners that they can waive retroactive higher beneficiary cost sharing amounts that would have applied if the claims had been processe d at the higher payment levels mippa also extends the quality reportin g program through 2010 establishes physician feedback program to provide confidential reports to physicians and establishes incentives for electronic prescribing in the medicare program3 why the fee schedule was enacted the fee schedule established by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 obra 1989 pl 101239 went into effect january 1 1992 the physician fee schedule replaced the reasonable ch arge payment method which with minor changes had been in place since the imple mentation of medicare in 1966 observers of the reasonable charge system cited num ber of concerns including the rapid rise in program payments and the fact that payments frequently did not reflect the resources used they noted the wide varia tions in fees by geographic region they also noted that physicians in different specialties could receive different payments for the same service the reasonable charge system was also criticized for the fact that while high price might initially be justified for new procedure prices did nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs3 4 the lower facilitybased payment reflects the fa ct that the facility itself receives separate payment for its costs of providing the servi ce while the nonfacilitybased payment to the physician encompasses all practice costsdecline over time even when the procedure became part of the usual pattern of care further it was suggested that differentials between recognized charges for physicians visits and other primary care services vers us those for procedur and other technical services were in excess of those ju stified by the overall resources used the fee schedule was intended to respond to these concerns by beginning to relate payments for given service to th actual resources used in providing that service the design of the fee schedule reflected many of the recommendations made by the physician payment review commission pprc congressionally established advisory body the pprc was replaced by the medicare payment advisory commission medpac on september 30 1997 it is responsible for advising the congress on the full ra nge of medicare payment issues calculation of the fee schedule the fee schedule has three components the relative value for the service geographic adjustment and national dollar conversion factor relative value the relative value for service compares the relative physician work involved in performing one service with the work involved in providing other physicians services it also reflects average practice expenses and malpractice expenses associated with the particular service each of the approximately 7500 physician rvice codes is assigned its own relative value the scale used to compare the value of one rvice with another is known as resource based relative value scale rbrvs the relative value for each service is the sum of three components physician work component which measures physician time skill and intensity in providing service practice expense component which measures average practice expenses such as office rents and employee wages which for certain services can vary depending on whether the service is performed in facility such as an ambulatory surgical facility or in nonfacility setting4 and malpractice expense component which reflects average insurance costs geographic adjustment the geographic adjustment is designed to account for variations in the costs of practicing dicine separate geographic practice cost index gpci adjustment is made to each of the three components of the relative value unit namely work adjustment practice expense adjustment and ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs4 5 the law requires the publication of geog raphic adjustment factor gaf for each payment locality the gaf is not actually used in the payment formula it does however present the weighted average impact for the locality of the three locality gpcis namely work gpci practice expense gpci and ma lpractice expense gpci the geographic adjustments are indexes that reflect cost diffe rences among areas compared to the national average in market basket of goods the wo rk adjustment is based on sample of median hourly earnings of workers in six professional specialty occupation categories the practice expense adjustment is based on employee wage s office rents medical equipment and supplies and other miscellaneous expenses the malpractice adjustment reflects malpractice insurance costs the law specif ies that the practice expense and malpractice indices reflect the full relative differences however the work index must reflect only onequarter of the difference using only one quarter of the difference generally means that rural and small urban areas receive higher payments and large urban areas lower payments than if the full difference were used value of 100 represents an average across all areas the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 placed floor of 100 on the work ad justment for the 20042006 period the tax relief and health care act of 2006 pl 109432 extended the provision through 2007 mmsea extended the provision through j une 2008 mippa extends it through 2009 areas that would otherwise have value below 10 pri marily rural areas receive higher payments over the period 6 for detailed description of how the geographic adjustments are calculated see appendix b 7 initially there was one conversion factor by 1997 there were three factors one for surgical services one for primary care services and one for all other services the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 provided for the use of single conversion factor beginning in 1998 8 the law requires that changes to the relative value units under the fee schedule can not cause expenditures to increase or decrease by more than 20 million from the amount of expenditures that would have otherwise been made this budget neutrality requirement was implemented through an adjustment to the conversion factor however beginning in 2007 it has been implemented through an adjustment to work relative values mippa requires that it again be implemented throug h the conversion factor beginning in 2009 see appendix malpractice adjustment5 these are added together to produce an indexed relative value unit for the service for the locality6 there are 89 service localities nationwide conversion factor the conversion factor is dollar figure that converts the geographically adjusted relative value for service into dollar payment amount the conversion factor is updated each year7 the conversion factor for 2008 is 380870 thus the payment for service with an adjusted relative value of 23 is 87608 anesthesiologists

assignment on all medicare claims in given year are referred to as nonparticipating physicians it should be noted that the term nonparticipating physician does not mean that the physician doesnt deal with medicare nonparticipating physicians can still treat medicare patients nd receive medicare payments for providing covered services there are number of incentives for physicians to participate chief of which is that the fee schedule payment amount for nonparticipating physicians is only 95 of the recognized amount for participatin g physicians regardless of whether they accept assignment for the particular service or not generally physicians are required to make any changes in their participati on status prior to the beginning of the calendar year nonparticipating physicians may charge beneficiaries more than the fee schedule amount on nonassigned claims these balance billing charges are subject to certain limits the limit is 115 of th fee schedule amount for nonparticipating physicians which is only 925 higher than the amount recognized for participating physicians ie 115 x 95 10925 see table 1 in 2007 933 of physicians and limited licensed practitioners billing medicare

one year of the service date an exception is permitted if beneficiary requests that the claim not be submitted this situation is most likely to occur when beneficiary does not want to disclose sensitive information for example treatment for mental illness or aids in these cases the physician may not bill more than the limiting charge the beneficiary is fully liable for the bill if the beneficiary subsequently requests that the claim be submitted to medicare the physici an must comply such exceptions should occur in only very limited number of caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs8 13 medpac march 2008a physician or practitioner may furnish service that medicare may cover under some circumstances but which the physician or practitioner anticipates would not be covered in the particular case for example multiple nursing home visits in this case the physician or practitioner should give the beneficiary an advance beneficiary notice abn that the service may not be covered if the claim is subsequently denied by medicare there are limits on what may be charged for the service if however the physician or practitioner does not give the beneficiary an abn and the claim is denied because the rvice does not meet coverage criteria the physician cannot bill the patient there is another condition under whic h physicians and practitioners do not submit claims for services which would otherwise be covered by medicare this occurs if the physician or practitioner is under private contacting arrangement see discussion under appendix in this case physicians are precluded from billing medicare or receiving any payment from medicare for two years refinements in relative value units on average the work co mponent represents 525 of services relative value the practice expense component represen ts 436 and the malpractice component represents 3913 the law provides for refine ments in relative value units the work relative value units incorporated in the initial fee schedule were developed after extensive input from th physician community refinements in existing values and establishment of values for new services have been included in the annual fee schedule updates this refinement and update process is based in part on recommendations made by the american medical associations specialty society relative value update committee ruc which receives input from 100 specialty societies the law requires review ev ery five years the 1997 fee schedule update reflected the results of the first fiveyear review the 2002 fee schedule reflected the results of the second fiveyear review the 2007 fee sc hedule reflected the results of the third fiveyear review while the calculation of work relative value units has always been based on resources used in providing service th values for the prac tice expense components and malpractice expense compone nts were initially based on historical charges the social security amendments of 1994 pl 103432 required the secretary to develop methodology for resourcebase d system for practice expenses which would be implemented in 1998 subsequen tly the secretary developed system the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 delayed its implementation it provided for limited adjustment in practice expense values for certain services in 1998 it further provi ded for implementation of new resource based methodology to be phase din beginning in 1999 the system was fully phased in by 2002 the 2007 fee schedule adopted new methodology for determining practice expenses this change is bein g phasedin over four years see appendix dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs9 bba 97 also directed cms to deve lop and implement resourcebased methodology for the malpractice expe nse component cms developed the methodology based on malprac tice premium data malpr actice premiums were used because they represent actual expenses to physicians and are widely available the system was incorporated into the fee schedule beginning in 2000 sustainable growth rate sgr system the conversion factor is dollar figure th at is the same for all services it is updated each year according to complicated formula specified in law application of the formula would have resulted in re duction in the conversi on factor for several years most recently congress overrode the formula through 2009 however the statutory formula remains in place the final physician fee schedule for 2008 issued before enactment of mmsea shows how the update calculation was to be made for 2008 the following discussion provides an overview of this calcu lation for more detail see appendix the statutory formula is based on the stainable growth ra sgr system the sgr system was established because of the concern that the fee schedule itself would not adequately constrai n overall increases in spending for physicians services while the fee schedule specifies limit on pa yments per service it does not place limit on the volume or mix of services the use of the sgr is intended to serve as restraint on aggregate spending the sgr targets are not limits on expenditures rather the sgr represents glide path for desired cumulative spending from april 1996 forward the fee schedule update reflect s the success or failure in meeting the goal if spending over the period is above the cumulative spending target for the period the update for future year is re duced if expenditures are less than the target the update is increased conversion factor calculation the annual update to the conversion fact or calculation is based on the following measures medicare economic index mei measures the weighted average annual price changes in the input s needed to produce services update adjustment factor used to make actual expenditures and target allowed expenditures equal allowed expenditures actual expenditures updated by the sgr under the formula if expenditures are in line with the target the update equals the mei that is payments would increase for all services at rate equal to the changes in input prices however in recent years expenditures have been significantly above the target therefore using the defined statutory update would have resulted in an update be low the mei the higher expenditures reflect numberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs10 of factors chief of which is that volume and intensity of services are growing at rate much faster than allowed under the formula update adjustment factor the update adjustment sets the conversi on factor at level so that projected spending for the year will meet allowed spending by the end of the year allowed spending for the year is calculated using the sgr the adjustment factor is the sum of 1 the prior year adjustment component and 2 the cumulative adjustment component use of both the prior year adjustment component and the cumulative adjustment component allows any devia tion between cumulative actual expenditures and cumulative allowed expenditures to be corrected over several years rather than single year in case can the adjustment factor be less than minus 7 or more than plus 3 thus despite calculations which woul d have led to larger reductions the uaf adjustment has been minus 7 for the last several years recent experience table 2 shows the annual nd cumulative allowed expenditures for calendar year 2007 these ar the expenditures that in the absence of mmsea would have been used to calculate the update for 2008 see appendix as can be seen from the table ther is significant difference between the targets and actual spending both in cu mulative spending nd annual spending under the formula the uaf would have been minus 267 for 2008 however the formula limited the reduction to minus 7 the caps on the adjustment limit the annual reduction or increase this means that the gap between cumulative actual spending and cumulative allowed spending grows larger each year this effect is further magnified by the fact that when congress has overridden the reduction it has not raised the targets table 2 annual and cumulative allowed and actual expenditures for physicians services 2007 in billions annual allowed expenditures 839 annual actual

the announced conversion factor reduction reflected both the negative update as well as some other adjustmentsmajor changes in update calculation when the fee schedule was first imp lemented in 1992 the medicare volume performance standard mvps served as th expenditure target mechanism under the mvps there was cumulative goal rather an annual target for physicians services was established further two nd then three conversion factors were used surgical primary care and other nonsurgi cal the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 pl 10533 replaced the mvps with the sgr the key difference between the mvps and the sgr system is that the sgr system looks at cumulative spending since april 1 1996 this was inte nded to eliminate some of the yeartoyear fluctuations however the estimated 8288 billion in actual spending from april 1 1996 through december 31 2007 far exceeds the cumulative 7766 billion in allowed expenditures over the period unde r the current system it would be very difficult to bring spending in below the cumulative target bba 97 also incorporated the gdp into the sgr calculation and provided for the use of single conversion factor in stead of three the balanced budget refinement

onsideration of alternative payment approaches testimony of bruce steinwald befo re house energy and commerce committee july 25 2006criticisms of current system most observers state that the sgr shoul d either be revised or replaced they note that in the absence of legislation negative updates will occur for the foreseeable future this reflects the fact that volume and intensity are growing at more than double the rate allowed under the sgr system15 further while legislation has averted recent cuts the targets have not been raised accordingly many observers contend that the current sgr system has additional flaws they note that the target is nationwide aggregate thus there is direct link between individual physician behavior and the targ ets an individual physician who reduces volume does not see proportional increase in payments related concern is that there is distinction between appropr iate volume increases and inappropriate volume increases another concern is that the targets may not adequately reflect scientific and technological innova tions or siteofservice shifts some persons state that actual increases in practice costs are in excess of those allowed under the system other observers ggest that the impact of legislative and regulatory changes may not be fully refl ected in the sgr calculation in addition some persons have stated that part b drug spending should be excluded from the calculation however cms s consistently stated that it cannot make this change retrospectively without legi slation and that even if it could it would not yield positive update for the next several years number of observers have expressed concerns regarding the implications of continuing to use the current system they state that over time physicians may be unable to absorb cuts if their marginal costs exceed the updates they may respond by refusing to see all medicare patients or new medicare patients quality of care and patient access may be adversely affecte d however some suggest that physicians might respond by becoming more efficient there is also the concern that patients may be forced to seek care in more costly settings suggested modifications while there is general agreement that the sgr system needs to be replaced or modified consensus has not developed on longterm solution part of the problem is that any permanent change is very costly this reflects the fact that the congressional budget office cbo baselin based on current law requirements assumes reduction in the c onversion factor will occur fo r the next several years further trhca specified that the override of the statutory formula was to be treated as if it did not occur therefore th starting base for the 2008 calculation was 5 below the actual 2007 conversion factor mms ea overrode the reduction for the first six months of 2008 and provided for 05 increase for that period however the legislation again specified that override of the statutory formula is to be treated as ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs15 16 medpac report to the congress medicare payment policy march 2008it did not occur mippa again specifies that the override of the statutory formula is to be treated as if it did not occur as previously noted cbo estimates that the statutory formula will result in reduction in the conversion factor of 21 in 2010 in addition to its impact on federal outla ys any change in the update formula will also have implications for beneficiaries because beneficiary premiums equal 25 of program costs any overall increas in spending results in proportional increase in premiums suggested modifications have ranged from modifying the current formula to replacing the formula and linking update s to payment ade quacy andor quality measures while change in the formul would require legisl ation some observers have suggested that there are things cms could do administratively to ease the impact of the current formula proponent s argue that these changes such as removing part b drugs from the calculati on could somewhat moderate the negative updates that are predicted the following outlines recent alternatives to the current sgr calculation that have been presented by the medicare payment advisory commission medpac the government accountability office gao and cbo also noted are proposed modifications contained in the house passed childrens h ealth and medicare protection act of 2007 champ hr 3162 medicare payment advisory commission medpac for several years medpac has recomme nded repealing the sgr sy stem it has recommended updating payments for physicians services based on the estimated change in input prices for the coming year less an adjustment for savings attributable to increased productivity specifically input prices w ould be measured using the mei without regard to the cms adjustment for pr oductivity increases the recommended productivity adjustment would be that used across all provider services16 dra required medpac to submit re port to congress on mechanisms that could be used to replace the sustainable growth rate system the report issued march 1 2007 did not recommend one specific course of action but rather outlined two broad approaches as follows the congress then must decide between two paths one path would repeal the sgr and not replace it with new expe nditure target instead the congress would accelerate development and adoption of approaches for improving incentives for physicians and other provid ers to furnish higher quality care at lower cost if it pursues this path th congress would need to make explicit decisions about how to update physician payments alternatively the congress could replace the sgr with new expenditure target system new expenditure target would not reduce the need however for major investment in payment reform regardless of the path chosen medicare should develop measures of practice styles and report the information to individual physicians medicare should also create opportunities for prov iders to collaborate to deliver high quality care while restraining resource usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs16 17 medpac assessing alternatives to the

concluded that such targets should not pply solely to physicians rather they should ultimately apply to all providers medicare has total cost problem not just physician cost problem moreover producing the optimal mix of services requires that all types of providers work together not at cross purposes17 government accountability office gao in its october 2004 report and subsequent july 2006 testimony gao outlined two main approaches for addressing current sgr issues the first approach would retain the targets but modify the current formula formul modifications could incl ude ceasing recoupment from prior periods eliminating the cumulative target mechanism and returning to system of annual targets modifying the allowan ce for volume and intensity growth to more closely reflect technologi cal innovation and changes in medical practice and removing drugs from the calculation18 the second approach would end targets as an explicit measure for moderating spending growth updates would be based on cost increases with the possibility of specifically addressing high volume serv ice categories such as medical imaging congressional budget office cbo in march 2008 cbo issued cost estimates for variety of approaches for dealing with the physician payment issue19 proposals with modest costs assumed freeze for the second half of 2008 asopposed to 106 reduction with reductions in future years to hold future rates at current law levels more costly alternatives would freeze or increase payments over the 10year budget window for example in creasing payments by the mei each year

whether those misvalued services warrant review through existing processes the secretary would be given the authority to reduce th work rvus for particular physicians service if the annual rate of growth in expenditures for the service provided under medicare for 2006 or subsequent year ex ceeded the average annual rate of growth in expenditures for all medicare physicians services by more than 10 percentage points the bill would also require the secretary to develop and implement physician feedback mechanism to measure resource use on per capita and an episode basis and create incentive paym ents under the medicare program for physicians practicing in an area identified as an efficient area recent actions evidencebased medicine trhca in recent years increasing attention has been focused on the rapid increase in vol ume and intensity of services attention has also been directed toward the wide geographic variations in the number and intensity of services provided even among physicians in the same specialty analyses of these geographi c variations shows that increased service use does not necessarily translate into increased quality or improved health outcomes some observers recommended incorporating quality measurements into the payment calculation quality measuremen ts would be based on evidencebased medicine physicians with higher quality performance would be paid more while those with lower quality performance would be paid less some have labeled this pay for performance or p4p20 in january 2006 cms launched the phys ician voluntary reporting program pvrp

negative update in the conversion factor instead trhca froze the 2007 factor at the 2006 leve l in addition the law set the work geographic adjustment level at minimum of 10 thereby slightly increasing the payment amounts in some areas however the rest of the 2007 fee sche dule regulation continued to apply it should be noted that this regulation inco rporated several significant changes from 2006 first it reflected the required fiveyear review of work relative values second it incorporated the first year of fouryear phasein of revised methodology for calculating practice expenses see appendix d third it included the impact of the dra mandated changes for payments for imaging services see discussion below the net impact of these changes for an individual physician varied by the

osullivanimaging services medpac and other observers have expr essed concerns that sizeable volume increases particularly for imaging services needed to be addressed part of the increases in volume may be attributable to beneficial uses of new technology however not all increases ma be appropriate dra modi fied the payment rules for certain imaging services specifically the law capped the technical component of the payment for services performed in doctors office at the level paid to hospital outpatient departments for such services the limitation does not apply to the professional component ie the physicians interpretation services subject to the cap are xrays ultrasound including echocardiography nuclear medicine including positron emission tomography magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography and fluoroscopy diagnos tic and screening mammography are excluded the provision was effectiv january 1 2007 number of groups objected to the payment cuts they cont end that the cuts could have unintended consequences including potentially diminis hing access to imaging services outside of the hospital setting mippa specifically addresses the imagin g issue it provides that beginning january 1 2012 payment may only be made under the physician fee schedule for the technical component of advan ced diagnostic imaging services furnished by supplier if such supplier is accredited by an accr editation organization the provision further requires the secretary to conduct demonstr ation using specified models to collect data regarding physician compliance with appropriateness criteria for advanced diagnostic imaging services the secretar could focus the demonstration project such as on services that account for large amount of medicare expenditures

increases on part b premiums payments for services paid under the physicians fee schedule account for about onethird of part b costs22 increased spending on physicians services therefore has considerable impact on overall part b costs and by extension on the amount beneficiaries are required to pa in monthly part b premiums by law beneficiary premiu ms equal 25 of part b program costs

decrease in the conversion factor for 2008 and 11 increase rather than decrease for 2009 these provisions have the effect of increasing part b costs fo r 2008 and 2009 and by extension the part b

about bene ficiaries continued access to care in 2002 the year the conversion factor was cut press reports in many part of the country documented many cases where beneficiaries were unable to find physician because physicians in their area were refusing to accept new medicare patients despite slight increases in the updates for 2003 2004 nd 2005 and the freeze in 2006 and 2007 some physicians claimed that program payments continued to fall significantly short of expenses they suggested that problem s would be magnified if the cuts scheduled to begin in 2008 were allowed to go into effect as noted mmsea delayed the cuts for six months physicians continue to st ate that access problems will definitely occur if congress does not address the cut in the c onversion factor slated to go into effect for the second half of 2008 access to care can be measured by reviewing beneficiary ability to get an appointment with physician the supply of physicians seeing medicare patients and physicians willingness to see new patients access periodic analyses by medpac show that beneficiary access to physicians services is generally good medpacs 2008 report reviewed several surveys conducted between 2005 and 200723 the surveys compared access for medicare beneficiaries with that for privat ely insured persons age 50 to 64 it noted that for both groups access to physicians was good and for some indicators was slightly better for the medicare populati on the large majority of medicare beneficiaries 82 had problem or only small problem in getting an appointment with new primary care physi cian while 17 reported big problem among those with an appointment 95 never or rarely had to wait longer than they wanted to get an appointment for routine car and 96 never or ra rely had to wait for care to treat an illness or injury however medpac noted that in view of possible negative updates in the second half of 2008 and in 2009 it pl anned to closely monitor access over the next year physician supply medpac reports that the growth in the number of physicians regularly billing medicare feefo rservice patients has kept pace with the growth in the medicare population medp ac reports that from 2001 to 2006 the number of physicians with at least 15 medicare patients grew 87 from 457292 to 497072 over the same period the number of such physicians per 1000 beneficiaries grew from 121 to 123 further the number of physicians with 200 or more medicare patients grew 12924 physicians willingness to see new beneficiaries related concern is the possible decline in the percentage of physicians accepting new medicare patients however medpac reports that the large majority of physicians in the us are willing to accept new medicare patients it cites results from 2006

appointment remained relativel constant about 7 nationwide similar percentages were reported for urban and rural beneficiaries beneficiaries who rated their health as poor were under 65 and disabled were not white and had supplemental health insu rance or had supplemental insurance from medicaid were more likely to have ex perienced physician access difficulties gao further noted that the proportion of bene ficiaries who received services and the number of services provided to beneficiaries who were treated suggested an increase in access from april 2000 to april 2005 future prospects while access remains good for medicare beneficiaries many observers are concerned that the situation could change if future cuts slated to occur through application of the sgr thodology are allowed to occur medpac does not support the consecutive annual cuts ca lled for in the law it is concerned that such cuts could threaten benefici ary access to physicians services over time particularly those provided by primary care physicians on june 26 2008 the ama issued st atement that based on physician survey if the cut in the conversion factor were allowed to go into effect july 1 2008 60 of physicians would limit the number of new medicare patients they treat more than half would need to cut staff nd 14 would quit patient care altogether26 geographic variation in payments geographic cost indices medicare makes geographic adjustment to each component of the physician fee schedule27 this adjustment is intended to reflect the actual differences in the costs of providing services in various parts of the country recently some observers particularly those in states with lower than average payment levels have objected to the payment variation in part this may reflect the concern

also suggested that states with lower than average per capita payments excluding managed care payments for all medicare services are being shortchanged it should be noted that the variations reflect variety of factors few of which can be easily quantified these include variations in practice pattern s size and age distribution of the beneficiary population variations in managed car penetration the extent to which populations obtain services in other states and the extent to which other federal prog rams such as those operated by the department of defense or veterans affairs are paying for beneficiaries care for these reasons cms considers statebystate medicare spending data misleading and is ther efore longer publishing this data payment localities geographic adjustments are applied by payment locality there are currently 89 localities some are statewide while others are substate areas some observers have r ecommended that changes be made to the composition of some of the current localities for example they state that costs in particular community significantly exceed t hose in other parts of the same locality cms has stated that it will consider requests for locality changes when there is demonstrated consensus within the state medical association for the change it should be noted that any changes must be made in budgetneutral fashion for the state thus if higher geographic practice cost indices and thus payments are applied in one part of the state they must be offset by lower indices and payments in other parts of the state in june 2007 the gao issued report that stated that more than half of the current payment localities had counties within them with payment difference of at least 5 between gaos measure of physi cians costs and medicares geographic adjustment for the area disproportiona number of these counties were located in five states gao recommended that cms revise the localities using an approach uniformly applied in all st ates and based

the localities when interested parties raised concerns or on its own initiative29httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs23 california issues two counties in california santa cruz and sonoma are assigned to

the approaches in the final rule however in view of the variety of comments received from interested parties in both california and other stat it decided further study was needed therefore change was made for 2008 medicare versus private payment rates some persons contend that medicare pa yments lag behind those in the private sector medpacs 2008 report notes that the difference between medicare and private rates narrowed in the late 1990s and has remained relatively stable in recent years averaged across all services nd areas the 2006 rates were 81 of private fees the 2006 rate was lower than the 83 ratio for 2005 medpac stated that this might be partially ttributable to the 0 update in the conversion factor for 2006 it should be noted that differen ce in fees can vary markedly within market area and for given service payments for oncology services the level of payments for practice expenses became major issue for oncologists who frequently administer chemot herapy drugs in their

additional charges typically have to find another doctor some physicians see concierge care as way of permitting them to spend more time with individual patients as well as way to increase their income however questions have been raised regarding the implications of concierge care for patients particularly medicare beneficiaries one concern is that while wealthier patients might be able to afford the additional costs other patients might find it more difficult to gain access to needed services the office of inspector general oig issued an oig alert on march 31 2004 the alert reminded medicare participating physicians bout the potential liabilities posed by billing for services already covered by medicare participating physicians can bill their patients for the requisite coinsurance and deductibles as well as for uncovered services however the alert noted that it had been brought to the oigs attention that some concierge contract services while scribed as uncovered services were actually servi ces covered by medicare th is would be in violation of the physicians assignment agreement and could subject the physician to civil monetary penalties recent legislation

geographic adjustments to the physician fee schedule section 1848e of the social security act requires the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs to develop indices to measure relative cost differences among fee schedule areas compared to the national average three separate indices are required one for physician work one for practice expenses and one for malpractice costs the law specifies that the practice expense and malpractice indices reflect the full rela tive differences however the work index must reflect only onequarter of the difference using only onequarter of the difference generally means that rural nd small urban areas would receive higher payments and large urban areas lower paymen ts than if the full difference were used the indices are updated every three years and phasedin over two years legislative background the physician fee schedule represented the culmination of several years of examination by the congress hhs and other interested parties on alternatives to the then existing chargebased reimburse ment system in 1986 congress enacted legislation providing for the establis hment of the physician payment review commission pprc to provide it with i ndependent analytic advice on physician payment issues key element of the commissions charge was to make recommendations to the secretary of hhs respecting the design of relative value scale for paying for physicians services the commissions march 1989 report presented the commissions proposal for fee schedule based pr imarily on resource costs it recommended that the initial basi s for the physician work component should be the work done by william hsiao and his colleagues at harvard university the 1989 pprc report examined issues re lated to geographic variations it noted that adjustments could be made to reflect nonphysician i nputs overhead costs such as office space medical equipment salaries of nonphysician employees and malpractice insurance and physician input s of their own time and effort which is generally measured by comparing earnings da ta of nonphysicians it concluded that payments under the fee schedule should vary from one geographic locality to another to reflect variation in physician costs of practice the costofliving practice index underlying the geographic multiplier should reflect variation only in the prices of nonphysician inputs35 pprc stated that the fee schedule should only reflect variation in overhead costs other observers however suggested that since physicians as well as other professionals compete in local markets local market conditions should be reflected in the payments three congressional committees have jurisdiction over medicare part b which includes physicians services these ar the house energy and commerce house ways and means and senate finance each of these committees consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs36 36 us congress house committee on the budget omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 report to accompany hr 3299 september 20 1989differing versions of the phy sician fee schedule as part of the budget reconciliation process in 1989 both the ways and means committee measure and the senate finance committee measure included geographic adjustment for the overhead and malpractice components of the fee sche dule but not for the physician work component however the energy nd commerce committee version provided for an adjustment the committee noted the pprc in its annual report for 1989 recommended that the physician work effort component of the fee schedule not be adjusted at all for geographic variations on the grounds that the physician s time and effort should be given the same valuation everywhere in the country the committee does not agree with this recommendation the committee recognizes that the costofliving varies around the country and that other professionals are compensated differently based on where they perform their services the committee is concerned that if adjustment is made in the physici an work effort component fees in high cost areas may be reduced to such an exte nt that physician services in such areas would become inaccessible the committ ee is also concerned however that full adjustment of this component in accord with the index developed by the urban institute would be disadvantageous to the low valuation areas and would not serve the committees policy goal of fostering better distribution of physician personnel fees in those areas might be too low to attract physicians and to resolve problems of access that have occurred the index chosen by the committee tries to balance these concerns it makes the adjustment in the physician work effort component but cuts the impact of the original urban institute index in half 36 the 1989 budget reconciliation bill passed by the house included both the ways and means committee and energy and commerce committee versions of reform the senate finance committee version was not in the senatepassed version because all medicare and nonmedicare provisions which did not have specific impact on outlays and therefore could not withstand point of order based on the byrd rule were struck from the senate bill since the physician payment reform provisions were designed to be budget neutral they were not included therefore the senate physician fee schedule provisions we re not technically in conference after considerable liberation the conference committee approved reconciliation bill which included physician payment reform the conference agreement provided that onequarter of th geographic differences in physician work would be reflected in the fee schedule the accompanying report described the provision but contained discussion of this issue mma contained several provi sions relating to the geographic calculations the law set floor of 10 on the work adjustment for the 20042006 period trhca extended the provision through 2007 mmsea extended it through the first six months of 2008 and mippa extends it through 2009 mma also raised the adjustments in alaska for the work co mponent practice expense component and malpractice component to 167 for th 20042005 period this provision was nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs37 37 much of the discussion in this section is drawn from 1 medicare program revisions to payment polices under the physician fee schedule for calendar year 2001 proposed rule 65 federal register 44189 july 17 2000 and 2 medicare program revisions to payment polices under the physician fee schedule for calendar year 2001 final rule 65 federal register 65404 november 1 2000 38 in both cases very slight very technical adjustments were madeextended however mippa specifies that beginning january 1 2009 the work geographic adjustment is raised to 15 in aska if the index would otherwise be less than 15 calculation37 work component the law defines the physici an work component as the portion of resources used in furnishing the service that reflects physician time and intensity the geographic adjustment to the work component is measured by net income the data source used for making the geographic adjustment has remained relatively unchanged since the fee schedule began in 1992 the original methodology used median hourly earnings based on 20 sample of 1980 census data of workers in six specialty occupati on categories with five or more years of college at the time the 1980 census data we re the latest available the specialty categories were 1 engineers surveyors and architects 2 natural scientists and mathematicians 3 teachers counselors nd librarians 4 social scientists social workers and lawyers 5 registered nurse s and pharmacists and 6 writers artists and editors adjustments were made to produce standard occupational mix in each area hhs has noted that the actual repor ted earnings of physicians were not used to adjust geographical differences in fees because these fees in large part are the determinants of earnings hhs further stat ed that they believed that the earnings of physicians will vary among areas to the same degree that the earnings of other professionals will vary calculations for the 19951997 indices also used 20 census sample of median hourly earnings for the same si x categories of pr ofessional specialty occupations however the 1990 census l onger used sample of earnings for persons with five or more years of colle ge for 1990 data were available for all education and advanced degr ee samples hhs selected the all education sample because it felt the larger sample size made it more stable and accurate in the less populous areas the 19951997 indices also replaced metropolitanwide earnings with countyspecific earnings for cons olidated metropolitan statistical areas cmsas which are the largest metropolitan statistical areas virtually changes were made in the 19982000 work indices from the indices in effect for 19951997 similarly virtua lly changes were made in the 20012003 work indices38 this was because new census data were not available hhs examined using other sources including th hospital wage index used for the hospital prospective payment system however for variety of reasons it was unable to find one that was acceptable it felt that making changes was preferable to making unacceptable changes based on inaccurate data it further noted that updating fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs38 the 1980 to 1990 census for the 19951997 indices had generally resulted in small magnitude of changes in payments it was expected that the 2004 update would reflect the 2000 census data however cms stated that the work and practice expense adjustments relied on special tabulations which had not been completed in time for use in the 2004 fee schedule the 2000 data is being used for 20052008 the same data sources and methodology used for the development of the 20012003 period were used for the subsequent periods practice expense component the geographic adjustment to the practice expense component is calculated by meas uring variations for three categories employee wages office rents and miscellaneous employee wages are measured using medi an hourly wages of clerical workers registered nurses licensed practical nurses nd health technicians as is the case for calculating the work indices th 2000 census is used for 20052008 office rents are measured by using residen tial fair market rent fmr data for residential rents produced annually by the department of housing and urban development hud commerc ial rent data has not been used because hhs has been unable to find data on commercial rents across all fee schedule areas hud publishes the data on metropolitan area basis the costs of medical equipment supp lies and miscellaneous expenses are assumed not to vary much throughout the country therefore this category has always been assigned the national value of 1000 malpractice component malpractice premiums are used for calculating the geographic indices premiums are for mature claims made policy policy that covers malpractice claims made during the covered period providing 1 million to 3 million coverage adjustments are made to incorporate costs of mandatory patient compensation funds cms updates the geogra phic adjuster based on the most recent premiums informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs39 appendix d development of practice expense payment methodology practice expenses background the relative value for servi ce is the sum of three components physician work practice expenses and malpractice expenses practice expenses include both direct costs such as nurse s and other nonphysician personnel time and medical supplies used to provide specifi c service to an individual patient and indirect costs such as rent utilities and business costs associated with maintaining physician practice when the fee sc hedule was first implemented in 1992 the calculation of work relative value units was based on resource costs at the time there was insufficient information to determine resource costs associated with practice expenses and malpractice costs therefore payment for these items continued to be based on historical charges number of observers felt that the us of historical charges provided an inaccurate measure of actual resources use d the social security act amendments of 1994 pl 103 432 require d the secretary of health and human services to develop methodology for resourcebase d system which would be implemented in cy1998 hcfa now cms devel oped proposed methodology which was published as proposed rulemaking june 18 1997 under the proposal expert panels would estimate the actual direct costs such as equipment and supplies by procedure hcfa then assigned indirect expenses such as office rent and supplies to each procedure this bottom up methodology proved quite controve rsial number of observers suggested that sufficient accurate data had not been collected they also cited the potential large scale payment reductions that might result for some physician specialties particularly surgical specialties bba 97 bba 97 delayed implementation of the practice expense methodology while new methodology was developed and refined bba 97 provided that only interim payment adjustments to existing historical chargebased practice expenses would be made in 1998 it established pr ocess for the development of new relative values for practice expenses and provided that the new resourcebased system would be phasedin beginning in cy1999 in 1999 75 of the payment would be based on the 1998 chargebased relative value it and 25 on the res ourcebased relative value in 2000 the percentages would be 50 chargebased and 50 resource based for 2001 the percentages would be 25 chargebased and 75 resource based beginning in 2002 the values would be totally resourcebased hcfa developed the required new thodology which was labeled the top down approach for each medical speci alty hcfa estimated aggregate spending for six categories of direct and indirect practice expenses using the american medical associations amas socioec onomic monitoring system sms survey data and medicare claims data each of the direct expense totals for clinical labor medical equipment and medical supplies were allocated to individual procedures based on estimates from the specialtys clinical practice expert panels cpeps indirect costs for office expenses admin istrative labor and other expenses were allocated to procedures based on combin ation of the procedures work relativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs40 value units and the direct practice expense estimates if the procedure was performed by more than one specialty weighted average was computed this average was based on the frequency with which each specialty performed the procedure on medicare patients the final step was budg et neutrality adjustment to assure that aggregate medicare expenses were more or less than they would be if the system had not been implemented subsequent modifications during the phasein period congress and others continued to evidence concern rega rding the survey data being used bbra 99 required the secretary to establish process under which data collected or developed outside hhs would be accepted and used to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with sound data practices these outside data would supplement data normally veloped by hhs for deter mining the practice expense component under this authority cms has accepted supplementa l data from seven specialties cms continued to refine practice expe nse relative value units on an ongoing basis assisting in this process was multispecialty subcommittee of the amas ruc this subcommittee the practice expense advisory committee peac reviewed cpep clinical staff equipment and supply data for physicians services it made recommendations to cms based on this review cms implemented most of the refinements recommended by the ruc and peac recently the peac was replaced by the practice expe nse review committee perc in its proposed rulemaking for the 2006 fee schedule cms proposed to revise the calculation used to determine practice expenses this proposal was withdrawn in the final rule primarily because inco rrect calculations were published in the proposed fee schedule modi fied version is incorporat ed in the 2007 fee schedule 2007 fee schedule the 2007 fee schedule incorporated major revision in the way practice expenses are calculate d cms stated that the revisions should make the process more tran sparent and easier to understand the following are the major changes use of bottomup method to cal culate direct practice expenses cms states that data refinement s by the peacpercruc process has enabled it to use this approach the direct costs are to be determined by adding the costs of the resources clinical staff equipment and supplies typically required to provide the service use of practice expense survey data from eight specialties allergyimmunology cardiology rmatology gastroenterology radiology radiation oncology ur ology and independent diagnostic testing facilities elimination of an exception to the previous methodology the nonphysician work pool which wa s used to calculate practice expenses for service codes without physician work component ie technical component codes and c odes for services furnished byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs41 nonphysicians these services w ill now be priced using the standard practice expense methodology incorporate technical modifications in the calculation of indirect practice expenses the changes are being phased in over four years 20072010httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs42 appendix private contracting rules private contracting is the term used to describe situations where physician and patient agree not to submit claim for service which would otherwise be covered and paid for by medicare under private contracting physicians can bill patients at their discretion without being subject to upper payment limits specified by medicare hcfa now cms had interp reted medicare law to preclude such private contracts bba 97 included language permitting limite d opportunity for private contracting effective january 1 1998 however if and when physician decides to enter private contract with medicare patient that physician must agree to forego any reimbursement by medicare fo r all medicare beneficiaries for two years the patient is not subject to the twoyear limit the patient would continue to be able to see other physicians who were not private contrac ting physicians and have medicare pay for the services how private contracting works hcfa issued regulations november 2 1998 as part of the 1999 physician fee schedule regulations which clarified privat contracting requirements the following highlights the major features of private contracting arrangements physicians and practitioners private contract may be entered into by physician or practitioner physicians are doctors of medicine and osteopathy bba 97 did not include chiropractors podiatrists dentists and optomet rists mma includes these limited license practitioners except for chiropractors who remain unable to enter into private contracts practitioners are physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists certified nurse midwives clinical psychologists and clinical social workers beneficiaries private contracting rule s apply only to persons who have medicare part b contract terms the contract between physician and patient must 1 be in writing and be signed by the beneficiary or the beneficiarys legal representative in advance of the first service furnished under the arrangement 2 indicate if the physician or practitioner has been excluded from participation from medicare under the sanctions provisions 3 indicate that by signing the contract the beneficiary agrees not to submit medicare claim acknowledges that medigap pl ans do not and that other supplemental insurance plans may choose not to make payment for services furnished under the contrac t agrees to be responsible for payments for services acknowledges that medicare reimbursement will be provided and acknowledges that the physician or practitioner is not limited in the amount he or she can bill for services and 4 state that the beneficiary has the right to obtain medicarecovered items nd services from physicians and practitioners who have not optedout and that the beneficiary is not compelled to enter into private contracts that apply to other serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs43 provided by physicians and practitioners who have not optedout contract cannot be signed when the beneficiary is facing an emergency or urgent health care situation affidavit physician entering into private contract with beneficiary must file an affidavit with the medicare carrier within 10 days after the first contract is entered into the affidavit must 1 provide that the physician or practitioner will not submit any claim to medicare for two years 2 provide that the physician or practitioner will not receive any dicare payment for any services provided to medicare benefi ciaries either directly or on capitated basis under medicare advantage 3 acknowledge that during the optout period services are not covered under medicare and medicare payment may be made to any entity for his or her services 4 identify the physician or practitioner so that the carrier will not make inappropriate payments during the opt out period 5 be filed with all carriers who have juri sdiction over claims which would otherwise be filed with medi care 6 acknowledge that the physician understands that bene ficiary who has not entered private contract who requires emergency or urgent care services may not be asked to sign private contract prior to the furnishing of those services and 7 be in writing and be signed by the practitioner effect on noncovered services private contract is unnecessary and private contracting rules do not apply for noncovered services examples of noncovered services include cosmetic surgery and routine physical exams services not covered in individual case physician or practitioner may furnish servi ce that medicare may cover under some circumstances but which the physician or practitioner anticipates would not be considered reasonable and necessary in the particular case for example multiple visits to nursing home if the beneficiary receives an advance beneficiary notice abn that the service may not be c overed private contract is not necessary to bill the patient if the claim is subsequently denied by medicare there are limits on what may be charged for the non covered service medicare advantage and private contracting private contracting physician may not receive payments from medicare advantage formerly medicarechoice organization for medicarecovered services provided to plan enro llees under capitation arrangement ordering of services medicare will pay for services by one physician which has been ordered by physician who has entered private contract unless such physician is excluded under the sanctions provisions the physici an who has opted out may not be paid directly or indirectly for the ordered services timing of optout participating physicians can enter private contract ie opt out at the beginning of any calendar quarter provided the affidavit is submitted at least 30 days before the beginning of the selected cale ndar quarter nonparticipating physicians can opt out at any timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31199crs44 early termination of optout physician or practitioner can terminate an optout agreement within 90 days of the effective date of the first opt out affidavit to properly terminate an optout the individual must notify all carriers with which he or she has filed an affidavit within 90 days of the effective date of the optout period b refund any amounts collected in excess of the limiting charge in the case of physicians or the deductible and coinsurance in the case of practitioners c inform patients of their right to have their claims filed with medicare for services furnished during the period when the optout was in effect issues prior to passage of the bba provision hcfa had interpreted medicare law to preclude private contracts proponents of private contracting argued that private contracting is basic freedom associated with private consumption decisions patients should be allowed to get services from medicare and not have medicare billed for the service advocates of private contracting generally object to medicares payment levels and balance billing limitations they state that if medicare is not paying the bill physician s who choose to private contract should not be governed by medicares rules opponents of private contrac ting contend that the ability to enter into private contracts benefits the pocke tbooks of physicians and creat twotiered system one for the wealthy and one for other medicare eligibles the twotiered system would allow wealthier beneficiaries to seek care outside of medicare and could conceivably create situation where only wealthier beneficiaries have access to the nations or an areas leading specialists for medical condition further concern is that beneficiaries living in areas served by only private contracting specialists would be unable to afford the bill which could be any amount and therefore forgo needed care the bba 97 provision provided limited oppor tunity for private contracting however the twoyear exclusion proved ve ry controversial proponents of private contracting viewed the twoyear exclusion as disincentive to enter these arrangements they argued that physi cians should not be excluded entirely from medicare because of their decision to contract in an individual case other observers were concerned that remova l of the twoyear limit would place beneficiaries at risk they contended that more physicians would ect to private contract if they could do it on servicebyservice basis beneficiaries might not know sufficiently in advance whether particular service would or w ould not be paid by medicare following enactment of the private contracting pr ovision in 1997 some efforts were made to eliminate the twoyear exclusion howeve r the provision has not been amended or repealed except for the mma provision allowing podiatrists dentists and optometrists to private contract
