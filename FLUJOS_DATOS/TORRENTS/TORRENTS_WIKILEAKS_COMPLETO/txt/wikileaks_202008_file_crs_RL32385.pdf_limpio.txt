health care coverage for the uninsured lessons learned from states summary state policymakers have been concerne d about the uninsured for number of years and have pursued many strategies to help expand health care coverage to understand the strategies undertaken by st ates and their successes and failures crs contracted with the institute for health care research and policy at georgetown university to conduct 50 state survey the findings of that survey are presented here in 2002 all states subsidized comprehensive health care for at least some of their lowincome residents medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip programs which enable states to augment their resources with federal matching funds we re the principal means of subsidizing health coverage in states in addition to medicaid and sc hip number of states used stateonly funding to subsidize health insurance or pa the cost of health care services for the uninsured or lowincome populations three states for instance had tax credits for small employers or individuals six states and the district of columbia had other statefunded programs to eith er subsidize health insuran ce or provide direct coverage for the uninsured twenty nine states d established highrisk pools for individuals rejected from traditional insurance for health reasons the variety of approaches used by th states that have engaged in these initiatives can yield some useful information for congress many have been in place for number of years so state progra m officials are knowledgeable about the strengths and weaknesses of the initiatives while many of the states efforts are small in scale they provide an oppor tunity to track their impact and any administrative challenges they pose cav eat for the reader is that the changing fiscal conditions reflected in many states budgets in the years since 2002 may have changed the priorities of states and impacted the size or generosity of some of the programs that were in effect at the time of the survey understanding how states regulated insurance markets and improved the availability of insurance for the sickest and poorest before feeling the full impact of the recent recessi on remains valuable nonetheless by providing insight into the va rious choices that ar available and their implications for federal initiatives at the same time we know that in few states dramatic changes in state health policies to increase coverage have occu rred since 2002 this includes initiatives in maine and california as well as several other states that have established high risk pools using funds made available under th trade adjustment act of 2002 this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32385contents t h u n i n s u r d 2 state coverage initiatives

state coverage initiatives states have pursued different coverage initiatives to varying degrees to make health insurance more affordable andor accessible all states subsidize health insurance for at least some of their lowincome residents medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip programs which enable states to augment their resources with federal matc hing funds are the principal means of subsidizing health insurance in states as table 2 illustrates few states have used stateonly funding to go beyond medicaid and schip to establish initiatives that subsidize health

stateonl funded programs to subsidize health insurance or provide direct coverage for the uninsured states have also tried to make health insurance more available to employers and individuals by setting rules for private health insurers these rules seek to stabilize coverage for those who have it such as when people change jobs or family circumstances change many states rules minimize the number of uninsured by removing barriers people face in obtaining and keeping health insurance and place limits on how much insurers can charge for insurance all states have comprehensive rules for insurers that sell health insurance to small firms with two to 50 employees called small group health insurers these rules are product of state efforts in the early 1990s and federa l law the health

than individual c overage and since most empl oyers contribute to the cost of their workers health insurance states may reach more people with fewer state funds but as indicated by the enrollment in several state programs they have faced challenges in doing so group health insu rance is major focus of programs in washington and new york these states programs serve both individuals and employer

been expanded to include groups of one that is selfemployed persons with other employ ees in 2002 in five states co ma vt wa groups of one had guaranteed access to all products offered by small group health insurer yearround but some states co fl md nh and nc had carved out an exception for groups of one on limited basis for instance they may have guaranteed access during one month out of the year or may be limited to standardized plans in az and nm groups of one have been guaranteed access to small group health insurance through statesponsored purchasing poolsgroup health insurance initiatives because most people twothirds of nonelderly americans get health insurance through their job and most of the nonelderly uninsured are employed group health insurance has been the corn erstone of many in itiatives and proposals intended to expand coverage while these efforts principally seek to stabilize coverage they are also intended to reduce or prevent an increase in the number of uninsured by removing barriers to accessing health insurance and helping workers keep their health insurance12 federal and state portability statutes and other market reforms created for private group health in surance have removed many of the access barriers to health insurance for exampl insurers are prohibited from denying or canceling health insurance because an em ployee is in poor health and for most people there are limits on how long insurers can deny them coverage for pre existing conditions few states have gone step further and sponsored purchasing pools for small employers to buy health insurance small group health insurance prior to the early 1990s state regulators identified number of problems in the sm all group market for health insurance some insurers were rejec ting small employers who had an employee with poor health status others would accept the group but refuse to cover any employees or dependents with history of illness in some cases insurers would refuse to renew health insurance or dramatically increase th price of health insurance for groups with high claims access rules beginning in the early 1990s the states moved to address these barriers to health insurance by setting rules for small group health insurers later in 1996 hipaa established nationa l standards for private health insurance based in large part on these state effo rts although almost all of the states had small group reforms by the time hipaa was enacted there was inconsistency in the degree of the protections among the states some states for example required insurers to make all of their products available to small employers but in many other states insurers were only required to make one or two products availabl these products tended to have many more sick people than health people and were usually very expensive hipaa provided greater uniformity and breadth to these protections it also expanded them to selffunded group health plans that state law does not reach

of jan 1 2003 all small group health insurance policies in the state will be communityratedaddress this issue through rating rules but the extent to which they have done so varies table 7 approaches to rating reform for small group health insurers pure community rating insurers cannot set premiums for policies sold to small group based on the health status or case characteristics demographics such as age gender or industry of the gr oups membership those buying the same benefits are charged the same premium adjusted community rating insurers cannot set premiums based on health status the state might allow insurers to vary premiums based on factors such as age gender or industry rate bands insurers can set premiums based on factors such as health status age gender or industry but the state limits how much th premium can vary among those receiving the same benefits based on some or all of these factors health status and claims experience are the primary factors influencing rates and the focus of most state rating rules most states place some limits on their use in setting premiums by group insurers but in 2002 only 13 states prohibited their use altogether as rating factors for small group health insurance the most stringent form of rating restriction pure community rating see table 7 can be found only in the states of new york and vermont16 in those states small group insurers cannot charge more because of the hea lth status age gender or occupation of members of the group as result the cost of health insurance is spread more broadly across the entire market and pre mium variations are based only on benefits and not health status or demographics called case characteristics this makes the cost of health insurance more predictable for small employers it also spreads the cost of health insurance among all groups making it more affordable for groups with sicker employees and dependents as re sult groups that have more employees with poor health status may pay less than they otherwise would while healthier groups are likely to pay more in some states pur community rating re quirements may apply to certain insurers for instance in 2002 bl ue crossblue shield was required to use pure community rating in michigan anot her 11 states california colorado connecticut florida maine maryland massachusetts new hampshire new jersey oregon and washington required that sm all group insurers use method called adjusted community rating which prohibits them from charging groups more due to health status they are able however to charge more for other factors such as age or gender one of these states oregon pplied this rule to products purchased by groups of two to 25 instead of more comm on small group size of two to 50 workers most of the

offering health insurance at lower cost than would otherwise be available to small firm pu rchasing coverage i ndependently in the private market it is argued that th cost savings is achieved through volume purchasing and discounts ne gotiated with insurers18 cost savings may also be achieved through favorable lection of purchasing pool members who are healthier than average such savings however may be directly offset by increases in the cost of health insurance for sicker groups w ho are left outside of the pool although achieved costs savings are debatable pool s can improve choice for small businesses and their workers generally employees of participating sm all businesses choose among different insurance companies health insurance policies and benefit levels such choices are not typically available to employees of small businesses outside the purchasing pool19 additionally purchasing pools may fill an unmet need by serving population that has limited access to health in

guaranteed access to those individuals who are federally eligible it allowed states to choose how to implement this guarantee most states used options that already existed such as highrisk pools as

number of reasons for the small enrollment numbers the most prominent reason is that these programs have lacked funding to enroll larger number of people26 states and enrollees generally share in the cost of the insurance funding for states high ri sk pools came from variety of sources including general revenue tobacco settlement f unds state taxes assessments on insurers and taxes or service charges on providers27 at the time of the survey participants were also required to pay premium for their coverage while states often offered variety of levels of coverage highrisk pool covera ge is still nonetheless expensive and unaffordable for many uninsurable individuals28 this may have discouraged some people from applying some of the features of highrisk pools may also have contributed to low enrollme nt levels while individuals meeting the eligibility requirements could not be turned down the highrisk pools could use many of the same features as private individual health insurers for example to protect against individuals waiting until they get sick to purchase coverage called adverse selection highrisk pools had preexisting condition exclusion periods however these strategies

activities tax credits in each of the years that presid ent bush has been in office the administrations budget pr oposals have included as central component of his health care agenda proposal to establis h health insurance tax credits for the uninsured in addition va rious members of congress have introduced their own health insurance tax credits bills some of those bills include credits for employers but most of the nationa l debate has focused on credits for individuals33 there has been much discussion among policy analysts about how large tax credit has to be to make individual health insurance affordable and growing consensus that it will have to be large to substantia lly lower the number of uninsured34 analysts have struggled with the difficult question of how tax credit could be structured so that it really reached the uninsured35 there has also been discussion about how tax credit could be structured to minimize any adverse impact on jobbased coverage36 this discussion includes for instance th extent to which younger and healthier workers who qualify for the tax credit will drop their jobbased health insurance and make health insurance more expensive for those who remain the impact of tax credits on people with chronic conditions or history of illness has also been subject of concern since as discussed above most states currently do not have the protections in place to make individual h ealth insurance accessible to broad range of people public programs the health insurance flexibility and accountability demonstration initiative hifa gives states options to expand coverage to the uninsured by allowing them more flexibility in designing eligibility benefit packages and costsharing requirements than under cu rrent medicaid and schip rules it also encourages states to offer premium assistance through schip to enroll children in their parents jobbased health insurance37 while this may expand coverage some have expressed concern about the effect on medicaid beneficiaries should states reduce benefits packages or increase co stsharing as allowed under the initiative38 other proposals have been introduced to expand coverage thr ough public

small employers continue to have difficulty affording health insurance cong ress continues to deba other strategies to make insurance affordable one strate gy that has been discussed for number of years is to change federal law so that many associationsponsored plans would not be subject to state small group health insurance rules including some benefit mandates and rating rules the bills would establish association health plans ahps as legal entities that allow small employers to pool together to buy coverage that is priced below plans that must meet state regulations this approach has been the subject of heated debate for many years three bills hr 4281 hr 660 and its companion bill s 545 have been introduced in the 108th congress39 the trade act of 2002 some of the approaches discussed in this report were incorporated into the trade adjustment assistance reform act of 2002 pl 107 210 this act included an individual tax cr edit that applies only to individuals who are receiving trade readjustment assistance or benefits from the pension benefit guaranty corporation they will be able to use the credit to subsidize 65 of their cost for cobra or other qualified health insurance the act relies on states to establish these other qualified health insura nce arrangements it also provides some resources to states to creat or expand highrisk pools the act included seed money in the amount of 1 million for each state that had not yet started highrisk pool and limited matching funds to help states with existing pools defray some of their costs the matching funds available amount to total of 40 million in each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 three states new hampshir maryland and south dakota have qualified for grants under the taa to establish risk pools implications for the future the federal government tinues to look to the states as its laboratories of innovation states have spent many years exploring ways to expand private health insurance and public programs to the uninsured medicaid and schip are the primary vehicles through which they have pur sued this goal states have also made progress designing rules to better stabilize group health insurance and promoting access for those who can afford to pay but they have been largely unable to reach those who are not eligible for public prog rams or those who are declined or cannot afford private insurance for those who lack access to gr oup health insurance the states have faced greater challenges ccess to and affordability of individual health insurance and alternative form s of coverage such as high risk pools in particular remains problematic creating stable c overage options for small employers and individuals who cannot access or afford pr ivate health insurance has proven difficult task for stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32385crs24 probably the most important lesson learned from the states experience is that they cannot easily do this alone the most comprehensive initiatives that states have undertaken involved significant federal involvement federa l standards andor federal dollars the schi p program and the small group health insurance rules established under hipaa are the most recen t notable examples while states had begun to enact many of the market refo rms later included in hipaa the federal laws passage created uniformity across states so that all small employers have the opportunity to buy group health insurance schip helped states make significant headway in reducing the uninsurance rate for children states have been uneven in their effo rts to expand coverage to the uninsured reflecting at least in part the significant financial costs associated with many of these initiatives and the demands of different priorities only six states and the district of columbia for instance d public programs in place in 2002 providing access to health insurance funded without federal dollars very few states have attempted to extend tax credits to subsidize the cost of health insurance coverage further with few exceptions such as nnesotas highrisk pool or washingtons basic health plan the states have not reached appreciable numbers of uninsured through these initiatives even in the cas of highrisk pools which 29 states have created states have struggled to garner sufficient resources to reach large number of residents or to make such coverage affordable they are further challenged by the rising number of people without insura nce and the declining number covered by employerbased coverage given comp eting priorities for limited state budgets questions remain about how states can ma intain their current public programs much less begin new ones nevertheless the variety of approaches us ed by those states that have engaged in these initiatives can yield some useful information for congress many have been in place for number of years so state pr ogram officials are knowledgeable about the strengths and weaknesses of their initiatives understanding how these public and private programs have been designed can pr ovide insight into the various choices that are available and their implications while many of the states efforts are small in scale they provide an opportunity to track their impact and any administrative challenges they pose
