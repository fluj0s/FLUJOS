supported by the program presents budget trends discusses the management of program and describes the infrastructure in which the program is implemented this report is for staff new to the area of defense research and for senior staff interested in historical trends this report will be updated periodically for tracking congressional action on the current years budget the reader is referred to the issue brief entitled defense research dods research development test and evaluation rdte program by the same author defense research primer on the department of defenses research development test and evaluation rdte program summary over the last 10 years the country has spent an average of 36 billion year on dods rdte program about 80 of that goes toward the development of specific military systems or system components most of the rest between 7 billion and 8 billion goes toward more fundamental research development and demonstrations of sciences and technologies identified as important to military capabilities and operations called the science and technology program total rdte funding for the last 10 years has remained relatively level in nominal terms however when accounting for inflation rdte funding peaked in fy1987 and declined fairly steadily until fy1997 the decline primarily occurred in those activities associated with developing specific weapon systems science and technology funding during that time although more volatile from year to year has kept up with inflation maintaining healthy science and technology program is continuing concern of congress the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology has been given the responsibility of overseeing the overall rdte budget reporting to the undersecretary is the director of defense research and engineering ddre who is responsible for overseeing the science and technology program actual program management responsibility belongs to the services and number of defense agencies each service and defense agency has its own process for planning its rdte and science and technology investment the ddre is responsible for publishing dodwide science and technology strategy and plan dods rdte budget supports work at universities private firms nonprofits federally financed research and development centers serviceowned research facilities and other federally owned research facilities dod currently has over 80 research and development facilities and 26 test and evaluation centers some issues that congress has been addressing and likely will continue to deal with include maintaining healthy science and technology st investment accelerating the transition of new technology from the laboratory to the field downsizing dods rdte infrastructure and integration with the commercial sector

the department of defenses research development test and evaluation rdte program introduction this report describes the basic elements and issues of the department of defenses dod research development test and evaluation rdte program over the last 10 years the country has spent an average of 36 billion year on dods rdte program about 80 of that goes toward the development or demonstration of specific military systems or system components most of the rest between 7 billion and 8 billion per year goes toward more fundamental research development and demonstrations in sciences and technologies identified as important to military capabilities and operations because it represents such large investment and supports the development of the nations high technology weapons systems and the technology base upon which those systems rely congress has shown considerable interest in overseeing dods rdte program and although its share of the nations overall expenditure on science and technology research and development has diminished over the years the program still plays an important role in developing certain key technologies that impact commercial products and the overall economy this report discusses the types of activities supported by the rdte program trends in the programs budget program management and dods rdte infrastructure program activities dods rdte program is one of the major elements of dods total budget other major elements include personnel operations and maintenance and procurement for an introduction to dods overall budget the reader is referred to crs report rl30002 defense budget primer see for additional reading the rdte program supports wide range of activities from basic research in science and engineering eg physics mathematics materials electronics to the full scale development of specific weapons systems eg the f22 fighter or the comanche helicopter the rdte budget is accordingly subdivided into 7 separate activities basic research applied research advanced technology development demonstration and validation engineering manufacturing development management support and operational systems development these 7 activities are designated as 61 through 67 description of each is given in figure 1 crs2 figure 1 rdte activities 61 basic research supports research 64 demonstration and validation that produces new knowledge in supports the initial development and scientific or technological area of demonstration of product designed interest to the military areas include specifically to meet an agreed upon set of atmospheric and space sciences ocean performance standards associated with sciences biological and medical validated operational need demval as it sciences chemistry cognitive and is often called supports formal acquisition neural sciences computer sciences program and typically involves electronics materials science competition among different designs mathematics mechanics ocean sciences physics and terrestrial 65 engineering manufacturing sciences for example basic research development supports the continued may study the electronic effects of development and refinement of infrared radiation on certain class of specifically designed product that has materials demonstrated it can meet performance requirements and development of the 62 applied research supports the necessary manufacturing processes needed exploratory development and initial to build that product maturation of new technologies for specific military application or further 66 management support supports the developing existing technology for new overhead costs associated with managing military applications an example the rdte activities and running facilities would be studying the feasibility of integrating infrared detecting materials 67 operational systems development and electronics for night vision any supports the continued improvement and hardware development would be upgrading of products already in primarily to demonstrate the capability production of the technology to meet military need in simulated or laboratory environment 63 advanced technology development supports larger scale hardware development and integration and experiments that can demonstrate capability in more operationally realistic settings an example might be equipping soldiers taking part in training operation with new prototype night vision goggle funding for 61 and 62 activities constitute what is called dods technology base program and is often referred to as the seed corn of dods technological capabilities it is here where new technologies and their potential for military application are explored and developed sometimes over long periods of time number of the technologies utilized with such great effect during the gulf war eg laser guided bombs stealth cruise missiles night vision can trace their origins to technology base programs initiated in the late 1960s and early 1970s advanced technology development 63 activities are meant to help technology make the transition from the laboratory to the field among these activities are advanced technology demonstrations atds conducted by the services crs3 individually for relatively unique service needs and advanced concept technology demonstrations actds managed by the office of the secretary of defense in cooperation with one or more of the services for needs associated with joint operations taken together these first three activities 6163 constitute what is called dods science and technology st program the st program does not support development in formal acquisition program although as one goes from 61 to 63 the connection to specific military operational capability becomes more important and apparent funding for 64 65 and 67 activities does support formal acquisition program where specific new product or product upgrade is designed and developed to meet certified military requirement the lions share of the rdte budget goes toward support of these activities the acquisition process is discussed later in this report budget trends rdte funding for the last 10 years has remained relatively flat in nominal terms however when accounting for inflation rdte funding peaked in fy1987 and declined fairly steadily until fy1997 see figure 2 the steep increase in total rdte funding during the early part of the 1980s was the result of increased support for the development specific new weapon systems associated with the reagan administrations military buildup the decline in total rdte since the last half of the 1980s is the result of slowing down in the development of specific new weapon systems the decline in spending was initially in concert with other efforts to control federal budget deficits and then later continued in response to the breakup of the soviet union and the end of the cold war figure 2 total rdte funding 50000 40000 30000 millions 20000 10000 0 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 fiscal year current 2000 crs4 beginning in the carter administration funding for science and technology programs also grew but at slower rate see figure 3 with the end of the cold war congress became concerned that drop in nearterm weapons development might adversely impact dods long term ability to develop new weapons systems congress maintained and even increased slightly funding for science and technology after three years however faced with internal budget tradeoffs congress was unable to sustain that level of investment in real terms if dod and congress seek to increase support for force modernization in the next few years 64 and 65 funding may increase again relative to the science and technology program figure 3 total rdte vs total st 50000 40000 millions fy00 30000 20000 10000 0 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 fiscal year total rdte total st figure 4 shows the funding trend for each activity within the science and technology program 61 through 63 much of the increase in science and technology spending during the reagan buildup was concentrated in advanced technology development 63 the big step increase in 63 funding beginning in fy1986 was primarily due to the strategic defense initiative much of the funding for which was characterized as advanced technology development funding for basic research 61 and applied research 62 has been relatively flat in constant dollars over the last 10 years the university community however has expressed some concern over the slow erosion of basic research from its peak in fy1993 much of the funding for basic research is spent at universities while universities as whole receive decreasing share of their rd funds from dod dod does provide disproportionate share of funding in certain engineering fields such as electrical engineering and materials and mathematics crs5 figure 4 st funding by activity 7000 6000 5000 millions fy00 4000 3000 2000 1000 0 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 fiscal year dod 61 dod 62 dod63 management organization the secretary of defense through the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology usdat has overall responsibility for managing the total rdte budget reporting to the undersecretary is the director of defense research and engineering ddre who oversees the st program while the office of the secretary of defense osd provides guidance and final approval of the rdte program and budget it is the service departments army air force and navy and defense agencies that develop the plans and budgets and implement the rdte program the defense agencies that manage significantly large rdte programs include the defense advanced projects agency darpa which only supports 6163 activities the ballistic missile defense organization bmdo and the office of the secretary of defense itself primarily through the ddre in addition the defense special weapons agency the chemical and biological defense program and special operations command manage relatively large rdte programs finally there are the director of developmental test and evaluation and the director of operational test and evaluation who receive rdte funds for carrying out their responsibilities for independent andor joint testing of new systems how best to maintain an independent evaluation of new military systems independent of the organizations charged with developing those systems has been the topic of some debate over the years figure 5 shows the relative share of the total rdte budget between services and defense agencies defense agencies primarily darpa and bmdo but also crs6 osd have received an increasing share of the overall rdte budget as result of their increased spending on st the bmdo also has significant investment in demonstration and validation 64 and engineering and manufacturing development 65 programs the relative share between the services partly reflects the relative costs and complexities of the systems developed as sophisticated as us army tanks have become fighter aircraft still costs more figure

strategy and planning separately from acquisition strategy and planning while the two processes do function somewhat independently of each other they are intimately related the st program develops the future generations of technology while acquisition programs bring that technology into the next generation of equipment there is time lag between technology development and the ability to get that technology into the field st planning in 1988 as part of its fy1989 defense authorizations section 823 pl 100456 congress instructed the usdat to provide it with an annual plan for developing the technologies that the office of the secretary defense osd felt were most critical to ensure the long term qualitative superiority of us weapons systems the plan is to include the rationale for selecting those technologies milestones associated with developing them budgets allocated to developing them and the potential contribution industry and allies could make to their development prior to this there was dodwide st strategy or plan to guide an integrated approach to technology development among the services or to provide congress with information useful for its oversight function the first such plan was submitted in crs7 1989 the process for generating the plan and the look of the plan has evolved considerably since then figure 6 shows the current process figure 6 st planning process nstc national security joint vision st strategy 2010 defense st strategy t d program s objective r t memoranda reliance g basic research defense technology joint warfighting plan area plan st plan budget serviceagency st plans the st investment strategy and planning process occurs at two levels and in two directions at one level each service has its own planning and review process to ensure that its st program supports the current and longterm needs of its own war fighting community at higher level the ddre is responsible for ensuring that the combined st programs compliment each other serve the jointwar fighting capabilities identified by joint chiefs of staff and the area commandersinchiefs as stated in joint vision 2010 in the figure below and address the national security science and technology strategy generated by the national science and technology council also shown in figure below the ddre is also responsible for ensuring that redundancies and deficiencies in the individual st programs of the services and agencies are addressed while war fighting needs are generally defined by the war fighting community and the st community seeks to develop technologies to meet those needs topdown the st community also provides the war fighter with new opportunities as new technologies are conceived and matured bottomup interservice and agency coordination is facilitated by the defense science and technology reliance project the army and air force formed reliance in 1990 primarily in response to the st planning process implemented in 1989 it expanded to include the navy and now includes darpa bmdo the deputy ddre and the defense special weapons agency reliance is an interserviceagency forum where agreements on joint planning collocation of inhouse rd and leadserviceagency assignments are made reliance focuses primarily on those areas of common interest to more than one service eg aviation electronics crs8 reliance is responsible for developing the three plans listed in the figure above the basic research plan the defense technology area plans and the joint war fighting science and technology plan these plans lay out basic roadmaps for achieving certain military capabilities to achieve these levels of capability in the time required specific defense technology objectives dtos or in the case of basic research strategic research objectives sros are identified each dto sro identifies specific level of technological advancement or gain in knowledge that will be made including estimated dates funding levels the rdte program elements pes which will support that funding and an explanation of how this effort will impact the war fighters needs together over 300 dtos are identified and account for about 50 of dods total 62 and 63 funding sros account for about 67 of dods total basic research funding these plans and technology strategic research objectives are reviewed by technology area review and assessment tara teams program modifications or recommendations are forwarded to the defense science and technology advisory group dstag chaired by the ddre who then proposes any changes to the program review group prg which is part of the defense resources board which prepares dods budget any changes approved by the prg are sent back to the service planners in the form of program decision memoranda acquisition planning the deputy secretary of defense with the assistance of the defense resources board decides whether to acquire new military system the decision is based on military strategy the mission capabilities needed to carry out that strategy the equipment needed to achieve those capabilities and the affordability of developing and operating that equipment once new acquisition program is begun 64 65 and 67 rdte funding supports certain phases of that program profile of the acquisition process that is supported by the rdte budget is shown in figure 7 it consists of phases separated by milestone decisions these decisions are made by the defense acquisition board dab chaired by the usdat work done during the phases are managed by the services or agencies figure 7 acquisition process milestones 0 i ii iii phase 0 phase i phase ii phase iii relevant rdte 64 65 67 phase 0 concept exploration phase i program definition risk reduction phase ii engineering manufacturing development phase iii production deployment operational support crs9 before an acquisition program can begin an operational component within one of the services eg the air force air combat command must identify broadly stated mission need that cannot be satisfied by changes in tactics doctrine etc if the materiel solution to this need is expensive enough above certain threshold the joint requirements oversight committee jroc of the joint chiefs of staff must review and approve it at that point the usdat reviews the jroc request and chooses one or more concepts for further study milestone 0 phase 0 concept evaluation involves shortterm studies evaluating the feasibility of competing concepts at the end of phase 0 the dab assesses whether new acquisition program is warranted and if so approves milestone i baseline acquisition strategy which includes budgets test and evaluation master plans risk assessments and mitigation efforts etc milestone approval also agrees on what needs to be demonstrated in the next phase of the program exit criteria at this point if the deputy secretary of defense approves new program is begun phase i program definition and risk reduction will further develop one or more of the concepts studied in the previous phase assessing advantages and disadvantages and demonstrating prototype equipment if necessary to reduce risks uncertainties the acquisition strategy becomes more clearly defined as does the specific system requirements when the exit criterion for phase i has been met the dab decides whether to continue with one of the concepts milestone ii phase ii engineering and manufacturing development translates the most promising concept into stable operational affordable and producible design also during this time the manufacturing and production processes are validated once prototype of the design demonstrates it can meet the requirements low rate initial production is authorized by the dab low rate initial production provides operational components for operational testing and to establish the initial production capability at milestone iii the dab approves phase iii production deployment and operational support at this point rdte funds decline and procurement funds take over infrastructure dods rdte program supports work at universities research institutes federally funded research and development centers ffrdcs private firms and consortia and at service rdte facilities funds flow in different proportions to different entities depending on the type of activity being funded large part of dods basic research program almost 60 goes to universities about 25 goes to dods own rd facilities most of the 62 and 63 work is performed in industry almost 50 and at dods own facilities 30 just about all of the 64 65 and 67 funding goes to private firms dods rdte infrastructure is divided into two groups research and development laboratories and test and evaluation centers laboratories are dod activities cost centers that perform one or more of the following activities science and technology engineering development systems engineering and engineering support of deployed materiel there are over 80 dod rd laboratory facilities eg naval research laboratory test and evaluation centers are facilities and the surrounding area ie sea air ground space that are governmentowned or controlled and which are used to collect data and deliver products eg crs10 reports there are 26 centers eg the armys white sands missile range each of the services supports its own rd laboratories and centers each manages them in its own way it should be noted that darpa and bmdo do not have any rd laboratories of their own bmdo does operate the joint national test facility ffrdcs are notforprofit organizations which are financed on solesource basis exclusively or substantially by federal agency to perform specific research and development that the agency cannot do itself or contract from other organizations the federal government supports total of 42 ffrdcs each is administered by contract by an industrial firm university or other nonprofit institution dod supports 12 ffrdcs at one point dod supported 39 an example is the lincoln laboratory managed by the massachusetts institute of technology and begun in world war ii to develop radar about 3 of dods total rdte budget goes to ffrdcs as mentioned earlier much of dods 61 research is performed by grant or contract at universities much of this is singleinvestigator research however 61 funding also goes to support centers of excellence and other centers at universities that take multidisciplinary team approach besides providing direct funding to private firms for various research and development activities dod also provides indirect support for private firms independent research and development ird based on negotiations between the firm and dod dod will allow firms to count as an expense on its dod contracts some share of the research and development the firm does with its own funds and for its own purposes these cost allowances have in the past amounted to 2 billion to 3 billion per year congress removed the limits on how much companies could be reimbursed in the early 1990s as part of congressional efforts to continue supporting military rd during the transition to postcold war environment issues issues that congress has confronted and may continue to confront relating to dods rdte budget include maintaining healthy science and technology investment the science and technology program is perceived as imperative to maintaining dods technological edge over potential adversaries investments made here bear fruit later in the form of more sophisticated equipment and capabilities however because knowledge and information is the primary product at this stage in development especially for 61 and 62 activities specific return on investment in the form of hardware or software is not always immediate in fact it is not always clear beforehand whether new technology will ever prove useful as result there is always concern within the st community that pressures for nearerterm developments or issues will crowd out the longer term investment associated with science and technology projects over the last 10 years dods st investment has varied widely but since fy1993 when it peaked in real terms it has steadily declined crs11 there is clear objective way to determine how much st funding is appropriate to maintain healthy technology base and to maintain dods technological advantage the fy1999 defense authorization bill pl 105261 sec 214 expressed sense of congress that st funding should increase 2 above inflation each year through fy2006 the bill same section also called for report by the national research council to study what level of st investment was appropriate and what the impacts might be of not maintaining that level of funding as of the writing of this report that study has not been initiated in may 1998 the defense science board studied this issue by looking at how industry determines how much to spend on research and development the board concluded that industry did not use formal process for determining what to spend but instead used general rule of certain percentage of sales according to the study technologically dynamic industries invested up to 35 of sales in research 15 of sales in research and development using this rule and equating dods total outlays to sales the board determined that an investment in fy1999 of about 8 billion would be appropriate another issue is the level of basic research supported by the st program between fy1993 and fy1998 investment in basic research had slowly eroded in constant dollars much of dods basic research is invested in universities dod basic research investment in universities represents relatively small share of universities outside funding but in certain areas such as materials and electronics engineering and mathematics dods investment is significant source of funds reductions in 61 funding generate concern within the university community accelerating the transition of new technology the pace at which new technology moves from the laboratory to fielded system has always been of concern although the urgency to do so may have subsided with the end of the cold war scaling technology up in size and integrating it with other technologies can present problems not identified in the laboratory trying to solve these bugs in an acquisition program can delay the program andor greatly increase the costs of the program therefore over the years more emphasis has been placed on technology demonstrations as way to solve these problems before beginning an acquisition program in the last few years technology demonstrations have also been proposed as way to quickly get new technologies into the field short of formal acquisition program while agreeing on the need for such demonstrations congress has been cautious in support especially of actds even so technology demonstrations have increased as share of the st program downsizing infrastructure dods downsizing since the end of the cold war focused initially on reducing force levels and reducing or delaying the development of new weapons systems the next phase of downsizing was directed at trying to reduce infrastructure across the board the base realignment and closure brac process has been the instrument by which dod and congress have agreed to close bases and other dod facilities in what is otherwise highly politicized process closure and consolidation of defense rd facilities to the extent they have occurred have been result of the brac process in addition dod has been reducing the rdte workforce since fy1992 reductions are to continue into the next century at which point the workforce will have been reduced almost 30 from fy1992 levels additional reductions to the acquisition workforce which includes crs12 rdte personnel were mandated in the fy1998 defense authorizations pl 105 85 section 912 although there have been some laboratory consolidations via brac congress felt more could be done especially in regard to crossservicing ie colocating the services rdte activity or assigning lead responsibility to service in particular technology area section 277 of the national defense authorization act for fy1996 pl104106 required dod to develop fiveyear plan to be implemented between fy2001 and fy2005 that would consolidate and restructure its laboratories and centers further as much as is practical and possible the process by which dod intended to draw up this plan was called vision 21 vision 21 had made some progress in laying the groundwork for making further consolidations including the design of cost accounting system that would allow the cost of rdte to be compared across services however vision 21 efforts were later consumed by the quadrennial defense review process draft legislation related specifically to laboratory and test center consolidation was dropped in favor of general request for two more brac rounds relating to dods entire infrastructure congress has not been receptive to any more brac rounds in this larger context congress however continues to encourage the services to find ways to improve efficiencies and to find ways to account for costs that will allow comparison across services pl 105261 sec 906 integration with the commercial sector while dods science and technology program has produced wide range of sophisticated technologies in some technology areas it has not been able to keep pace with the level of technology development in the commercial sector prime example is microelectronics while the semiconductor and integrated circuits were developed with private funds dod and the space program provided an early market for the devices and pushed the subsequent development of those technologies by the 1970s however dods market share declined significantly and commercial demands pushed new developments soon commercial circuits outperformed circuits made for dod at the urging of congress part of the dods articulated st strategy has been to piggyback on the commercial sectors technology base efforts where it can it has sought to do this primarily by pursuing what it calls dualuse programs these programs seek to cooperatively develop technologies of mutual benefit to dod and the commercial sector in way that will accelerate their use by both dualuse programs differ from core dod rdte programs in that they are suppose to appeal more to commerciallyoriented firms or even firms that have not typically worked with dod in the past requiring costsharing with the private party or parties and contracts are drawn up independent of usual defense contracting regulations to make them more palatable to commerciallyoriented firms management of dualuse programs have undergone great deal of evolution since they were initiated currently each service manages its own dualuse science and technology program with oversight by the ddre crs13 other crs products crs report rl30002 defense budget primer by mary tyszkiewicz and stephen daggett crs report 95738 the
