classified information to the news media or others who are not entitled to receive it have renewed congresss interest with regard to the possible need for legislation to provide for criminal punishment for the leaks of classified information the espionage act of 1917 and other statutes and regulations provide web of authorities for the protection of various types of sensitive information but some have expressed concern that gaps in these laws may make prosecution of some disclosures impossible the 106 th congress passed measure to criminalize leaks but president clinton vetoed it the 108th congress reconsidered the same provision but instead passed requirement for the relevant agencies to review the need for such proscription the department of justice in turn reported that existing statutes and regulations are sufficient to prosecute disclosures of information that might harm the national security this report provides background with respect to previous legislative efforts to criminalize the unauthorized disclosure of classified information describes the current state of the laws that potentially apply including criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed

revelations involving alleged disclosure s of classified information to the news media or to others who are not entitled to receive it ve renewed congresss interest with regard to the possible need for legislation to provide for criminal punishment for the leaks of classified information opponents of any such legislation express concern regarding the possible consequences to freedom of the press and other first amendment values the current laws for protecting classified information have been criticized as patchwork of sometimes abstruse and antiquated provisions that are not consistent and do not cover all the information the government legitimately needs to protect 1 certain information is protected regardless of whether it belongs to the government or is subject to normal classification information related to the national defense is protected even though harm to the national security is intended or is likely to be caused through its disclosure however nonmilitary information with the potential to cause serious damage to the national security is only protected from willful disclosure with the requisite intent or knowledge regarding the potential harm for example under 50 usc 783 the communication of classified information by government employee is expressly punishable only if the discloser knows or has reason to believe the recipient is an agent or representative of foreign government but not for example if the recipient is an agent of an international terrorist organization to close some perceived gaps the 106 th congress passed measure to criminalize all leaks of classified information however president clinton vetoed the measure2 the 108th congress considered passing an identical provision as part of the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 20013 but instead directed the attorney general and heads of other departments to undertake review of the current protections against the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and to issue report recommending legislative or administrative actions by may 1 2002 4 in its response to congress the department of justice concluded that existing statutes and 1 see eeb and kem note plugging the leak the case for legislative resolution of the conflict between the demands of secr ecy and the need for open government 71 v l rev 801 811 1985 with respect to major component of the legal framework one district court judge had the following to say the conclusion that the statute is constitutionally permissible does not reflect judgment about whether congress could strike more appropriate balance between these competing interests or whether more carefully drawn statute could better serve both the national security and the value of public debate indeed the basic terms and structure of this statute have remained largely unchanged since the administration of william howa rd taft the intervening years have witnessed dramatic changes in the position of the united states in world affairs and the nature of threats to our national security the increasing importance of the united states in world affairs has caused significant increase in the size and complexity of the united states military and foreign policy establishments and in the importance of our nations foreign policy decision making finally in the nearly one hundred years since the passage of the defense secrets act mankind has made great technological advances affecting not only the nature and potential devastation of modern warfare but also the very nature of information and communication these changes should suggest to even the most casual observer that the time is ripe for congress to engage in thorough review and revision of these provisions to ensure that they reflect both these changes and contemporary views about the appropriate balance between our nations security and our citizens ability to engage in public debate about the united states conduct in the society of nations united states v rosen 445

might harm the national security5 this report describes the current state of the law with regard to the unauthorized disclosure of classified information including criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed on violators as well as some of the disciplinary actions and administrative procedures available to federal agencies with respect to their employees as such measures have been addressed by federal courts the report also describes the background of legislative efforts to amend the laws including the measure passed in 2000 and president clintons stated reasons for vetoing it finally the report considers possible constitutional issuesin particular issues related to the first amendment that may arise if congress considers new legislation to punish leaks or if the attorney general seeks to apply current law to punish newspapers that publish leaked classified information g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the classification by government agencies of documents deemed sensitive has evolved from series of executive orders 6 congress has for the most part let the executive branch make decisions regarding the type of information to be subject to protective measures the current criminal statutory framework providing penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of classified government materials traces its roots to the espionage act of 19177 which made it crime to disclose defense information during wartime8 the national security act of 19479 directed the director of the cia to protect intelligence sources and methods10 the atomic energy act of 195411 provided for secrecy of information related to nuclear energy and weapons12 the invention secrecy act of 195113 gave the government the authority to declare patent application secret if disclosure of an invention might expose the country to harm continued 4 see intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2002 pl 107108 310 2001 an identical measure was introduced in the 109th congress s 3774 but

subjected to civil penalty of up to 100000 for each violation of energy department regulations regarding dissemination of unclassified information about nuclear facilities 57 the government can also use injunctions to prevent disclosures of information the courts have generally upheld injunctions against former employees publishing information they learned through access to classified information58 the supreme court also upheld the state departments revocation of passports for overseas travel by persons planning to expose us covert intelligence agents despite the fact that the purpose was to di srupt us intelligence activities rather than to assist foreign government59 similarly the government can enjoin publication of inventions when it is determined that the release of such information is detrimental to the national security if an inventor files patent application for an invention that the commissioner of patents believes should not be made public the commissioner may place secrecy order on the patent and establish conditions for granting patent or may withhold grant of patent as long as the national interest requires it60 in addition to criminal penalties

from disclosing classified information most famously the government failed to enjoin publication of the pentagon papers by newspaper even though the information was clearly classified and had been stolen by someone with access to it62 in that case the supreme court set very high standards for imposing prior restraint on the press yet in another case the government was able to enjoin newspaper from printing information about the design of an atomic bomb even though the information did not originate from classified material and the authors purpose was not subversive 63

provisions that are not consistent and do not cover all the information the government legitimately needs to protect64 certain information is protected regardless of whether it belongs to the government or is subject to normal classification technical and scientific information for example can be restricted regardless of source65 information related to the national defense is protected even though harm to the national security is intended or is likely to be caused through its disclosure however nonmilitary information with the potential to cause serious damage to the national security is only protected from willful disclosure with the specific intent to harm the national interest66 or with the knowledge that such harm could occur67 in 2000 and again in 2002 congress sought to create 18 usc 798a subsection of which would have read whoever being an officer or employee of the united states former or retired officer or employee of the united states any other person with authorized access to classified information or any other person formerly with authorized access to classified information knowingly and willfully discloses or attempts to disclose any classified information acquired as result of such persons authorized access to classified information to person other than an officer or employee of the united states who is not authorized access to such classified information knowing that the person is not authorized access to such classified information shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than 3 years or both the new provision would have penalized the disclosure of any material designated as classified for any reason related to national security regard less of whether the violator intended that the 62 united states v new york

was thus classified as restricted data under the atomic energy act even though the information had been compiled from unclassified publicly available documents one reason for the different outcomes in

to 50 usc 783 it would have been the first law to penalize disclosure of information to entities other than foreign governments or their equivalent solely because it is classified without more specific definition of the type of information covered68 in short the provision would have made it crime to disclose or attempt to disclose classified information69 to any person who does not have authorized access to such information with excep tions covering disclosures to article iii courts or to the senate or house committees or members and for authorized disclosures to persons acting on behalf of foreign power including an international organization the provision would have amended the espionage laws in title 18 by expanding the scope of information they cover the proposed language was intended to make it easier for the government to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of classified information or leaks of information that might not amount to violation of current statutes the language was intended to ease the governments burden of proof in such cases by eliminating the need to prove that damage to the national security has or will result from the unauthorized disclosure 70 substituting requirement to show that the unauthorized disclosure was of information that is or has been properly classified under statute or executive order the 106th congress passed the measure71 but president clinton vetoed it calling it well intentioned as an effort to deal with legitimate concerns about the damage caused by unauthorized disclosures but badly flawed in that it was overbroad and posed risk of unnecessarily chilling legitimate activities that are at the heart of democracy 72 the president explained his view that desire to avoid the risk that their good faith choice of wordstheir exercise of judgmentcould become the subject of criminal referral for prosecution might discourage government officials from engaging even in appropriate public discussion press briefings or other legitimate official activities similarly the legislation may unduly restrain the ab ility of former government officials to teach write or engage in any activity aimed at building public understanding of complex issues incurring such risks is unnecessary and inappropriate in society built on freedom of expression and the consent of the governed and is particularly inadvisable in context in which the range of classified materials is so extensive in such circumstances this criminal provision would in my view create an undue chilling effect 73 68 18 uscs 1924 prohibits removal of governmentowned or controlled classified information by government employee without authorization 50 usc 783 covers onl information classified by the president or an executive agency transmitted by government employee to foreign government 18 usc 793 and 794 are potentially broader than these in that they cover information related to the national defense by government employees and others without regard to the identity of the recipient of the information but these require intent or knowledge regarding harm to the national defense 69 classified information was defined in the proposed measure to mean information or material designated and clearly marked or represented or that the person knows or has reason to believe has been determined by appropriate authorities pursuant to the

part of the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 200174 but instead directed the attorney general and heads of other departments to undertake review of the current protections against the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and to issue report recommending legislative or administrative actions75 an identical measure was introduced late in the 109th congress but was not reported out of committee76 the attorney general in his report to the 108th congress concluded that although there is single statute that provides criminal penalties for all types of unauthorized disclosures of classified information unauthorized disclosures of classified information fall within the scope of various current statutory criminal prohibitions it must be acknowledged that there is comprehensive statute that provides criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information irrespective of the type of information or recipient involved given the nature of unauth orized disclosures of classified information that have occurred however i conclude that current statutes provide legal basis to prosecute those who engage in unauthorized disclosures if they can be identified it may be that carefully drafted legislation specifically tailored to unauthorized disclosures of classified information generally rather than to espionage could enhance our investigative efforts the extent to which such provision would yield any practical additional benefits to the government in terms of improving our ability to identify those who engage in unauthorized disclosures of classified information or deterring such activity is unclear however 77 g5g152g151g156g157g146g157g158g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the publication of information pertaining to the national defense may serve the public interest by providing citizens with information necessary to shed light on the workings of government but some observe consensus that the public release of at least some defense information poses significant enough threat to the security of the nation that the public interest is better served by keeping it secret the constitution protects the public right to access government information and to express opinions regarding the functioning of the government among other things but it also charges the government with providing for the common defense policymakers are faced with the task of balancing these interests the first amendment to the us constitution provides congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press 78 despite this absolute language the supreme court has held that the government may regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest 79 74 the classified information protection act of 2001 hr 2943 107th cong 75 intelligence authorization act for

been accepted that the government has compelling need to suppress certain types of speech particularly during time of war or heightened risk of hostilities82 speech likely to incite immediate violence for example may be suppressed83 speech that would give military advantage to foreign enemy is also susceptible to government regulation84 where first amendment rights are implicated it is the governments burden to show that its interest is sufficiently compelling to just ify enforcement whether the government has compelling need to punish disclosures of classified information turns on whether the disclosure has the potential of causing damage to the national defense or foreign relations of the united states85 actual damage need not be proved but potential damage must be more than merely speculative and incidental86 g18g155g152g150g152g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g138g157g561g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g561 in addition to showing that the stated interest to be served by the statute is compelling the government must also show that the law actually serves that end if the accused can show that the statute serves an unrelated purposefor example to silence

negative information could challenge the statute by arguing that his prosecution is related to the negative content of his speech rather than to valid concerns about the damage it might cause if he can show that those who disclose sensitive information that tends to support the administrations position are not prosecuted while those who disclose truthful information that is useful to its opponents are prosecuted he might be able to persuade court that the statute as enforced is an unconstitutional restriction of speech based on impermissible contentrelated interests 88

government has compelling need to suppress 89 statute that reaches speech that the government has sufficiently compelling need to regulate may be subject to attack due to overbreadth law is overly broad if it prohibits more speech than is necessary to achieve its purpose if defendant can show that statute regulating speech is substantially overbroad he may challenge its validity on its face 90 if the law is found to be substantially overbroad court will invalidate the law even if the defendants co nduct falls within the ambit of conduct that the government may legitimately prohibit for this reason statute that relies solely on the executives classification of information to determine the need for its protection might be contested as overbroad 91 if challenger were able to show that agencies classify information that it is unnecessary to keep secret he could argue that the statute is invalid as overly broad because it punishes protected speech that poses danger to the national security although information properly classified in accord ance with statute or executive order carries by definition if disclosed to person not authorized to receive it the potential of causing at least identifiable harm to the national security of the united states 92 it does not necessarily follow that 88 cf rav v city of st paul 505 us 377 1992 but see snepp v united states 444 us 507

issue in the context of criminal trial government classification will likely serve as strong evidence to support the contention typically courts have been unwilling to review decisions of the executive related to national security or have made strong presumption that the material at issue is potentially damaging93 in the context of criminal trial especially in case with apparent first amendment implications courts may be more willing to engage in an evaluation of the propriety of classification decision than they would in case of citizens seeking access to information under the freedom of information act foia 94 the supreme court seems satisfied that national security is vital interest sufficient to justify some intrusion into activities that would otherwise be protected by the first amendmentat least with respect to federal employees although the court has not held that government classification of material is sufficient to show that its release is damaging to the national security 95 it has seemed to accept without much discussion the governments assertion that the material in question is damaging lower courts have interpreted 18 usc 798 which criminalizes the unauthorized release of specific kinds of classified information96 to have requirement that the government prove that the classification was proper or personally approved by the president97 it is unlikely that defendants bare assertion that information is unlikely to damage us national security will be persuasive without some convincing evidence to that effect or proof that the information is not closely guarded by the government 98 snepp v united states99 affirmed the governments ability to enforce contractual nondisclosure agreements against employees and former employees who had had access to classified information the supreme court allowed the government to impose constructive trust on the earnings from frank snepps book about the cia because he had failed to submit it to the cia for prepublication review as he had agreed to do by signing an employment agreement although the cia stipulated to the fact that the book contained classified information 100 the court accepted the finding that the book caused irreparable harm and loss to the american intelligence continued is able to identify or describe emphasis added 93 see eg haig v agee 453 us 280 291 1981 matters intimately related to foreign policy and national security are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention 94 5 usc 552b1 exempts classified information from release to requesters 95 see eg scarbeck v united states 317 f2d 546 dc cir 1962 holding government did not have to show documents were properly classified as affecting the national defense to convict employee under 50 usc 783 which prohibits government employees from transmitting classified documents to foreign agents or entities 96 18 usc 798 provides in pertinent part whoever knowingly and willfully communicates furnis hes

ability to revoke citizens passport because of his intent to disclose classified information philip agee was former cia agent who engaged in campaign to fight the united states cia which included publishing names of cia operatives around the world in order to put stop to this activity the department of state revoked his passport agee challenged that action as an impermissible burden on his freedom to travel and an effort to penalize his exercise of free speech to criticize the government 104 the supreme court disagreed finding the passport regulations constitutional because they may be applied only in cases involving likelihood of serious damage to national security or foreign policy 105 united states v morison106 is significant in that it represents the first case in which person was convicted for selling classified documents to the media morison argued that the espionage statutes did not apply to his conduct because he could not have had the requisite intent to commit espionage the fourth circuit rejected his appeal finding the intent to sell photographs that he clearly knew to be classified sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement under 18 usc 793 the definition of relating to the national defense was not overbroad because the jury had been instructed that the government had the burden of showing that the information was so related 107

prevent publication by prior restraint ie seeking temporary restraining order or an injunction from court to enjoin publication 108 the supreme court however is unlikely to uphold such an order it has written prior restraints are the most serious and least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights prior restraint by definition has an immediate and irreversible sanction if it can be said that threat of criminal or civil sanctions after publication chills speech prior restraint freezes it at least for the time the damage can be particularly great when the prior restraint falls upon the communication of news and commentary on current events 109 101 id at 512 102 id at 509 n3 moreover this courts cases make clear that even in the absence of an express agreement the cia could have

statute is unconstitutionally vague if it does not permit the ordinary person to determine with reasonable certainty whether his conduct is criminally punishable therefore statute prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of classified information must be sufficiently clear to allow reasonable person to know what conduct is prohibited where first amendment rights are implicated the concern that vague statute will have chilling effect on speech not intended to be covered may make that law particularly vulnerable to judicial invalidation 112 the espionage act of 1917113 has been challenged for vagueness without success there have been very few prosecutions under that act for disclosing information related to the national defense the following elements are necessary to prove an unauthorized disclosure offense under 18 usc 793 1 the information or material disclosed must be related to the national defense that is pertaining to any matters directly and reasonably connected with the defense of our nation against its enemies that would be potentially damaging to the united states or might be useful to an enemy of the united states and are closely held in that the relevant government agency has sought to keep them from the public generally and that these items have not been made public and are not available to the general public 114 2 the disclosure must be made with knowledge that such disclosure is not authorized 3 there must be an intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the united states or to the advantage of any foreign nation there does not appear to be requirement that the disclosure cause actual harm115 an evil motive is not necessary to satisfy the scienter requirement the willfulness prong is satisfied by the continued publication or broadcast of accounts of confessions or admissions made by the defendant at criminal trial 110 new york times co v united states 403 us 713 1971 111 see david topol note united states v

upheld portions of the espionage act now codified as sections 793 and 794 of title 18 us code communication of certain information to foreign entity against assertions of vagueness but only because jury instructions properly established the elements of the crimes including the scienter requirement and definition of national defense that includes potential damage in case of unauthorized release of protected information and materials gorin was classic case of espionage and there was challenge based on first amendment rights the court agreed with the government that the term national defense was not vague it was satisfied that it is generic concept of broad connotations referring to the military and naval establishments and the related activities of national preparedness 120 whether information was related to the national defense was question for the jury to decide121 based on its determination that the information may relate or pertain to the usefulness efficiency or availability of any of the above places instrumentalities or things for the defense of the united states of america the connection must not be strained one nor an arbitrary one the relationship must be reasonable and direct122 as long as the jury was properly instructed that information not likely to cause damage was not related to the national defense for the purpose of the statute the term was not unconstitutionally vague other challenge to conviction under the espionage act has advanced to the supreme court g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 under the present legal framework the publica tion of national security information by non government personnel may be prosecuted under various provisions but only if the information meets the definition set forth by statute and the disclosure is made with the requisite knowledge or intent with regard to the nature of the damage it could cause the first amendment limits congresss ability to prohibit the publication of information of value to the public especially with regard to prepublication injunctions against nongovernment employees that the publication of some information has the potential to damage us national security
