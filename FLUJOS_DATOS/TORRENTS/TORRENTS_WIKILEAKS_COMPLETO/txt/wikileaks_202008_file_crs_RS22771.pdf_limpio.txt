mail costs by matthew glassmanbudget for the entire legislative branch for fy200714 house official mail costs 142 million were 811 of the total whereas nate official mail costs 33 million were 189 of the total during fy2006 congress spent 343 million on official mail house official mail costs 307 million were 893 of the total wh ereas senate official mail costs 36 million were 107 of the total these expenditures continue historical pa ttern of congress spending less on official mail costs during nonelection years than durin g election years however analysis of monthly data on official mail costs indicates that due to the structure of the fiscal year calendar comparisons of electionyear and nonelectionyear mailing data tend to overstate the effect of preelection increases in mail costs because it also captures the effect of large spike in mail costs from december of the previous calendar year15 during the past 20 years franking reform efforts reduced franking expenditures in both evennumbered and oddnumbered ears evennumberedyear franking expenditures have been reduced by almost 70 from 1134 million in fy1988 to 343 million in f2006 while oddnumbere dyear franking expenditures

cally reduced its costs from 436 million in fy1984 to 33 million in fy2007 legislation in the 110th congress despite contemporary restrictions on mass mailings and overall reduced costs the frank continues to generate controversy opponents concer ned about incumbent electoral advantages and mail costs have called for additional fra nking restrictions including prohibitions on the use of the frank in election years bans on unsolicited mass mailings and free mailings for electoral challengers proponents of franking argue that the privilege serves an important informational role in democratic society and that without the privilege most members could not afford to send important information to their constituents five bills introduced in the 110th congress hr 1614 hr 2687 hr 2788
