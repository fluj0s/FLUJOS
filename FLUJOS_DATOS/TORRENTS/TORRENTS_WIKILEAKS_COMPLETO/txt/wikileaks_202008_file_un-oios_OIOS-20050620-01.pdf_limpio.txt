of internal oversight services internal audit division ii audit of the unodc country office afghanistan ae200536601 executive summary in january and february 2005 oios conducted an aud it of the united nations office on drugs and crime country office afghanistan coafg the audit covered activities with total expenditure of 98 million in 2003 and 2004 oios overall assessment is that the project financial and technical management and financial ma nagement at coafg needed improvement the coafg representative requested the auditors to provide concrete recommendations in the draft audit report and therefore the report includ ed more detailed recommendations than usual unodc accepted all the recommendations and is in th process of implementing them project management programme formulation there are inherent difficulties in the formulation of programme and projects in afghanistan unodc is not the lead agency in important areas of work and the country programme is donor driven which continued to have an impact on p rogramme portfolio formulation coafg lacked information on the activities of other parties such that it could not readily assess the effectiveness of the programme portfolio coafg commented that they had enhanced the implementation of project afgg71 that would provide monitoring mechanism on what other parties are doing strategic programme framework had not been develo ped the representative informed oios that the framework was being developed staffing the need for programme manager to guide and supe rvise project coordinators was evident as of december 2004 the representative nd deputy representative were the only regular unodc staff in coafg that managed eleven dr ug control and three criminal justice reform projects with total budget of some 25 mil lion coafg agreed in principle to engage programme manager and an administrative an d finance officer but their engagements are subject to the availability of fund s oios underlines that the cost to engage them is immaterial compared to the total amount spe nt in the operation in afghanistan financial accountability over these funds needs to be strengthened project planning and implementation weak financial planning resulted in slow implementa tion of planned activities in some projects whereas in other projects activities tha t could have been performed were not planned mainly because of lack of regular review f project activities and financial implementation coafg stated that they had started to share financi information with the project managers to provide them the opportunity to verify charges against their projects and to enable them to develop and adjust their proj ect plans based on the actual financial position of the projects project records and expenditures record keeping in projects was not standardised and it was difficult to relate expenditures incurred with the technical implementation the re corded financial implementation rate was not reliable as administrative and general office xpenditures were charged to projects in the absence of chargeout policy or standard allo cation of the charges to the projects financial information was distorted coafg replied that chargeout policy had since be developed and an electronic system had been set up to enable easy access to information from centralised database the process of standardising files in accordance wi th hqs recent instructions on project document format and field office quarterly reports had been started operational advances were given to project staff wi thout system in place to track outstanding advances in project afgf98 advances of some 150000 given during period of six months were cleared in one voucher u nodc should request undp to record the advances against the staff members who receive the advances and clear the advances as and when the clearance vouchers are presented project procurement unops procured nonexpendable equipment totalling 3 million and immediately transferred them to government counterparts without any procedure or arrangement to ensure that assets are used for the intended purposes coafg agreed to include right of use clause in future projects that would allow projects to monitor the use of the assets until their formal transfer to the government counterparts pre ferably at the end of project administration the lack of basic systems procedures and internal controls in financial administration weakened accountability undp issued cheques of bstantial amounts to staff members in coafgs finance section and not in the name of cred itorspayees coafg had changed this practice and now issues cheques in the name of creditors wherever possible there was evidence that proper selection of cons ultants was made coafg did not complete performance evaluation of some consultants consultant who was former intern did not complete the final report but was p aid 10000 another consultant was paid 39500 for strategic programme framework that had not been completed as oios recommended coafg improved the selection process f consultants through competitive bidding and obtained the required reports june 2005 table of contents chapter

acknowledgement 56 57 i introduction 1 from 30 january to 16 february 2005 oios conducted an audit of the united nations office on drugs and crime country office afghanist an coafg the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 based on the 2004 opium survey the area unde r opium poppy cultivation in afghanistan increased from about 80000 hectares in 2003 to record level of 131000 hectares in 2004 afghanistan provides about seven ty per cent of the global illicit opium production the objective of the coafg programme i s to contribute in the longterm to sustainable reduction and eventual elimination of i llicit drug production trafficking and drug abuse in the country its criminal justice reform projects focused on capacity building of the penitentiary and juvenile justice systems 3 oversight review was previously conducted either by oios or the board of auditors 4 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed during the exit conference held on 16 february 2005 with the representative draft of this audit report was shared with the director division for perations unodc on 22 april 2005 whose comments which were received in may 2005 hav been reflected in the report in italics unodc has accepted all of the recommendations made in the draft report and progressed well to implement them ii audit objectives 5 the main objectives of the audit were to determine whether projects are properly formulated planned implemented and evaluated and whether project resources are use d effectively and economically determine the effectiveness of internal controls to ensure reliable recording and reporting of transactions safeguarding the ass ets and compliance with relevant unodc and undp regulations and rules evaluate the system for reimbursement of costs for services locally provided by undp coafg iii audit scope and methology 6 the audit covered 2003 and 2004 expenditures totaling 98 million incurred in the following drug control and criminal justice reform programme projects 2 drug programme afgf55 drug demand reduction in refugee camps in baluchis tan pakistan with expenditures totalling 125000 in 2003 and 73000 in 2004 allocation of 203000 afgf98 monitoring of opium production with expenditures t otalling 544000 in 2003 and 947000 in 2004

expenditures of s ome 380000 incurred in 2003 and 2004 and the general administration at coafg were also udited 8 oios reviewed project documents and other rec ords related to operational and financial management held discussions with coafg staff and ssessed the adequacy of internal control systems iv audit findings and recommendations project formulation and staffing programme formulation 9 the programme portfolio covered three themati c areas that of counter narcotics enforcement prevention treatment and rehabilitati on and sustainable livelihood justice reform projects focused on reform and capacity buil ding of the penitentiary and juvenile justice systems 3 10 it is not known to what extent the programme portfolio of coafg adequately addresses the drug problem in afghanistan there has been external evaluation of the programme but the chief of the partnership in development bra nch of the division for operations carried out management review of coafg in august 2004 ccording to his report the afghan drug control and counter narcotics objective is not addressed in comprehensive and coordinated approach to the contrary related act ivities are implemented in fragmented approach the report also showed nonimplementati on of key activities in the afghan national drug control strategy 11 the programme was donor driven and unodc is not the lead agency in counter narcotics which made it difficult to develop coor dinated project portfolio without substantive information on what the other role play ers and donors are doing especially in the area of alternative livelihoods under project afg g71 started in 2003 coafg developed database for this purpose but had made little progr ess at the date of the audit the database was yet to be piloted coafg was aware of this fact and enhanced the imple mentation of the project at the end of 2004 12 an important development was the establishme nt of the counter narcotics ministry cnm towards the end of 2004 its implementation plan for 2005 to tackle the cultivation production and trafficking of drugs that was still to be considered in unodcs project portfolio coafg commented that they were in the process of developing strategic programme framework for the operation that might re sult in revised programme portfolio lack of data in important areas of work especially in counter narcotics and justice reform still persisted and certain donor requirements cont inued to have an impact on the programme portfolio all of these complexities would be take n into account in formulating the strategic programme framework need for project manager 13 the representative and deputy representative were the only regular unodc staff in coafg that managed eleven drug control and three cr iminal justice reform projects as of december 2004 with total budget of 25 million rather large portfolio to manage without programme manager project coordinators were eng aged under unops contracts but they had prior unodc experience and had limited knowl edge of unodcs policies practices and procedures also the high turnover in project staff resulted in lack of continuity in some projects overall the required level of supervisi on could not be provided and the need for programme manager was evident recommendation head2right unodc division for operations should consider engag ing programme manager to manage the rather large progra mme portfolio in afghanistan with total budget of 25 million to strengthen the overall project management provide guidance to other project staff and enhance compliance to odcs policies practices and procedures rec 01 14 unodc accepted the recommendation and stated that t he unodc division for operations supports the allocation of an additional post at the p3 level to coafg so that programme management and in particular financial mo nitoring can be improved in accordance with the other recommendations contained in oios draft report unodc 4 further said that this is also in line with the rec ommendation made by the chief of the partnership in development branch mission report f august 2004 which was reinforced by the chief fund budget unit of the financial resour ces management service after mission conducted in march 2005 this would be subject to the availability of postresources 15 oios understands that the appointment of p rogramme manager is subject to the availability of funding however considering the importance of sound project management in large operation such as afghanistan and cons idering the limited cost in relation to the programme funds at stake oios views the recommenda tion as critical the recommendation can only be closed once the programme manager is gaged b project planning and implementation 16 project documents were completed but some p roject documents were outdated in respect of activities to be carried out their tim ing financial requirements and the cost element of workplans did not tie in with the projec t budgets mainly because of weak planning and monitoring inadequate financial planning led to slow project implementation or failure to carry out activities that could have been perfor med within the available resources certain projects did not achieve its objectives due to lack of staff 17 in counter narcotics it was evident from discussions with project staf f in projects afgg24 afgg38 and h10 that capacity at the drug coordinating body the counter narcotics department now cnm and the drug law enf orcement arm the counter narcotics police cnp remained weak coafg was not the lead agency in this thematic area and it was not known how the activities were coordinated w ith the other role players to achieve the overall objective of providing capacity in counter narcotics to provide coordination mechanism and avoid gaps and duplication under pro ject afgg71 started in 2003 coafg developed database of activities of various playe rs however there had been little progress mainly due to lack of staff although the project b udget provided for two staff it was not until late 2004 that staff were hired moreover consu ltant engaged at an earlier stage did not work on the project but the cost of his consultanc for two months and travel charges to kabul were charged to the project coafg commented that they had already enhanced the implementation of afgg71 18 projects focused on material assistance and training unops procured nonexpendable equipment costing 3 million for counter narcotics projects of which the ownership was transferred to the government counterparts upon rec eipt the completeness of the hand over agreements could not be confirmed and the extent to which the equipment was utilized could not be determined assistance provided by other ro players was also not known as to training it was limited to courses for drivers and computer and language training although coafg averred that other role players also provided training in project afgg38 coafg entered into construction contracts to renovate pre mises for the investigation unit of cnp at cost of 99000 however construction work that s tarted in april 2004 at four of the seven premises was still to be completed in kabul some 50 per cent of the construction costs incurred was only for the construction of parking area coafg was following up on the construction work 19 in the thematic area of sustainable livelihood the aga khan foundation foundation was engaged under project afgh56 to s upport alternative livelihood development activities in badakhshan up to the end of 2004 but its implementation was not 5 properly monitored and expenditures were not verifi ed of the 815000 total budget disbursements of 464000 or only 57 per cent was r eported at the end of 2004 although the agreement provides for an audit that still remained to be arranged coafg should properly monitor the financial and technical implementation of the project even though the installments are directly paid from unodc headquart ers in vienna the project included budget for monitoring by unodc but it was used for overhead costs and not for monitoring 20 to improve project monitoring oios recommend ed monitoring plan that includes the verification of expenditures coafg maintains regular contacts with the foundatio n especially in view of the developments in badakhsha n province and the attack against the foundation which led to the temporary closure of t heir office these will affect the implementation of project activities meeting wa s held in march 2005 between the foundation and the unodc chief fund budget unit t finalize the 2004 yearend financial report for project afgh56 monitoring plan to r eview and assess the implementation status of the project activities was developed and shared with the foundation the plan was shared with oios the first mission planned in may 2005 was cancelled due to riots and unrest in the province under the circumstances oios finds the monitoring plan to be adequate to consider this recommendation as impleme nted 21 oios also recommended that the foundation sh ould arrange an external audit of the project as per the agreement coafg stated that during the meeting with the found ation in march 2005 the unodc chief fund budget unit reque sted the foundation to submit an audit report in may 2005 the foundation submitte d an external audit report on the consolidated accounts of the foundations operation s in kabul as indicated in the monitoring plan full project audit is planned up on completion of the project activities final terminal evaluation report is also planned fo r august 2005 oios finds these arrangements as adequate 22 under prevention and rehabilitation coafg project afgh09 started in june 2003 for period of two years aimed to mainstream drug demand reduction activities of role players however the implementation rate was only 36 per cent based on total expenditure of 515000 of the total project budget of 14 mil lion demand reduction teams were established in 2004 to provide demand reduction p rogramme in provincial centers and coafg had continued with the assistance but the ac tivities to be carried out had not been clearly planned andor budgeted with an original llocation for 2005 of 155000 it was estimated that 670000 or 48 per cent of the origi nal project budget should be spent at the end of the implementation period foreseen to be in september 2005 23 furthermore the project document was outdat ed and future budgetary requirements apart from the initial 155000 allocation for 2005 was still to be determined and documented project resources were not utilised to the maximum extent possible although some fruitless expenditures were incurred for exa mple in 2003 the project spent 35000 on demand reduction resource materials but more th an half of the items had not been distributed also greater consideration could hav been given to engage ngos in this thematic area there are numerous ngos in afghanis tan but the project only engaged two ngos for the total amount of 13000 in 2004 recommendation head2right unodc country office afghanistan should review th 6 project document of project afgh09 to increase act ivity then revise the project budget accordingly and prep are workplans that tie in with the budget rec 02 24 unodc accepted the recommendation and stated that p roject afgh09 would be reviewed to reflect the latest developments on drug demand reduction in the country project coordinator had been engaged in the project and his inputs would be reflected in the review thereafter the project revision and the re lated budget revision would be submitted to hqs for ppc approval oios will record the recommendation as implemented upon receipt of the revised and approved project document budge t and workplans 25 oios also recommended increasing the engagem ent of ngos unodc replied that increasing the involvement of ngos is in line wit h the ongoing afgh09 activities to develop the drat teams at provincial level more ng will be engaged in project implementation especially in the extension of unod cs drug demand reduction activities to other provinces as of may 2005 three ngos wer recruited in kabul one in mazare sharif and one in herat the engagements of two mo re ngos are planned for jalalabad in june 2005 and one each in badaghshan and kandahar i n july 2005 oios considers coafgs actions to increase the engagement of ngos as adequate 26 project f98s opium survey 2004 achieved its objectives and oios found the project to be well managed with the exception of one case f noncompliance to undp rules coafg engaged the european space imaging eusi at cost of 287000 in 2004 without the approval of the advisory committee on procureme nt as required under undp procurement rules coafg received its first invoic from eusi in april 2004 but the retroactive waiver not to engage in bidding was nly granted by the committee in august 2004 oios requested coafg to comply with undps p rocurement rules and ensure that approvals or bid waivers are obtained prior to ente ring into any commitment recommendation head2right unodc country office afghanistan should not allow project managers to conduct procurement or place or ders without approval from coafgs management representative or her designated officer rec 03 27 unodc accepted the recommendation the case required waiver for the exemption of bidding but initially did not comply with undp procurement procedures the project manager started to place orders for satellite image ries on 23 march 2004 without consulting the country office management and the finance secti on and without submitting the waiver request to undp the project manager received the first invoice dated april 2004 the finance section did not process the invoice and inf ormed the project manager to comply with undp procurement rules retroactive case for approval of the waiver was submitted to undp in june 2004 and was approved on 20 august 2004 by the undp new york advisory committee on procurement 28 although this may be an isolated case oios views this as an example of the risk attached to allowing project staff to conduct procu rement without system in place to ensure that proper procurement procedures are followed i obtaining of the necessary approvals considering the risks attached to this weakness in the procurement function coafg should make it policy not to allow project managers to c onduct procurement or place orders 7 without the prior approval of coafgs management ios will record the recommendation as implemented when it receives copy of the polic that will require the approval of the representative or her designated officer for the pl acement of orders c project financial management 29 the main shortcoming at coafg was the lack f financial management during project implementation project coordinators did not monit or the financial implementation of their projects the finance section was responsible for recording transactions maintaining the profi system and monitoring financial implementatio n but the information was not adequately shared with the projects project coord inators could therefore not properly plan their activities and could not provide adequate exp lanations for the charges to their projects therefore oios recommended that the coafg finance section provide details of expenditures to the respective project coordinators 30 coafg stated that since april 2005 monthly expendi ture reports are submitted to project coordinators these reports highlight the f unding status funding allocation and expenditures incurred and include the immediate ste ps to be taken under each project copies were provided to oios and the recommendation has been implemented 31 the coafg finance section allocated overhead and administrative costs to projects without clearance from projects and there was llocation policy in place according to which overhead and administrative expenditures shou ld be charged to the projects charges included salaries of administrative staff rental c osts and general office expenses that were substantial for some projects but there was little correlation between the cost incurred and the project charged the charges also differed from pe riod to period this distorted financial information and therefore the financial implementa tion rate achieved in the projects was not reliable indicator to determine whether projects ma adequate progress to achieve objectives oios recommended that coafg establish chargeout policy coafg replied that the unodc chief fund budget unit had determined cost sharing policy for administrative expenditures and overhead costs that was shared wit h project coordinators 32 furthermore operational and travel advances were directly charged to projects without system in place to track the advances that would ensure clearance and that the same project and budget line was debited or credited with the am ount paid or due for instance advances of some 150000 were given to two staff members du ring the opium survey 2004 within the period of january to september 2004 to cover c osts of the survey the total amount was only cleared in november 2004 and although many cat egories of expenditures were included in this charge it was merely charged to the travel budget line recommendation head2right unodc country office afghanistan should request u ndp to record advances against the name of the staff mber of unodc and charge the respective projects as and whe n the clearance vouchers are received and processed rec 04 33 unodc agreed with the recommendation coafg stated that in october 2004 they started to monitor advances through centralised spr eadsheets the maintenance of the spreadsheets and electronic monitoring were introdu ced following the repeated late settlement of advances under project afgf98 samples of reminders sent to staff members 8 to clear advances were provided to oios but not copy of the spreadsheet indicating the advances also considering the large amounts and number of advances the spreadsheet as standalone recording system for advances is not ad equate to ensure the completeness and accuracy of recording the advances and neither to c ompletely and adequately track and clear advances this can only be achieved if the system is linked or made part of the accounting system therefore undp should record the advances to staff members and clear them as oios had recommended coafg should still keep the spreadsheet system to continue following up on the settlement status of the advanc oios will record the recommendation as implemented when it receives copy of the reque st to undp to record advances against the name of the staff member of unodc and to charge the respective projects only as and when the clearance vouchers are received and proces sed d project records 34 projects lacked proper filing system and in general the projects did not maintain project records in standardized manner especiall in respect of procurement construction and renovation costs and payments to implementing gencies payment vouchers were available but without project records of needs ass essments deliveries progress reports financial and narrative reports it was difficult t verify that payments were made for actual deliveries and performance 35 unodc accepted oios recommendation to intro duce proper filing system and standardise the contents of the files an electronic filing system was setup in april 200 5 to enable the sharing of information and to enable eas access to information from centralized database but coafg is still in the process of stan dardising files in accordance with hqs instructions on field office quarterly reports dec ember 2004 and on project document format april 2005 oios considers the introduction of the electroni c filing system as adequate progress to regard the recommendation as i mplemented and encourages coafg to comply with the hqs instructions as early as possib procurement in projects 36 unops procured nonexpendable equipment tota ling more than 3 million for coafg proper procurement procedures were followed by unops but the transfers from unops to unodc and then to government counterparts were not properly recorded in the absence of proper procurement files and the handin g over certificates at coafg oios could not confirm the completeness of the transfers 37 oios recommended that coafg introduce procur ement registers for projects and ensure that handing over certificates are filed i n manner that the completeness of transfers to government counterparts can be confirmed coafg introduced standardized electronic procurement register including standardized form attext for handover forms to government authorities sample copies of the electronic registration and h andover forms were submitted to oios 38 nonexpendable equipment were handed over im mediately upon receipt such that unodc longer had ownership and therefore did not monitor if government counterparts in fact use them for the purposes intended this p ractice should be reviewed and instead 9 coafg should consider the use of right of use ag reement that would strengthen accountability over the use of the nonexpendable quipment in the case of the latter agreement unodc would keep ownership of the nonex pendable equipment and its project staff would then be able to monitor their use and p eriodically verify their existence including proper maintenance thereof the eventual transfer to the government counterparts is still possible but preferably at the end of project recommendation head2right unodc country office afghanistan should prior to future purchases consider revising the project documents to include right of use clause that would strengthen acco untability over the use of nonexpendable equipment by governm ent counterparts the project staff should then period ically monitor their use and verify their condition rec 05 39 coafg accepted the recommendation with the provis that changes should be made on currently ongoing projects where the agreed conditions have to be followed any future projects for afghanistan will include the r ight of use clause whenever the government can agree relevant procurement files an d inventory will be maintained by coafg this clause will also determine the handove r arrangement at the end of the project and the handover will follow the proper procedures 40 oios is of the opinion that considering the fact that projects are for multiple years the arrangements regarding nonexpendable equipment pur chases with the government counterparts should be applied for future purchases even for current projects however where the government counterparts were already info rmed of the equipment ordered the agreed upon arrangements should be followed but f or future purchases in the current projects the project documents need to be changed to include the right of use clause and the handover arrangements oios will record the recom mendation as implemented when it receives samples of revised project documents to ev idence the right of use clause over the use of nonexpendable equipment by government count erparts f administration and finance financial administration 41 until may 2004 unodc submitted its payment requests with the vouchers as supporting documentation to undp for approval and p ayment the practice was stopped and only the payment requests were forwarded to undp fo r payment without them reviewing the vouchers or approving the payment this weakened i nternal controls but more importantly resulted in payments where the supporting documenta tions were not adequate to support the payments furthermore the fact that project coord inators were not involved in the financial management of their projects had an effect on the verall financial accountability of coafg 42 there was lack of basic systems and intern controls to ensure compliance with unodc rules and procedures that hampered accountabi lity the names of the project controllers were entered in the column on the payme nt vouchers cleared by although they did not clear many of the charges circumventing th is important internal control feature 10 43 coafg should not have taken over the approvi ng responsibility until its finance section staff were fully competent in preparing and reviewing vouchers acquired the necessary knowledge of unodc and undp policies and procedures and were acquainted with the profi accounting system there were numer ous reversals of previous charges either because of incorrect allocations or administrative costs that were previously charged contributing to the problem was the fact that the dministrative budget project 112 was inadequate to cover overhead and administrative cos ts that should have been charged to projects recommendation head2right unodc country office afghanistan should consider to either engage an administrative and finance officer or avail of the services of undps finance unit to introduce andor strengthen accounting and related internal control procedures ie clearance review approval and recording proc edures to enhance the overall accountability in respect of tr ansactions incurred rec 06 44 coafg accepted the recommendation to engage an admi nistrative and finance officer subject to the availability of funds for ch position oios reiterates its position the cost to engage an administrative and finance of ficer is immaterial compared to the total amount spent in the operation in afghanistan is sidered financial accountability over these funds needs to be strengthened in the inter im coafg should request undps finance unit to introduce procedures that will stre ngthen the overall accountability at coafg 45 undp issued cheques in the name of staff mem bers in the finance section and not in the name of the creditorspayee in most cases si nce the recipients then signed randomly on the payment voucher it was difficult to substantia if the cash was actually paid to the creditor coafg accepted oios recommendation tha t coafg issue cheques in the name of the creditor and not in the name of staff member s since october 2004 cheques are only issued in the name of staff members for subsequent release of funds to beneficiaries when direct payments to creditors are not possible due t distance and difficulties to travel around the country eg payment of monthly salary to nati onal surveyors assigned in provinces under afgf98 and afgi38 projects 46 oios understands that there will be cases in which the cheques have to be issued to and cashed by staff members in such cases the transa ction should be recorded as an advance

the perio d 29 may to 6 june 2004 the advance was only cleared on 31 july 2004 with operational c ost totaling 23000 that did not relate to the mission although undp charged 8 per issuance of cheque and therefore issued only one payment voucher for multiple transactions thus reducing total charges accountability was sacrificed oios suggested that better solution would have been to increase the level of the operational fund which was 5000 coafg replied that the operational fund was increas ed from 5000 to 8000 in february 2005 travel 49 travel file was not maintained and travel authorizations were not used instead travellers travelled on the basis of travel request s travel advances were in some cases not provided to staff and if provided were not obligat ed there were also

evident that proper selection process was followed our assessment was based on the lack of the required documentation such as curriculum vitaes advertisements personnel action authorizations and justification for remuneration rates at completion of consultancies some consultants did not complete final reports and coafg did not complete evaluation and p erformance reports 53 furthermore there were discrepancies in rem unerations rates an internresearch officer was engaged for the period 15 february to 3 0 april 2004 and paid stipend of 750 12 per month after completion the officer was
