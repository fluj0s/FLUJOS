funding from the henry m jackson foundation conducted workshop to assess the lessons and options for us policy stemming from the us experience with taiwan under the taiwan relations act tra over the

they centered on us governmentsupported interactions with taiwan us government approach to dealing with cross strait relations and other aspects of prctaiwan relations and unofficial including so called track ii us efforts to deal with taiwanmainland frictions participants agreed that the tra had been essential in insuring continued us support for taiwan after the break in relations in 1979 that us policy was seen to work best during those relatively infrequent occasions when us policy makers in the administration and congress agreed generally on us policy priorities that took careful account of important us interests visavis taiwan as well as key us concerns in relations with the prc and that the important us stake in cross strait relati ons was best secured through carefully balanced approach that maintained an equilibrium of confidence in both taipei and beijing looking to the future participants favored policy options that relied on the existing language of the tra to foster less constrained us interaction with taiwan while taking careful account of prc interests and domestic politics challenges for us policy included avoiding exaggerated views of alleged splitist trends in taiwan domestic politics and bridging the often deep divides between the us administration and congress over appropriate policy toward taiwan and cross strait issues to accomplish the latter would require more forthcoming administration posture toward interaction with congress over policy toward taiwan and restraint on perceived congressional tendencies to play politics with taiwan issues according to workshop participants while encouraging cross strait economic exchanges dialogues and other measures to build trust and reduce tensions participants said the united states should eschew any mediating role and remain strongly engaged in the region to back up its objective that any solution to the issue is peaceful and acceptable by both sides including the people of taiwan there was notable disagreement over whether continued active us military support for taiwan should include theater missile defense tmd equipment and technology and also some disagreement as to how far the united states should go in supporting taiwans role in international organizations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100contents introduction 1 congressionalexecutive interaction over taiwan since the 1970s 2

break in official ustaiwan relations as result of us normalization of relations with the peoples republic of china prc congress played very important role in writing the act in insuring its careful

since the 1970s us relations with taiwan since the 1970s and the passage of the taiwan relations act have been successful in many respects but have more often than not been mired in controversy especially between the executive branch and the congress over the past year for example there has been controversy over whether or not to provide us theater missile defense tmd technology or equipment to taiwan in the face of buildup of prc ballistic missiles opposite taiwan and whether to support taiwans entry into international organizations like the world trade organization wto the world bank the imf or the world health organization in general congressional advocates have been inclined to push for greater support for taiwan in these areas while the administration has been more reticent notably concerned about possible adverse reaction from the prc government in beijing1 most notably there was very strong congressional reaction to president clintons public affirmation on june 30 1998 of the socalle d three regarding us policy toward taiwan during roundtable discussion in shanghai following his summit meeting with chinese leaders in beijing president clinton said that we dont support independence for taiwan or two chinas or one taiwanone china and we dont believe that taiwan should be member in any organization for which statehood is requirement2 this marked the first time us president had publicly affirmed the three though clinton administration officials have been saying them publicly and in private conversations with chinese leaders publicized by chinese media since at least 1996 earlier us statements including some made privately by senior administration officials to chinese counterparts going back as far as 1971 provide basis for the current three according to clinton administration officials in particular the administration maintains that the three are consistent with the one china affirmations contained in the communiques of 1972 1979 and 1982 that provide the framework for usprc relations3 those communiques reflect agreements between the us and prc in which the us broke off us official ties with taiwan acknowledged the position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china recognized the prc as the government of china and agreed to limit us arms sales to taiwan provided beijing pursues peaceful approach toward the

301 in crs issue brief 98034 6 see among others conventional arms transfers to developing countries by richard grimmett crs report 97778supporters of the administrations policy in the congress and elsewhere have argued that the presidents statement is balanced by the strong show of us force in support of taiwan seen when the united states in early 1996 deployed two us aircraft carrier battle groups to the taiwan area in the face of provocative prc military exercises there they have judged that the statement of the three does minimal damage to taiwans interests that are consistent with us interests arguing notably that taiwan declaration of independence at this time would likely provoke prc military attack that in their view is not in the interests of the united states4 critics in congress the media and elsewhere have asserted that the administration has appeared to be buckling in the face of prc pressure sacrificing taiwan interests and us interests in relations with taiwan for the sake of assuring smoother us relationship with beijing in particular the critics have underlined taiwan government claims that the three appear to go beyond us commitment s in the three usprc communiques in order to restrict taiwan government efforts to seek greater role in world affairs as government separate from the prc some have charged that repeating the three aligns us policy closer to the one country two systems formula beijing has used to govern its takeover of hong kong and its proposed takeover of taiwan others have been suspicious that the president made this statement as gesture to the chinese leadership to insure that his nine day trip to china was without acrimony and that the united states gained little in return in concrete terms for the statement some also have been sympath etic with nongovernment advocates of self determination in taiwan who charge that the three effectively curb the right of the people of taiwan to decide whether or not they want to be independent of china5 us interests in taiwan of concern to these observers include active trade and investment taiwan is one of the top ten us trading partners and each year buys notably more us exports than the prc substantial us investment in taiwan is reciprocated by large taiwan investment in the united states taiwans free market economic system and vibrant political democracy enjoy broad

included major debate in the congress during the late 1970s over the pros and cons of the administ ration breaking all official us ties with taiwan for the sake of establishing normal diplomatic relations with beijing sharp and bipartisan congressional criticism of the carter administrations handling of the normalization with beijing in 1978 and 1979 leading notably to total congressional rewrite of the draft legislation proposed by the administration that ultimately became law as the taiwan relations act in april 1979 and controversy surrounding the reagan administrations decision to sign the august 1982 communique with the prc which restricted us arms sales to taiwan so long as beijing followed peace ful policy toward the territory the end of the cold war and the 1989 tiananmen crackdown in china coincided with taiwans rise as newly emerging democracy with vibrant free market economy prompting some calls in the congress the media and elsewhere for the administration to upgrade us relations with taiwan despite strong prc opposition congress was almost unanimous in 1995 in urging president clinton to reverse administration policy and allow taiwans president lee tenghui to make private visit to cornell university his alma mater president clinton acceded in may 1995 the visit took place in june 1995 beijing reacted strongly and with repeated shows of force in the taiwan strait from july 1995 to march 1996 after several months of prc military demonstrations in the strait the clinton administr ation with strong congressional support deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area the potentially dangerous faceoff of us and prc forces ended quietly but was widely seen to have added incentive to ongoing private clinton administration efforts to reassure chinese leaders of us intentions while building an administration policy of us constructive engagement with china statements by clinton administration officials affirming the three regarding us policy toward taiwan were meant to reassure the prc over american intentions and thereby open the way to smoother us relations with mainland chinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs5 9 those instances have included the cases of the taiwan relations act the lee tenghui visit and others noted above as well as recent congressional resolutions passed almost unanimously by the congress

and the administration over the three missile defense for taiwan taiwan representation in international organizations and other issues mirrors past episodes of legislativeexecutive friction over policy toward taiwan as in the past the administrations priority appears recently to have focused on managing the us relationship with taiwan in ways that would not unduly complicate or upset the important us relationship with the prc on the mainland from the perspective of congressional critics this approach at times including in recent years has prompted the administration to go too far in accommodating the prc by cutting back restrictin g or otherwise defining us interaction with taiwan in ways favored by beijing more receptive to the entreaties of taiwan representatives and their supporters in the united states and sensitive to the many tangible us benefits derived from relations with taiwan congress has repeatedly taken steps at many junctures over the past decades to adjust us policies in ways more supportive of taiwan interests and less favorable to beijing9 many observers believ and scholars report that from the administrations perspective congress can afford to lean in this direction which complicates and sometimes endangers the relationship with beijing because it does not bear primary responsibility for managing us foreign policy10 at times administration officials see congressional actions in support of taiwan as illadvised in turn many congressional observers for their part sometimes see administration officers as being so anxious to preserve smooth relationship with beijing that they are prepared to make unwarranted sacrifices of us interests in relations with taiwan prctaiwan rivalry an underlying fact that defines the frequent legislative executive debate over us policy toward taiwan is the ongoing rivalry between beijing and taipei although the rivalry waxes and wanes leaders in both capitals see their competition especially for international support largely in zerosum terms thus gain for one side in international support is seen as loss for the other both sides agree that by far the most important arena for their competition for international support is washington dc for taiwan us support in arms sales statements of strategic concern political backing and other ways is criticaltaiwan would not survive as separate entity

political calculus as leverage to persuade pressure or coerce the us government to curb its support for taiwan and thereby help smooth the way toward prc efforts to reunify taiwan with the mainlanda top goal of prc leaders us policy ambiguity the us policy debate also is grounded in prevailing us policy ambiguity about relations with taiwan on the one hand us governments in the process of establishing and improving relations with beijing have issued three communiques and other statements eg the three that often appear supportive of the prc position on the taiwan issue the communiques reflect agreements between the two countries in which the us broke off official ties with taiwan acknowledged the position that there is but one china and taiwan is part of china recognized the prc as the government of china and agreed to limit us arms sales to taiwan provided beijing pursues peaceful approach toward the island administration public statements in recent years explicitly rule out us support for an independent taiwan or taiwans membership in the or other such international organizations where statehood is requirement these two issues were not of primary importance in the 1970s and most of the 1980s when the authoritarian taiwan government was ruled by chiang kaishek and his chiang chingkuo they strongly supported the concept of one china argued that their governmentthe republic of china based in taipeiwas the sole legitimate governmen t of china strongly opposed taiwan independence and largely eschewed taiwans participation in international organizations where beijing was member since democracy took hold in taiwan in the late 1980s the administration of lee tenghui has responded to popular pressure in taiwan by softpedaling past commit ments to reunify one china it has asserted taiwans international legitimacy as one of two legitimate governments in china and sought greater international recognition through membership in international organizations and highlevel contacts with governments that already have relations with beijing11 against this background us leaders have repeatedly taken positions and policy actions designed to shore up important us relationships with taiwan12 the taiwan relations act is replete with expressions of us concern with taiwans security and determination to continue to provide arms to the island government the reagan administration endeavored to balance its signing of the 1982 communique restricting us arms to taiwan with six pledges to taiwan leaders including assurances that the united states would not set date to stop arms sales to taiwan would not amend the taiwan relations act and would not negotiate with beijing over arms sales to taiwan the bush administ ration resumed cabinetlevel contacts with taiwan in 1992 and also agreed to 5 billion transfer of 150 f16 fighters despite existing restrictions stemming from the 1982 communique the clinton administration released in 1994 the results of taiwan policy review that called for modest upgrading of us interchange with taiwan taiwan media also have reported on five supposedly secret meetings held in the past few years between taiwans

cohen met with taiwans military chief of staff in washington in october 1998 meanwhile there are persisting reports of us administration interest in the sale of ballistic missile defense system technology to taiwan14 the us government has also been ambiguous about the us commitment to taiwans security following the termination of the us defense treaty one year after the agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the prc in 1979 us officials have refused to say what actions the united states might take in the event of prc military threat to the island the us government made clear that arms sales would conti nue and that the united states expected the taiwan issue to be dealt with peacefully the taiwan relations act affirmed that the united states would maintain sufficient forces in the pacific to deal with contingencies in the taiwan area after the usprc military faceoff in the taiwan area in early 1996 the clinton administration strongly and repeatedly affirmed us interest in seeing the prc and taiwan ease cross strait tensions and resume cross strait negotiations the latter were being carried out by ostensibly unofficial representatives of the prc and taiwan but were suspended in the wake of the lee tenghui visit to the united states the two sides agreed earlier this year to resume the high level dialogue of their ostensibly unofficial representatives later in 1998 meanwhile several former clinton administration officials including secretary of defense william perry and assistant secretary of defense joseph nye were notably active since in 1998 promoting cross strait dialogue some have warned taiwan that us support might not be forthcoming if taiwan were to provoke prc attack by declaring taiwan to be independent and others have called for possible settlement of the taiwan issue which could involve beijing disavowing the use of force taiwan disavowing the option to declare independence and the united states curbing arms sales to the island in congress some members have examined the formidable prc ballistic missile capabi lity against taiwan to argue that the united states should work with taiwan to provide theater missile defense for the island15 us economic interests also argue for policy straddling relations with both beijing and taiwan the clinton administration strongly emphasized the importance of the china market in explaining its 1994 reversal on linking trade issues with chinese human rights practices16 administration leaders have hailed chinas continued economic grow th and determination to hold the line against currency devaluation as of particular importance in managing the consequence of the asian economic crisis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs8 17 taiwans national security adviser has held six rounds of ostensibly private talks in the unite d states with us officials headed by the us presidents deputy national security adviser according to taiwan media see taiwan crs issue

rate has flagged bit taiwan is widely seen as the east asian economy best situated to weather the current crisis us policy makers worrie d about another round of currency devaluations in asia hope taiwans currency remains strong devaluation in taiwan would place added pressure on the hong kong dollar and the chinese yuansomething us policymakers wish to avoid asian economic uncertainty also slows taiwans investment in the chinese mainland worth over 30 billion taiwan investment is widely seen as moderating factor in the ongoing taiwanprc rivalry meanwhile taiwans relatively healthy economy and large foreign exchange reserves are attractive to cashstarved southeast asian leaders they are now willing to offend prc sensitivities by meeting with senior taiwan leaders in the hope of gaining added assistance from taiwan taiwan has also taken steps to meet us requirements for entry into the world trade organization wto once it wraps up few pending issues with other trading partners the sole obstacle to taiwans wto entry will be the widely recognized implicit requirement backed by the prc that the prc must enter the wto first before taiwan can enter findings of the workshop lessons for us policy workshop participants saw three general sets or clusters of lessons for us policy stemming from the experience in managing relations with taiwan under the tra over the past 20 years they centered on us governmentsupported interactions with taiwan us government approaches to dealin g with cross strait relations and other aspects of prctaiwan relations and unofficial including so called track ii us efforts to deal with taiwanmainland frictions us governmentsupported interaction with taiwan technically the us government has relations with taiwan but as is noted above wide range of military economic and other interchange takes place often facilitated by the american institute in taiwan ait us governmentfunded legally private entity staffed heavily by us officials temporarily on leave from their agencies which provides many of the us government functions formerly provided by the us embassy in taipei prior to 1979 meanwhile taiwan officials interact with administration counterparts frequently albeit sometimes in nonofficial surroundings and sometimes at lower than top policy making levels17 top level taiwan officials are restricted from traveling to the united states and washington dc in particular and many top level us officials and some subcabinet officials notably in the state and defense departments are not allowed to travel to taiwan congressional members and staff routinely interact with taiwan officials in the united states and in taiwanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs9 18 they are based on us pledges to the prc at the time of normalization of relations with beijing that us relations with taiwan would remain unofficial and on the continued perceived need up to the present to adhere to those pledgesimportance of the tra the taiwan relations act was essential in insuring continued us support for taiwan after the break in relations in 1979 according to workshop participants one advised that without the tra taiwan today would be part of the prc the meaning was that the tra helped to stiffen us resolve in the face of pressures to accommodate the prc over this sensitive issue and us support was essential to taiwans ability to survive and prosper as free market economy and an emerging democracy in this 20 year period the tra provided focal point for congressional involvement in policy toward taiwan which as noted above tended to push the administration to be more supportive of taiwans continuing development than it otherwi might have been as is noted below however several seminar participants balanced this support for congress role with criticism of perceived congressional tendencies to play politics with taiwan issues using them as opportunit ies to differentiate the congress from the administration with an eye toward partisan political advantage in american domestic politics us priorities political will us policy was seen to work best during those relatively infrequent occasions when us policy makers in the administration and congress agreed generally on us policy priorities that took careful account of import ant us interests visavis taiwan as well as key us concerns in relations with the prc the period 19831989 was said to be such period of general policy consensus and strong us leadershi p based on careful calculation of how us interests and behavior would affect the policies of both beijing and taipei periods of divided or weaker us leadership before or since were seen to have prompted both beijing and taipei to push harder their respective policy preferences on washington adding to the difficulty in formulating coherent and effective us policy effectiveness of ait leadership workshop participants who included three former and the current head of ait generally agreed that the institute had worked effectively in meeting the objectives set forth in the tra and in managing overall us relations with taiwan of course it was recognized that the institute did not make us policy toward taiwan playing more the role of implementer and facilitator us administration restrictions on interaction with taiwan these are restrictions established or decided unilater ally by the us administration to conform to the administration officials views at the time as to what represents appropriate interaction with taiwan18 some participants criticized the administration restrictions on interaction with taiwan as counterproductive for us interests they averred that us administr ation officials should have better and more interchange with taiwan leaders in order to deal with many pertinent political economic and military issues in this context they also criticized unilateral us restrictions on the amounts of us arms to be sold to taiwan they were of the view that these kindshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs10 19 participant also said that there were instances in the past when the administration deliberately and in his view inappropriately avoided consultations with congress over policy toward taiwan notably during the provocative prc military exercises in the taiwan strait in 1995 of restrictions could be loosened to some degree without underm ining the us political and legal commitments made in establishing official relations with the prc19 us government approaches to cross strait relations us stake us influence workshop participants underlined the importance of cross strait relations for us interests they noted not only the important interests the united states has in relations with the prc and taiwan but how broader us interests in east asia and elsewhere would be adversely effected if conflict were to break out in the taiwan strait at the same time they emphasized that the united states remain ed dominant power in east asia and had great influence in both taipei and beijing it was seen as important for the united states to use this influence not in ways that would tilt to one side or the other but would foster balanced situation where both beijing and taipei felt their interests were reasonably secure this kind of situation was said to provide notably more room for an advantageous us relationship with taiwan as well as beijing whereas hostile or confrontational us posture toward beijing was seen to reduce not expand us opportunities for advancing relatio ns with taiwan the reasoning here was that suspicious or confrontational prc would resist strongly and possibly forcefully to us efforts to improve relations with taipei rules of engagement based on assessment of the experience of the previous 20 years one speaker offered set of rules of engagement that he said had worked well for us policy and interests in managing often difficult issues in cross strait relations these findings were generally supported by several other speakers at the workshop the rules were maintain an equilibrium of confidence on both sides of the strait ie us policy should not tilt against the interests of taipei or beijing to point where either party sees the us working against their interests keep the responsibility for managing cross strait relations in taipei and beijing and avoid getting the united states to bear the main responsibility for managing cross strait relations encourage cross strait dialogue but avoid getting directly involved unless invited by both sides and consistent with other us interests encourage others in the region to support easing of cross strait tensions dialogue and peace improve us executivecongressional dialogue over cross strait issues seeking broader policy consensus the taiwan military us security assistance speaker noted that the taiwan military leadership has been force for moderation in taiwans approach to cross strait issues they do not seek conflict with the prc and continue to supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs11 the national goal of reunification which is somewhat reassuring to beijing on the other hand he and other participants voiced concern over taiw an government tendencies to use arms purchases from the united states in order to seek political advantage in cross strait rivalry with beijing rather than to assist taiwa ns overall strategic defensive posture against the prc they complained that taiwans wish list of requests for us military equipment often seems more influenced by the taiwan leaderships perceived political needs visavis beijing than its military needs in this context they pointed to what was seen as the absence of good strategic military planning in taiwan this was said to be due in part to the expectation in taiwan that if there were military confrontation with beijing taiwan expects to rely heavily on an early and strong us military intervention unofficial or track ii us efforts to deal with crossstrait tensions these efforts were supported by participants these efforts which helped to ease cross strait tensions and contribute to better taiwanmainland understanding ran up against the recently highly competitive cross strait rivalry signs of the latter included the prc military buildup opposite taiwan the international diplomatic war for recognition being waged by both sides prc leaders greater sense of urgency in making progress on political issues with taiwan and taiwan leaders strong resistance to dealing with political issues meanwhile the economic interchanges between taiwan and the mainland continue to grow deepening mutual interests and neither side seems interested in or prepared to engage in sustained military conflict over cross strait issues seeing neither reunification nor independence as realistic outcomes anytime in the foreseeable future the us objective of track ii was seen as productive when it focused on such short term effects as building confidence between the two sides through suggested exchanges and communication s and on discussing such longer term formu as commonwealth or confederation for settling taiwanmainland relations in ways that were not seen to challenge the fundamental interests of either side but served to attract them to engage in civil dialogue about pertinent issues options and goals for us policy looking to the future workshop participants offered options and goals for us policy that centered on us governmentsupported interaction with taiwan and us government approaches to cross strait relations and in the broader taiwanprc rivalry us governmentsupported interaction with taiwan implementing the tra broadly speaking participants judged that the tra was not broken and therefore did not need to be fixed legislatively some noted that amending the tra could cause considerable controversy not in the interests of good ustaiwan relations others noted that much could be done within tra guidelines to strengthen us interaction with taiwan in ways they judged were needed thus tra provisions on taiwan human rights and taiwan representation in international organizations could be used to allow for stronger us support for the premise that taiwans fate should not be determined without popular approval inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs12 taiwan and for stronger support for taiwans role in international organizations of course basic question for us administration policy under these circumstances would be whether or not the perceived costs of using tra provisions in this way would outweigh the perceived benefits the administration also was encouraged to consult with or report to congress about taiwan developments regularly since the relatively narrow reporting requirements of the tra have long expired alternatively congress could pass legislation asking for or requiring such reports according to participants review us government restrictions these administration guidelines were seen to get in the way of effective us policy in several areas and should be made more flexible according to seminar participants this would allow for greater contacts with taiwans military with taiwan government and opposition party politicians and other interaction in taiwan that would make us policy more realistic and effective according to workshop participants setting us priorities executive congressional relations clearer policy consensus would allow the united states to use its influence in taiwan and with the prc to good effect according to workshop participants this consensus would have to take careful account of the respective interests of taiwan and the prc and notably would require closer us administrationcongressional cooperation the latter was point of special concern of several participants given the current acrimoni ous debate over us china policy to achieve improved cooperation requires the administration to move away from its perceived past practice of defensiveness and refusal to consult closely with congress according to workshop participants but it also requires that congress restrain its perceived tendency to play politics and act irresponsibly in handling taiwan policy questions according to participants only in this way can enough trust and comity be built between the executive and legislative branches to allow for honest give and take over policy deliberations leading to consensus that would allow us power and influence to be felt in ways beneficial to us interests us government approaches to cross strait relations seminar particip ants had list of dos and donts for future us policy in these areas they urged specific recommendations while encouraging cross strait trends generally seen as beneficial to us interests and easing tensions and improving cross strait dialogue and understanding including growing cross strait economic exchanges and track ii negotiating efforts that maintain the trust of opinion leaders on both sides of the strait the specific recommendations for us policy included realistic awareness of taiwan and prc politics participants urged us policymakers to respect democracy in taiwan to avoid exaggerating the alleged proindependence tendencies of taiwan politicians like president lee tenghui and leaders of taiwans opposition democratic progressive party and to see that the center of gravity of taiwan opinion on cross strait issues is not moving toward independence though it is strongly opposed to prc terms for reunification at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs13 20 they are cinsistence on peaceful resolution cbelief that dialogue is the best way to bring peaceful resolution cdialogue must be between the two sides the us will not be mediator cthe us will remain even handed will not pressure one side or the other on cross strait talks cany settlement must be acceptable to both sides including in the case of taiwan and its democratic government the requirement that it be acceptable to the taiwan peoplesame time participants affirmed that us policy can expect to be effect ive if it ignores the strong role played by domestic politics in the prc and how chinese leaders have very limited room for maneuver on sensitive sovereignty issues involving issues like taiwan balanced steps modest goals against this background participants gave series of balanced steps and modest goals for us policy in the cross strait relationship that were designed at bottom to avoid friction and confrontation seek to build better atmosphere of trust and make progress in small areas in the hopes that over the longer term developments may allow for greater progress in the future it was notable that these steps meshed fairly well with the five principles said to be governing current clinton administration policy on cross strait issues20 there were those who put their hopes on the development of democracy in the mainland leading to greater prc flexibility allowi ng for settlement of the taiwan reunification question but others disputed the notion that democracy if it comes to the prc would make the prc leadership more flexible on sovereignty issues like taiwan some participants thought that the two sides could reach agreement on commonwealth or confederation involving taiwan and the prc but others pointed out that taiwan is aware that historically these have not lasted long and have wound up with the stronger party incorporating the weaker and presumably would resist these plans meanwhile some advocated an interim agreement perhaps lasting 50 years whereby the prc would renounce the use of force and taiwan would renounce independence and both sides would commit to talks on reunification after the 50 year period was over this would allow political economic and cultural changes to take hold on both sides of the strait and presumably narrow differences in the process among the steps and goals recommended for us policy were dont assume that unification of taiwan is an appropriate outcome in the confrontation between taiwan and china focus on peace whether it entails reunif ication the status quo or permanent separation of taiwan from the mainland it is better to remain ambiguous on whether or when the us would become involved in military conflict in the strait credib military presence in the east asian region backed by japan and others if possible remains essentialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs14 to be effective in the region us leaders will need to devote more than episodic attention to cross strait and broader issues in east asia and the pacific this engagement needs to be accompanied by carefully monitored statements that avoid exaggerating the closeness of the united states to one side or the other us arms sales and government engagement with taiwan must continue despite prc objections though there was strong disagreement among participants on whether provision of us tmd equipment or technology to taiwan at this time is warranted the us should not mediate or take sides in cross strait issues while encouraging both sides to reduce tensions and increase dialoguehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30100crs15 speakers
