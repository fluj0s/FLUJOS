shsbc289 renumbered 318 24 jul 63 arc breaks and the comm cycle arc breaks and the comm cycle lecture given on 24 july 1963 clearsound checked against the old reels omissions were found thank you well youre going to get some demonstrations before were much older and im grooving in model session little bit better couple little bugs these days in model session do you agree thats clean can cause an arc break what you want to communicate to the pc is did the pc have anything to say about it you after all have asked question and you inform him of the state of the needle and ask him if hes got anything he wants to say about it but i havent quite got the pat wording for that but its interesting that there are two three little changes theyre just little refinements make it easier on the auditor were using mostly the 3n model session and in actual fact have not used the old original longdrawnout beginning rudsend ruds model session for some time and its good training ground maybe but in actual fact the since mid ruds are enormously better since mid ruds and pull missed withholds are enormously better than any beginning rudiments we ever had and an arc break assessment at the end of session just whether theres been an arc break or not is enormously superior to any end rudiments we ever had dont you see so you just clean every line of it you dont do an assessment by elimination if you got tick find out what it is and just clean that up and your pc comes up shining so it actually makes model session pretty easy to do but its still very precise activity weve now got the body of the session we end the body of the session you know goals and gains all that sort of thing everything is there you know we adjust the pcs chair and ask if its all right to audit in the room and get can squeeze and put in the rfactor and start the session you know same thing get the goals and roll right on through get the pcs goals and pcs needle is bit agitated your tone arm is higher than it was the last session we put in our since mid ruds and see if theres any missed withholds and carry right on through into the body of the session and do whatever weve got to do come right on up to the end of the body of the session and chatter with him little bit before we tell him thats the end of the body of the session thats very informal but still there then we get the pcs arc break assessment usually omitted if the sessions quite happy and the pc has had big win in the session we certainly dont harass him with an arc break assessment and then we take our goals and we take up each goal i notice some not quite doing that maybe and actually those are written on the auditors report diagonally across the goal see we just write yes you know or maybe see across each goal we dont write down another section here that says whether or not he made his goal see to have good session well we give him that goal you know did he make it he says yes we write yes diagonally across that top there see so we can see what his goals and gains were just by looking at that one block and its easy to review see if hes got all that we dont keep pestering him we just read it to him did he make them or didnt he make them then we thank him for making his goals in this session or if he only made part of them why thank you for making some of your goals in this session im sorry you didnt make all of them then we ask him for his gains and we take down the gains and we dont keep bleeding gains we dont keep asking the question did you make any gains for the session we just take what hes got see we make sure that hes answered it to his satisfaction and remember hes pretty foggy so sometimes thats little difficult to get closed out youre still trying to end the session hes still trying to give you gains you know long time to answer the question or something like that well let him answer it to his satisfaction but dont you keep pounding with the question about gains for the session you understand you can overask him see and next thing you know hes giving imaginary gains that he never heard of when hes got those you say thank you for making these gains in this session or thank you for making some gains in this session im sorry you didnt make all of them and sorry you didnt make more gains rather and close that out and then we just get cansqueeze test run any havingness that we have to run if the cansqueeze test was less than the beginning of the session and simply ask him is there anything you want to say before we end the session let him say it then we say is it all right with you if i end the session now and get yes on that and we just end the session thats it and tell im longer auditing you all of these various lines weve had before those little courtesy lines are in there the only additional ones thanking him for his goals then thanking him for his gains and that is the form of model session these days but it still requires precision dont you see it is still model session and its wording is very fixed for each one of these points before i gave you demonstration of this model session brought up to date however i wanted to get that business of what do you say to pc what is exactly the best thing to say you know that didnt read do you agree that that is clean that type of approach can cause arc breaks i myself have felt like saying well i dont have to agree that its clean to hell with it you know what are you trying to do force to say there are more answers on this question in the last trillion trillion years is there anything you have suppressed hell i know it cant be clean its clean for the purposes of the session maybe but sure isnt clean thats why when you heard demonstration i was giving on that tape short time ago i was slipping that you saw i wasnt using it very much and fumbling around with it i was still trying to find proper wording soon as i get that taped why ill give you this new one its almost exactly the same one that youre using now im just giving you these little refinements all refinements these days are just in the direction of causing less arc breaks and getting more auditing done the reason you have rough needles however has nothing to do with your model session or your rudiments or anything else the reason you have rough needles is you miss on tr 2 or tr 4 you miss tr 2 and tr 4 and you got rough needle thats it bang just like that comes back to auditing cycle if an auditors pc has clean needle consistently you know that this pc is either phenomenal or this auditor has very very good tr 2 and tr every good tr 2 and tr 4 see and if pc has rough needle not all the rudiments in the world will put it together if the auditors tr 2 and tr 4 are for the birds see thats big point thats big point now i invite you sometime to just watch this any auditor will have this happen to him it happens about once session sometime in the session you got clean needle its flowing along here very neatly and very nicely and smoothly clean needle everything going fine and all of sudden you got dirty needle you immediately assume pc has missed withhold if you were to take tape of your auditing session you would find out very rapidly that your tr 2 went out or the pc originated and you did something about it something happened there between tr 2 and tr 4 and immediately your needle was rough be very revelatory to you if you had tape of the needle were trying to accomplish this technically very hard problem if you had tape of your needle in your session and you could play it back sometime youd learn lot and its quite intriguing and you say what the hell gets into you know pc said i had an ache oh yes where was it oh yeah hmmm have anything to do with the process we were running dirty needle just like that bangbang uh well i feel better now well you dont have to worry about that well get you into another inaudible but you watch the coordination between auditing cycle and dirty and clean needles and youre going to be fascinated and whenever you look around and you see an awful lot of pcs have dirty needles you look around youll see an awful lot of auditors have dirty tr 2 and tr 4 you clean up the tr 2 and tr 4 and youll clean up more needles than you can shake stick at it isnt the significance of it you see its the calm flow of the auditing cycle well i didnt come in here to give you lecture on this today im going to give you lecture on the subject of arc breaks so i might as well start this lecture this is what audience july 24th 24 july ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and here is lecture on the subject of arc break assessments one which you need you need you need this worse than you think arc break assessments now ive just been rattling along here and talking about sessioning in general which is of course very applicable part of this lecture but you normally consider dirty needle you see as withhold or something that the pc has done and you seldom look at it as something that the auditor has done well let point out to you that there are two communication cycles in an auditing cycle two communication cycles in an auditing cycle and either one of those two communication cycles can be active now number one is auditor to pc number two is pc to auditor now either of those can operate independently and one of those cycles goes this way do fish swim see and the pc hears it and understands it see and that is simply cause distance effect so thats communication cycle see cause distance effect now pc says yes and auditor hears it and understands it now thats cause distance effect now youre used to all this of course but you probably havent looked at it in the degree of separateness which it deserves since either one of them can exist independent of the other one and both of those communication cycles have to be perfect or very acceptable before you have an auditing cycle an auditing cycle is not made up then of auditor command pcs reply auditors acknowledgment see that is very very loose look at an auditing cycle an auditing cycle can exist frankly on either of these independently the pc doesnt have to say thing and yet be perfectly satisfied do you see communication can exist from the auditor to the pc whats your rfactor thats communication from the auditor to the pc isnt it pc understands it you ever hear pc say very much to an rfactor he doesnt even have to signify hes heard it theres nothing in the books that says he did but he has to understand it he doesnt have to say anything okay all right well i agree that is the rfactor you dont expect the pc to say that see similarly youre going along in an auditing session the pc suddenly says hey i just realized that dirigibles arent airplanes see you know its fact and you havent even been auditing dirigibles or airplanes or anything else this very often takes you by surprise it can be close or far from the subject of the auditing session that has nothing to do with it but its an independent communication cycle an independent communication cycle now youre so cheerful on the subject of getting your tr 2 in just right in answer to the tr 4 that you dont sometimes look at the fact that tr 4 doesnt depend on tr 2 not even vaguely thats why its tr 4 its up upnumbered what is this do you know that some of the most successful origin handlings ive ever done had acknowledgment connected with them although you can say the auditor is supposed to understand and acknowledge the thing receive understand and acknowledge the communication all that sort of thing you can go into that kind of thing and try to explain what this is in actual fact look at this in its most naked form this is just simply single communication cycle originated by the pc and received and understood by the auditor and if you look at that not with any tricks or gimmicks around it all will suddenly make sense just as the auditor is emanating and originating his auditing cycle as oneway communication in its first step and just as an auditor can originate things which the pc doesnt have to respond to at all so can you get the reverse thing going in session which is to say the pc says something and thats communication cycle and the only thing youre trying to do is signify that it exists youre not trying to do tr 2 or anything else i mean the pc originates he says dirigibles are not airplanes hes had cognition of some kind or another one of the ways to knock him off his base is to give him very artificial tr 2 did you ever have an origin knocked off its base by having the auditor say very good thank you get very artificial piece of stuff back in your teeth youve just said something that was important to you very often in auditing ill handle an origin with facial expression or head nod because its oneway cycle and only ghost of the thing the other way needs go and actually neednt really go at all if youre really good at projecting your think tank you could sit there with the face of wooden indian and do perfect tr 4 i know that sounds utterly incredible the way not to handle tr 4 is to make it obvious that you havent understood and that you have received the communication thank you i suddenly i suddenly realize the pc says i suddenly realize i suddenly realize my migraine headaches gone i had it for years gone hey what do you know its gone gone thank you said slowly and ponderously audience laughter what the auditor has done in that particular regard is make mistake of thinking pc runs reverse auditing cycle see he thinks the pc is now going to audit him the point here is you audit any little kid on touch that table or touch that chair for little while and nearly all of them will suddenly start diving the command to you they get their flow going so far and youre fool if you dont do them too and you touch the table and touch the chair and the kids all satisfied and so forth and theyre perfectly willing for your next command see its quite game they play they go into very complete duplication of the auditing session good auditor of children and so on is quite well aware of this and doesnt refuse to execute the auditing command it throws kid completely out of session kid is overwhelmed thats the kids effort to be right dont you see all right but in handling an origin the pc has not started to audit the auditor thats different kettle of fish the pc doesnt expect anything but comprehension thats all the pc expects now how do you signify comprehension well i know your telepather is kind of busted its been busted for quite while i know mine has been to the degree that it might be i sometimes look back at what telepathy once was and guy is two thousand yards away and you hear all of his thoughts with crash dont you see thats ot stuff you can also have obsessive telepathy where you hear everybody all the time this is sort of out of control but were not asking for anything that is that marvelous were asking for pure and simple an ordinary response to communication now how do you signify that you comprehended until you can answer that question well till you can answer that question well and pleasantly to yourself see l mean not pleasantly but satisfactorily well youre sitting there right now how are you comprehending to that you heard what i said and understand it yeah i look at your faces and youre all doing it beautifully see perfect now that is an origin handling of and thats all there is to handling an origin pc says something and you understand it now we say and acknowledge it but weve gone too far because were tending to put it in thing we let the pc know weve understood it for instance once in while ill just laugh like hell see you know pc has said something thats very funny to the pc you know and seems funny to i wont laugh if i dont think its funny to l wont corn up the emotions on it and ill just laugh you know pcs perfectly satisfied thats because theres auditing cycle involved thats just communication cycle thats all there is to it see now there are bunch of processes which require answer from the pc but do require response from the pc of some kind or another but they are concept processes the old concept processes get the idea of well the pc can sit there and get the idea and never really say yes i nothing to the auditor you know hes done it well how did you know hes done it oh you look at his breathing and that sort of thing you take look at him and so on you get into this trouble in r3r how do you know the pc has moved to the beginning of the incident see thats an interesting little hole because you didnt say move to the beginning of the incident at approximately and tell when you get there in the first place that would be very sour because its two auditing commands theyre already complicated hes in too much trouble already and once in while any auditor will get dopey and have moved the pc to the beginning of the incident and then not move him through it you know forget the pc will sit there for while finally look at you kind of hostilely and say well when are you going to move through the rest of the incident you knuckle head see any auditor is liable to do this because hes all busy with his computation of where the beginning of the incident is and how many time it was and so forth and the pcs been taking quite while let us say to get to the beginning of the incident and so he moves him to the beginning of the incident and then all of sudden wakes up to realize at last that he hasnt moved him through the incident this can happen not to you just once or twice because youre new at it this will probably continue to happen to you embarrassedly now and then from here on out because youve got an incident thats trillion years long or something stupid like this and the pcs at the end of the thing and has had an awful time trying to find the beginning of it anyhow and you say move to the beginning of the incident at approximately wumptywumpbump trillion years ago and you decide well while hes moving to the beginning of the incident ill just catch up on my note of what hes just told because i didnt want to slow him down you see and youre busy writing anal writing you get interested in what youre writing you know well actually the pc wouldnt be upset with you if he didnt notice that your attention was on something else rather than following through the auditing command pc usually forgives this doesnt cause any arc break but ordinarily you pc says well im there so what and you say oh uhhohahho oh the exact auditing command that follows that of course is move through the incident to point duration time later thats the exact command that should be given him at that moment and hell go ahead and happily carry this out well this is point where if youre on the ball you say move to the beginning of the incident and if you keep your eye on your meter itll flick sooner or later you dont have to ask him are you there thats terribly bad form you want to ask him what are you looking at well soandso and soandso and i wouldnt spend much time asking him what he was looking at either as soon as i had any inkling that he was at the beginning of the incident id move him on through because you cant make any real mistakes there anyway point im making here is the pc doesnt have to tell you hes at the beginning of the incident he simply executes the auditing command causes little bit of embarrassment sometimes when you dont realize that hes executed the auditing command but it is communication cycle it has taken place the auditor said something the pcs done it thats all you expect thats it all right now the pc says something its communication cycle hes not auditing you it must be therefore communication cycle he originates see and he originates something to you and you receive it and understand it that is communication cycle communication cycle complete right there now to make it an originated cycle you should signify to him in some tiny fashion that you have received it and understood it now if you try to phony this up and he says lugulala blouuboog and you say hmmm hmmm hmmm and you dont know what the hell hes talking about there is some mystic influence sets in at this point which you will see go on the meter he knows damn well you didnt understand that half the time because he didnt now the auditor who specializes in this phrase should be stonewalled i just dont understand what you said see i didnt understand you i dont understand what you are saying dont understand in the first place thats lousy lousy approach from the basis that it uses very very powerful word understand is the crossroads of r and c and you say dont understand youre just asking at once for complete arc break but more importantly you have said to the pc to communicate the same thing again if youll notice he said i have pain in my back and you say i just dont understand what you said and the pc will only say i have pain in my back and you say i dont understand that and he will say i have pain in my back see were all of sudden seeing the buildup of the arc break see and you say i just dont understand that i have pain in my back loud you can build this up but do you notice that the pc is saying the same words over and over and over its peculiarity of homo sap if you indicate that you dont understand what hes talking about he says the same thing again he says the exact same thing again he never varies it what you want him to do is vary the explanation what youre asking him to do is to help you get this if hes got to say something more what you want to indicate to him is he should tell you little more broadly what he is tallying about so that you can get very good grasp of it and if you are very clever and theres substitute for cleverness you cant give anybody pat phrase with it because they vary all the time if youre very clever he will explain it to you in half dozen different ways and then he understands it and so do you but its mainly you thats got to understand it now here basically and elementarily we get the basis of an arc break i dont care what kind of charge is bypassed the thing is bungedup communication cycle whatever else it is see its affinity reality communication these things are all out its bungedup communication cycle but what in it is bunged up detected and understood those are whats bunged up in it how can you have communication cycle where the communication is not fully detected and is not understood how can you have one it isnt communication cycle became the communication cycle is cause distance effect with duplication occurring at the effect point of the cause point thats very pure accurate definition not over all the years has there been any shift of that but look at this are you going to call this communication cycle cause distance alterised effect comprehension you said good morning and she thought you insulted her how did that come about well it just came about by the nonexistence of communication cycle it was imperfectly detected and it was not understood now of course its not understood because its imperfectly detected i mean how much more elementary can we get somebody rolls lollipop in your direction how can you detect what it is if you dont receive it oh yes it can arrive within four feet of you and you can look out there and see lollipop see then you could detect it without receiving it which is another thing this would also be an arcbreaky situation its detected but you didnt receive it usually youll find tr 4 breaks down at this point its detected but not received pc says i dont i i i dont think you have to keep keep the session going much longer i feel fine you say well were going were going to keep it going as long as is necessary to fill in this particular period you detected he said something but you didnt receive it youve said you didnt receive it because you didnt do anything about it you said it should be something else before it arrived at you and you have therefore busted down the communication line between the pc and yourself now that was very pleasant origin wasnt it do you know that you could so work on that origin that you would have that pc i dont care what pc or how calm this pc normally is or how splendid and pleasant this pc is you could get that pc into an absolute screaming fit just on that by just continuing that just continue it and continue it and if you ever want to see an arc break man just rig one of these things so that you dont receive what the pc says and that can be done to any pc some pcs are really bit below spitting in your face but you can just see them go blyaaahhh and they just sort of pass out right where they sit but it produces fantastic effect fantastic effect now an auditor must realize that that is primary effect and that is primary cause of arc break that is not one of the causes of arc break that is your textbook perfect example from the pcs point of view there is cause and theres distance the distance is not covered or the communication cycle does not complete and thats it thats it i dont care what pc youve got you can reduce pc to screaming fit matter what this pc has said you can just get the pc gibbeting pc will just be shaking and exhausted in very short space of time and thats an arc break well why is it an arc break thats because both r and c are out the combination of r and c equals understanding and the understanding is out the intention is cause distance effect and the progress of that cycle is prevented so that the communication is actually not fully detected see not fully detected this is very very interesting point in arc breaks that forms woof and warp of all arc breaks not fully detected partially detected but not fully detected nobodys going to arc break going out here and yelling at rock you could go out here and yell at rock all morning you can say oh rock i hate thee or oh rock whither dost thou comest anything you want to say and you will go out and yell at the rock and talk at the rock and speak at the rock and so forth but your expectancy of whats going to happen at the rock never does get quite up to expecting the rock to give you tr 2 so therefore your estimate of the detection is not at fault the rock isnt going to detect the communication to it so you then dont expect anything to happen in the communication cycle so therefore you do not arc break see ah but the pc is under very very definite detection cycle the pc expects the auditor to detect the communication from the pc and understand it and when that is thrown sideways because understanding has entered into it because detection has entered into it because only partial detection or detection has entered into it in spite of the expectancy of its being detected you can reduce pc to an absolute shaking mess of jelly im not kidding you now i see from your silence that youre either accepting this as too grim to confront or you think i may be exaggerating it this is not so this is not so you can take the most common statement such as i feel pretty good now refuse to detect what the pc is saying dont duplicate it dont understand it in other words and keep giving the pc evidence that you havent understood it and have that pc i dont care how calm cool and collected that pc has always suspected himself in utter amazement at having been shuddering mess of jelly because he eventually will start screaming but i was just trying to tell you i feel perfectly good now see and it goes up up up up up scream scream scream and hell then break down scale you can see him go down the scale i was just trying to tell you and hell be crying you know he gets on the same line the stuck flow of his communication on the thing and he cant get it through he tries everything under gods green earth to get it through and eventually he starts giving up and you can see his whole emotional tone scale follow this then well that is basic arc break thats fundamental now you expect to tell you there are many other kinds of arc breaks but there are other kinds of arc breaks these mechanisms are all based on the communication cycle i dont care what the devil happens with the rest of the bank the whole definition of bypassed charge is partially detected now it wouldnt become bypassed charge unless it were at least slightly detected you understand somebody had to drag magnet within few feet of it it had to be stirred up one way or the other for the thing but that is communication line which begins going to restimulate an engram in the session lets take this as bypassedcharge source see the auditor does this knuckleheadedly you want to be careful in r3r in selecting incidents using things like the first incident the earliest incident cut your throat man what are you talking about you want an earlier incident the next incident not first and earliest why what are you trying to do lifes so dull you have to have an arc break well how are you going to get this arc break the pc cant give you the earliest incident on the chain but could give you the earlier incident than the one you just had but you ask him for the earliest incident and you will kick in some earlier incident which he then doesnt reach so he now partially detects and you have partially detected both of you now are guilty of partial detection of started communication and somewhere down deep it follows the same cycle as communication cycle right there bangbangbang itll go all to flinders just like that bangbangbang the more you scrape it up and the less you detect it the more arc break youre going to have and thats all there is to it if you considered the time track series of mines nah i shouldnt do this some of you girls are timid enough when it comes to approaching some of these things but let give you this anyway supposing we consider it bunch of mines which were activated magnetically all you had to do was drag magnet somewhere near them and theyd explode see and you want mine number four and youre all set to sit on it and pull its teeth and not let it explode see so you throw magnet down to mine number eight and then start to prevent mine number four from exploding and you wonder what that shattering roar is well you see you just miscalculated on what one you were going to explode now time track isnt quite that dramatic but it gives you an example see you want mine number four so you activate mine number eight now what in actual fact is that well its bum origin as far as the auditor is concerned but actually the communication cycle is reverse end to somebody has told mine number eight to speak accidentally and mine number eight speaks and nobody detects it quite see its partially detected but it is activated and being partially detected now will follow that same incomplete communication cycle nobody understands it see it isnt that that has life in it which is capable of doing that at all its just that communication cycle once begun must go through and if there is any type of thing that you want big truism big truism communication cycle once begun must go through if that communication cycle isnt permitted to go through there will be upset somewhere sometime someplace in fact most of the difficulties of mankind if you wanted to lay them out are simply begun communication cycles which are not then detected you know theyre only partially detected let us say there it is see let give you an idea the president of the united states says i want all of you bums and all of the indigent and the poor and the pauperized characters i want all of you to write letter and tell exactly what i can do to help you personally individually and personally gluck nobody would see in this the eventual revolution do you see whats going to happen the guys got technology for handling the communication cycle at all to say something like that would be weird and yet the politician in democratic country has always got this as his stock in trade hes gladhander tellmejoe you know this kind of thing eventually it starts exploding in his face we are very adventurous in that i go ahead and do something like that remember theres slight difference here slight difference here you know how to catch the ball we can catch the ball we know the mechanics of this sort of thing and generally the communication cycle doesnt have that as source i mean it isnt that communication cycle thats at fault it will have been somebody audited somebody and they got into an arc break and they bypassed some charge and then the person wouldnt admit that they had bypassed some charge you see on the pc and then the pc gets more and more disturbed and eventually they go to see somebody in the area and eventually the hco sec and then the hco sec tries to handle it one way or the other but it misses there one way or the other and it slides sideways and slips around and so forth and ill eventually hear about it and once in while i drop ball on these and i only know of one case extant right now where the ball has been dropped forever as far as im concerned because he got into the hands of psychiatrist incomplete communication cycle was the immediate and direct cause of that particular action he already let us say we know this had tremendous number of overts on the organization and everything was gone to hell and hed been in mess for long time see but communication cycle i didnt pay attention to it just as communication cycle just directly didnt and the character sprung sideways and there wasnt any way you could pick up the ball after that because there was psychiatrist standing there havent done anything to the guy apparently some psychiatrist that doesnt use icepicks in the morning only the afternoon i only know one thats extant like that well thats pretty good tribute to us and it doesnt say then that the situation isnt dangerous merely because its being handled but look at this it is situation which is pretty doggone violent if it is not handled and if youre unaware of this you realize that gunners and that sort of thing are always chucking around live ammunition and theyre not spooked about it at all and youll see people that work in oilwell districts blowing out oil wells and so forth theyre always walking around with pint flask of nitroglycerin in their hip pocket they just couldnt care less dont you see well why those guys dont die and get splattered all over the place all the time theyre handling very dangerous materials theyre just familiar with their material they know what that material is see well how would you like to be handling on totally unknowing basis the way everybody else does in the community see have you heard any conversations amongst meat bodies lately have you have you ill give you an assignment some time go around to tea break in construction works and listen to them that isnt so bad as cocktail party cocktail party is armored on this basis they dont expect anybody to hear them so its never partially detected charge but this becomes pretty idiotic pretty idiotic you just stand there and watch the number of dropped communication cycles and you dont wonder at all after while why these people tear each others throats out all the time theyre always partially detecting that somebody has spoke and of course they get blowup you see that you can handle the dynamite of the reactive mind this stuff you know this stuff is not very dangerous i dont mean to minimize it so on frankly not very dangerous it requires understanding it never has been very dangerous but look how desperate it has made practitioners of the past look how desperate it has made people look how desperate problem it is and look how frightened people can get if the united states whatever you call it is appropriating sixteen billion bucks to let psychiatry figure out how to give quicker and faster prefrontal lobotomies to more people oh i tell you man they must be worried that worry must be proportional at least one third as much worry invested in that as they have invested in the russian situation because thats about the proportionate amounts of appropriation i think thats fascinating you mean theyre so worried about this problem theyre so worried about the mind that they invest treasure to this extent they must be frantic to put it in the hands of the people they put it in too i dont exaggerate if youd talk to most psychiatrists yourself or if you were head of committee or something like that and you called in two or three psychiatrists or something like that to get testimony from them as to how to handle the community mental health if you were just an average citizen youd probably wind up with your eyes like saucers police listening to these fellows testify in courts and that sort of thing have become confirmed in the fact the psychiatrists are always crazier than the patients well look how desperate the situation must be if its put into the hands of people who put up forward mockup of franticness to that degree see lets just look up these coordinative factors see well psychiatrist of course is himself frantic and if we didnt give him hand to straighten out hell just never make it and i dont think well ever help him any way the point im making here is this factor of the arc break this factor of the explosive character of interpersonal relationship this factor of explosive nature of social or any other type of personal contact is looked upon in quite another way by other people than yourselves see its looked upon as just huuhhrh well everybody is dangerous and everything is dangerous and oh my god and its all on an emergency basis and huuuhh and figurefigurefigure you know its fantastic very few of you would say well you cant talk to him about that just show you that youve arrived someplace else you see than in that state of mind very few of you would be convinced you couldnt talk to anybody about anything after you talk to them for while you know you can handle the situation to some degree or another and so on well thats not the general state of mind with regard to this sort of thing in the society talk to somebody about something huuuhhh see impossible huooohh dangerous well what are these characters reacting to theyre reacting to communication cycle so the communication cycle is itself the most deadly thing if mishandled that interpersonal relationships has and the most valuable if it can be handled the reason you cant fish the ants out and straighten them up is because you cant talk to them desperation enters in only when communication goes out just remember that you only get desperate you can look back on sessions youve given the only times youve been worried and desperate and that sort of thing is when you actually had the communication cycle go out one way or the other you want to say to this pc what the hell is the matter with you see whats the matter with you i mean im asking you perfectly simple question here you know and you poor sod if you cant answer that question get some tone arm action youve just about had it man you know you know this sitting there you see and you sit there and you get tied up in the situation after while you find yourself kind of peeved with the pc pc isnt responding correctly then you get all right when you do get the pc at some level that the pc is responding all right with communication you find out that much to your red face that you had eight wrong dates on the case and thats why the ta action wasnt moving something like this you get these things straightened out you notice the situation evaporates in other words your response to the pc ebbs and flows to the degree that you can put communication between yourself and the aberration thats bothering him and straighten it out and see the evidence of its discharge dont ever think you worry about case for any other reason you dont its that basic thing youre having an effect on the case the case is responding and the case is coming along and that is what you expect to have happen and therefore thats happening and all is well and when that ceases to happen when your breakdown comes in and you cant seem to reach this pc with an auditing command you cant seem to reach this bank with communication of any kind whatsoever you cant seem to untangle this knot by speaking at it or into it you start getting worried and you start getting upset and thats when you as an auditor become upset and thats when you as an auditor become worried about your pc and its off theres reason for to give you some pat answer because there isnt broad pat answer to it because cases have these various bugs and complications of which youre aware and which you get around eventually but you look it over and try to find out what communication youre not getting home to the pc and you as an auditor will feel better now if the pc is feeling like the devil pcs feeling miserable about an auditing session or auditor or something like that you can just be sure that not his communication cycle now dont get this one awry his as an auditor its always your communication cycle that is awry from your analysis of the thing you want to improve something you improve your communication cycle but from pcs point of view pc is very much the effect of very heavy and strong processes and from the pcs point of view communication cycle is awry but it can be awry in various ways its awry the communication cycle is awry communication has started it hasnt been fully detected and it certainly hasnt been understood and where pc is going awry as pc you want happy pcs you just listen to these little words and dont bother about anything else and you just start figuring out exactly how you apply these to any case that youre auditing that you want to make happier case one way or the other and itll work and that is some communication cycle has begun it hasnt been detected fully detected you see has to be slightly detected or it wouldnt be active and it hasnt been understood now if you put that in nutshell as to the basis of low arc or arc breaks in pcs that you are auditing you actually never need another line of anything you need the mechanics of how to detect these things you need list of how many things these can be and so forth but i give you that as basic principle and you go at that as basic principle and you figure out the pc youre auditing has that as basic principle even when the pc doesnt have an arc break you know theres reason to figure this out now get this theres reason to figure this out at all go ahead and figure it out and you all of sudden will understand something about your pc that you havent understood before youre going to find communication cycle out i mean it doesnt matter what pc you see where youre always going to find communication cycle out whats the evidence hes not ot for instance hes always missing the telepathic communication cycle see hes always missing that one thats always out didnt go out in session i was in last night the auditor and pc practically blew each others brains out by having exactly the same communication cycle on telepathic wave hit midway and almost blow up in the middle of the session it was an incomplete communication cycle had taken place in the session both auditor and pc thought of it simultaneously and almost went around the bend trying to figure out which one had thought of it first so as to unbalance so as to unbalance this sudden ridge that had appeared in the middle of the auditing session quite an amusing situation missed goal back in the session you know one of these skitterscatter sorts of reviews of putting things back together again redating and that sort of thing and just up and missed goal didnt realize any goal had been missed until the end of session then all of sudden thought of it either the auditor thought of it first or the pc thought of it first the immediate result was telepath on the subject and it it was pretty weird you watch some of this stuff you havent seen for long time you know you get tremendously intrigued you say huh this stuff can exist you know anyway we had quite ball on that but thats just communication cycle of some kind or another which is completing there are all kinds of communication cycles now what do you think of pc who isnt receiving the auditing command and what do you think of the auditor that goes ahead and gives auditing commands the pc is only partially detecting hm now does this explain why you can run touch process on an unconscious person particularly if youre monitoring their hands you say touch the sheet touch the pillow you say touch the pillow and then you have them touch the pillow and now they know theyve received the communication you understand you see that as surety so it even works at the level of unconsciousness its quite interesting what do you think an auditor is going to walk into who keeps saying squizzlewig the ruddy rods thank you squizzlewig the ruddy rods thank you and the pc keeps saying yes yes yes yes what do you think the assessment at the end of session is going to look like theres going to be communication cycle missing it happens to be the auditors originated communication which is only partially detected by the pc and never understood now what do you thinks going to happen in that session its going to blow in some weird direction and there isnt going to be progress and things are going to go to hell in balloon one way or the other and its all going to be very hard to detect you see that all right now lets look at another communication cycle the pc is im not trying to tell you all arc breaks are based on the communication cycle you understand the communication cycle is primary but goes awry at the point of detection and understanding understanding throws it into and r you understand there are the affinity factors and the reality factors are what tend to make it not understood this is why its arc but still you can analyze it headon on the basis of communication you see and itll fall into that category its the reasons why the communication cycle didnt complete and was only partially detected when it should have been really detected see well lets say the auditor has never cleared the auditing command with the pc the pc has gone on answering this endlessly well of course youre going to get into trouble whats the primary source of trouble the fact that communication cycle existed and the communication cycle was only partially detected only the communication cycle didnt cycle it didnt get all the way through it was partially detected and it was not understood so of course youre going to get into trouble all right lets take another look at the situation we try to get engram four and we trigger engram eight well weve started communication cycle dont you see of engram eight without knowing we started engram eight and we suddenly hear an explosion someplace and we cant quite detect where it came from we look it over and we find out the communication cycle was that we accidentally got the response of engram eight but then we abandoned that somehow or another and we got four so actually the communication cycle was not completed was directed to eight was not received at eight dont you see it was received at four instead so therefore youve got partial detection and the pc didnt find it out really and the auditor didnt find it out so there it remains as sleeper dont you see there was something that didnt go through thats all youve got to figure on the thing if you left all of your lists home something didnt go through well its only question of how many things wont go through well the basic things that wont go through are affinity reality and communication and the basic things that those three things face are time time matter energy space and time its arc versus time dont you see that the livingness of the individual consists of arc and he faces the material universe which consists of mest so you have the factors of mest and you have the factors of arc and these confront each other but this basically takes up the communication cycle the individual communicating with time or time communicating with the individual goes awry and as result you get an incomplete and partially detected communication cycle all of these things end up in what you call an arc break this arc break results in all sorts of violent emotions which actually could not be exaggerated in their violence its just an arc break amongst nations that causes wars and yet heres millions of people strewn out across the battlefields causing all kinds of work up here at the betweenlives area poor fellows i bet they even have to work overtime lets hope they dont belong to the union or anything like that the boys must have an awful time well thats an immediate direct result of arc break communication breakdown of some kind or another with the affinity and reality attendant thereunto so dont think that because these factors are very simple and very easy to handle and very easy to detect that the results of not detecting them are not severe and that the severe results that you see in life interpersonally and in auditing sessions too as well are not catastrophic or think that these results do not stem from this very simple little factor because it always does an incomplete communication cycle results in bypassed charge always the common denominator of an arc break is bypassed charge theres charge someplace but what do we mean by charge we mean well of course ergs dynes and all the rest of it but we apply it to the communication cycle and we mean that communication or charge has been excited and was channeled to go in certain direction and then was not detected and not understood and that charge then explodes in dispersal of some sort or another it goes blooey dont you see this is elementary bypassed charge is something that originates as the beginning of communication cycle and then not having been wholly detected or understood remains then as bypassed charge and its very often not detected by the auditor or the pc and you have session sort of running at low gear now dont think these things are just explosive either pc just isnt feeling so well lately so forth well youve got some sleeping bypassed charge of some kind or another you didnt pick up thats all bypassed charge we mean we bypassed getting the completion of the communication cycle or we carelessly started communication cycle which didnt get completed thats all accidentally did so its very easy to do we say give the earliest engram on this chain little while later pc has an arc break we say lets see did i miss an origin or what did i do what happened then you hit finally an earlier incident was restimulated this usually settles it away one way or the other particularly if the pc spots what was restimulated bang there goes your arc break its attended with great magic but the magical look at it is the fact that we have the anatomy of this tremendously explosive stuff the explosive stuff of interpersonal relations we know the magic of that we know how many different ways communication can be begun and not be detected and therefore become bypassed charge its lot of ways in which this thing can be done well knowing those things you should be able to handle session better you should be able to handle session better pc says oh i i dont think we ought to go on too long and you say very good just as your words fly out the window at least have the grace to realize that you are adding something into the communication cycle if this then bears bad fruit just realize how come it came about its partially detected communication wasnt understood far as the pc is concerned you say well obviously that leaves you in position of always doing what the pc says it doesnt well good im glad thats the way you feel all right all right yeah okay okay dont want to carry on too long all right all right well good thing that im perfectly fresh and i hope you are the same because i intended to go for another two hours we find that one cycle isnt the other cycle dont you see youve originated new series of communications on the subject you haven t slapped the old one in the head you only get into trouble by slapping the old one in the head dont you see pc said i think you ought to go all over the track and restimulate all these engrams because actually the best thing to do is to get to basicbasic which is tomorrow and you say all right you take look at this you understand what he said you may not understand why he said it but you sure understand what he said and you say all right good enough and go on and do what youre doing he still isnt too upset about the situation see he only gets upset if you slap him in the face therefore youve got to be an expert in the detection of communication that has begun the better you are at detecting begun communication the better you are at this the less arc breaks youll have but actually you neednt worry about arc breaks because you can handle these things before they get catastrophic now thats an arc break thats handling the arc break these are the basic fundamentals stripped right down to rock bottom your arc break assessment form is simply the number of types of communications which can be started and only partially detected by the auditor and the pc now some of you are prone to this now this can be done so you are led astray by some wins you can say well an earlier incident was restimulated in the session thats whats wrong thats what the arc break was about and the pc suddenly feels better and if you go on that way and you get wins and you say boy this is the cats theres nothing to this this is absolute magic right up to the point when you get the arc break that you didnt assess the right line for or you assessed the wrong list for or the pc didnt quite know where to go to in order to look at and is still fubblefubbled you didnt find it even though it read on an assessment so therefore there are several actions undertaken in the detection of one of these things and one is to assess it on the form where the arc break reason lies that sounds idiotic for to say something like that but if the arc break is in the session and you do an r3r arc break form youre not going to find the arc break are you and so forth so the right form the right list the right list comes as primary in this and if you dont find it on the right list why you better get another list in other words if you dont find it get another list your commonest error on these things is not now that the lists are not complete but that the lists are in several pieces to save you time so your commonest error is wrong list you actually didnt find the arc break you didnt find the communication cycle that began and so left bypassed charge now the main mistake youre making or could make in this if you do make any mistake on it is not making sure that its all straightened out with the pc thats the biggest common error you say well that was an earlier incident restimulated thats all right okay and go on with the session the pcs sitting there frying it wasnt an earlier incident or he didnt know what incident it was and hes totally baffled the arc break charge has not been spotted and laid to rest see it says right there in the bulletin on this that you better take it up with the pc and find out if thats right well you can go to the point of dating all of the things which you dated wrongly and finding and locating and dating all of the bypassed incidents in fact it could become total production which will go on for sessions trying to clean up one arc break you understand good stunt in this regard is to find the order of magnitude of the bypassed charge that doesnt let you in for more trouble an earlier incident was restimulated yeah but what what who what where whats which which whats which its all you can find is an earlier incident was restimulated you dont know what earlier incident was restimulated you dont know what the hell and all of sudden the pc says oh yes and yes it must have been and so on and i wonder when that was can you date that yeah there it is and so on can you date it good trick is just give it order of magnitude is it hundreds of years ago thousands of years ago millions of years ago billions of years ago trillions of years ago trillions of trillions of year its trillions of trillions of years ago kidding all right thats fine thats the end of it see thats way of parking one without getting yourself all solidified in dating you know that the pcs attention is still stuck on this thing and hes still trying to sort out what incident it was and that sort of thing well one of the ways to get rid of it is find its order of magnitude not go ahead and date it and find its duration and run it by r3r when you in the first place were doing 3n you understand you can go that far but locating locating it on the list is where the semantic error turns up here you dont locate it on the list the list only locates the type the type of charge bypassed in other words the type of communication cycle that began and was never completed never detected see thats all that just locates its type now its up to you to take the additional steps of locate and indicate to the pc the charge in other words doing the assessment is really not locating the charge the charge is not on the list its in the pc you get this im not saying that just to be clever the truth of the matter is its only the type the list will only give you the type of charge and you havent accomplished the step of location youve only found the type see people are saying all right well you locate and indicate that means you do an assessment bang that is located now and we indicate it to the pc well the funny part of it is this is so good that even that works see theres where you get tripped up you can shortcircuit it to that degree and still make it work well recognize what youre doing thats terribly shortcircuited youve only found the type of charge you havent done the location step at all so in some arc breaks you are totally baffled as to why the arc break doesnt evaporate youre totally baffled you say why doesnt it go away well the primary reason is you havent done it on the right list that oddly enough is the most flagrant one but youve never done the location step at all the assessment is not the location see and an earlier incident was restimulated you say all right an earlier incident was restimulated well the magic of it is so great that occasionally this works and it gives you gives you bit of win so you say well this arc break assessment stuff pretty good haha thats it yeah fine and itll work like that and itll always work if youve got the right list and youve produced this minimal effect on the pc and pc isnt all coming apart now at the edges see because that works this whole system tends to get very shortcircuited you see the assessment is not the location that isnt the way you locate the charge that is the way you find the type of charge that you now want to locate you go down this pocketapocketapocketa pocketapocketa and sometimes when you go over it you retrigger it and your dirty needle turns off and your next time down why it reads purely see youve had dirty needle on the first assessment expect that as normal next time you go through and flick those off that were still in bang one is standing out there clean now you can say well it says soandso and soandso thats an earlier incident was restimulated earlier incident restimulated thats what it says here how do you feel about that the pc says i feel lots better yeah its fine well lets not plow up the field after its plowed man see this is just handling arc breaks as they occur in session you know reason to go into this stir it all up again find some more bypassed charge bypass you had it handled let sleeping dogs lie your assessment location and indication all occurred in the same breath see then you verified to find out whether or not it was okay and obviously it all occurred in the same breath so why are you going to go into any trouble from here on everybodys satisfied why are you going to any trouble youre just going to stir up more trouble but remember you have done very shortcircuited shorthand version of an arc break rundown that is very shortcircuited if you got the right charge it can happen but earlier incident restimulated yeah thats what it says here an earlier incident was restimulated in this session pc says ah well okay now thats good and starts getting interested in something else see ahahah thats all right nobodys going to quarrel with him doing that but you say well now how do you feel about this ah maybe so but uh yeah it was that earlier incident that was restimulated aorrwrrahr that earlier incident was restimulated you havent found the charge man and the first thing you should suspect is not your assessment but that you had the wrong list reach for another list do you know that you can do 3n and inadvertently do some 3r and be accidentally into 3r making arc breaks of 3r you can sometimes do r3r and get inadvertently into 3n and your arc break lies in 3n do you realize that and if you have an arc break on r3r and 3n it is never the session arc break list but sometimes after youve cleared them up you then have to get the session arc break that resulted from having had those out you get the stunt here but remember that there is an assessment location and an indication and it has to be all right with the pc so there are four steps always four you could say five finding out that the pc has an arc break would normally be the first one but that is the score on your arc break assessments and recognize recognize those steps in handling the existing arc break actually exist to that number and that the assessment is not the location the assessment is just finding out the type of charge you might have to go quite bit further to find the location you say wrong date youve done nothing the whole session but date you see the arc breaks caused by wrong date well it reads well and it is wrong date and that is the arc break but the pc says what date is wrong well you think that you now have to redate everything in the session and so forth well just call off few of the dates you found and ask if theyre right thats all bang bang bang bang bang bang do they read as wrong dates thats one way of doing it another way of doing it is first half of the session last half of the session theres dozen ways of doing it im not going to try to teach you that trick but you can go ahead and locate it right on down well what as the right date for that thing one of the ways of doing it is simply get order of magnitude that makes the pc very happy that causes it all to go back into place very smoothly you ran the goal to spit you thought it was in the helatrobus implants you have wrong date on the thing all the way along the line and you find the goal to spit had the order of magnitude of trillions of trillions of years ago its good enough not to go on to run the goal to spit you understand but to find out that youd found the goal to spit and you want to get it out of your road so you can keep on with the goal to spat see well you find the order of magnitude for the goal to spit and itll move out of your road these are all just shorthand methods of handling the thing but you are dealing with an assessment for type you are dealing with location you are dealing then with indicating what that was and then you are dealing with another factor here is was it all right with the pc does he feel okay now and thats what you were doing it for in the first place so youre ruddy fool not to find it out in the last place okay all right well because you can get away with it on the basis of do an assessment bang you say that was it and suddenly your location and indication take place just like that see you dont then break them down and realize that there are that additional steps if you wanted to know complete list of all types of arc breaks in this whole universe you would have to find all types of communication that could be partially detected when originated and all the things then thereafter that could be misunderstood and you would have full list of all arc breaks because were dealing with the mind we know the ones that are important and we know what really causes the explosions and we include those otherwise 150 million books printed each one to the size of the encyclopedia britannica could not give you partial list of the number of communications that could leave bypassed charge by being incomplete okay audience yes thats the lot thank you tape _
