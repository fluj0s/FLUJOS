bills in the 110th congress hr 1361 and s 163 respectiv ely to modify the small business administrations sba response to major disasters the bills agree on certain fundamental questions but differ in the details both bills address ways to improve sbas response to large disasters there is some congressional concern that following an exceptionally large disaster sba staff may not be large enough to be able to respond as rapidly as congress might wish both bills would increase disaster staffing and both would augment sbas staff by allowing certain private lenders to either make loans on behalf of sba or make loans that sba would guarantee in manner similar to sbas other loan programs other provisions would allow for closer congressi onal oversight of sba disaster responses under both bills sba would continue to make disaster loans to households and businesses the maximum personal real property limit of 40000 and the real personal property limit of 200000 would not change the maximum size of disaster loans to businesses would increase from 15 million to 3 million house or 2 million senate both bills would llow economic impact disaster loans to be made to nonprofits for the first time

journal of agricultural economics vol 61 3 august continuedchanges to the sba disaster loan program proposed legislation in the 110th congress introduction since the disastrous hurricane season of 2005 congress has continued to examine legislative options that would enhance the federal response to natural disasters members of both the house of representatives and the senate have introduced separate bills in the 110th congress to improve the small business administrations sba disaster loan programs1 witnesses at hearings held by the house small business committee and the senate small business and entrepreneurship committee re ported that sba was slow to start accepting disaster loan applications issued unclear guidan ce to those applying for loans did not adequately coordinate the disaster loan programs with state and other federal agencies was slow in processing applicati ons and lacked loan programs that could have sped rebuilding after the hurricanes sba has responded by making internal changes2 federal disaster assistance has long history in 1906 c ongress appropriated 25 million to speed the recovery from the san francisco earthqua ke and subsequent fires since its creation in 1953 sbas di saster loans have contributed to the recovery from disasters that have large impact over large area because sba disaster loans are the federal governments main disaster relief program they are available to individuals businesses regard less of size and nonpr ofits although sba disaster loans are not meant to replace insurance against disasters evidence shows that homeowners do consider flood insurance and disaster loans to be substitutes for each other3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34058crs2 3 continued 1979 pp 496505 4 13 cfr 123104 and 13 cfr 123203 5 some federal emergency management agency programs will accept applications only from those who have been denied disaster loans by the sba reduced interest rates to disaster victims amount to federal grant to those receiving disaster loans all disaster loans carry belowmarket interest rate and borrowers who are unable to obtain credit on similar terms elsewhere pay lower rate than borrowers who can obtai n loans from other sources4 for example sba disaster loans to homeowners to repair their hous following hurricane katrina in 2005 were charged interest rates of 2687 and 5375 in comparison the rates on private sector 30year fixedrate mortgage in the fourth quarter of 2005 ranged from 577 to 633 on an average sba homeowner disaster loan of 45000 this could save the borrower between 100 and 1000 over the 30 year life of the loan according to the sba more than 97 of the disa ster loans made for the 2005 hurricanes were at the lower rate and very few loans were at the statutory maximum sba has more relaxed underwriting standards than private sector lenders but it can and does reject applications when the ability to repay is doubtful5 background most sba programs involve technical assistance grants to nonprofits that provide technical assistance to small busin esses advocacy and guaranteeing private sector disaster loans to sm all businesses but the agency does make disaster loans directly to renters homeowners businesse s and nonprofits these loans are at lower interest rates than can be obtained from private sector lenders and are made to borrowers who cannot obtain private sector loans on similar conditions currently homeowners and renter s may borrow up to 40000 to cover unreimbursed personal property losses following di saster declaration although there are exclusions for unusually expensiv property such as art work homeowners may also borrow up to 200000 to cover unreimbursed real property losses businesses and nonprofits may borrow up to 15 million for unreimbursed real property losses in addition businesse s but not nonprofits may borrow up to 15 million combined with the previously ntioned real property losses for economic injury which is the inability to make nor mal payments for supplies payroll etc overview of congressional proposals hr 1361 as engrossed and s 163 as re ported seek to speed sba processing of disaster loan applications by adding nd reallocating staff to the agencys disaster loan office involving the private sector streamlining processing and increasing congressional oversight both bills also expand the disaster loan programs the bills take different approaches to implementing these goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34058crs3 6 the house bill would allow the administrator to waive the limit in certain cases hr 1361 section

force on funding disaster relief federal disaster assistance 104th cong 1st sess sdoc 1044 washington gpo 1995analysis of additional issues some additional issues that congress might wish to consider are the impact of the disaster loan program on participati on in other government programs and the influence that disaster loans might have on the decisions of people and businesses to locate in disasterprone areas policy analysts frequently examine the relationship between meeting the legitimate needs for assistance following disaster minimizing the cost to the government and taxpay ers and encouragin g prudent behavior58 people and businesses make decisions about where to locate and to undertake economic activity by considering the costs nd benefits of altern ative decisions new or expanded disaster loan program c ould affect these decisions by providing lowcost funds for recovery an enlarged disaster loan program could also affect decisions to engage in pre or postdisa ster mitigation as ntioned earlier some may view disaster loan as good substitute for optional flood insurance analysts view subsidized loan programs as way to transfer risk from the private sector to the government few would argue against this transfer when it is because of the failure of federal programs such as federal levee or dam to perform according to specifications or when the priv ate sector has failed to respond as in the case of flood insurance some might argu that the federal government should not intervene in other cases where alternativ resources including local government or private planning are available in considering whether to extend disaster loan coverage to more types of disasters such as ice storms blizzards and the lack of snow one concern might be if these are normal or regular occurrence that should be anticipated and whether the expansion of the disaster loan progra m would encourage businesses to undertake activities with less regard for the risk than they would without the program expansion for example would including th lack of snow shift ski resort on the margin from adding snow making equipmen t or locating in another location to one that depends on economic injury disaster loans both bills recognize the need for exceptional federal response when the magnitude of the problem is extremely large by historical standards because of the interrelatedness of decisions to rebuild along the gulf coast after the 2005 hurricane season extraordinary federal assistance was offered congress appears to have decided to institutionalize this experien ce by expanding sbas disaster response team and authorizing private sector participation the tw bills differ on what would trigger this response the house bill would trigger the private sectors participation during an incident of national significance or when the average loan processing time for single disaster exceeds 30 days th senate bill would trigger the private sectors response following major disa ster or catastrophic national disaster congress might wish to consider whethe r the new category of catastrophic national disaster is more appropriate than the incident of national significance whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34058crs15 includes many other events be sides natural disasters it might wish to consider whether catastrophic national disaster should be part of the stafford act which might imply that it would be used by othe r disaster response nd recovery programs or if it should be part of the small business act which would imply that it would be used only by sba both bills would create small expedited disaster loans with the rapid approval there will be less time to review the loan applications and it is likely that the loss rate will be higher than on other disaster loan s on the other hand the loans would be smaller which would reduce the dollar amount of losses legislative status hr 1361 was introduced in the house on march 6 2007 the house small
