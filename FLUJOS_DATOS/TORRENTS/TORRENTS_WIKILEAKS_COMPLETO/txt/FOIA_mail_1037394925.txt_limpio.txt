from john ogden jogdenaucklandacnz to itrdbforlistservarizonaedu subject re fwd history and trees date fri 15 nov 2002 161525 1300 replyto grissinoutkuxutccutkedu dear professor savidge hal frittss comments were as always to the point and gracious i have much less patience with your ignorance and arrogance the sampling and statistical procedures involved in the production of crossdated chronology are of course quite different to those used in randomised experiment but they are nonetheless logical rigorous science we have been through all those arguments so many times you are wasting everyones time john ogden on wed 13 nov 2002 131620 0700 harold c fritts hfrittsltrrarizonaedu wrote dear ron i respectfully disagree with you we have reached out to you many times and find little but judgmental response i have worked with this group for many years now and they are just as exact scientists as you they are interested in what the tree tells us about the earth and its history and not as interested and experienced as you in how the tree works i agree with you to the extent that we must understand how the tree works but i fear you have created the reality that dendrochronologists are stupid and beneath your greatness and that it will not ever change people like you in the past such as waldo glock and sampson at berkley ca made similar statements when i was young man i set out trying to examine their criticism objectively with both physiological investigations and statistical analysis i found that these criticisms could be met with data from solid physiological tests and even though those practicing the science at that time were astronomers not physiologists there are talented and insightful people in other sciences outside of plant physiology i am sorry for all of our sakes as the future holds many possibilities with many experts contributing to the future of science if you could only get outside the judgmental ideas that you hold about us i think you might be very surprised and pleased yes i think many in this group oversimplify the response of the tree but in the same way you oversimplify the practice of dendrochronology we all have much to learn from each other but calling each other names doesnt further anyones science i believe science is embarking on course of greater cooperation among different disciplines this implies respect and cooperation in both directions we welcome your interest in dendrochronology but are saddened that you have so little respect for our integrity and honesty it would be more appreciated if we could together work for better future not just quarrel call each other names and delve on what is wrong with the past sincerely regretfully and lovingly hal fritts ps one other comment to my fellow scientists i agree with frank that i have made only start at understanding the basis for tree ring formation it will take much more work in physiology and modeling in current discussions and debates on the importance of physiology and process modeling in dendrochronology understanding plant processes often takes secondary impotence in the eyes of many dendrochronologists i think this will change because i believe in the integrity of my colleagues but i sometimes wonder how long this will take i had at one time hoped that i might see it happen we can answer such criticism but not until we investigate further how the tree responds to its environment and how the tree lays down layers of cells we call the tree ring physiologists outside dendrochronology have little inclination to do it for us as this message reveals we can and must do it ourselves by including welcoming and funding physiological investigation in treering research hcf rod savidge wrote to the editor new york times indeed its activities include subjective interpretations of what does and what does not constitute an annual ring statistical manipulation of data to fulfill subjective expectations and discarding of perfectly good data sets when they contradict other data sets that have already been accepted such massaging of data cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered science it merely demonstrates total lack of rigor attending socalled dendrochronology research i would add that it is the exceptionally rare dendrochronologist who has ever shown any inclination to understand the fundamental biology of wood formation either as regulated intrinsically or influenced by extrinsic factors the science of tree physiology will readily admit that our understanding of how trees make wood remains at quite rudimentary state despite several centuries of research on the other hand there are many hundreds if not thousands of publications by dendrochronologists implicitly claiming that they do understand the biology of wood formation as they have used their data to imagine when past regimes of water temperature pollutants co2 soil nutrients and so forth existed note that all of the counts and measurements on tree rings in the world cannot substantiate anything unequivocally they are merely observations it would be major step forward if dendrochronology could embrace the scientific method

history and trees comments to scitimesnytimescom to itrdbforlistservarizonaedu i was rather horrified by the inaccurate statements about treering dating that you allowed to slip into print in the interview with thomas pakenham today treering science is an exact science none of the data obtained from tree rings would be useful if the dates were inaccurate dendrochronologists dont say much these days about how old trees are because they are interested in more important questions such as what can the tree rings tell us about our planets past you at the new york times should know something about tree rings check on lexisnexis shows that since 1980 you have run more than 100 stories in which the words tree rings appear in full text some of the stories are irrelevant but most are not such as the july 13 2002 story in which you misspell the name of neil pederson at lamontdoherty earth observatory or the march 26 2002 story about medieval climate warming detected in treering data i do not remember treering dating being labeled an inexact science in stories like that did walter sullivan who wrote story about tree rings and drought on september 2 1980 ever question the exact nature of treering dating he didnt seem to question it on june 7 1994 when he wrote story about ash from santorini and said that the ash cloud may have persisted long enough to stunt the growth of oak trees in irish bogs and of bristlecone pines in the white mountains of california producing tightly packed tree rings you really do have to know when those rings were laid down before you can associate them with specific volcanic eruption i tell you what i am member of the national association of science writers as well as working dendrochronologist and occasionally paidup member of the treering society if you feel the need for refresher course on treering dating ill be more than happy to try to introduce you to knowledgeable practioners in you neighborhood such as neil pederson not peterson at
