in public finance government and finance division taxexempt bonds description of state and local government debt summary this report provides information about state and local government debt state and local governments often issue debt instruments in exchange for the use of individuals and businesses savings this debt obligates state and local governments to make interest payments for the use of these savings and to repay at some time in the future the amount borrowed state and local governments finance capital facilities with debt rather than out of current tax revenue in order to match the time pattern of benefits from these capital facilities with the time pattern of tax payments the federal government subsidizes the cost of most state and local debt by excluding the interest income from federal income taxation this tax exemption of interest income is granted because it is believed that state and local capital facilities will be under provided if state and local taxpayers have to pay the full cost state and local debt is issued as bonds to be repaid over period of time greater than one year and perhaps exceeding 20 years and as notes to be repaid within one year general obligation bonds are secured by the promise to repay with general tax revenue and revenue bonds are secured with the promise to use the stream of revenue generated by the facility built with the bond proceeds most debt is issued to finance new capital facilities but some is issued to refund prior bond issue usually to take advantage of lower interest rates taxexempt bonds issued for some activities are classified as governmental bonds and can be issued without federal constraint because most of the benefits from the capital facilities are enjoyed by the general public many taxexempt revenue bonds are issued for activities congress has classified as private because most of the benefits from the activities appear to be enjoyed by private individuals and businesses the annual volume of subset of these taxexempt privateactivity bonds is capped arbitrage bonds devote substantial share of the proceeds to the purchase of assets with higher interest rates than that being paid on the taxexempt bonds such arbitrage bonds are not tax exempt because congress does not want state and local governments to issue taxexempt bonds and use the proceeds to earn arbitrage profits the arbitrage profits could substitute for state and local taxes the major policy issue in this area is the effort to use taxexempt bonds to increase federal financial support for variety of public facilities another policy issue is whether constraints should be relaxed on the types of activities for which state and local governments can issue taxexempt debt the extent to which the current arbitrage bond rules prohibit what some consider legitimate state and local financial behavior is related area of dispute the list of activities that classify tax exempt privateactivity bonds and whether they should be included in the volume cap is another area of controversy this report will be updated as new data become available contents what is debt 1 why do state and local governments issue debt 1 what makes

government debt what is debt individuals and businesses lend their accumulated savings to borrowers in exchange borrowers give lenders debt instrument these debt instruments typically called bonds represent promise by borrowers to pay interest income to lenders on the principal the amount of money borrowed until the principal is repaid to the lenders this principal sometimes called the proceeds generally is used to finance the construction of capital facilities why do state and local governments issue debt since public capital facilities provide services over long period of time it makes financial and economic sense to pay for the facilities over similarly long period of time this is particularly true for state and local governments their taxpayers lay claim to the benefits from these facilities by dint of residency and relinquish their claim to benefits when they move given the demands market oriented society places on labor mobility taxpayers are reluctant to pay today for state and local capital services to be received in the future the rational response of the state or local official concerned with satisfying the preferences of constituents is to match the timing of the payments to the flow of services precisely the function served by longterm bond financing an attempt to pay for capital facilities up front is likely to result in less than optimal rate of public capital formation state and local governments are also faced with the necessity of planning their budget for the year or in some cases for two years this requires balancing of revenue forecasts against forecasts of the demand for services and spending not infrequently the inevitable unforeseen circumstances that undermine any forecast cause revenue shortfall which must be financed with shortterm borrowing or notes in addition even when the forecasts are met the timing of expenditures may precede the arrival of revenues creating the necessity to borrow within an otherwise balanced fiscal year finally temporarily high interest rates that prevail at the time bonds are issued to finance capital project may induce shortterm borrowing in anticipation of drop in rates thus state and local governments have valid reasons to borrow funds in fact these reasons are so universally accepted that both taxpayers and the courts have crs2 ignored the nineteenth century legacy of unrealistically restrictive constitutional and statutory limitations on state and local borrowing1 what makes state and local debt special the federal government has chosen to intervene in the public capital market by granting the debt instruments of state and local governments unique privilege the exemption of interest income earned on these bonds from federal income tax the tax exemption lowers the cost of capital for state and local governments which should then induce an increase in state and local capital formation the lower cost of capital arises because investors would be indifferent between taxable bonds eg corporate bonds that yield 10 rate of return before taxes and taxexempt bonds of equivalent risk that yield 65 return the taxable bond interest earnings carry tax liability 35 of the interest income in most cases making the after tax return on the two bonds identical at 65 thus state and local governments could raise capital from investors at an interest cost 35 percentage points 350 basis points lower than borrower issuing taxable debt generally the degree to which taxexempt debt is favored is measured in two ways the yield spread is the difference between interest rate on corporate bonds and the interest rate on municipal bonds of equivalent risk table 1 lists the average yield on highgrade municipal bonds and aaarated corporate bonds from 1980 to 2007 and the corresponding yield spread the spread grew to high of 343 in 1980 and dropped to low of 094 in 2003 the greater the yield spread the greater is the nominal savings to state and local governments as measured by the interest rates they would have to pay if they financed with taxable debt as the spread approaches zero state and local borrowing costs approach the level of taxable bond interest rates another measure the yield ratio which is an average rate on taxexempt bonds divided by an average rate on corporate bond of like term and risk adjusts the spread for the level of interest rates the lower the ratio the greater the savings to state and local governments relative to taxable debt as the ratio approaches one the cost of taxexempt state and local borrowing approaches that of taxable borrowing as shown in table 1 the ratio was lowest in 1980 at 071 and reached peak of 084 in 1982 for the last decade the ratio has been relatively stable these variations in the cost of state and local borrowing relative to the cost of taxable borrowing depend upon the demand for and supply of both taxexempt and taxable bonds demand for taxexempt bonds depends upon the number of investors their wealth statutory tax rates and alternative investment opportunities supply depends upon the desire of the state and local sector for capital facilities and their ability to engage in conduit financing issuing state or local government bonds and passing the proceeds through to businesses or individuals for their private use 1 dennis zimmerman history of municipal bonds in his the private use of taxexempt bonds controlling the public subsidy of private activity washington the urban institute press 1991 pp 1727 crs3 almost all of the factors which influence demand and supply are

direct cost to the federal government of this interest exclusion is the individual and corporate income tax revenue forgone consider 35 marginal tax rate corporate investor who purchases 65 taxexempt bond with principal of 1000 that is to be repaid after 20 years each year for 20 years this taxpayer receives 65 in taxexempt interest income each year the federal government forgoes collecting 35 of revenue because the revenue loss is based upon the yield the taxpayer forgoes for example if the investor had purchased taxable bond carrying 10 interest rate he would have received 100 in interest income and paid 35 in income taxes on that income2 the annual federal revenue loss or tax expenditure on the outstanding stock of taxexempt bonds is reported in the analytical perspectives section of the budget every year the estimates for the last 14 years are displayed in table 23 because they are based upon the outstanding stock of publicpurpose taxexempt bonds it takes time for some legislative changes to show up in these data the amount of forgone tax revenue from the exclusion of interest income on publicpurpose tax exempt bonds is substantial 235 billion in 2007 table 2 tax expenditure on the outstanding stock of public purpose taxexempt bonds 1994 to 2007 in billions year tax expenditure year tax expenditure 1994 196 2001 274 1995 204 2002 299 1996 249 2003 311 1997 199

preferred alternatives is critical to estimates of the revenue loss from taxexempt bonds an entire range of financial and real assets exists with different yields risk and degree of preferential taxation it is not true that the municipal bond purchasers preferred alternative is always taxable bond 3 these estimates are derived by summing the revenue loss estimates for each activity listed in the tax expenditures budget technically this is incorrect because each activitys revenue loss is calculated in isolation and there are interactive effects nonetheless without an estimate of the interactive effects impact on revenue loss the summing employed here provides the best available order of magnitude crs5 why does the federal government subsidize state and local debt when first introduced in 1913 the federal income tax excluded the interest income earned by holders of the debt obligations of states and their political subdivisions from taxable income it was asserted by many that any taxation of this interest income would be unconstitutional because the exemption was protected by the tenth amendment and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity the us supreme court rejected this claim of constitutional protection in 1988 in south carolina v baker 485 us 505 1988 although the legal basis for the subsidy is statutory rather than constitutional the policy reason for the subsidy is economic economic theory suggests that certain types of goods and services will not be provided in the correct or optimal amounts by the private sector because some of the benefits are consumed collectively street light for example the nations welfare can be increased by public provision of these goods and services and some of these public goods and services are best provided by state or local governments however some of the goods and services provided by state or local governments benefit both residents who pay taxes and nonresidents who pay minimal if any taxes since state and local taxpayers are likely to be unwilling to provide these services to nonresidents without compensation it is probable that state and local services will be under provided in theory the cost reduction provided by the exemption of interest income compensates state and local taxpayers for benefits provided to nonresidents and encourages these governments to provide the optimal amount of public services classifying state and local debt instruments state and local debt can be classified based on 1 the maturity or term which is the length of time before the principal is repaid 2 the type of security which is the financial backing for the debt 3 the use of the proceeds for either new facilities or to refinance previouslyissued bonds and 4 whether the type of activity being financed has public or private purpose another important factor is the level risk just about every bond issued by state or local government is rated based on the probability of default the privately managed rating agencies incorporate all of the above factors as well as the financial health of the entity issuing the bonds when arriving upon bond rating the higher the default risk the lower the rating maturity shortterm vs longterm tax and revenue anticipation notes state and local governments must borrow money for long periods of time and for short periods of time longterm debt instruments are usually referred to as bonds and carry maturities in excess of one year shortterm debt instruments are usually referred to as notes and carry maturities of 12 months or less if the notes are to be paid from specific taxes due in the near future they usually are called tax anticipation notes tans if from anticipated intergovernmental revenue they are called revenue anticipation notes rans if the notes are to be paid from longterm borrowing eg bonds they are crs6 called bond anticipation notes bans tax anticipation notes and revenue anticipation notes are often grouped together and referred to as tax and revenue anticipation notes trans table 3 displays the volume of longterm and short term borrowing since 1980 longterm borrowing dominates state and local debt activity in most years with

interest rates in contrast to longterm fixed rate securities issuers go to auction periodically anywhere from every 7 to 35 days to reset the interest rate on the debt outstanding the auction mechanism and interest rate parameters vary by issuer and issue though most use what is termed dutch auction where each bidder submits bid for the amount they are willing to purchase at given interest rate all bids are ordered from lowest interest rate to highest interest rate and the rate where the market clears eg crs7 where all bonds would be purchased establishes the new ars rate all bidders receive that rate unique features of arss arss typically have call option where the issuer can buy the ars back at par face value at any scheduled auction and then retire the debt most arss are insured by the issuer because they do not carry put option that would allow bondholders to sell the bonds at specified price to the issuer or designated third party the bond insurance reduces risk and thus interest rate making the bonds less costly to issuers for this reason arss are very sensitive to changes in credit ratings and normally require the highest ratings eg aaaaaa to make them marketable this is usually achieved with bond insurance4 failed auction the existing holders of arss offer bids as well as new bidders if all bids of both existing bond holders and new participants fail to clear the market the auction is termed failed auction in this scenario the original agreement with bondholder stipulates reservation interest rate the issuer must pay in the event of failed auction at least until the next successful auction the reservation rate is typically significantly higher than current market interest rates because the rate is higher than market interest rates issuers of arss wish to avoid paying the reservation rate growth of arss the issuance of arss has grown considerably in the last 20 years in 1988 the bond buyer identified one ars issue valued at 25 million none were issued in 19875 in 2004 the peak year 438 ars bonds valued at 425 billion were issued the number of arss issues has since dropped to 322 and 387 billion in 2007 security general obligation revenue and lease rental bonds another important characteristic of taxexempt bonds is the security provided to the bondholder general obligation go bonds pledge the full faith and credit of the issuing government the issuing government makes an unconditional pledge to use its powers of taxation to honor its liability for interest and principal repayment revenue bonds or nonguaranteed debt pledge only the earnings from revenue producing activities most often the earnings from the facilities being financed with the revenue bonds should these earnings prove to be inadequate to honor these commitments the issuing government is under obligation to use its taxing powers to finance the shortfall some revenue bonds are issued with credit enhancements provided by insurance or bank letters of credit that guarantee payment upon such revenue shortfall 4 douglas skarr california debt and investment advisory commission auction rate securities issue brief aug 2004 pp 23 5 the bond

2007 and earlier editions all taxexempt interest income attributable to state and local governments does not appear in the form of bonds governments may engage in installment purchase contracts and finance leases for which the portion of the installment or lease payment to vendor is tax exempt for example computer equipment or road building equipment could be leased from vendor using rental agreement or an installment crs9 sales contract under this type of agreement the monthly payments to the vendor are large enough to cover the vendors interest expense on the funds borrowed to purchase the equipment which was leased to the government this portion that is attributable to interest income is not included in the vendors taxable income such transactions are often referred to as municipal leasing lease rental revenue bonds and certificates are variations on revenue bonds an authority or nonprofit corporation issues bonds builds facility with the proceeds and leases the facility to municipality security for the bonds or certificates is based on the lease payments when the bonds are retired the facility belongs to the lessee the municipality an advantage to this type of arrangement is that many states constitutional and statutory definitions do not consider this type of financing to be debt because the lease payments are annual operating expenses based upon appropriated monies the leasing technique has also been used to provide taxexempt funds to nonprofit organizations municipality issues the bonds for the construction of facility that is leased to nonprofit hospital or university again security for the bonds is based on the lease payments use of the proceeds newissue vs refunding bonds longterm taxexempt bond issues also can be characterized by their status as new issues or refunding issues new issues represent bonds issued to finance new capital facilities refundings usually are made to replace outstanding bonds with bonds that carry lower interest rates or other favorable terms as such the refunding bonds usually do not add to the stock of outstanding bonds or the capital stock the proceeds of the refunding bonds are used to pay off the remaining principal of the original bond issue which is retired advance refunding bonds however do add to the outstanding stock of bonds without adding to the stock of capital advance refunding bonds are issued prior to the date on which the original bonds are refunded so that for period of time there are two bond issues outstanding to finance the same capital facilities the last two columns of table 4 show the dollar value of refunding issues and their share of total longterm bond volume the share varies widely depending to great extent on changes in the relative magnitudes of taxable and taxexempt interest rates note that the 1993 increase in the top marginal individual income tax rates may have increased the demand for taxexempt bonds higher tax rates make taxexempt bonds more attractive relative to taxable bonds all other things being equal the increased demand and accompanying lower interest rates may have prompted state and local governments to replace outstanding issues with refunding bonds that carried lower interest rates in contrast refundings dropped considerably in 1999 and 2000 the decline could have been in response to higher interest rates or to strong economic conditions in most states which minimized the need for debt finance generally the story is reversed from 2001 to 2003 as the economy slowed and state budgets were strained by lower tax revenue collections new issues in 2003 were more than double the amount of new issues in 2000 in 2005 go bonds and refunding bond volume peaked likely reflecting the historically low interest rates on taxexempt debt see table 1 crs10 public purpose vs private purpose an important characteristic of taxexempt bonds is the purpose or activity for which the bonds are issued most of the tax legislation pertaining to taxexempt bonds over the last 30 years reflects an effort to restrict tax exemption to bonds issued for activities that satisfy some broadly defined public purpose that is for which federal taxpayers are likely to receive substantial benefits bonds are considered to be for public purpose if they satisfy either of two criteria less than 10 of the proceeds are used directly or indirectly by nongovernmental entity or less than 10 of the bond proceeds are secured directly or indirectly by property used in trade or business bonds that satisfy either of these tests are termed governmental bonds and can be issued without federal limit bonds that fail both of these tests are termed privateactivity bonds pabs because they provide significant benefits to private individuals or businesses these projects are ineligible for taxexempt financing activities which fail the two tests but are considered to provide both public and private benefits have been termed eligible or qualified pabs these selected activities can be financed with taxexempt bonds table 5 provides the dollar value of new issues of taxexempt privateactivity bonds and their share of total private

capacity for selected activities and issuers brief description of legislation that congress has enacted since 2001 follows below economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 as part of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 new type of taxexempt privateactivity bond was created beginning on january 1 20028 the act expanded the definition of an exempt facility bond to include bonds 7 this does not mean governmental ownership in the conventional sense it simply means that lease arrangements for private management and operation of bondfinanced facilities must be structured to deny accelerated depreciation benefits to the private operator lease length must conform to the facilitys expected service life and any sale of the facility to the private operator must be made at fair market value 26 irc section 146g 8 for more extensive explanation of the tax exempt bond provisions in egtrra see crs continued crs13 issued for qualified public educational facilities bonds issued for qualified educational facilities are not counted against states privateactivity volume cap however the qualified public educational facility bonds have their own volume capacity limit equal to the greater of 10 multiplied by the state population or 5 million since nearly all states would be better off with the 10 per capita limit the potential new debt would have been approximately 28 billion in 2001 if the bonds were available in 2001 job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 the jcwa 2002 pl 107147 created the new york liberty zone nylz in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the legislation included several tax benefits for the nylz intended to foster economic revitalization within the nylz specifically the socalled liberty bond program allows new york state in conjunction and coordination with new york city to issue up to 8 billion of tax exempt privateactivity bonds for qualified facilities in the nylz qualified facilities follow the exempt facility rules within section 142 of the irc the original deadline to issue the bonds was january 1 2005 but was extended to january 1 2010 by pl 108311 american jobs creation act in 2004 the american jobs creation act pl 108357 created bonds for qualified green building and sustainable design projects the bonds are exempt from the state volume cap and are instead limited to an aggregate of 2 billion for bonds issued between january 1 2005 and october 1 2009 the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act of 2005 this legislation created new type of taxexempt private activity bond for the construction of rail to highway or highway to rail transfer facilities the national limit is 15 billion and the bonds are not subject to state volume caps for private activity bonds the secretary of transportation allocates the bond authority on projectbyproject basis gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 the hurricanes that struck the gulf region in late summer 2005 prompted congress to create taxadvantaged economic development zone intended to encourage investment and rebuilding in the gulf region the gulf opportunity zone goz is comprised of the counties where the federal emergency management agency fema declared the inhabitants to be eligible for individual and public assistance based on proportion of state personal income the katrinaaffected portion of the goz represents approximately 73of louisianas economy 69 of mississippis and 18 of alabamas9 specifically the gulf opportunity zone act of 2005 goza 2005 pl 109 135 contains two provisions that would expand the amount of privateactivity bonds 8 continued report rs20932 taxexempt bond provisions in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 by steven maguire 9 see crs report rl33154 the impact of hurricane katrina on the state budgets of alabama louisiana and mississippi by steven maguire crs14 outstanding and language to relax the eligibility rules for mortgage revenue bonds the most significant is the provision to increase the volume cap see table 3 for privateactivity bonds issued for hurricane katrina recovery in alabama louisiana and mississippi identified as the gulf opportunity zone or go zone goza 2005 would add 2500 per person in the federally declared katrina disaster areas in which the residents qualify for individual and public assistance the increased volume capacity would add approximately 22 billion for alabama 78 billion for louisiana and 48 billion for mississippi in aggregate over the next five years the legislation defines qualified project costs that can be financed with the bond proceeds as 1 the cost of any qualified residential rental project 26 sec 142d and 2 the cost of acquisition construction reconstruction and renovation of i nonresidential real property including fixed improvements associated with such property and ii public utility property 26 sec 168i10 in the goz the additional capacity would have to be issued before january 1 2011 the provision is estimated to cost 1556 billion over the 20062015 budget window10 the second provision allows for advance refunding of certain taxexempt bonds under goza 2005 governmental bonds issued by alabama louisiana and mississippi may be advance refunded an additional time and exempt facility private activity bonds for airports docks and wharves once privateactivity bonds are otherwise not eligible for advance refunding see earlier discussion of advance refunding what are arbitrage bonds many individuals and businesses make money by engaging in arbitrage borrowing money at one interest rate and lending that borrowed money to others at higher interest rate the difference between the rate at which one borrows and the rate at which one lends produces arbitrage earnings at its most basic level it is the primary activity of commercial banks pay depositors an interest rate of x and use the deposits to make commercial automobile and home loans at x interest rate in this context arbitrage is timehonored and appropriate financial market activity that is not the case in the taxexempt bond market state and local governments do not pay federal income tax and absent federal constraint have unlimited capacity to issue debt at low interest rates and reinvest the bond proceeds in higheryielding taxable debt instruments thereby earning arbitrage profits unchecked state and local governments could substitute arbitrage earnings for substantial portion of their own citizens tax effort 10 the 10year revenue loss estimates for goza 2005 are from the joint committee on taxation estimated revenue effects of hr 4440 thegulf opportunity tax relief act of 2005 as passed by the house of representatives and the senate on dec 16 2005 jcx89 05 dec 20 2005 crs15 congress has decided that such arbitrage should be limited and that taxexempt bond proceeds must be used as quickly as possible to pay contractors for the construction of the capital facilities for which the bonds were issued since it is impossible for bonds to be issued precisely when contractors must be paid for their expenses incurred in building public capital facilities the tax law provides threeyear period to spend an increasing share of the bond proceeds bond issues that have unspent proceeds in excess of the allowed amounts during this threeyear spend down schedule must rebate any arbitrage earnings to the department of the treasury bond issues are considered to be taxable arbitrage bonds if governmental unit in violation of the arbitrage restriction in the tax code invested substantial portion of the proceeds to acquire higher yielding investments or to replace funds which were used directly or indirectly to acquire higher yielding investments11 what are tax credit bonds the 1997 taxpayer relief act created new category of tax preferred state and local bonds the qualified zone academy bond qzab for renovating public school facilities congress authorized qzab debt of 400 million year for 1998 through 2005 or 32 billion over the eight years the annual limit is allocated among the states in proportion to their share of all individuals below the poverty line12 in 2005 congress created two new types of tax credit bonds called clean renewable energy bonds crebs and gulf tax credit bonds gtcbs crebs were created with the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 pl 1095813 the bonds are intended to encourage the development of renewable energy sources as with qzabs purchasers of crebs receive federal tax credits in lieu of interest payments and the borrower only repays the principal the total creb bond volume is limited to 800 million nationally and the bonds must be issued before january 1 2008 only 500 million may be allocated to qualified projects of qualified borrowers which are governmental bodies14 in addition third party must spend at least 10 of the proceeds of the issue for the bond to qualify the third party would likely be private business or individual that would benefit from the creb expenditures after hurricane katrina congress created yet another tax credit bond called gulf tax credit bonds gtcbs these tax credit bonds are different from the others in that the maturity is capped at two years and only three states can issue limited amount alabama 50 million louisiana 200 million and mississippi 100 million the tax credit rate will approximate the interest rate on equivalent twoyear taxable securities in addition gtcbs require an equal match from the issuing state the proceeds from the bonds can be used to pay principal interest or 11 26 irc section 148a 12 for more detailed explanation of tax credit bonds or qzabs see crs report rs20606 tax credit bonds brief explanation by steven maguire 13 119 stat 594 14 119 stat 994 crs16 premiums on state governmental bonds or make loans to any political subdivision of the state to then be used to pay principal interest or premiums on the political subdivisions governmental bonds the bonds can only be issued in 2006 the subsidy for tax credit bonds is not provided in the form of the exemption of interest income from federal income tax as is true for taxexempt bonds including bonds issued for public elementary and secondary education facilities rather the subsidy for them is credit taken by eligible financial institutions against the federal taxes they owe the credit rate is calculated by the treasury department such that the bonds can be issued without discount and without any interest cost to the issuer unlike qzabs where issuers are chosen by the state issuers of crebs are selected by the secretary of treasury for gtcbs the governor of the issuing state designates the use of the bond proceeds one way to think of this alternative subsidy is that financial institutions can be induced to purchase these bonds if they receive the same aftertax return from the tax credit bonds that they would from the tax exemption the value of the credit must be included in taxable income but is then used to reduce regular or alternative minimum tax liability assuming the taxpayer is subject to the regular corporate income tax the credit rate should equal the ratio of the purchasers forgone market interest rate on taxexempt bonds divided by one minus the corporate tax rate for example if the taxexempt interest rate is 6 and the corporate tax rate is 35 the credit rate would be equal to 0061035 or about 92 thus financial institution purchasing 1000 tax credit bond would receive 92 tax credit for each year it holds the bond the implicit subsidy is much greater for tax credit bonds than for taxexempt bonds all of the interest costs for tax credit bonds are paid by the federal taxpayer for taxexempt bonds the federal taxpayer absorbs only the difference between the taxable and taxexempt interest rates for example if the taxable rate is 92 and the taxexempt rate is 6 the nontax credit bond receives subsidy equal to 32 percentage points the difference between 92 and 6 the tax credit bond receives subsidy equal to all 92 percentage points the relationship between three types of bonds all with the same aftertax yield of 6 is presented in table 8 the most important column is the last titled implicit subsidy to borrower which is synonymous with the federal revenue loss presented in table 2 for all outstanding taxexempt debt the implicit subsidy is the amount the borrower saves because of favorable federal tax treatment in the case of tax credit bonds the subsidy is considerably greater than with traditional tax exempt bonds crs17 table 8 comparison of three types of bonds with 6 aftertax yield numbers are in percentage of bond proceeds assuming corporate taxpayer is in the 35 marginal tax bracket federal tax implicit type of borrower lender taxes paid revenue subsidy to bond pays receives by lender from bond borrower taxable 92 92 32 32 00 taxexempt 60 60 00 00 32 tax credit 00 92a 32b 60b 92 the lender is allowed to reduce its tax liability by the amount of the credit b the federal government receives some additional tax revenue because the credit is included in taxable income however the loss in revenue from the credit exceeds the revenue gain producing the negative revenue effect legislative issues current legislative interest focuses on altering the tax treatment of state and local debt to provide even greater financial support for variety of public projects such as education infrastructure healthcare facilities and rapid transit there are several ways the federal government can increase the federal subsidy to state and local governments that issue taxexempt bonds for these targeted purposes one arbitrage rules could be loosened to allow the state or local government to earn more investment income on unused bond proceeds less stringent arbitrage rules may also reduce the compliance burden of some smaller government entities freeing more funds for the project two the federal government can change the rules for private activities that qualify for taxexempt financing if more activities qualified to use taxexempt debt finance by virtue of any proposed rules changes previous congressional efforts to limit the use of taxexempt debt for nongovernmental projects would be mitigated third congress could introduce new type of tax favored instrument such as tax credit bonds for broader range of activities in addition to the three options highlighted above many other methods can be employed to enhance the federal subsidy for state and local government capital formation the desire to subsidize state and local capital formation which in many cases may be justified must be weighed against the federal revenue loss and the potential for misallocation of federal tax revenue crs18 suggested readings ballard frederic l jr abcs of arbitrage tax rules for investment of
