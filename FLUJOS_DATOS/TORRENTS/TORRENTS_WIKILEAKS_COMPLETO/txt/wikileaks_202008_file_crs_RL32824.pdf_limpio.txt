divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32824federal crime control background legislation and issues summary states and localities have the primary responsibility for prevention and control of domestic crime as crime became more rampant the federal government increased its involvement in crime contro l efforts over period of 10 years congress passed five major anticrime bills and increased appropriations for federal assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies since the 911 terrorist attacks however federal law enforcemen t efforts have been focused more on countering terrorism and maintaining ho meland security amid these efforts however congress continues to ddress many crimerelated issues many have attributed the increased attention the federal government gave to crime issues in the 1980s and 1990s to the ri sing crime rate th violent crime rate for example began to increase in the 1960s continuing to rise in the mid1990s before starting to decline in the late1990s the continued decline in the violent crime rate in the early 2000s coincided w ith national attenti on being focused away from domestic crimes and more on securing the homeland against terrorism during this period congress began to increase fede ral funding to homel and securityrelated activities in 2005 however the violent crime rate began to increase and continued to increase in 2006 before declining again in 2007 the increase in the violent crime rate in 2005 and 2006 however continues to remain at an over 30 year low the 110th congress is considering variet of crimerelated legislation

the crime control act of 1990 pl 101647 and the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322federal crime control background legislation and issues introduction the prevention and control of domestic crime has traditionally been responsibility of state and local government s with the federal government playing more of supportive role the federal government increased its involvement in domestic law enforcement through series of grant programs to encourage and assist states and communities in their efforts to control crime and in the expansion in the number of offenses that could be prosecuted in the federal criminal justice system over 10year period 19841994 cong ress enacted five major anticrime bills1 and increased appropriations for federal assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies as result the federal bureau of investigation fbi had seen an expansion of its role in fightin g domestic crime as congress began to add more crimes to the federa l criminal code that were previously under the sole jurisdiction of state and local governments within the past several years however some federal assistance to state and local law enforcement has declined and the fbi refocused its resources on countering terrori sm as federal post911 law enforcement efforts have focused primar ily on protecting the nation against terrorist attacks the policy question facing congress is what is the role of the federal government in crime control specific questions related to this issue include the following should federal jurisdiction over hate crimes be broadened should the department of justices doj community oriented policing services cops pr ogram be restructured should the federal government pr ovide additional and new funding for court security and states victimwitness protection programs should the federal government play larger role in reintegrating ex offenders into the community should the federal government play larger role in prosecuting identity theft and how should it treat restitution for victims should the federal mandatory min imum penalties for crack and powder cocaine be equitablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32824crs2 2

government provi funding to ai d state local and tribal governments maintain the fugitive database should congress exercise its oversig ht role of several department of justice grant programs including the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant jag and the community oriented policing services cops grant program this report focuses on the aforementioned crimerelated issues and legislation that have been acted upon in the 110th congress this report however does not cover issues related to homeland secur ity terrorism abortion and gun control2 crime statistics3 as previously mentioned the preventi on and control of domestic crime has traditionally been responsibility of state and local governments with the federal government playing more supportive role the federal govern ment began to take more direct role in crime control however as the violent crime rate increased and some questioned the ability of state and local law enforcement to combat the growing problem with limited resources at their disposal the federal bureau of investigations fbi uniform crime report ucr program compiles data from monthly reports transmitted directly to the fbi from approximately 17000 local police departments or state agencies of interest tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32824crs3 4 us department of justice office of ju stice programs bureau of justice statistics crime and victims statistics available online at httpwwwojpusdojgovbjscvicthtm 5 although not discussed in this report the property crime rate during the period examined tended to closely trend the violent crime ratelawmakers are the two indices of crimes that are the basis of the ucr the part i index includes the four major violent crimes of homicide and nonnegligent manslaughter forcible rape robbery and aggravated ssault the part ii index includes the property crimes of burglary larcenytheft motor vehicle theft and arson the ucr collects crime data from th various state and cal law enforcement agencies and presents it in variety of formats in the ucr the data on which the crime rates are derived are crime incidents reported to the police as opposed to arrests made by police or cases cleared by the police although the ucr is most commonly refe renced when discussing crime rates another measurement is worth noting the national crime victim survey ncvs which is administered by the department of justice doj bureau of justice statistics bjs is comprehensive nationwide survey of victimization in the united states since not all crimes are reported to local law enforcement ncvs data attempts to address underreporting issues in the ucr by asking respondents if they have been victimized any time in the past year each year data are obtained from nationally representative sample of 77200 households comprising nearly 134000 persons on the frequency characteristics and consequences of criminal victimization in the united states4 the ncvs asks respondents if th ey have been the victim of rape sexual assault robbery assa ult theft household burglary and motor vehicle theft ncvs data allows doj bureau of justi ce statistics bjs to estimate the likelihood of victimization for the popula tion as whole as well as for segments of the population such as women the elderly mbers of various racial groups city dwellers or other groups for the most part the ncvs genera lly trends similar to the ucr for the purpose of this report however we will be presenting and analyzing crime rates as reported by the ucr program violent crime rate according to the ucr the violent crime rate began to increase sharply in the 1960s the increase continued throughout the 1970s and into the early 1990s by the mid1990s however the violent crime rate began to decline see figure 1 while the violent crime rate continued to decline overall into the new millennium it increased slightly in 2005 and 2006 however began to decline once again in 2007 despite the slight increases in the vi olent crime rate in 2005 and 2006 the rate remained at 30year low5 the decline in the crime rate has led recen t congresses in part to take another look at federal f unding for state and local law enforcement despite the declining crime rate however congress continued to pass get tough measures for certain categories of offenders by increasing existing penalties or creating new categories of penalties ie mandatory minimum sentences following is discussion of legislation that has seen legislative action in the 110th congress and selected crime related issues that could warra nt congressional considerationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32824crs4 6 for additional information and legislation in the 110th congress on hate crimes see crs report rl33403 hate crime legislation by william j krousesource fbis ucr for each respective year see 2007 federal bureau of investigation us department of justice crime in the united states uniform crime report hate crimes6 under current federal law hate crimes are limited to certain civil rights offenses the issue facing congress is whether it shoul d consider legislati on to broaden federal jurisdiction over hate crimes by establishing additional categories of hate crime offenses that could be prosecuted in federal court in 2006 there were 7722 reported incidents of hate crimes before crime is labeled hate crime law enforcement must reveal sufficient eviden ce to lead reasonable person to conclude that the offenders actions were motivated in whole or in part by his or her bias there is little disagreement that some criminal acts are motivated due to bias based on race religion sexual orient ation or ethnicity there is however disagreement with respect to the level of federal intervention while some argue that greater federal involvement would ensure that ch crimes are systematically addressed others contend that federa l involvement would be redunda nt to the legal prohibitions for these crimes in their traditional form that already exist under either federal or state law for several congresses attempts had been made to stiffen penalties for crimes of violence motivated by bias the 110th congress is considering such legislation and on may 3 2007 the house passed the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act of 2007 hr 1592 0100200300400500600700800

through fy20098 in addition to reauthorizing the program the act consolidated the cops program into single grant program prior to this the cops program consisted of veral different subgra nt programs the 110th congress however is considering legisl ation that would restructure and further reauthorize the cops program two bills have seen legislative action thus far on may 15 2007 the house passed

critical evidence10 it can also reduce public confidence in the criminal justice system and create the perception that the criminal justi ce system cannot protect citizens witness intimidation can be the result of actual or perceived threats from an offender or his associates but it can also be the result of more general community norms that discourage residents from cooperating with the police or

estimates that over 60 of all released prisoners will commit new offences within three years of their release the issue facing congress is how to manage this population once they have been released from custody there has been recent discussion of reinstating parole at the federal level for nonviolent drug offenders and creating and nhancing existing programs th at are designed to provide assistance for offenders to prepare them for reentry into their communities many studies have shown that reentry initiatives that combine work training and placement with counseling and housing assistance can significantly reduce recidivism rates within the federal government and the academic community broad consensus exists that offender reentry can typically be divided into three phases programs that prepare offenders to reenter society while they are in prison programs that connect exoffenders with services immediately after they are released from prison and programs that provide longterm support and supervision for exoffenders as they settle into communities permanently both the presidents serious and violent offender reentry initiative and recent congressional appropriations

force authored strategic plan for combating identity theft in which it recommended that congress close gaps in the federal criminal statues to more effectively prosecute identity theftrelated offenses16 legislation enacted in the 110th congress addresses several of these recommendations the identity theft forcement and restitution act of 2008 title ii of pl 110326 was signed in to law on

mandatory minimum sentencing laws requi re offenders to be imprisoned for specified period of time for committing certain types of crimes while the intent of mandatory minimum sentencing and other similar measures is to punish the most serious offenders by incarcerating them for long periods critics contend that the laws are disproportionately applie d to nonviolent minority offe nders while this debate tends to focus on nonviolent drug offenses it is especially apparent they argue with the crack versus powder cocaine sent encing disparities proponents however contend that mandatory minimums decrease crime and ensure certainty in the criminal jus tice system in addition to serving as specific deterrent pr oponents argue that these measures serve as general deterrent to potential criminals the 1986 and 1988 antidrug abuse acts pl 99570 and pl 100690 respectively played pivotal roles in the current mandatory minimum sentencing structure applicable to federal drug offenses the 1986 act created mandatory minimum sentences for certain illicit drugs that are based on the quantity and type of drug involved in trafficking offenses the act however is most notable for its establishment of what has come to be known as the 100to1 quantity ratio between powder and crack cocaine17 the 1988 act required mandatory minimum sentence for first time offense of simple possession of crack cocaine possession of more than 5 grams of crack cocaine is punish able under the act by minimum of five years congress through the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 199418 directed the us sentencing commission commission to study the difference in penalties for powder and crack cocaine offenses congress was concerned that the penalties for crack and powder cocaine were having disproportionate effect on minority offenders in 1995 1997 2002 and 2007 the commission reported to congress19 on the disparity in penalties for crack and powder cocaine offenses in the first report the commission called for congress to equalize the quantities between crack and powder cocaine that trigger mandatory minimum penalty however in th eir 2002 and 2007 reports the co mmission recommended that the 5year and 10year trigger quantities for crack cocaine be raised but not to the level of powder cocaine while th penalties remain in place at the federal level some states have

prevention act jjdpa reauthorization24 as more focus is being placed on young offenders some have questioned the way in which the united states treats this population in the nations criminal justice systems over the past thirty years the federal juvenile justice system has generally moved from focus on rehabilitation to fo cus on holding juveniles accountable for their actions in larger sense this is the underlying tension that drives the national debate surrounding the juvenile justice system rehab ilitation versus retribution this debate may come into focus again because the authorization for the juvenile justice delinquency and prevention act jjdpa expired in 2007 it has not been reauthorized thus far in the 110th congress although its major programs have continued to receive appropr iations the last time the jjdpa was reauthorized during the 107th congress in 2002 pl 107273 restructured many of the grant programs aimed at preven ting juvenile delinquency repealed large number of smaller grant programs and consolidated mo st of their purpose areas into one large block grant that included accountability nd graduated sanctions many of the programs that were repealed however continued to receive annual appropriations even as the overall juvenile justice appr opriation has decreased by over 50 the theme of holding juveniles accountable for the crimes they commit continued into the 108th and 109th congresses as several pieces of legislation attempted to lower the age of culpability for certain gangrelated offenses the core issues in the larger juvenile justice debate will remain the same during the 110th congress whether rehabilitation s hould be the drivin g theme in the handling and processing of young offende rs through the criminal justice system or whether more punitive approach that emphasizes young offenders responsibility for the crimes they commit should be the focus another issue that may arisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32824crs12

debate at the core of the debate is fpis preferential treatment over the private sector fpis enabling legislation and the federal acquisition regulation require federal agencies with the exception of the department of defense to procure products offered by fpi unless authorized by fpi to solicit bids from the private sector it is this mandatory source clause that has drawn controversy over the years and is the subject of current legislation although federal agen cies are not required to procure services provided by fpi they are encouraged to do so although the administration ma several efforts to m itigate the competitive advantage fpi has over the private sector congress has taken legislative action to lessen such impact on the private sector for example in 2002 and 2003 congress passed legislation that modified fpis mandatory source clause with respect to procurements made by the department of defense and the central intelligence agency46 and in recent years congress passe d

addition to the aforementioned legi slation other crimere lated issues have surfaced during the 110th congress as discussed below federal sentencing structure48 in 1984 congress passed legislation that led to the creation of federal sentencing guidelines the sentencing reform act of 1984 chapter ii of the comprehensive crime control act of 1984 pl 98473 in essence eliminated indeterminate sentencing at the federal level the act created the united states sentencing commission commission an independent body within the judicial branch of the federal government and charged it with promulgating guidelines for federal sentencing the purpose of th commission was to examine unwarranted disparity in federal sentencing policy among other things49 in establishing sentencing guidelines for federal judg the commission took into consideration factors such as 1 the nature and degree of harm caused by the offense 2 the offenders prior record 3 public views of the gravity of the offense 4 the deterrent effect of particular sent ence and 5 aggravating or mitigating circumstances50 in addition to these factors the commission also considered characteristics of the offender such as age education vocati onal skills and mental or emotional state among other things51 prior to the recent supreme court ruling us v booker see discussion below the guide lines were binding and they werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32824crs19 52 mandatory minimum sentencing laws are sepa rate from the federal sentencing guidelines over the years congress has directed the us sentencing commission to integrate mandatory minimum penalties it has passed into the federal sentencing guidelines 53 see us v booker 125 sct 738 2005 54 according to the ruling provision in cu rrent law makes the guidelines binding on all judges the provision 18 usc 3553b requi res courts to impose sentence within the applicable guidelines range 55 see 18 usc 3742e 56 while the court struck down provision th at made the federal sentencing guidelines mandatory the court also noted that current w requires judges to take account of the guidelines together with othe r sentencing goals see 18 usc 3553a the court also struck down provision that governed the sta ndard of appellate review of sentences that were imposed as result of judges departure from the guidelines the court noted however that current law continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions irrespective of whether the trial judge sentence s within or outside the guidelines range see 18 usc 3742ab 57 see for example erik luna misguided gu idelines critique of federal sentencing policy analysis 458 november 1 2002also subject to statutory directives including mandatory minimum penalties for specific offenses set by congress52 on january 12 2005 the us supreme c ourt ruled that the sixth amendment right to trial by jury requires that the current federal sentencing guidelines be advisory rather than mandatory53 in doing so the court struck down provision in law that made the federal sentencing guidelines mandatory54 as well as provision that governed the standards of appellate review of departures from the guidelines55 in essence the courts ruling gives federa l judges discretion in sentencing offenders by not requiring them to adhere to th guidelines unless the offense carried mandatory sentence rather the guidelines can be used by judges on an advisory basis56 as result of the ruling judges now have discretion in sentencing defendants unless the offense carries mandatory sentence as specified in the law while some view the ruling as an opport unity for federal judges to take into consideration the circumstances unique to each individual offender thus handing down sentence that better fits the offender others fear that such discretion may result in unwarranted disparity and inconsistencies in sentencing across jurisdictions that led to the enactment of the guidelines in 198457 as result of the ruling many stioned whether congress should amend current law to require federal judges to follow guided sentences or permit federal judges to use their discretion in senten cing under certain circumstances possible congressional options include 1 amend the sentencing ranges by increasing the top of each guideline range to the statutory maximum for each given offense 2 require jury trial or defendant waiver for any enhancement factor that would increase the sentence for which the defendant did not wa ive his rights or 3 take action thus permitting judicial discretion in sentencing in cases where congress has not specified mandatory sentenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32824crs20 maintaining the fugitive database on september 18 2008 the senate judiciary committee amended and
