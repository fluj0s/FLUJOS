costsharing options and recent state actions to implement these provisions and will be updated as additional activity warrants in health insurance beneficiaries may face two types of outofpocket payments 1 participationrelated costsharing typically in the form of monthly premiums regardless of whether services are utilized and 2 servicerelated costsharing which consists of payments made directly to providers at the time of service delivery such beneficiary costsharing under medicaid is described below participationrelated costsharing in order to obtain health insurance generally enrollees may be required to pay monthly premiums andor less frequently enrollment fees such charges are prohibited under traditional medicaid for most eligibility groups nominal amounts set in regulations ranging from 1 to 19 per month depending on monthly family income and size can be collected from 1 certain families moving from welfare to work who qualify for transitional assistance under medicaid and 2 pregnant women and infants with annual family income exceeding 150 of the federal poverty level fpl or for example about 19800 for family of two crs2 premiums and enrollment fees can exceed these nominal amounts for other specific groups for example for certain individuals who qualify for medicaid due to high outof pocket medical expenses states may implement monthly fee as an alternative to meeting financial eligibility thresholds by deducting medical expenses from income ie the spend down method costsharing is not capped for workers with disabilities and income up to 250 fpl premiums cannot exceed 75 of income for other workers with disabilities and income between 250 and 450 fpl if state covers both groups the same costsharing rules must apply finally some groups covered by medicaid through certain waivers can be charged premiums that exceed nominal amounts under dra authority the general rules regarding applicable premiums are specified for three income ranges for individuals with income under 100 fpl and between 100 to 150 fpl premiums are prohibited like traditional medicaid other specific groups eg some children pregnant women individuals with special needs are also exempt from paying premiums under the new dra option for persons with income above 150 fpl dra places limits on the amount of premiums that may be charged for the most part premiums are not used under traditional medicaid except for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22578 workers with disabilities and waiver populations among the four states idaho kansas kentucky and west virginia with approval for alternative dra benefit packages only kentucky imposes monthly premiums 1 20family with children with income over 150 fpl who are enrolled in the state childrens health insurance program schip additional details below and 2 up to 30family not to exceed 3 of the adjusted average monthly income during the last six months of transitional medicaid for working families with income over 100 fpl servicerelated costsharing beneficiary outofpocket payments to providers at the time of service can take three forms deductible is specified dollar amount paid for all services rendered during specific time period eg per month or year before health insurance eg medicaid begins to pay for care coinsurance is specified percentage of the cost or charge for specific service rendered copayment is specified dollar amount for each item or service delivered while deductibles and coinsurance are rarely used in traditional medicaid copayments are applied to some services and groups the appendix table provides comparison of the maximum charges allowed for servicerelated costsharing under traditional medicaid dra and schip schip is capped federal grant that allows states to cover lowincome uninsured children in families with income above medicaid eligibility thresholds children may be enrolled in separate schip programs for which schip rules apply shown in the appendix table or in medicaid for which traditional medicaid or dra rules apply some states eg kentucky have both types of schip programs medicaid expansion and separate schip program for which children with the highest income levels are enrolled in the separate program servicerelated costsharing under separate schip programs generally parallels the rules under traditional medicaid for lowerincome subgroups there are limits specified for higherincome subgroups total schip costsharing is capped at 5 of family income per eligibility period crs3 servicerelated costsharing under traditional medicaid is prohibited for the following specific groups and services 1 children under 18 2 pregnant women for pregnancyrelated services 3 services provided to certain institutionalized individuals 4 individuals receiving hospice care 5 emergency services and 6 family planning services and supplies for most other groups and services nominal amounts are allowed for example nominal copayments specified in regulations range from 050 to 3 depending on the payment for the item or service these nominal amounts will be increased by medical inflation beginning in 2006 regulations not yet released under the dra option certain groups and services are also exempt from the service related costsharing provisions these exemptions are nearly identical to those under traditional medicaid however under traditional medicaid all children under 18 are exempt while under dra only children covered under mandatory eligibility groups the lowest income categories and certain foster careadoption assistance youth are exempt also groups exempted from the general servicerelated costsharing provisions under dra may nonetheless be subject to costsharing for nonemergency services provided in hospital emergency room er andor for prescribed drugs see the appendix table under schip only american indian and alaskan native children are exempt from cost httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22578 sharing and costsharing is also prohibited for wellbaby and wellchild services among the four states with approval for alternative benefit packages via dra only kentucky includes costsharing for participants summarized in table 1 for many services across the four kentucky plans there is costsharing for beneficiaries when applicable copayments for selected noninstitutional services acute inpatient hospital care and for generic and preferred brandname drugs are very similar to the maximums allowed under traditional medicaid for nonpreferred brandname drugs and for non emergency care in an er 5 coinsurance charge will be applicable in most cases for all four kentucky plans the maximum annual outofpocket expense per member is 225 for health care services and 225 for prescriptions additionally under dra the total aggregate amount of all costsharing premiums plus servicerelated charges cannot exceed 5 of family income applied on monthly or quarterly basis as specified by the state under kentuckys dra spa this limit is applied on quarterly basis consequences for failure to pay costsharing the rules governing consequences for failure to pay premiums differ somewhat under traditional medicaid and dra under traditional medicaid for certain groups of pregnant women and infants for whom monthly premiums may be charged states cannot require prepayment but may terminate medicaid eligibility when failure to pay such premiums continues for at least 60 days in contrast under dra states may condition medicaid coverage on the payment of premiums but like traditional medicaid states may terminate medicaid eligibility only when nonpayment continues for at least 60 days states can apply this dra provision to some or all applicable groups under both traditional medicaid and dra states may waive premiums in cases of undue hardship in kentucky benefits are terminated after two months of nonpayment of premiums for children in the separate schip program upon payment of missed premium re enrollment is allowed after 12 months of nonpayment payment of the missed premium is not required for reenrollment also working families with transitional medicaid will lose coverage after two months of missed premiums unless good cause is established crs4 there are more differences between traditional medicaid and dra with respect to rules for failure to pay servicerelated costsharing under traditional medicaid providers cannot deny care to beneficiaries due to an individuals inability to pay costsharing charge however this requirement does not eliminate the beneficiarys liability for payment of such charges in contrast under dra states may allow providers to require payment of authorized costsharing as condition of receiving services providers may be allowed to reduce or waive costsharing on casebycase basis pl 109432 exempts individuals in families with income below 100 fpl from the dra failure to pay rules for both premiums and servicerelated costsharing according to state regulations kentucky requires all providers to collect applicable costsharing from medicaid beneficiaries at the time of service delivery or at later date provider can waive costsharing but only pharmacy providers can deny services for failure to pay as per state law finally under schip states must specify consequences applicable to nonpayment of premiums andor servicerelated costsharing and must institute disenrollment protections eg providing both reasonable notice and an opportunity to pay policies table 1 costsharing under
