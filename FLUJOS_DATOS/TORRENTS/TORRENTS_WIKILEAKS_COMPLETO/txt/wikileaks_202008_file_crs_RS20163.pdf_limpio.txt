resources science and industry division updated july 12 1999 abstract sulfur in gasoline reduces the eﬀectiveness of catalytic converters in vehicles thus increasing tailpipe emissions that adversely aﬀect human health and the environment mobile sources of air pollution including lightduty vehicles and trucks contribute 49 percent of total nitrogen oxides inventory 40 percent of volatile organic compounds including hydrocarbons about onequarter of particulate matter smaller than 10 microns and nearly 80 percent of carbon monoxide the environmental protection agency epa is studying whether to limit the level of sulfur in gasoline in order to protect vehicle catalytic converters and vehicle onboard diagnostic systems and as away of facilitating lower vehicle emission standards in the future epa sent proposed regulations imposing limits on sulfur in gasoline to the oﬃce of management and budget for approval bills introduced during the 106th congress would limit sulfur in gasoline reports indicate that epa wants nationwide yearround standard of 40 ppm of sulfur in gasoline or alternatively at the discretion of each gasoline producer 80 ppm so long as the average over year is higher than 30 ppm auto manufacturers and states support setting that standard while petroleum reﬁneries seek less stringent and more localized limitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20163congressional research

standards for cars and ligh t trucks under the clean air act on may 1 1999 if fully implemented in 2009 the standards would reduce nitrogen oxide emissions 7795 below curren t tier 1 standards included in the proposal were requirements that the averag concentration of sulfur in gasoline be lowered more than 90 to 30 parts per million by 2004 sulfur in gasoline reduces the effectiveness of catalytic converters and on board diagnostic equipment in vehicles thus increasing tailpipe emissions that adversely affect human health and the environment auto manufacturers an d most states support setting strict national limits on sulfur while petroleum refiners seek less stringent and more localized limits bills introduced during the 106 congress s 171 and hr 888 would pr ovide statutory limits on sulfurth similar to those in the proposed regulations while there is some congressiona l opposition as well as support for the proposed standard as of early july legislation had been int roduced to scale it back this report will be updated as development s warrant background the performance of catalysts in vehicle emission control systems is adversely affected by the pre sence of sulfur in gasoline sulfur contaminant that is naturally present i n crude oil competes with other pollut ants for space on the active surface of the catalyst this limits the ability of catalysts to convert pollutants such as nitrogen oxides carbo n monoxide and hydrocarbons to less harmful gases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of groundlevel ozone and fine particles

carbon monoxide sulfur in gasoline in the united states averages about 340 parts per million ppm nationally the average level varies in different parts of the country from low of 30 ppm in california t high of 449 ppm in some other areas of the country some gasolin contains as much as 1000 ppm of sulfur reducing the sulfur content of gasoline to 30 ppm as proposed by the environmental protection agency epa and as required i n california would improve the effectiveness of vehicle catalytic converters enough to cut1 nitrogen oxide emissions in half in new vehicles and reduce hydrocarbon emissions b significan t amounts as well the cost of meeting this standard is estimated by refiners at 56 cents per gallon of gasoline and by epa at less than 2 cents per gallon february2 1999 study for t he american petroleum institute estimated cost of about 2 ½ cents per gallon to meet less stringent standa rd of 40 ppm for section of the country east of the rockies rather than nationwide as proposed by epa3 epas proposed standards building on 20year history of progressiv ely more stringent emission standards the clean air act amendments of 1990 in 42 usc 7521 required epa to implemen t tighter emission standards for autos and light trucks in 19941996 tier 1 standards section 202i of the act required that after implementing the stan dards epa was to study the need fo r further tier 2 reductions in emissions the availability of technology t achieve such reductions an d the costeffectiveness of such technology the agency was required to submit report to congress by june 1 1997 containing the results of th study and if stricter standards were needed to make that determination by december 31 1999 on augu st 4 1998 epa submitted its report to congress in it the agenc y4 concluded that further reductio ns in emissions are needed that technology exists to make those reductions and that the technologies can be applied costeffectively epa states the presence of sulfur in gasoline has an impact on the performance of catalysts and thus on tailpipe emissio ns and the sensitivity of catalyst efficiency to sulfur5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20163crs3 continued5 epa420r98008 p

advances in catalyst technol ogy because of the impact of gasoline sulfur on emissions epa analyzed the issues associated with gasoline sulfur contro l program as part of tier 2 regulation development following series of studies th agency conclude d that limiting the level of sulfur in gasoline would be desirable in order to protect vehicle catalytic converters and onboard diagnostic systems and as way of facilitating lower vehicle emission standards in the future president clinton announced the proposal of tier 2 standards on may 1 1999 the formal proposal appeared in the may 13 federal register the proposed standards have6 three major features first when fully implemented in 2007 they would reduce new auto emissio n standards for the two major categories of pol lutants that cause smog ozone by 70 88 second for the first time they would require that light trucks and sport utilit vehicles which now make up about half of the market for new vehicles meet the same standards as cars when fully implemented in 2009 this step will reduc emissions from such vehicles by as much as 95 third by 2004 the standards would set national limits on sulfur in gasoline reducing the average sulfur content more than 90 from 340 ppm to 30 ppm in addition to setting average sulfur content requirements the sulfur standard would set maximum per gallon concentration of 80 ppm 7 like other parts of the tier 2 proposal the sulfur proposal contai ns several provisions designed to provide flexibility to the regulated community the controls are generall applicable in 2004 but refiners who phase in controls before then could use credits gained in the earlier years to delay full compliance until 2006 small refiners would be granted 4year extension until 2008 to comply with the possibility of further 2yea r extension the program would also allow refiners and importers t trade credits generated by achieving concentrations below the standard and to use such credits in place f physical compliance legislative activity in the 106 congressth the may 13 federal register notice begins public comment period that will ru n until august 2 1999 epa conducted four public hearings in philadelphia atlanta denver and cleveland between june 9 and june 17 after evaluating public comments the agency intends to promulgate final standards before the end of the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20163crs4 for discussion of these factors see manufacturers of emission controls association the8 impact of gasoline sulfur on catalytic emission control systems september 1998 the report is available online at httpwwwmecaorgno matter what standards the agency ultimately promulgates significant interests are likely to be dissatisfied environmental grou ps auto manufacturers producers of pollution control equip ment and most states want strict national limits on sulfur in gasoline while petroleum refiners and some western and midwes tern states seek more local and seasonal limits thus congress has begun the process of oversight and depending on the fina l form of epas regulations could take action on the issue in the 105 congress legislation to require strict national standards s 2377 wasth introduced by senator m oynihan but not acted on the bill has been reintroduced in the 106 congress as s 171 moynihan and hr 888 kildee beginning 4 years afte rth enactment the moynihan and kild ee bills would set nationwide yearround standard of 40 ppm of sulfur in gasoline or alternatively limit of 80 ppm so long as the average over year is higher than 30 ppm this standard similar to the epa proposal woul d duplicate the requirement that california has imposed on gasoline sold in that state since 1996 as of early july legislative action on these bills had occurred in the wake of the presidents may 1 announcement other congressional sources including the chairman of the senate environment subcommittee on clean air senator inhofe have expressed displeasure with the proposed rule and have suggested that they might introduce legislatio n to modify it senator inhofes subcommittee held two days of hearings on the proposal may 18 and 20 1999 but as of early july legislation to block or modify the standards had not been introduced selected policy issues nation yearround standards whether sulfur causes permanent damage t catalysts or its effects are reversible once the catalyst is exposed to lower sulfur exhaust is key questio n on which differing views have been expressed the answer depends on number f factors including the catalyst design and location the richness of the l mixture engine cali bration and load and the amount of sulfur in the fuel if the damage8 is permane nt national yearround reductions in sulfur would appear more desirable i f not regional and seasonal controls might achieve the desired effects at lower costs t gasoline producers and consumers similarly if high sulfur levels substantially interfere with onboard diagnost ic systems causing illumination of the malfunction indicator light then na tional sulfur level may be needed to address the problem if changes in catalyst design and fuelcontrol technology can offset the effects of sulfur in vehicles that are highly sensitive to sulfur then national sulfur standard would be less important as noted environmental groups auto manufacturers manufacturers of pollutio n control equipment and many states have urged epa to set strict national limits on sulfur in gasoline to protect vehicle catalytic c onverters and onboard diagnostic systems and as way of facilitating l ower vehicle emission standards in the future in the proposed rule the agency agrees with the groups arguing that damage to emission control systems is not sufficiently reversible to allow regional and seasonal exemptions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20163crs5 summary of the proposal is available at wwwapiorgnewsroomcgi9 padd stands for petroleum administrative district

corporation pp 45 epa regulatory impact analysis p v4712petroleum refiners have sought less stringent and more localized limits in order t hold down costs to consumers and to minimize the economic hardship on smaller an d older petroleum refineries the petroleum industry proposal which calls for an average9 sulfur content of 150 ppm beginning in 2004 in states east of the mississippi river plu s missouri louisiana and east texas and 300 ppm elsewhere would cost about half what the epa proposal would cost the industry envisions future reductions in the easter n region to 30 ppm standard in 2010 refinery compliance problems some refineries would be more adversely affected than others by lower lim its on sulfur in gasoline some gasoline feedstocks contain more sulfur than ot hers so that more sulfur must be reduced in order to meet the prescribe d standard in general smaller older refineries claim they could not afford to mee t significantly lower sulfur standards because mo re investment would be required per gallon of gasoline produced and because getting the necessary funds would be more difficult than for larger more profitable refineries industry has raised particular concerns about refineries located in the rock mountain region an area re ferred to as padd iv according to industry padd iv is10 almost entirely supplied by small refineries which would face the largest challenge meeting fuel sulfur standards for some refiners pas proposed regulation will be the straw that breaks the camels back facilities w ill close and jobs will be lost since the phasein of identical sulfur lowering requirements in californias gasoline in 1996 11 percent of that state s refineries have shut down11 epa concedes that the cost of compliance would be double in padd iv 35 cents per gallon vs the 18 cent national average but believes that exemptions for smal l12 refiners provided in the proposed rule and trading and credit provisions would eas compliance epas proposal would low small refiners defined as those with more than 1500 employees an additional 4 years beyond 2004 to come into compliance small refiners that can demonstrate severe economic hardship could apply for n additional extension to 2010 in addition to meeting the standard by investing in sulfu r removal technology refiners would be allowed to comply by purchasing credits fro m others who reduce sulfur beyond the requirements of the standard epas definition of small refiner is an area of contention however the agenc defines as small any refining company that employed 1500 or fewer employees as f january 1 1999 in calculating the number of employees the business must include lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20163crs6 64 federal register 26054 13 for epas discussion of the small business impacts see chapter viii of the agencys regulatory14 impact analysis available online at httpwwwepagovomstr2homehtm ensign testimony pp 78 the same issue was raised in the testimony of j louis frank 15 previously cited pp 46 and that of william nasser ceo energy biosystems pp 23subsidiaries including all refining distribution and marketing activities worldwide13 apparently it is not the size of the specific refinery but measure of the corporat resources available to be drawn upon that epa has chosen in choosing this definition epa relied on the small business administrations definition of what constituted small petroleum refining business about 17 refineries ut of national total of 160 qualify for special treatment under this definition the agency n otes that 9 of the 17 already produce gasoline with sulfur content below 90 ppm14 industry representatives want much rger number of refiners to be exempt relying on defin ition of small diesel refiners that was inserted into the clean air acts acid rain program in the 1990 amendments to the act section 410h of the clean air act in this definition small refiners are those with crude oil throughput of less than 1825000 0 barrels per year provided that they are owned or controlled by refiner with tota l combined throughput of less than 50187500 barrels per year about onethird of us refineries are believed to qualify for exemption under this definition costeffe ctiveness of alternatives to reducing sulfur whether improved vehicle engines and cataly sts would be more cost effective than reducing sulfur in gasoline is not an issue that has received much attention epa argues and to some degree most of the interested parties seem to agree that reducing emissions will require both better engines and catalysts and lower sulfur gasoline costeffectiveness of controls is an issue however as industry considers how i t would comply wi th epas proposed standard the petroleum industry disagrees strongly with epas conclusions regarding the technologies that will be used to remove sulfur from gasoline the agency has concluded that new technologies will reduce the cost f removing sulfur to an average of 18 cents per gallon refine rs argue that the technologies touted by epa have not been demonstrated on anything more than pilot scale given the short time the industry would have to achieve compliance refi ners say they are unlikely to use unproven technologies rather they would install already proven technologies which would cost substantially more15 conclusion epas proposal to limit sulfur in gasoline is open to public comment until august 2 1999 epa appears committed to yearround national standards with flexibility limited to the provisions for averaging sulfur content and the exemption and trading provision s available to small refiners the agencys position is supported by broad range f interests i ncluding auto manufacturers environmental groups and many states others including refiners and some western and midwestern states are opposed congressional oversight hearings have occurred legislation similar to epas position has bee n introduced and bills opposing or modifying the rule may be introduced
