goes toward the development f specific military systems or syst em components most of the rest between 7 billion and 8 billion goes toward more fundamental research development an d demonstr ations of sciences and technologies identified as important to militar capabilities and operations called the science and technology program total rdte funding for the last 10 years has remained relatively level i n nominal terms howeve r when accounting for inflation rdte funding peaked in fy1987 and declined fairl steadily until fy1997 the decline primarily occurred in those activities associated with developing specific weapon systems science an d technology funding during that time although more volatile from year to year has kept up with inflation maintaining healthy science and technology

introduction this report describes the basic elements and issues of the department f defenses dod rese arch development test and evaluation rdte program over the last 10 years the country has spent an average of 36 billion year n dods rdte program about 80 of that goes toward the development r demonstr ation of specific military systems or system components most of the rest between 7 billion and 8 billion per year goes toward more fundamental research development and demonstrations in sciences nd technologies identified as important to military capabilities an d operations because it represents such large investment and supports the developmen t of the nations high technology weapons systems and the technology base upon which those systems rely c ongress has shown considerable interest in overseeing dods rdte program and although its share of th nations overall expenditure on science and t echnology research and development has diminished over the years the program still plays an important role in developin g certain key technologies that impact commercial products and the overall economy this report discusses the types of activities supported by the rdte program trends in the progra ms budget program management and dods rdte infrastructure program activities dods rdte program is one of the major elements of dods total budget other major elements include personnel operations and maintenance an d procurement for an introduct ion to dods overall budget the reader is referred to crs report rl30002 defense budget primer see for dditional reading the rdte prog ram supports wide range of activities from basic research in science and engineering eg physics mathematics materials electronics to the full scal development of specific weapons systems eg the f22 fighter or the comanch helicopter the rdt budget is accordingly subdivided into 7 separate activities basic research applied research advanced technology development demonstration an d validation engineering manufacturing development management support an d operational systems development these 7 activities are designated as 61 throug h 67 description of each is given in figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97316crs2 61 basic researc h supports research that produces new knowledge in scientific or technological area f interest to the military areas includ atmospheric and space

example might be equipping soldiers taking part in training operatio n with new prototype night vision goggle64 demonstration and validation supports the initial development an d demonstration of product designe d specifically to meet an agreed upon set f performance standards associated with validated operational need demval as it is often called supports formal acquisition program and typically involves competition among different designs 65 engineering manufacturin g development supports the continue d development and refinement of specifically designed product that s demonstrated

and 62 activities constitute what is called dods technology base program and is often referred to as the seed corn of dods technologica l capabilities it is here where new technologies and their potential for militar application are explored and developed sometimes over long periods of time number of the technologies utilized with such great effect during the gulf war eg laser guided bombs

activities 6163 constitute what i s called dods science and technology st program the st program does not support development in forma l acquisition program although as one goes from 61 to 63 t he connection to specific military operational capability becomes more important and apparent funding for 64 65 and 67 activities does support formal acquisition program where specific new product or product upgrade is desig ned and developed to meet certified military requirement the lions share of the rdte budget goes toward support of these activities the acquisition process is discussed later in this report budget trends rdte funding for the last 10 years has remained relatively flat in nomina l terms however when accoun ting for inflation rdte funding peaked in fy1987 and decline d fairly steadily until fy1997 see figure 2 the steep increase in total rdte funding during the early part of the 1980s was the result of increased support for the development specific new weapon systems associated with the reaga n administrations military build up the decline in total rdte since the last half of the 1980s is the result of slowi ng down in the development of specific new weapon systems the decline in spending wa s initially in concert with other efforts to control federal budget deficits and then later continued in response to the breakup of the soviet union and the end of the cold warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs973160 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 millions fy00 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 fiscal year total rdte total stcrs4 figure 3 total rdte vs total stbeginni ng in the carter administration funding for science and technolog programs also grew but at slower rate see figure 3 with the end of the cold war congress became concerned that drop in nearterm weapons developmen t might adversely impact dods long term ability to develop new weapons systems congress maintained and even increased slightly fu nding for science and technology after three years however faced with internal budget tradeoffs congress wa s unable to sustain that vel of investment in real terms if dod and congress seek to increase support for force modernization in t he next few years 64 and 65 funding may increase again relative to the science and technology program figure 4 shows the funding trend for each activity within the science an d technology program 61 through 63 much of the increase in science an d technol ogy spending during the reagan buildup was concentrated in advance d technology development 63 the big step increase in 63 funding beginning i n fy1986 was primarily due to the strategic defense initi ative much of the funding for which was characteriz ed as advanced technology development funding for basic research 61 and applied research 62 has been rel atively flat in constant dollars over the last 10 years the university community however has expressed som concern over the slow ero sion of basic research from its peak in fy1993 much of the funding for basic research is spent at unive rsities while universities as whole receive decreasing share of their rd funds from dod dod does provide disprop ortionate share of funding in certain engineering

processes do function somewhat independently of each other they are intimately related the st program develops the future generations of technology while acquisitio n programs bring that technology into the next generation of equipment there is time lag between technology development and the ability to get that technology into the field st planning in 1988 as part of its fy1989 defense authorizations section 823 pl 100456 congress instructed the usdat to provide it with an annual plan for developing the technologies that the office of the secretary defense osd felt were most critical to ensure the long term qualitative superiority of us weapon s systems the plan is to include the rationale for selecting those technologies milestones associated with developing them budgets allocated to developing them and the potential contribution industry and allies could make to their development prior to this there was dodwide st strategy or plan to guide an integrate d approach to

7 it consists of phases separated by milestone decisions these decisions are made by the defense acquisition board dab chaired by the usdat work don during the phases are managed by the services or agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97316crs9 before an acquisit ion program can begin an operational component within one of the services eg the air force air combat command must identify broadl stated mission need that cannot be satisfied by changes in tactics doctrine etc if the materiel solution to this need is expensive enough above certain threshold th joint requirements oversight committee jroc of the joint chiefs of staff mus t review and approve it at that point the usdat reviews the jroc request an d chooses one or more concepts for further study milestone 0 phase 0 concep t evaluation involves shortterm studies evaluating the feasibility of competin g concepts at the end of phase 0 the dab assesses whether new acquisitio n program is warranted and if so approves milestone i baseline acquisition strategy which includes budgets test and evaluation master plans risk assessments an d mitigation efforts etc milestone approval also agrees on what needs to b demonstrated in the next phase of the program exit criteria at this poin t if the deputy secretary of defense approves new program i s begun phase i program defini tion and risk reduction will further develop one or more of the concepts studied in the previous phase assessing advantages an d disadvantages and demonstrating prototype equipment if necessary to reduce risks uncertainties the acquisition strategy becomes more clearly defined as does th specific system requirements when the exit criterion for phase i has been met the dab decides wheth er to continue with one of the concepts milestone ii phase ii engineering and manufacturing development translate s the most promising concept into stable operational affordable and producible design also during this time the manufacturing and production processes are validated once prototype of the design demonstrates it can meet the requirements low rate initial production i s authorized by the dab low rate initial production prov ides operational components for operational testing and to estab lish the initial production capability at milestone iii the dab approves phase iii production deployment and operational support at this point rdte funds decline and procurement funds take over infrastructure dods rdte program supports work at universities research institutes federally funded research an d development centers ffrdcs private firms and consortia and at service rdte facilities funds flow in different proportions t different entities depending on the type of activity being funded large part f dods basic research program almost 60 g oes to universities about 25 goes to dods own rd facilities most of the 62 and 6 3 work is performed in industry almost 50 and at dods own facilities 30 just about all of the 64 65 and 67 funding goes to private firms dods rdte infrastructure is divided into two groups research an d development laboratories and test and eva luation centers laboratories are dod activities c ost centers that perform one or more of the following activities science and technology engineering development systems engineering and engineerin g support of deployed materiel there are over 80 dod rd laboratory facilities eg naval research laboratory test and evaluation centers are facilities and th surrounding area ie sea air ground space that are governmentowned r controlled and which are used to collect data and deliver products eghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97316crs10 reports there are 26 centers eg the armys white sands missile range each of the services supports its own rd laboratories and centers eac h manages them in its own way it should be noted that darpa and bmdo do not have any rd laboratories of their own bmdo does operate the joint nationa l test facility ffrdcs are notforprofit organizations which are financed on solesource basis exclusively or substantially by federal agency to perform specific research and development that the agency cannot do itself or contract from other organizations the federal government supports total of 42 ffrdcs each is administered b contract by an industrial firm university or other nonprofit institution do d supports 12 ffrdcs at one point dod supported 39 an example is the lincoln laboratory managed by the massachusetts institute of technology and begun i n world wa r ii to develop radar about 3 of dods total rdte budget goes to ffrdcs as mentio ned earlier much of dods 61 research is performed by grant r contract at universities much of this is singleinvestigator research however 61 funding also goes to suppo rt centers of excellence and other centers at universities that take multidisciplinary team approach besides providing direct funding to private firms for various research an d development activities dod also provides indirect support for private firms independent research an d development ird based on negotiations between the firm and dod dod will allow firms to count as an expense on its dod contracts some share of the research and development the firm d oes with its own funds and for its own purposes these cost allowances have in the past amounted to 2 billion to 3 billion per year congress removed the limits on how much companies could be reimbursed in the early 1990s as part of congressional efforts to continu supporting military rd during the transition to postcold war environment issues issues that congress has confronted and may continue to confront relating to dods rdte budget include maintaining healthy science and technology investment the science and technology program is perceived as imperative to maintaining dod s technological edge over potential adversaries investments made here bear fruit later in the form of more sophisticated equipment and capabilities however becaus knowledge and information is the primary product at this stage in developmen t especially for 61 and 62 activities specific return on investment in the form of hardware or software is not always immediate in fact it is not always clear beforehand whether new technology will ever prove useful as result there i s always concern within the st community that pressures for nearerter m developments or issues will crowd out the longer term investment associated wit h science and technology projects over the last 10 years dod s st investment has varied widely but since fy1993 when it peaked in real terms it has steadil declinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97316crs11 there is clear objective way to determine how much st funding i s appropriate to maintain healthy technology base and to maintain dod s technological advantage the fy1999 defense authorization bill pl 105261 sec 214 expressed sense of congress that st funding should increase 2 abov inflation each year through fy2006 the bill same section also called for report by the national research council to study what level of st investment wa s appropriate and what the impacts might be of not maintaining that level of funding as of the writing of this report that study has not been initiated in may 1998 the defense science board studied thi s issue by looking at how industry determines how much to spend on research and developm ent the board concluded that industry did not use formal process for determining what to spend but instead used general rule of certain percentage of sales according t the study technologically dynamic industries invested up to 35 of sales in research 15 of sales in research an d development using this r ule and equating dods total outlays to sales the board determined that an investment in fy1999 of about 8 billion would be appropriate another issue is the level of basic research supported by the st program between fy1993 and fy1998 investment in basic research had slowly eroded i n constant dollars much of dods basic research is invested in universities do d basic research investment in universities represents relatively small share f universi ties outside funding but in certain areas such as materials and electronic s engineering and mathematics dods investment is significant source of funds reductions in 61 funding generate concern within the university community accelerating the transition of new technology the pace at which ne w technology moves from the laboratory to fielded system has always been of concern although the urgency to do so may have subsided with the end of the cold war scaling technology up in size and integrating it with other technologies can present problems not identified in the laboratory trying to solve these bugs in n acquisiti on program can delay the program andor greatly increase the costs of th program therefore over the years more emphasis has been placed on technolog demonstrat ions as way to solve these problems before beginning an acquisitio n program in the l ast few years technology demonstrations have also been proposed as way to quickly get new technologies into the field short of formal acquisition program while agreeing on the need for such demonstrations congress has bee n cautious in support especially of actds even so t echnology demonstrations have increased as share of the st program downsizing infrastructure dods downsizin g since the end of the cold war focused initially on reducing force levels and reducing or delaying the development of new weapons systems the next phase of downsizing was directed at trying t reduce infrastructure across the board the base realignment and closur brac process has been the instrument by which dod and congress have agreed to close bases and other dod facilities in what is otherwise highly politicize d process closure and consolidation of defense r d facilities to the extent they have occurred have been result of the brac process in addition dod has bee n reducing the rdte work force since fy1992 reductions are to continue into the next century at which point the workforce will have been reduced almost 30 from fy1992 levels additional reductions to the acquisition workforce which includeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97316crs12 rdte personnel were mandated in the fy1998 defense uthorizations pl 105 85 section 912 although there have been some laboratory consolidations via brac congress felt more could be done especially in regard to crossservicing ie colocating the services rdte activity or assigning lead responsibility to service in particular technology area section 277 of the national defense authori zation act for fy1996 pl104106 required dod to develop fivey ear plan to be implemented between fy2001 and fy2005 that would consolidate and restructure its laboratories an d centers further as much as is practical and possible the process by whic h dod intended to draw up this pl an was called vision 21 vision 21 had made some progress in laying the groundwork for making further consolidations including th design of cost accounting system that would allow the cost of rdte to b compared across services however vision 21 efforts were later consumed by the quadrennial defense review process draft legislation related specifically t laboratory and test center consolidation was dropped in favor of general request for two more brac rounds relating to dods entire infrastructure congress has not been receptive to any more brac rounds in this larger context congress however continues to encourage the services to find ways to improve efficiencies and to find ways to account for c osts that will allow comparison across services pl 105261 sec 906 integration with the commercial sector while dods science an d technology program has produced wide range of sophisticated technologies i n some technology areas it has not been able to keep pace with the level of technology development in the c ommercial sector prime example is microelectronics while the semiconductor and integrated circuits were developed with private funds dod and the space program provided an early market for the devices and pushed th subsequent development of those technologies by the 1970s however dod s market share declined significantly and commercial demands pushed ne w developm ents soon commercial circuits outperformed circuits made for dod at the urging of congress part of the dods articulated st strategy has been t piggyback on the commercial sectors technology base efforts where it can it has sought to do this primarily by pursuing what it calls dualuse programs thes programs seek t cooperatively develop technologies of mutual benefit to dod and the commercial sector in way that will accelerate their use by both dualuse programs differ from core dod rdte programs in that they ar suppose t appeal more to commerciallyoriented firms or even firms that have not typically worked with dod in the pa st requiring costsharing with the private party or parties and contracts are drawn up independent of usual defense contractin g regulations to make them more palatable to commerciallyoriented firms management of dualuse programs have undergone great deal of evolution sinc they were initiated currently each service man ages its own dualuse science and technology program
