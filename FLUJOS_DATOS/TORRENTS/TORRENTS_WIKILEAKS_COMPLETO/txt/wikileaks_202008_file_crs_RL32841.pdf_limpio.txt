selected programs and policies discusses programs now in place this report is the last in the series bts plays an important role in the broader function of providing homeland security the overall homeland security effort can be seen as series of concentric circles or screens with the outer screen being that of preventive efforts launched outside the country before terrorists or th eir weapons can reach the country the next screen is interdiction efforts at the border and in the transportation system the continuum of activities then moves through progressively smaller circles ending with emergency preparedness and response congressional concern over homeland security began with broadgauged efforts to learn more about the nature of the terrorist threat and then moved to much more specific actions following the events of 911 congressional interest in broader more strate gic approaches continues which makes this review of possible new directions and policy options timely both the complexity of the challenges at the border and the realization that multiple points of vulnerab ility might be turned into expanded opportunities for interdiction have given rise to the notion of layered approach to security the basic idea of layering is that multiple and overlapping measures applied at several points in the border security environmen t could be more successful than more targeted measures alone the problem in hardening few selected targets is the rising expense of unit costs increasing conflict with other goals andor inability to cover all conceivable risks posed by the sh ifting and opportunistic nature of terrorist tactics to pursue layered approach to border and transportation security would mean applying some measure of security effort to each of the following points of vulnerabilityopportunity tr ansportation staff passengers conveyances access control cargo and baggage ports and security route several possible policy options are presented that flow directly from the framework presented in the three part series of crs reports before action is contemplated in any of these areas however it would be important to assess th priority of each step

in protecting the american people from terrorists and their in struments of destruction the issue for congress is how to achieve sired levels of security while not compromising other important values in the process in seri of three reports strategic approach to bts using variety of frameworks to clarify objectives and help identify policy options is discussed this final report builds on the analysis presented in the first two reports and explores possible new directions and policy options that spring directly from the analytical frameworks contained in those reports before doing so however it is useful to place this set of activities in the broader context of overall homeland security efforts and to review the development of congressional concern and policy approaches up to this point the role of border and transportation security in homeland security the homeland security effort can be seen as series of concentric circles or screens with the outer screen being that of preventive efforts launched outside the country the continuum of activities to provide homeland security then moves through progressively smaller circles starting from more distant efforts to closer and more localized measures thus the process starts with prevention abroad and ends with emergency prepare dness and response at home discovery and preventive intervention of terrorist actions emanating from abroad before reaching the united states interdiction of dangerous people or thin gs at the us border and in the interior transportation sector defense agai nst catastrophic terrorism

of terrorist attacks in the 1990s the congressional response began with inquiries as to the nature of the terro rist threat and the commissioning of several studies and was followed by specific targeted measures to protect the nation following the events of 911 congressiona l interest however c ontinues in broader more comprehensive approaches including efforts in the 108th congress to respond to the report of the 911 commission embodied in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 irtpa pl 108458 congressional policy actions are summarized briefly below broad efforts to understand the terrorist threat starting in 1998 congress stimulated the creation of three commissions to better understand the nature of the terrorist threat facing the nation these included the g ilmore commissi on the bremer commission and the hartrudman commission2 highly specific actions to prot ect against immediate threats immediately following the airpla nebased attacks of 911 early legislative action focused on air line security visa and border security and then moved on to maritime security3 structural and procedural c hanges to provide an effective framework for action following the 911 attacks congress enacted legislation to create the department of homeland security to provide structural framework for subsequent action and the usa patriot act to provide the tools needed for the new challenge to national security4 interest in broader more comp rehensive substantive approaches as evidenced in oversight hearin gs congress has been frustrated by the failure to more aggressi vely address other border and transportation security threats including the need to create integrated terrorist watchlists nd measures to address other modes of transportation rail

rl32839 border and transportation security the complexity of the challenge by jennifer lake william h robinson and lisa m seghettibuses these concerns were give n strong impetus by the final report of the 911 commission which highlighted the need for more strategic approaches to the terrorist threat and are now expressed in legislative form in pl 108458 the evolution of congressi onal concern moving from general to specific and back to broader concerns makes this an opportune time to cons ider some possible policy frameworks that might shed additional light on the nature of the problem and possible new or enhanced policy choices the next section of the report briefly summarizes the two earlier reports in the series that address the complexity of the challenge as well as the programs and po licies developed thus far to contribute to border and transportation security the th ird section explores the idea of using layered approach to protecting the nation relying on multiple and overlapping policy actions on number of fronts to increase the probability of interdicting bad people or bad things the final secti on explores some ideas for possible new directions and policy options that spring directly from the analytical frameworks used in the report the complexity of the border security challenge and selected policy tools now in use the task of providing border and tran sportation security is complex both because of its scale and possible conflicts with other important national goals the magnitude of the task is s ubstantial covering thousa nds of miles of land borders millions of passengers hundreds of airports and seaports and millions of individual motor vehicles rail cars and cargo containers 5 the first possible goal conflict springs fr om the demands of security confronting the need for facilitating the essential travel and trade that are at the heart of continued economic growth this reality leads to redefinition of the task from one of pitting security vs economic wellbeing to that of good border mana gement good border management requires facilitating and even expediting the flow of desirable goods and people across our borders while screening out dang erous people and material the process of doing that is made more manageable if the bor der is envisioned not merely as physical boundary but rather as flexible concept that allows for the possibility that the border begins at the point where goods or people commence their usbound journey the result of such br oader perspective is significantly wider array of options for good border management companion report presents several graphical images of how this process might be envisioned see crs report rl32839 border and transportation security the complexity of the challenge

exploited can actually increase the probability of interdiction of the bad things and bad people that we seek to intercept before they arrive at their intended targets the current programs designed to accomplish this interception are discussed more fully in the second report in this series crs report rl32840 border and transportation security selected programs and policies these efforts can be summarized by using an analytical framework that highlights generic strategies that might be used to achieve greater border and transportation security6 pushing the border outwards to in tercept unwanted people or goods before they reach the united states as in the container security initiative and passenger prescreening hardening the border through the use of technology eg xraymachines for examining cargo w ithout opening the containers radiation and explosives detector s and unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor remote areas at the border making the border more accessible for legitimate trade and travel faster passage for trusted tr avelers and cargo conveyors strengthening the border inspection process through more effective use of intelligence terrorist screening data bases and multiplying effectiveness of interdiction programs through theengagement of other actors in the enforcement effort including engaging canada mexico state and local law enforcement resources and the private sector the realization that multiple points of vulnerability might be turned into expanded opportunities for inte rdiction has given rise to the notion of layered approach to security the basic idea of layering is that multiple and overlapping measures applied at key points in the border security environment could succeed where only more targeted measures might fail because of their rising expense increasing conflict with other goals or inability to cover all conceivable risks arising from opportunistic terrorist tactics layered approach to border and transportation security the concept of layered approach to border and transportation security is gaining currency in policy discussions the idea was cited in security context in the socalled gore commissi on report on aviation safety and security in early 19977httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32841crs6 7 continued created in the wake of concerns over the crash of twa flight 800 and the earlier crash of pan am flight 103 one of the three charges to the commission was to look at the changing security threat and how we can address it 8 report of white house commission on av iation safety and security p 18 the notion of layering in the area of transportation safety has history that stretches back to the 1970s but this was an early instance of the idea being applied in the context of aviation security 9 the phase iii report of united states commission on national security21st century hart rudman commission road map for national secu rity imperative for change washington dc gpo p 11 however it shoul d be noted that the concept of layering is applied to the entire area of homeland security but is not discussed in depth 10 the 911 commission report final report of the na tional commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states washington dc gpo 2004 p 83 hereafter the 911 final commission report however the commission adds the important caveat that each layer must be effective in its own right ach must be supported by other layers that are redundant and coordinated p 392 with respect to the effectiveness of the layers in place on 911 the commission concludes but each layer relevant to hijackings intelligence passenger prescreening checkpoint screening and onboard security was seriously flawed prior to 911 taken together they did t stop any of the 911 hijackers from getting on board four different aircraft at three different airports p 83 11 stephen flynn america the vulnerable how our government is failing to protect us from terrorism new york ny harpercollins publishing 2004 hereafter cited as flynn america the vulnerable the commission stated the belief that av iation security should be system of systems layered integrated and working together to produce the highest levels of protection8 an important pre911 reference to layering was found in the hart rudman commission report in 2001 the commission stated we believe that homeland security can best be assured thr ough comprehensive strategy of layered defense that focuses first on prev ention second on protection and third on response 9 this report discusses the concep t of layered prot ection as applied specifically to border security and offers definition that is intended to translate the concept into something more concrete with the goal of making it possible to be applied to actual progra ms and policy actions background the most recent advocacy of layered approach comes from the 911 commission report issued in july 2004 ddressing the importance of passenger screening the commission states the faa set and enforced security rules which airlines and airports were required to implement the rules were supposed to produce layered system of defense this meant that the failure of any one layer of security would not be fatal because additional layers would provide backup security10 later the commission introduced footnote specifically endorsing such layered approach and refers the reader to dr stephen flynns latest work11 in which he uses householdbased example of what layering would look like in residential settinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32841crs7 12 flynn america the vulnerable pp 6869 13 the 2002 report of the council on foreign relations contains reference that comes the closest to the definition posed here the first recommendation under the title of make trade security global priority reads as follo ws develop layered security system that focuses on the entire logistics and intermoda l transportation network rather than on an unintegrated series of tactics aimed at

still in danger 2002 p 25the simple act of locking door with conventional lock will deter most amateur thieves returning to our case of securing home we might consider some additional ways to ward off burglars without trying to make conventional doors and windows burglarproof since thef ts often occur at night we could consider installing automatic lights that are triggered when people approach dog on the premises will provide another measure of security add to this sign posted on the front lawn that indicates the home is monitored by security company finally the community could form neighborhood watch groups and post signs on the streets advertising this fact any of these measures might work only 60 of the time but statistically five 60 measures when placed in combination will raise the overall probability of preventing burglary to 99 in many instances it may well be that the cost of all these measures is less expensive than trying to bolster any one or even two measures12 definition of layered pproach to bo rder security truly operational definiti on would be applicable to the entire environment of border and transportation security and would suggest specific action points and measures for added protection the following is provisional atte mpt to address that need layered approach to border and transportation security is comprehensive strategy that identifies ke points of vulnerability wherever they exist including travelers staff ca rgo vehicles processes documents and locations and turns them into targets of opportunity for interdiction it provides series of interdependent overlapping and reinforcing redundancies designed to raise the odds that terrorist activity could be intercepted also raising the risks and costs to terrorists and serving both an interception and deterrence function13 layering speaks to three dilemmas of policy design in border and transportation security the law of diminishing returns ie at some point the unit costs of any single measure become increasingly high as we attempt to push to higher levels of securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32841crs8 14 stephen flynn comments on the first two dile mmas in the following terms our goal should not be to find foolproof solutions for protecting the ta rgets terrorists are most likely to strike it is about identifying workable asures that are costeffective and not disruptive then we need to string them together in such way that each serves to reinforce the deterrent value of the other flynn america the vulnerable p 70 all of chapter 3 security maturity addresses the layering notion 15 for striking example of this tactical flexibility see the new york times article which describes joint fbidhs threat assessment that assessment reportedly warns that qaeda and other jihadist terrorists may be sh ifting their focus from commercial airliners which still remain serious target to charte r planes helicopters and other more vulnerable general aviation targets as the commercial air line sector becomes more secure the report goes on to note that members of qaeda appear determined to study and test new american security measures to uncover w eaknesses p a16 eric lichtbau security report on us aviation warns of holes new york times mar 14 2005 pp a1 a16heightened goal conflict as tightened security begins to impede the legitimate flow of desired people and goods14 as well as resulting in possible incursions on privacy and civil liberties and the opportunistic nature of terrorism ie the more we harden one target the more likely that terrorists will shift their attention to softer target andor use different means15 to reduce cost and risk of operations terrorists desire to us targets and methods that have been used successfully before can be easily taught and replicated and have high probability of success and impact frustrating any or all of these goals could l ead to abandoning the operation layered approach to border and transportation security figure 1 illustrates that the security of people and cargo destined for the united states requires complex set of policies that engage actors from each of the geographic zones foreign governments priv ate sector actors and us government agencies these relationships and policies must also take into consideration requirements unique to the di fferent modes of transporta tion air vessel truck and rail policies could for example encompass the entire journey from the source zone to the destination zone or policies could focus distinctly on particular zoneplaceactor in the journey or as noted above layered approach may be employed that involves nearly all of the constructs identified in figure 1 eg people conveyances carg places routes etc possible new directions and policy options to pursue layered approach to border and transportation security would mean applying some measures of security effort to each of the following points of vulnerabilityopportunity staff

opportunities suggest some possibilities for further policy exploration the following are offered as brief illustrations of areas that might warrant further consideration based on the framework set out above in many cases ac tions have already begun and the option would relate to acceleration or enhancements in others where new beginnings are envisioned the options might entail further research or exploration16 however it should be noted that action in any of these areas would need to be weighed against prevailing resource constraints and possible conflicts with other important societal goals such as facilitatin g the legitimate flow of people and goods and avoiding infringements on civil liberties and rights with these qualifications the following options might be explored as part of layered approach to border and transportation security staff authentication one early interception opportunity in the tr ansportation process is to ensure that all transportation staff are whom

steps could include acceleration of the implementation of twic particularly to maritime workers and possible expansion to workers in all areas of transportation through inte rnational agreement it may be possible to consider expanding secure identification to tran sportation workers from other countries screening for all staff an option would be some level of screening for staff at all levels and points in the proce ss including office workers along the entire supply and shipping chain in this sens even clerks in shipping houses may represent some level of vulnerability since they have the capacity to alter documents that disguise the real contents of shipments passengers another key point in the process is to ensure that terrorists do not gain access to transportation systems and cross our borders andor perp etrate an act of terrorism while on board to add this layer of defense might involve the following improved terrorist screening undertake improvements in terrorist screening databases the 911 commissi on recommends that every stage of our border and immigration system s hould have as part of its operations the detection of terrorist indicators on travel documents information systems able to authenticate travel documents and detect potential terrorist indicators should be used at consulates at primary border inspection lines in immigration services offices and in intelligence and enforcement units20 this effort would start with expansion of intelligence efforts feeding into the databases and would be enhanced by more sophisticated name recognition software to reduce the number of false positive identifications finally the entire effort could benefit from better integration of databases and other technical improvements for greater ease and speed of use

of the key recommendations of the 911 commission was to expand the use of biometri c identifiers as one of the more secure forms of identity authentication the commission noted that when people travel they usually move through fined channels or portals they may seek to acquire passport they may apply for visa they stop at ticket counters gates and exit controls at airports and seaports u pon arrival they pass through inspection points they may transit to another gate to get on an airplane once inside the country they may seek another form of identification and try to enter government or private facility they may seek to change immigration status in order to remain each of these checkpoints or portals is screening chance to establish that people are who they say they are and seeking access for their stated pur pose to intercept identifiable suspects and to take effective action22 this effort would include continued research into the most effective biometric identifiers assessment of their relative cost and feasibility of use and the development of appropria standards it could also include research and investment in readers to increase the accuracy speed nd efficiency of use at multiple portals23 screening for other modes of transportation explore feasible and effective methods of screenin g for rail and transit passeng ers while early passenger screening efforts understandably focused on air transportation passengers the 911 commission urged that efforts be made to expand coverage to other modes especially passengers on ra il and mass transit systems24 referring to major vulnerabilities that still exist in cargo and general aviation security the commission stated that opportunities to do harm are as great or greater in maritime or surface transportation25 because of the need to maintain the free flow of people that is an essential feature in the effective functioni ng of these modes passenger screening in this setting would require dditional research and crea tive experimentation but given the threat made manifest in the 311 train bombings in madrid in 2003 many experts believe further exploration of feas ible screening methods is merited the intelligence reform and terrorism pr evention act of 2004 pl 108458 also extended some form of screening to crui ships and larger charter airplanes26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32841crs12

falsification techniques this was an area highlighted in the 911 commission final report and especially in its suppl ementary volume on terrorist travel we found that as many as 15 of the 19 hijackers were potentially vulnerable to interception by border authorities an alyzing their characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could have allowed authorities to intercept four to 15 hijackers and more effective use of information available in us government databases could have identified up to three hijackers27 according to the commission there were clear signs and markings on the travel documents used by most of the terrorists that would have linked them to terrorism but that these telltale marks were the results of recent re search and were not part of routine inspector training at the time comprehensive screening throughout the transportation process explore ways to deny internal travel to those terrorists who have already entered the country whether legally or illega lly the commission asserted that targeting travel is at least as powerfu l weapon against terrorism as targeting their money the united states should combine terrorist travel intelligence operations and law enforcement in strate gy to intercept terrorists find terrorist travel facilitators and constrain terrorist mobility28 the 911 commission report suggests setting national standards for stateissued documents including birth and death certificates drivers licenses etc29 that proposal was addressed in pa rt in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 and has also been the subj

that to propose an automatic shutoff device for large rigs hauling such material california has considered such plan in the past and may be reexamining the concept34 according to report on research being done at the lawrence livermore national laboratory truckstopping devices are being designed that could be used by road side law enforcement officers to activate the airbrakes of truck carrying hazardous cargo to bring it to quick stop if it was thought to represent terrorist threat35 access control ensuring the safety of transportation vehicles themselves is an essential step in the

the highly porous and vulnerable transit zone see figure 1 one possibility is exploring the use of multimodal security devices for cargo including smart containers and transponders crosscutting measures there are number of potential actions that would cut across modes of transportation andor points of vulnerability or opportunity the following policy options present the potential for multiple payoffs in terms of security better targeting of terrorist s and dangerous materials explore methods for better targeting of both passengers and cargo this could involve blend of sophisticated and directed targeting with an additional complementary component of random inspections the goal would be to achieve the greatest level of confidence concerning the contents of container or the identity of the individual seeking entry in order to isolate and in terdict highrisk people and goods the ability to intercept highrisk people may be pendent on combination of biometric identifiers accelerated implementation of the usvisit program better integration of terrorist watch lists better training of border inspectors and use of screening at several points in the transpor tation process the ability to successfully target high risk containers is dependent upon simila r needs with the crucial addition of information regarding which containers ar most likely to contain contraband both of these processes require better use of intelligence they also require an attempt to avoid predictability in whatever we do to make it less likely that terrorists can take evasive actions based on secondguessing our targeting system see below benefits of random inspections as supplement to targeting make systematic use of random changes in inspection targets and procedures random changes and random inspections are us eful supplement to targeting in order to determine what you dont know in rms of identifying gaps in present algorithms for setting targets it also increases risks for terrorists who may be studying the inspection process carefully in order to exploit any predictable patterns to avoid interdiction55 good example of using random principles is

security july 2002 washington dc pp viii 19 58 the study was only recently officially published prior to its release there was some considerable discussion of it in the trade pre ss by many who had seen the draft version of the report see for example govexeccom daily briefing july 23 2004 and homeland security monitor sept 10 2004 they quote the staff recommendation identically as follows congress should create independent red teams outside of tsa and dhs for the covert testing of all transportation modes while there was direct reference to red teaming in the final redacted version of the staff report unredacted footnotes numbered 604 607 and 610 all refer to the absence of red team exercises at logan and newark airports in the two years preceding 911 all th text to which the footnotes refer has been redacted however the simple existence of red teams could not possibly be the reason for redaction since the concept is included in the national strategy for homeland security continuedland border port between mexico and the ited states at the douglas az port this port uses sophisticated and auto mated algorithms to randomly switch inspectors from one lane to another as well as change targets for inspection and does so at random intervals using secu re communication system for the inspectors strategic planning red teams and war games consider the expanded use of red teams and warga ming these concepts are borrowed from both the national security and intelligence fields and are related functionally the use of red teams involves gathering expe rts in the security field and various potentially vulnerable sectors to creatively explore vulnerabilities and suggest ways in which attacks might be feasible war games involve taking the scenarios developed by the red teams nd determining ways to defeat the attack efforts this path was cited approvingly by the 9 11 commission in the following graphic example the commission noted that such techniques have been used by the military for many years revealing that the north american aerospace defense command norad had run an exercise that postulated hijacked airliner coming from overseas and crashing into the pentagon the exercise was terminated because of the exigencies of the korean war the commission identified the four elements common to this type of contingency planning as 1 think about how surprise attacks might be launched 2 iden tify telltale indicators connect ed to the most dangerous possibilities 3 where feasible collect in telligence on these indicators and 4 adopt defenses to deflect the most dangerous possibilities or at least trigger an early warning56 the first step represents the red team portion of the process and the fourth step is the wargaming phase the intervening stages are used to target intelligence to inform the entire response pr ocess the notion of red teams was specifically endorsed in the bush adminis trations national st rategy for homeland security57 more recently the red team tec hnique was also endorsed by the 911 staff group charged with aviation and trans portation security in an early version of its draft report to the commission58httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32841crs20 58 continued and the 911 commission heard public testimony from the leader of several faa red teams see statement of bogdan dzakovic to the national

radiation and explosives that are capable of working across transportation systems59 in terms of explosives detection the ability to use nii technology to detect explosives carried by passenger at distance could have very high payoff in the crowded setting of rail and transit terminals60 the 911 commission stated that the most powerful investments may be for impr ovements in technologies w ith application across the transportation modes such as scanning t echnologies designed to screen containers that can be transported by plane ship tr uck or rail though such technologies are becoming available now widespread deployment is still years away61 as noted above this is not intended as comprehensive inventory of all steps that could be considered nor is it series of recommendations the examples cited here flow directly from the frame works used above and offer few illustrative options that might be worth further exploration conclusion the goal is to find more effective wa ys to promote bette r border management this effort is complicated by the many potential goal conflicts that can arise in seeking greater security while at the same time trying to pursue other important national goals like promoting economic grow th assuring freedom of movement to lawabiding citizens and allies and protecting privacy and civil liberties pushing too hard on any one of these goals may make it too expensive both in terms of resource costs but also in losses imposed on other important social goals one possible path to facilitate this delicate balancing act is to pursue the layered approach recommended by th 911 commission and other bts analysts over the years such an approach would mitigate overreliance on any one policy action yet holds out the possibility of achieving higher level of security cumulatively by spreading actions over many ar eas to enhance the odds of either interdicting or deterring terrorist activity wherever it may occur it also addresses the dilemma of terrorist opportunism which fflicts preventive efforts that are more concentrated as fast as we secure one area through concentration of resources the terrorists have shown themselves to be remarkably adaptable in seeking other softerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32841crs21 targets in effect finding the weakest link in the defensive chain and attacking it instead of the newly hardened target whether policymakers wish to follow the layering strategy discussed above or pursue more targeted approach the opti ons identified above ma constitute useful point of departure for possible actions to consider under any circumstances the following criteria in the form of policy questions may be useful in evaluating how far to take any single action what are the relative priorities for action in the near term does the action yield security benefits that outweigh possible socialor economic costs is the step being taken in the least intrusive manner consistent withachieving the objective are incursions on privacy and ci vil liberties taken into account minimized and accompanied by appeals processes for any violations in what ways will the steps under c onsideration interact with others in the security process to provide higher cumulative security
