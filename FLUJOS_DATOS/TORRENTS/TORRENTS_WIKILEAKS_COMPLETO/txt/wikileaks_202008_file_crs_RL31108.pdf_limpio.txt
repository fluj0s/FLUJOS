contributions for nonitemizers began in the 107th congress with hr 7 passed by the house which had eight new tax provisions designed to benefit charities and charitable giving this deduction which was subject to phasedin cap of 100 200 for joint returns was in the presidents initial tax proposal although it was not capped in 2002 s 1924 which included temporary deduction with 400800 cap was introduced in the senate the senate finance committee adopted version of s 1924 with floor and ceiling also reported out as s 476 in the 108 th congress and passed april 9 2003 similar nonitemizer deduction was in hr 7 in the 108th congress passed by the house on september 17 2003 s 6 in the 109th congress included the same deduction as did hr 3908 and s 1780 the president did not include the deduction in the budget for fy20 06 the senatepassed reconciliation bill in 2005 s 2020 included temporary provision with floor paid for by providing floor for the itemized deduction the pension protection act pl 109208 adopted in 2006 included some incentives for charitable contributions but not nonitemizers deduction the presidents advisory panel on tax reform also included nonitemizers deduction with floor for all taxpayers equal to 1 of income this plan is still under review at the treasury department this paper focuses on the economic effect of the deduction assessing the incentive such deductions would create for increased charitable giving it does not attempt to estimate other types of societal impacts economic analysis suggests that the impact of the original proposed deduction on charitable giving is likely to be relatively small due to the proposed 100200 deduction cap for individuals and couples already contributing more than the cap there is additional incentive for further giving nonetheless the deduction w ould still generate significant government revenue loss effects are also reduced by estimates that project limited response by taxpayers particularly lower income taxpayers to this kind of charitable giving incentive analysis suggested that even when the deduction is fully phased in dollar of revenue loss is likely to increase charitable giving by three cents even under relatively optimistic assumptions the effect would be only half as large if one netted out the percentage of contributions that go to provide sacramental services to church members the higher caps in the 108 th congress proposals and in s 6 in the 109th as well as the floor is estimated to increase that amount to 18 cents the provisions in s 2020 should induce giving in greater amounts than these proposals with little or revenue loss capped charitable contribution deduction for nonitemizers would add complexity to the tax system and to the simplified tax forms used by millions of taxpayers since an additional line would have to be added charitable deductions are also particularly complicated for record keeping purposes because there is unified reporting system finally because of the small amounts in question and the absence of requirements for documentation for small gifts tax evasion may increase there are likely to be deductions taken even when contributions were made this report will be updated to reflect legislative developments

designed to benefit charities and charitable giving according to the joint committee on taxation the charitable tax benefit provisions were projected to cost 133 billion over 10 years when fully phased in they would have cost 24 billion on an annual basis the president proposed three of these tax provisions in his first tax proposal but these provisions were not included in the 2001 tax cut pl 10716 s 1924 introduced in the senate after discussion with the president and reported out in modified form on june 18 2002 also provided series of similar tax benefits it did not reach the floor but similar bill s 476 was passed by the senate on april 9 2003 version of hr 7 was reported by the ways and means committee and passed by the house on september 27 2003 with provisions similar to s 476 the pension protection act pl 109208 adopted in 2006 included some incentives for charitable contributions but not nonitemizers deduction the presidents advisory panel on tax reform also included nonitemizers deduction with floor for all taxpayers equal to 1 of income this plan is still under review at the treasury department this report summarizes the provisions affecting charitable contribution deductions of individuals and then analyzes the incentive such deduction would create for increased charitable giving beginning with the original proposal for relatively low cap and then considering other approaches including the current one it does not attempt to estimate other types of societal impacts the nonitemizers charitable deduction was the single most important tax provision in the original version of hr 7 in s 1924 s 476 and the 108 th congress current version of hr 7 the nonitemizer provision was temporary and d higher cap and floor the provision affecting rollovers from iras which can also function as deduction for nonitemizers is also discussed briefly the next section describes the proposed changes the following sections discuss three basic issues how effective and efficient the proposed nonitemizer deduction might be in increasing charitable contributions how equitable the change is and how the revision might affect tax complexity administration and compliance g6g142g156g140g155g146g153g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g14g138g160g561g138g151g141g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g156g561

deductions with the major deductions being charitable contributions excess medical expenses mortgage interest and state and local income and property taxes or choose the standard deduction the latter is advantageous if that amount is larger than total itemized deductions the original version of hr 7 would have allowed someone who takes the standard deduction to deduct charitable deductions in addition but with caps as shown in table 1 the deduction is taken from adjusted gross income and thus would not affect that measure s 1924 initially would have imposed cap of 400 800 for joint returns the version passed on april 9 2003 would have like the presidents proposal provided floor and cap of 250500 5001000 for joint returns similar provision was adopted on september 9 2003 by the ways and means committee the presidents advisory panel would expand the deduction to all taxpayers and apply floor of 1 of income t

formerly available in the tax law enacted as part of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 the deduction was temporary for the years 19811986 and initially restricted to dollar ceilings and partial deductions eg deductions for 25 and then 50 of contributions however 1986 was year with dollar limits and full deductions the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 was measure aimed at lowering rates and broadening the tax base since it made provision for extending the charitable deduction that provision ended after 1986 however data from 1986 provide basis for estimating some of the economic effects of the current proposal g11g20g3g561g20g152g149g149g152g159g142g155g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g561 the second largest provision in the original version of hr 7 and retained in other versions is one allowing tax free distributions by individuals aged 70 and12 and over from individual retirement accounts to charitable organizations while this treatment may appear different from simply including the amounts in adjusted gross income and then deducting them as itemized deductions it can provide several types of benefits even to those who itemize apparently an important motivation is to reduce adjusted gross income which can trigger variety of phaseouts and phaseins including the phasein of taxation of social security benefits another potentially important phaseout effect that for itemized deductions is now scheduled to be eliminated there are also some income limits on charitable contributions however unlike the case in the presidents proposal this provision can also benefit those who take the standard deduction by allowing exclusions that would not be otherwise allowed in effect return with the standard deduction would have cap on charitable deductions up to the limit of aggregate ira amounts since the taxpayer could simply channel contributions through an ira this effect did not matter in the presidents proposal which had cap this provision was adopted as part of the pe nsion protection act pl 109280 with rollovers limited to 100000 per year g17g157g145g142g155g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 the remaining provisions include phased in increase in the cap on corporate charitable contributions change in the treatment of contributed property by firms modifications of excise taxes on net investment income and one previous version in the house included provision restricting the counting of some administrative costs as part of foundations minimum distribution requirement changes in the treatment of unrelated business income changes in the treatment of self constructed property and modification of basis for certain appreciated assets the increase in the corporate charitable deduc tion limit was also included in the presidents httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31108g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g5g145g138

revenue terms of the remaining provisions1 the senatepassed bill however excluded these provisions but contained other ones some other provisions affecting charitable donations were also included in the pension protection act2 g7g143g143g146g140g146g142g151g140g162g561g138g151g141g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g146g159g142g151g142g156g156g561 the first question that one might consider is whether the deduction for nonitemizers is effective and efficient in achieving its goal the charitable deduction provision is combined with other legislative initiatives including charitable choice provisions that are designed to liberalize rules governing the administration of public funds by religious organizations the stated purpose of the tax revision was to encourage giving to charitable organizations to provide funds to charitable organizations many of which will perform activities that otherwise would have to be performed by the federal government 3 economic theory also recognizes an efficiency rationale for subsidies to charitable giving when individuals give to charity they do not take into account the benefits their contribution provides to others and therefore charitable giving is under supplied in market economy indeed other potential donors in society can receive the benefits from the charitable activities of others without contributing this freerider problem is in fact one of the justifications for government activities that use mandated contributions taxes to provide variety of services some activities such as national defense would probably be impossible to provide privately most of the support of the poor is also undertaken by government other activities that may have broad benefits to society eg research and development art education are provided both publicly and privately there are advantages and disadvantages in using direct funding versus encouraging private charitable donations for example government provision may more generally reflect the collective preferences of society but priv ate provision may provide added diversity the under supply of charitable activities is greater in some circumstances than in others one important factor is the size of the contributing group in general the larger the pool of contributors or potential contributors the greater the freerider problem it is also more difficult to obtain better market outcome if the benefits of the activity are not excludable for example contributions that finance health research benefit all members of society for that reason government is heavily involved in providing fu nds for such research and in providing legal framework eg patent laws that encourage the profitmaking sector to invest art museums however have the option of charging admission to finance their services so that these institutions would still exist perhaps in smaller numbers in the absence of both charitable donations and government support 1 see joint tax committee description of an amendment in the

private giving is that it is not always easy to separate pure charitable giving and giving in which the donor receives direct benefit contributor to the opera for example who receives seating preference is receiving benefit contributors to institutions of higher education may find it more likely that their children are admitted to prestigious schools and one of the more obvious examples of small groups that receive benefits are contributions to churches where contributions are partly used to provide services to members this provision of sacramental and similar services is particularly important in evaluating the deduction for nonitemizers because of the very large fraction of contributions that go to religious organizations there is also some leakage in the tax system in that individuals will claim deductions for expenditures they did not incur this problem may be particularly likely to arise with small cash donations since there is requirement that small donations be substantiated and it is not efficient for the tax authorities to make efforts to enforce compliance associated with small dollar amounts another issue is whether dollar spent stimulating private giving will result in contributions regardless of their use that are greater than dollar or smaller than dollar if the induced contribution is larger private charitable tax incentives are more efficient than direct spending assuming the objectives of private and public spending are equally desirable the stimulative effect of tax subsidy is measured by the price elasticity as rule of thumb without considering other factors such as the whether the contributions actually go to charitable purpose and the effects of caps dollar of revenue cost will result in more than dollar of giving if the price elasticity is above one in absolute value all further references to price elasticities will refer to absolute values without negative signs finally an important issue with capped deduction is what portion of the revenue loss is associated with individuals whose deductions in the absence of the subsidy are less than the cap if individuals are already giving more than the cap there is economic incentive for further giving since further giving will not affect tax liability however the government still incurs revenue loss therefore the amount of induced giving per dollar of revenue cost for the nonitemizer capped deduction is the product of three factors the absolute value of the price elasticity the share of the cost going to individuals not subject to the cap and the share of the induced contributions going to desired charitable activities the following subsections explore each of these in turn g22g145g142g561g18g155g146g140g142g561g7g149g138g156g157g146g140g146g157g162g561 research on the price elasticity of charitable contributions had long suggested that other things equal charitable contributions deductions might be efficient since elasticities averaged above one however these studies were criticized because they did not control for transitory timing effects high income

timing effects but also considered the older elasticity of 13 reflecting general findings of earlier studies4 recent study duquette 1999 of nonitemizer contributions also suggests that elasticities will be below one in absolute value5 this study examined the nonitemizer deductions allowed in 1985 and 1986 when ceilings were not present and also estimated price elasticities for itemizers note that this study could not correct for transitory effects including the temporary nature of the deduction for nonitemizers which would have encouraged individuals to shift deductions especially to 1986 particularly those at higher income levels this study found elasticities for 1985 and 1986 of 1 and 124 for itemizers but elasticities of 08 and 06 for non itemizers note that the estimate for nonitemizers in 1985 while statistically significant was not measured very precisely the estimate for 1986 while measured somewhat more precisely may be overstated because individuals would have an incentive to concentrate their contributions in that year these findings of lower elasticities for nonitemizers are also consistent with evidence that suggests that price elasticities are not constant across income levels but are lower at lower levels examining itemized returns that do not suffer as much from transitory effects duquette finds price elasticities for the 1 to 40000 income class to be 008 in 1985 and 025 in 1986 with neither estimate statistically different from zero elasticities rise as income increases although some of that increase may reflect the greater importance of transitory effects at higher income levels as shown in table 2 where the 1986 data are reported by income class but restated in 2001 income levels nonitemizer deductions are concentrated in lower income levels simply because it is in the lower income levels that the standard deduction is normally taken based on duquettes elasticities by income level an average elasticity weighted by the number of contributors in each class suggests an elasticity of 010 based on 1985 data and 029 based on 1986 data these estimates are however highly imprecise the effects of caps which tend to concentrate the marginal benefit even more among lower income levels would slightly decrease these estimates on the whole therefore the evidence suggests price elasticities that are considerably lower than one and perhaps not very different from zero in the analysis below we use the estimate of 05 which reflects typical level from the literature corrected for transitory effects is somewhat below duquettes direct estimates which do t correct for transitory effects and somewhat above the income weighted estimates we also discuss the effects of alternative choices 4 see charles clotfelter and richard l

in these data is provided in the appendix however some simple approximations will explain why this share is relatively small to begin with we need to estimate an aggregate that reflects the shares of joint versus single returns since only 20 of nonitemizer returns are joint number of about 32 is appropriate our actual estimates are slightly different because shares are adjusted by income class but out of the class with contributions below the ceiling the average deduction will also be below the ceiling while for those above the ceiling the average deduction will also be the ceiling amount if say the average were only half the cap the percentage of deductions below the ceiling would fall to 19 032 x 05032x05 068 however this number is also too large because the data indicate the cumulative share of the population under ceiling do not rise proportionally with ceiling increases that is the function is not linear one for that reason the average contribution in the bottom class tends to be less than half the ceiling functional form that fits the data quite well suggests that the average will be about 32 of the ceiling this correction would lead to about 13 of the cost associated with the group under the ceiling 032 x 032032x032 068 the tax revenue shares would be further lowered because small contributors are concentrated in low tax rate brackets calculations in the appendix suggest that the average tax rate in this class is only 70 of the average across all taxpayers causing the share to fall to 95 of the total 032 x 032x07032x032x07068 two other factors tend to lower the share although they interact with the correction described above in ways that cause only small additional reduction first the survey data cover the entire population while tax benefits go only to the taxpaying population about 20 of returns have tax liability before credits since low levels of donations are associated with lower levels of income the share of the taxpaying population with small donations should be considerably smaller than the share of the total population adjustments for these effects suggest that about 24 of the taxpaying population would fall below the caps finally the caps were phased in and began at 2550 rather than 100200 moreover even as caps increase in nominal value they are also decl ining in value relative to income so the shares will fall below 10 an adjustment is also made for these effects which vary by year but even in the year that benefits are fully phased in the caps are cut approximately in half further details of the methodology used to make these adjustments are provided in appendix table 3 presents the estimated share of revenue loss that falls under the cap as result of these calculations after 2011 the share would continue to decline as nominal values fall relative to incomes for the 400800 ceiling the share of revenue going to individuals with marginal incentive would be higher but is still at 24 7 7 the congressional

deduction is what types of contributions are induced this issue is particularly important because of the amount of giving to religious organizations to the extent that those contributions provide for member benefits they may be less likely to efficiently address the market failures in charitable contributions identified by economic theory or the objectives stated directly in the legislation to provide for private provision of services that might otherwise be provided by the government the most important recipient of all charitable giving is religion which accounted for 365 of the total 20345 billion of giving in 2000 8 it is almost three times as large as the next largest recipient area education which accounts for 138 the remaining categories health human services arts culture publicsociety environment and international affairs account for less than 10 each religious giving accounts for an even larger share 434 of giving excluding foundations foundations account for 12 of giving individuals for 75 bequests for 78 and corporate giving for 53 however giving to religious organizations is even more pronounced among individuals at lower and moderate incomes as shown in

in this section we combine the three estimating parameters to estimate the induced giving in cents per dollar of revenue cost these estimates are provided in table 5 and they indicate that initially excluding religious member services each dollar of revenue lost will result in one cent of induced contributions this amount will gradually rise to two cents before beginning to fall if all giving is included the induced amount begins at slightly over two cents gradually rising to almost four cents the estimated effects of the 400800 caps in the original versions of s 1924 would be somewhat larger 12 cents per dollar of revenue 05 x 024 with half that amount going to religious services for an induced giving outside of religious services of 6 cents per dollar of revenue loss the combination of

109th congress by any of the measures very little induced giving occurs as result of the capped itemizer deduction in hr 7 or even in s 1924 the most important limiting factor is the cap on deductions which causes most of the revenue loss to accrue as benefit or windfall to individuals who are already giving in excess of the cap however the effectiveness is also limited by the relatively low price elasticity which alone would cause only 50 cents of induced giving per dollar of revenue loss even without the caps or exclusion of religious member services deduction with caps would result in only 24 cents of induced giving out side of religious member services thus all three factors act to limit the effectiveness of the deduction for nonitemizers t able 5 stimated cents of charitable giving p

caps even using the higher 1986 estimates with the lower 1985 estimates the elasticity would be 012 without cap and 010 with cap estimating the share attributable to caps is also subject to number of potential uncertainties because of limitations of the data it is possible that small contributors are less likely to be making regular contributions to churches and the estimates in column two may be somewhat understated at the same time the estimates do not take into the account the possibility that lot of small deductions may simply be claimed without making contribution given the fact that such small deductions are likely to be unchallenged by the tax authorities

deduction is less costly than an uncapped deduction but also less efficient it is possible to increase the efficiency level by use of floor and the senate adopted proposal that has cap as well as floor10 as the appendix shows this same data can be used to estimate floor in the case of 500 1000 for joint returns floor we estimate that each dollar of revenue loss will induce 64 cents of giving and 32 cents if religious services were excluded the floor increases the power of the effect which would otherwise be 50 cents total on the dollar with deduction with neither cap nor floor and an important constraint is the elasticity floor however tends to shift the distributional effect to higher in come individuals compared to ceiling one approach that is likely to be even more efficient and which does not shift the distribution as much is to have floor as percentage of income it is more efficient because the floor can be moved up to reflect the higher giving levels of higher income individuals while our data do not permit the full projection of large floors and thus effects can be calculated only at lower incomes initial results suggest that this approach would be considerably more effective per dollar of revenue for the 12000 to 24000 income class floor that was 2 of income was estimated to induce 81 cents of contributions per dollar in the 24000 to 36000 class each dollar of loss is estimated to induce 104 of contributions in the 33000 to 48000 income level each dollar of loss is estimated to induce 131 of contributions these effects would of course vary with the percentage of income falling as the percentage falls and rising as it rises and about half would go to religious services 11 g7g154g158g146g157g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 equity issues are probably not the principal issues associated with charitable deduction for nonitemizers the tax cut benefits individuals in the lower and moderate income classes relative to many types of tax cuts but the same effects could be accomplished with an increase in the standard deduction it may be argued that individuals should be able to deduct charitable contributions separately because they do not benefit from them however economic theory does not provide particular justification for deducting charitable transfers on equity grounds since individuals freely make such contributions and derive some benefit from them even if the benefit is only good feeling moreover individuals who take the standard deduction generally elect to take it because it is larger than their itemized deductions including charitable contributions another claim that might be made is that charitable giving directly benefits the poor as recipients of funds of course as indicated above very little of the revenue loss translates into additional 10 the effect of floor is also estimated in extending the charitable deduction to nonitemizers policy issues and options by joseph cordes john ohare and eugene steuerle

goes to charity is focused on poor people for example only about 6 of giving to religious organizations is estimated to go to benefit poor individuals and while the share benefitting the poor is somewhat higher in some other categories we estimate that more than 10 of all charitable giving directly benefits the poor12 moreover very little of this amount is in the form of cash transfers

deduction for nonitemizers adds complexity to the tax system indeed one of the standard deductions major purposes has been to reduce the complications of tax filing by allowing fixed sum for most individuals as substitute for itemized deductions allowing an additional deduction for charitable contributions would add an additional complication in particular since charitable deductions may occur in small amounts and require more recordkeeping than many other kinds of deductions most itemized deductions taxes mortgage interest are reported directly to taxpayers but records of small charitable contributions must be kept by taxpayers themselves individuals who wish to claim the deduction would have to use more complicated forms and all individuals using those forms would have an additional line to read an additional deduction also makes it more difficult to consider moving some day to simplified returnfree income tax filing system in addition because of the small sums involved with cap and the lack of requirement for recordkeeping for these small sums the allowanc of an deduction for charitable contributions may induce more than average amounts of tax evasion many individuals will probably figure they can safely report small amount of fictitious contributions without any consequences although there were many individuals who made contributions at all when the nonitemizers deduction was allowed in the early 1980s g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 the most important revision that might be considered in the nonitemizer deduction is to eliminate the caps of course one of the constraints on tax cuts is the shortage of revenue however it would be possible to modify the deduction to make more of the contributions subject to marginal effects even while limiting the revenue cost one approach would be to raise or even eliminate the ceilings and provide only partial deduction partial deductions were allowed during the 19811985 period an approach that would have an even more pronounced effect on targeting the marginal contribution would be to institute floor rather than ceiling as is the case for medical deductions such floor increased the bang for the buck somewhat for the version of s 1924 reported by the senate finance committee but its effect was still constrained by the cap flat dollar floor would simplify administration and redu ce false claims of deductions floor based on income would be most effective although more complicated to compute floor might also direct even more of the benefits to religious activities that provide direct services to the contributors 12 these estimates are based on the articles in who benefits from the nonprofit sector edited by charles t clotfelter chicago university of chicago press 1992

share of dollars going to individuals who will have marginal incentive requires the combining of two sets of data the 1986 data on the number of returns that claimed the non itemized deductions for charitable contributions and recent data by the independent sector showing that 293 of individuals made contributions that amounted to less than 100 and 446 of individuals made contributions that amounted to less than 200 these data are not distributed by income we cannot directly use these latter numbers for several reasons first these survey data on distribution of contributions by size of cont ribution cover individuals who would have tax liability and thus would not have benefit from the deduction since there is correlation between small contribution size small income and lack of tax liability the percentage would be smaller secondly the dollar limits depend on filing status joint or single so that the numbers must be weighted to reflect ceilings averaged over filing status to allocate these amounts over incomes we used the average contribution in each income class from table 1 as guide to the differential share of individuals in each class below the cap by measuring the share that would have fallen below the contribution limit based on uniform distribution of contributions this approach produces total number that is too small because there are likely to be some individuals in each class with very large contributions that affect the average in way that uniform distribution would not the formula for this ratio is the dollar cap divided by twice the average contribution this method produces shares that begin at 24 in the lowest class and decline to 12 in the next bracket 10 in the next and so forth with an average of 104 for all of the income classes the 200 and 100 amounts were computed separately and then weighted in the case of the 200 amount we begin with an overall average of 4 46 however some of that amount reflects individuals who might have not claimed deduction because of lack of tax liability we made an adjustment only in the lowest bracket by assuming that the differential between the share claiming the deduction in that bracket and the next bracket was part of the reported share this amount of 63 reduces the overall average for taxable returns under 200 to 383 similar procedure reduces the share for the 100 and over co ntribution class to 230 this adjustment is imperfect since it assumes all of that amount is due to contributors overstating the adjustment but makes adjustment for the next bracket where some returns might not be taxable as well understating the adjustment to obtain the totals each ratio was multiplied by the share derived from the uniform distribution calculation so that for the 200 category the share in the lowest class was 90 383104 times 024 the next class was 46 and so forth similar procedure was calculated for the 100 class in calculating the totals however an exclusion of returns expected to have tax liability under current tax law was made for the joint return 200 number the first bracket was excluded entirely for the single or head of household return 100 number two thirds of the first bracket was excluded based on the exempt levels of singles and heads of household and the share of returns that are heads of household in that category the resulting effect of excluding this total was to reduce the under 200 share from 383 to 369 and the under 100 share from 23 to 225

joint returns filed in that class based on 1997 data inflated to 2001 income levels this procedure yielded total of 241 of returns with contributions under the cap this 241 number is however too large to use in estimating contributions induced per dollar of revenue loss first those over the cap have full 200100 deduction while those under the cap have only partial deductions thus it is necessary to estimate the average size of contributions for those below the cap secondly the returns above the cap will have higher marginal tax rates than those under the cap because the share under the cap falls as income rises to correct for this effect we weighted the tax rates for the cap and the tax rates for all returns and found those with cap had tax rates approximately 70 of those over the cap finally the caps begin at smaller level and are phased in nominal terms in 2002 and 2003 the ceiling is only quarter of the size of the long run amounts 25 and 50 rather th an 100 and 200 and the dollar amounts do not rise with income even the data on the shares with 200 and 100 ceilings from 1999 must be corrected for growth over that time that is to maintain the shares of individuals under the caps the 100 and 200 amounts must have been increase d with income growth adjusting by growth rates that have already occurred in output and by the projections of the congressional budget office 100 deduction in 1999 must have growth by 76 to maintain its relative value in 2010 which is the same as saying for purposes of pplying the data from 1999 that the 2010 deduction is only 54 of its value in 1999 in adjusting the shares for these lower real amounts however another problem is projecting from the data 446 giving less than 200 and 293 giving less than 100 this function is not linear that is if we want to examine the effect of deduction 25 as big we cannot simply use share quarter as large the data suggest some sort of exponential function relating cumulative shares of the population to dollar amounts we considered two functional forms the first is function derived from an exponential probability distribution of the form 1 1e x ps xp where s is the cumulative share of the population falling below the dollar value of x with x ranging from zero to infinity the second functional form was 2 psax to project these relationships we used all of the observations of shares up to 1000 assumed an exponential function and fitted the curve both curves performed well statistically however the first functional form did not match shares very well at the lower end of the distribution the second function matched these shares very closely but had the disadvantage that probabilities do not sum to one we chose the function that fit most closely at the low end of the scale and which yielded an exponential curve with power of 04476 13 in general limit 25 as large would 13 for the first seven increments of 100 the shares are 0293 0153 0122 0086 0066 0049 and 0025 the next 300 from 700 to 1000 account for 0057 despite the small number of observations the constant term and exponent were statistically significant and precisely estimated

the average contribution within cumulative interval is 1p p times the ceiling of that cumulative interval this amount is obtained by integrating the density function 1ppax times x and then dividing by the cumulative probability this ratio amounts to about 32 04476104476 indicating that the average contribution in the group of contributors that gave less than 100 is 32 this amount is less than the average of 50 that would occur with linear relations thus the functional form causes larger share of individuals to remain under the cap compared to linear form but lower average contribution for those individuals the results will differ somewhat however depending on what assumptions are made about where the contributors below the limit that have tax li ability fall relative to the contributors below the limit if these two groups are scattered randomly ac ross the entire population share subject to the caps one can just multiply the population ratios by the original share of 241 and the constant share by the new dollar ceiling this assumption is not entirely reasonable and an alternative one is that nontaxable contributors take up the very bottom of the distribution and taxable contributors are stacked on top of these individuals this approach understates somewhat the share of the taxpaying population that is covered especially in the early years but overstates the average contribution within that population in this case the ratio of individuals included would be multiplied by the share of all individuals which we calculate at about 35 based on the ratios of joint and single returns and then subtract the amounts associated with the nontaxable share which we estimate at about 109 the taxable population share goes down by much more than in the approach used above however the average contribution using this approach is much higher 1 1 109 p px n t p s where ntps is new taxable population share and also multiplied by the difference between the new ceiling and the ceiling associated with the distribution running up to 109 divided by the new ceilings based on these relationships we predict the shares of individual revenues that would be covered under the cap as shown in table 3 the formula for dollars spent affecting taxpayers at the margin is 07 07 1rxr ss where r is the ratio of the average contribution to the ceiling and s is the share of the taxable population falling under the cap for the 400800 cap in s 1924 the share is estimated at 24 data presented that report for 1999 indicated that significant fraction of contri butions were made by individuals contributing less than 800 and 400 813 and 654 as noted above these numbers are much too high because they must be adjusted for the distribution across taxable returns and weighted for the share of returns filed by single individuals who tend to be more important at the lower income levels these adjustments led to an estimate that about 566 of individuals would have contributions under these amounts when adjusted for the lower value of deductions granted in 2002 compared with 1999 income levels this adjustment resulted in share of 504 that is 504 of the individuals who make contributions ar likely to fall under the ceiling and thus are likely to have marginal inducement to contribute we estimate that the average amount given would be approximately 39 of the cap while the share of those above the cap would be the cap it self this factor would cause the share to be 28 in addition the tax rate of individuals under the cap will be lower than the rate of those over the cap and we estimate the ratio of tax rates to

fall to 238 that is only about 24 of the revenue cost would accrue to individuals where an incentive to give would still exist to estimate induced giving we used an elasticity of 05 which resulted in an additional giving of 12 cents 05 x 238 per dollar of revenue loss these estimates are if anything likely to be little high since about 70 of giving by nonitemizers is to religious organizations and about 70 of that amount is for sacramental services and similar services for members about half or 6 cents per dollar would go to these member services in the analysis of the effects of floor the analysis uses the estimates of the number of individuals who fall below the floor and their average deduction along with overall average deductions to determine the average deduction for those above the floor that is 1ba ads d s d where ad refers to average deduction s is the share of individuals giving below the floor ad b is the average deduction for individuals below the floor and ad is the average deduction for those above the floor we consider the case of floor of 500 for single return and 1000 for joint return with these floors each dollar of revenue loss is estimated to lead to about 64 cents of induced contributions with about half of that amount going to provide sacramental or other religious services according the data referred to above significant fraction of contributions were made by individuals contributing less than 1000 and 500 851 and 720 again these raw numbers are too high because they must be adjusted for the distribution across taxable returns and weighted across taxpayers resulting in share of 619 after adjusting for income levels the share is estimated at 562 that is 562 of the individuals who make contributions are likely to fall under the floor for these individuals we estimate that the aver age amount given would be approximately 39 of the floor using the formula above and weighting across returns and filing status we estimate that the average individual contributing over the floor amount would contribute 4575 times the floor the floor makes the contribution an estimated 128 times as effective for these individuals as deduction allowed without floor 457545751 this amount must be multiplied in turn by the price elasticity which is estimated at 05 to yield an induced contribution per dollar of 64 cents 05 x 128 as with other estimates about half of this amount would go to fund religious services and the remaining half would go to other purposes for moving floor the shares are estimated for each floor in each income class the get data on shares and giving ratios unfortunately not all of these effects can be estimated with the data available since these data do not extend above 1000 thus it is impossible to extrapolate above that level the results for both floor and ceiling as estimated for the senate proposal indicate that 402 of contributors fall below the floor and about 562 fall below the ceiling on average the tax rates of individuals below the ceiling are about 70 of those above the ceiling 0177 compared to 0254 individuals below the floor have contributions that average about 41 of the floor while those below the ceiling have contributions that average 39 of the ceiling the formula for calculating this effect is
