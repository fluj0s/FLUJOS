requirements of federal election law by contrast soft money refers to funds raised and spent outside the federal election regulatory framework but which may have at least an i ndirect impact on federal elections chapter ii major reforms proposed by category this section of the report is organized into 15 subsections encompassing the 14 major areas of reform addressed in proposed 108th congress bills and miscellaneous category for provisions outside that framework in each subsection bills containing provisions that address that particular area are noted greater detail for each provision and sense of how b ills various provisions might affect each other can be found in chapter iii where b ill summaries appear in numerical order in some cases reference is made here to other provisions of the same bill for easy reference arbitrary decisions we re made as to the primary nature and goal of particular provision many provisions however ve multiple purposes for example bill that would raise the limit on an individuals contributions to political parties would empower both the individual and the political party such provision would be listed here under individual as it most directly affects what an individual may do even though the pa rties would bene fit as well the first six categories can be examined in the context of hard money as they pertain to types of activity that are re gulated under federal election law which specifies prohibited sources sets limits on permitted contributions and requires disclosure the six hard money categorie s are shown on the checklist in chapter i under larger heading of hard money with the first four individuals pacs parties and candidates fu rther grouped to reflect the four principal sources of campaign receipts the eighth ninth and tenth categories comprise provisions dealing with soft money the eighth contains provisions relating to party soft money and some general provisions the ninth focuses on nonparty soft money direct activities of unions and cor porations and the tenth addresses issue advocacy electionrelated communications that fall rgely outside the purview of the federal election campaign act

independent expenditures are communica tions with the public advocating the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates made wit hout any coordination cooperation or consultation w ith the candidates they are not subject to limits on amounts spent but the source re strictions and disclosure requirements of federal law apply this hard money activity should not be confused with issue advocacy which is largely outside federal election regulation this is treated in separate category below increase disclosur requirements hr 3641 tierney for clean money candidates coordination hard

coordinated activity as contribution or expenditure hr 3641 tierney but exempts party spending for clean money candidates soft money party this term has traditionally referred to money that may indirectly influence federal elections but that is raised and spent outside federal election laws purview and that would be illegal if sp ent directly in connection w ith federal election prior to enactment of the bipartisan campai gn reform act of 2002 bcra national parties commonly raised money from sour ces and in amounts that were federally impermissible these funds could then be tr ansferred to state pa rties where permitted under state election law and used for grassr oots and generic party activity party soft money was also used for share of admin istrative and overhead expenses and issue advocacy since bcras prohibition on the ra ising of soft money by national partieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32650crs13 and federal officials this issue has largely been moot those few bills that address it focus solely on improving disc losure of state party funds add disclosure requirements hr 1878 andrews allows state parties to file copies of state reports with fec if substantially similar to what fec requires hr 3525 doolittle requires copies of state party reports to be filed with fec soft money nonparty nonparty soft money pertains to direct spending by and activity of groups as opposed to their donations to another entity such as parties the term is most commonly used to refer to union and corpor ate treasury money that federal election law allows for three exempt activities aimed only at specified restricted classes corporate executives and stockholders nd families and union members and their families the three exempt activities are setting up and raising money for pac internal communications including express advocacy and voter registration and getoutthevote drives add election law disclosure requirements hr 1878 andrews issue advocacy soft money prior to enactment of bcra in 2002 observers had become concerned about communications that promoted political issues in reference to candidates but which by avoiding the use of specific election advocacy language eg elect jones or defeat smith were not s ubject to regulation under fede ral election law these issue advocacy communications contrasted with those that explicitly promoted the election or defeat of clearly identifi ed candidates known as express advocacy since the courts had generally construed express advocacy communications in narrow sense ie using explicit phrases communications that may have been perceived as constituting thinlyveiled election activity could thus avoid federal disclosure and source regulations bcra addressed issue advocacy by creatin g new term in federal election law electioneering communication political advertisements that refer to clearly identified federal candidate nd are broadcast within 30 da ys of primary or 60 days of general election the act prohibite d unions and certain corporations from spending treasury funds for electioneerin g communications and required disclosure of disbursements of ove r 10000 and the identity of donors of 1000 or more in part because of bcras narrowl ytailored response to issue advocacy concerns remain some be lieve bcra went too far nd favor the repeal of itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32650crs14 electioneering communications provision others believe it did not go far enough and favor more regulation in this area of particular interest has been the activity of political organizations defi ned by section 527 of the in ternal revenue code irc while congress in 2000 enacted public w 106230 to require disclosure by 527 groups through the irs much

provide 1 campaign spending limits for house or senate candi dates on overall campaign or candidate personal spending or advertising time restrictions 2 public costsaving bene fits to candidates or 3 both they are grouped together because many bills embody both concepts largely because voluntary system of limits with conditional benefits has been major response to the buckley v valeo ruling 424 us 1 1976 which overturned mandatory limits this grouping should not be construed as an inherent linkage between the two ideas there are very distinct principles behind spending limits and public benefits or financing options among spending limit bills include voluntary limits in response to buckley with or without inducements to participation through public benefits mandatory limits through
