concepts citizenship concerns the political status and rights conferred on person by nation such as the right to vote and to hold office nationality concerns the status of person unde r1 internati onal law ie the allegiance which person owes to nation and th protecti on owed by nation to person vis vis another nation in the us l citizens are nationals but not all nationals are citizens nationals by birth who ar citizens are those persons born or presumed to be born in the us born in th outlying possessions to parents at least one of whom is us citizen who satisfie s certain condit ions precedent or born outside the us and its possessions to parents at least one of whom is us citizen who satisfies certain conditions precedent2 nationals by birth who are not citizens are those perso ns born or presumed to be born in an outlying posses sion of the us on or after the date of formal acquisition of the possession or born to parents at least one of whom is us national who satisfie s certain conditions precedent aside from this distinction generally the terms seem3 to be used interchangeably although citizenship is really subset of nationality therefore although the us provision concerni ng loss of nationality is entitled loss of nationality by nativeborn or naturalized citizen the courts also appear to have4 used the two terms interchangeably so the loss of nationality seems to be understoodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98819crs2 the american law institute 1 3rd restatement of the foreign relations law of the5 united states 212 comment c reporters note 4 1986

nation are really12 determined by the laws of that other nation claiming person as citizen andor as national therefore when naturalized us citizen renounces allegiance to his13 former country if the laws of that country do not recognize the renunciation tha t person still retains the citizenship of his former country in deference to th sovereignty of that other nation the us generally recognizes

mer commission of an act of expatriation enumerated in section 1481 or any other act that may be evidence of expatriation cannot result in loss of citizenship unless commit ted voluntarily and with specific intent at one time us citizen could lose his citizenship by denationalizati on as well as by expatriation the19 distinction is that expatriation is loss of citizenship resulting from an act evincing the desire and intention of the ci tizen to renounce his citizenship while denationalization is loss of citizenship resulting from co nduct which congress has decided is contrary to the national in terest and thus should result in loss of citizenship while conduct resulting in denationalization had to be voluntary and not coerced there was n requirement of specific or subjective intention to renounce c itizenship for example at one time an american woman could be denationalized by marrying foreigner the womans lack of subjective intent to renounce her us citizenship was irrelevant if she married voluntarily she lost her citizenship one interpretation is that th e20 voluntariness of the denationalizing conduct was equivalent to an objective intent to renounce us citizenship21 over the years the united states supreme court has moved toward stricte r interpre tation of expatriation formerly the supreme court upheld the power f congress to denationalize us citiz even citizen by birth finally it reversed22 itself and found that the fourteent h amendment prevents congress from legislating23 the automatic loss of citizensh ip by naturalization or birth in the us merely because of certain conduct without that citizens assent there has been at least one case24 which found that congress could set conditions on the retention of us citizenship for person born abroad to parents only one of who m has us citizenship since the person was neither born nor naturaliz ed in the us but merely derived his citizenship from the parent he was not protected from denationalization by the fourteent hhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98819crs5 rogers v bellei 401 us 815 1970 the conditions of residency between the ages25 of fourteen and twentye ight years for retention of

allegiance as part of naturalizatio n process in order to gain employmentamendment more recently the supreme court elaborated on its earlier decision25 in afroyim by holding that the government had to prove specific intent to renounce citizenship the statutory provisions on expatriation state that the party claimin g26 that expatriation occurred must establish the claim by preponderance of th evidence any act of ex patriation including those enumerated under 1481 will be presumed to have been done voluntarily but the presumption may be rebutted upon showing by preponderance of the evidence that the act or acts committed r performed were not done voluntarily terrazas upheld the statutory evidentiar standards as constitutional but in light of afroyim and the fourteenth amendment it required finding of intent to relinquish us citizenship and stated that n presumption of intent arose from an expatriating act finding of intent did t27 require written express relinquishment of citizenship intent could be found by preponderance of the evidence it could be infer red from conduct that was completely inconsistent with and derogatory to allegiance to the us28 the courts have interpreted the s tatutory requirements with regard to several of the acts of expatriation regarding an oath of allegiance and statement f renunciation court has found that signing an oath of allegiance to another country as part of that countrys naturalization process did not constitute renunciation of us citizenship in the absence of an explicit renunciation the courts have found tha t29 where there is an explicit renunciation or an oath of allegiance accompanied by r including an explicit renuncia tion the requisite specific intent exists and the citizen is expatriated on the other

subsequen t attempt to retract his renunciation was deemed ineffective because he had alread voluntarily and effectively renounced us citizenship35 administ ratively it appears that since the line of cases holding that perso n must have committed an expatriating act voluntarily and with specific intent to lose citizenship the state department has taken permissive position with regard t whether person has lost citizenship upon commission of an act even taking n36 oath of all egiance to foreign state which renounces allegiance to the united states is considered strong but not necessarily

naturalization process in anothe r nation he might well be advised for example to take care that renunciation of us citizenship i s included in any required oath of allegiance us citizen must also be cautious if he or she is considering accepting government position in the other country in recent years many easteuropean american dual nationals have been going to eastern europ to aid in the

early 1990s was said to have receive d39 express permission from the us state department to retain his us citizenship while serving as prime minister us citizenship may have been deemed so inherentl y40 incomp atible with holding high government position in foreign country that n intent to relinquish us citizenship could arguably be found in the act of accepting such high office an additional factor in this case was the embargo against the former yugoslavia as us citizen panic had to receive permission from the united states for travel to yugosla via in an even more recent case valdas adamkus the current president of lithuania baltic state onc part of the soviet union was naturalized us citizen who had fled his native country more than fifty years ago after hi s election in lithuania he renounced hi s us citizenship reportedly the lithuanian41 constitution would have permi tted him to retain his us citizenship while serving as president however he had made campaign promise to renounce his us citizenship knowing it would be politically awkward to retain it he went to the us embassy in vilnius lithuania to turn in his passport sign formal renunciation of us citizenship and receive dip lomatic visa it appears that since lithuanian laws permitted him to r etain his us citizenship and did not require him to renounce it to take office us laws would have permitted him to retain his us citizenship an d that president adamkus action was not legally required if the laws of the other country provide for mand atory military service for young men they may

describe the dual nationality or citizenship laws f selected countries in which it appears that significant number of americans possess nationality or citizenship in particul ar recent changes in the constitution and federal statutes of mexico have received great deal of attention in the united states since those changes were apparently motivated at least in part by the effects of recen t immigration law reforms in the united states on mexican citizens who are permanent resident aliens in the united states additionally the relevant citizenship an d nationality laws of israel ireland and colombia will be discussed the laws discussed here do not include the naturalization laws which could result in dual citizenship if us citizen chose to apply for naturalization in those countries rather thi s discussion focuses on describing those laws which provide for retention of nationality after naturalization in the united states or for acquisition of nationality by descent sort of jus sanguinis it has been suggested that the exercise of the rights an d privileges of prior nationality by naturalized us citizen after the date f naturalization calls into question the truthfulness of the citizens oath of allegiance to the united states and renunciation of other allegiances and that therefore th naturalization could be invali dated on the grounds of fraud in the procurement on51
