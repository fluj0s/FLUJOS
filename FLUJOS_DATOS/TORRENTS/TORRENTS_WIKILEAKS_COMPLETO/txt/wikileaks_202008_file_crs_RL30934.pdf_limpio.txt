as employers and businesses ve sought to avoid the judicial system for resolving disputes it is believed that at least eight percent of american workers are now bound by arbitration agreements1 since the early 1990s an increasing number of credit card issuer s have added arb itration clauses to their customer agreements2 although arbitration is often pe rceived as faster and less costly alternative to litigation some consumer advocates contend that mandatory arbitration agreements are onesided measures that force employees and consumers to give up certain advantages including access

upon such gr ounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract6 by enacting section 2 congress sought to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contr acts where they belong7 prior to 1925 american courts viewed arbitration with judicial hostility8 it is believed that this hostility flowed from similar hostility displayed by english courts9 because english judges were paid fees based on the number of cas they decided arbitration infringed on their livelihood10 english courts were also unwilling generally to surrender their jurisdiction over various disputes11 as industrialization prompted an incr eased number of business disputes the hostility toward arbitration subsided12 in 1924 the court upheld new york law that compelled arbitration in di spute involving maritime contract13 the courts decision in red cross line v atlantic fruit company opened the door for congress to pass legislation that recognized the validity of arbitration agreements14 president coolidge signed the united states arbitration law commonly referred to as the federal arbitration act on februa ry 12 1925 the enactment of the new law declared national policy fa voring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration15 while congress primary motivation for drafting the faa reflected its interest in recognizing arbitration agreements as being just as valid as ot her contract provisions it also understood the potential benefits that would be provided by enactment of the faa it is practically appropr iate that the action shoul d be taken at this time when there is so much agitation against the costliness and delays

idlitigation these matters can be largely eliminated by agreements for arbitration if arbitration agreemen ts are made valid and enforceable16 while section 2 of the faa requires the enforcement of arbitration agreements in maritime transactions and contracts evidencing transaction involving commerce the precise scope of this latter group of cont racts has not been certain although congress provided definition for the term commerce in section 1 of the faa it did not identify the extent to which contract must evidence transaction involving commerce before the faa will apply17 prior to 1995 there was split among courts interpreting th is language some courts found that the faa applied only to those contracts where the parties contemplated an interstate commerce connection18 i n burke county public schools b oard of education v shaver partnership north carolina court stated that where performance of the contract necessarily involves so that the parties to the agreemen t must have contemplated substantial interstate ac tivity the contract eviden ces transaction involving commerce within the meaning of the federal arbitration act19 other courts held that the section 2 nguage reached to the limits of congress power under the commerce clause20 in snyder v smith the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit maintained that th courts should take into account congress broad power to regulate unde r the commerce clause when deciding which contracts involve commerce21 because congress may reach activities affectin g interstate commerce under its commerce clause author ity the seventh circuit reasoned that it was logical to conclude that any contract affecting interstate commerce falls within section 2 of the faa22 in 1995 the supreme court determined that

commerce reaches not only the actual physical interstate shipment of goods but also contract s relating to inte rstate commerce25 remarks in the congressional record indicated further that the faa affects contracts relating to interstate subjects and contracts in admiralty26 the court determined that the word involv should be read as the functional equivalent of the word affect27 because the phrase affecting commerce normally signals congress intent to exercise its commerce clause powers to the fullest extent the court reasoned that the use of the phrase invol ving commerce should be given similar reading after concluding that section 2s involving commerce language should be interpreted broadly the court further determined that the faa applies to all contracts that involve commerce and does not require the contemplation of an interstate commerce connection by the parties the court found that contemplation of the parties requirement was inconsistent with the faas basic purpose such requirement invited litigation about what was or was not contemplated by the parties any congressional recognition of an expedited dispute resolution system at the time the faa was drafted would be undermined by this additional litigation28 other issues beyond those involving th scope of the faa have also been addressed by the supreme c ourt for example in southland corporation v keating the court concluded that the faa preempts state law29 the court maintained that congress would not have wanted state and fe deral courts to reach different outcomes about the validity of arb itration in similar cases30 allowing state courts to enforce state statutes that invalidate arbitration agreements would frustrate congress intent to place arbitration agreements on the same footing

forum33 recent developments since 2000 the court has decided six cases involving the faa in green tree financial corp v randolph the court concluded that the failure to identify the costs of arbitration in an arbitration agreement does not invalidate such an agreement34 the respondent larketta randolph financed the purchase of mobile home through green tree financial green trees c ontract required that randolph purchase insurance to protect the vendor or lienholde r against the costs of repossession in the event of default the contract also stipul ated that all disputes whether arising under case law or statutory law would be resolved by binding arbitration randolph sued green tree for violations of the truth in lending act and the equal credit opportunity act she argued that green tree failed to disclose the insurance requirement as finance charge and impermissibly require d her to arbitrate her statutory claims randol ph contended that the arbitr ation agreements failure to disclose related costs and fees created risk that she would have to bear prohibitive arbitration costs if she pursued her claims in an arbitral forum35 this risk forced her to forgo any claims she had against green tree and left her unable to vindicate her statutory rights in arbitration36 the court determined that the prohibitiv costs identified by randolph were too speculative to justify the invalidation of th arbitration agreement the court stated that where party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the grounds that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive she bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs37 randolph failed to meet this burden the court further noted that the party seeking to avoid arbitration must also establish that congress intended to preclude arbitration of the stat utory claims at issue38 in circuit city stores v adams the court considered the faas exemption clause in section 139 adams sales counselor at ci rcuit city

circuit held that the arbitration agreement was in contract of employment within the exemption clause of section 1 and thus was not subject to the faa41 the supreme court concluded that if ll contracts of empl oyment were beyond the scope of the faas coverage the section 1 exemption for contracts of employment of seamen railroad employees or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce would be pointless42 the court maintained that the section 1 exemption clause should be given narrow construction the court interpreted the exemption to apply to cont racts involving seame n railroad employees and other types of re lated transportation employees reading of the phrase any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce to exclude all employment contracts would undermine th faas enumeration of the specific seamen and railroad employees categories43 the court stated there would be need for congress to use the phrases s eamen and railroad employees if those same classes of workers were subsumed within the meaning of the engaged in commerce residual clause44 during its 20012002 term the court decided eeoc v waffle house another case involving arbitration and th employment relationship in waffle house the court determined that an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee did not bar the equal employ ment opportunity commission eeoc from seeking victimspecific relief on behalf of the employee45 in completing his application for employment with waffle house eric baker agreed to binding arbitration for any dispute or claim arisin g out of his employment baker suffered seizure shortly after beginning work at waffle house and was subsequently discharged baker did not in itiate arbitration proceedings but did file charge of discrimination with the eeoc baker alleged that his discharge violated the ada the fourth circuit concluded that the eeoc was authorized to bring suit but could seek only injunctive relief the court maintained that the federal policy favoring arbitration outweighs the eeocs authority to bring suit when it seeks victimspecific relief when an employee has signed mandatory arbitrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30934crs7 46 waffle house 534 us at 285 47 waffle house 534 us at 297 see 42 usc 12117 the eeoc shall exercise the same enforcement powers remedies and

policies of the ada and the faa47 title vii does however authorize the eeoc to bring suit to pursue reinstatement backpay and compensatory or punitive damages48 recognizing that the eeoc was not party to the contract between waffle house and ba ker the court concluded that the eeoc has the authority to pursue victimspecific relief regardless of the forum that the employer and employee have chos to resolve their disputes49 during its 20022003 term the court deci ded three cases involving the faa in howsam v dean witter reynolds the court concluded that an arbitrator not court should interpret and pply an arbitration rule of the national association of securities dealers nasd50 the nasd rule required an arbitration claim to be brought within six years of the occurrence or event that gave rise to the dispute51 dean witter asked federal district court to declare that howsams claim could notbe arbitrated because it was more than six years old the court maintained that procedural questions that arise from dispute and that bear on its final disposition are to be d ecided by an arbitrator in the absence of an agreement to the contrary questi ons about time limits notice and other conditions precedent to arbitration are for an arbitrator to decide 52 the court observed the nasd arbitrators would be comparatively more knowledgeable about the meaning of their own rule and would be better able to interpret and apply it53 in citizens bank v alafabco the court considered wh ether debtrestructuring agreement is contract evidencing tr ansaction involving commerce within the meaning of the faa54 alafabco fabrication and construction company executed two debtrestructuring agreements with citizens bank that required the parties to arbitrate all of their disputes claims or

was showing that any portion of the restructured debt was actually attributable to interstate transactions that the funds comprising that debt originated outofstate or that the restructured debt was inseparable from any outofstate projects the court found an insufficient nexus with interstate commerce to establish faa coverage of the parties dispute 56 123 sct 2402 2003 57 bazzle 123 sct at 2405 58 bazzle 123 sct at 2407bank moved to compel arbitration in accordance with the agreements the alabama supreme court concluded that alafabcos claims did not have to be arbitrated because there was an insufficient nexus with interstate commerce to require arbitration pursuant to the faa55 the us supreme court reversed the decision of the alabama supreme court following its decision in alliedbruce the court maintained that the term involving commerce in the faa should be interprete d broadly to apply to wide range of transactions within the flow of intersta commerce the court articulated three reasons for finding the debtrestructuring agreements to involve commerce for purposes of the faa first alafabco engaged in business throughout the southeastern us using substantial ans from citizens bank these loans were renegotiated and redoc umented in the debtrestructur ing agreements second the restructured debt was secure d by alafabcos assets including its inventory of goods assembled from outofstate parts and raw materials finally the court noted that commercial lending has broad impact on the national econom and interstate commerce finally in green tree financial corp v bazzle the court considered whether the arbitration clauses in lending contracts executed by green tree authorized the use of class arbitration56 although the contracts provided for the arbitration of all disputes claims or controve rsies arising from or relating to the contracts they were silent as to whether arbitration could proceed in the form of class arbitration57 the south carolina supreme court found that when there is such silence south carolina law interprets the contracts as permitting cl ass arbitration the us supreme court reviewed the case to determine whether th at holding was consistent with the faa the court declined to automatically accept the south carolina supreme courts decision the court maintained that an arb itrator rather than court should resolve the question of whether the cont racts forbid class arbitration58 the court characterized the question of class arbitration as dispute relating to the contract and requiring contract interpretation by an arb itrator because the parties agreed to have an arbitrator resolve such dispute judge should not decide the issue legislative action during the 108th congress two bills have been introduced to amend the faa s
