pamela w smith analyst in biomedical policy domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33695the national institutes of health nih organization funding and congressional issues summary the national institutes of health is the focal point for federal health research an agency of the department of health and human services hhs it uses its 292 billion budget to support more than 300000 scientists and research personnel working at over 3100 institutions across the us and abroad as well as to conduct biomedical and behavioral research and research training at its own facilities the agency consists of the office of the direct or in charge of ove rall policy and program coordination and 27 institute s and centers each of wh ich focuses on particular diseases or research areas in human health range of basic and clinical research is funded through highly competitive system of peerreviewed grants and contracts fy2003 was the final year of fiveyear undertaking by congress to double the nih budget from its fy1998 base of 137 billion to the fy2003 level of 271 billion si nce then the growth rate has fallen to below the rate of inflation in fy2008 nih funding was increased by 05 above fy2007 the president requested an essentially flat budget of 292 billion for nih for fy2009 while the advocates in the research community r ecommended 65 increase the projected increase in the inflation index is 35 for both fy2008 and fy2009 in inflation adjusted terms the fy2008 funding level represents an estimated 11 decrease from fy2003 while the fy2009 request level w ould be 14 below fy2003 the request planned to support about th same number of grants as the fy2008 estimate the success rate for competing grant applica tions getting funded would be an estimated 18 compared with 25 in fy2004 nd 3032 during the doubling years appropriators and authorizers face many issues in working with nih to set research priorities in the face of tight budg ets congress accepts for the most part the priorities established through the agencys complex process of weighing scientific opportunity and public health needs while the public health service act phsa provides the statutory basis for nih progra ms it is primarily through appropriations report language not budget line items or ear marks that congress gives direction to nih and allows voice for advocacy groups challenges facing the agency and the research enterprise all aggravated by restrained budgets include attracting and keeping young scientists in research career s improving the translation of research results into useful medical interventions through more efficient clinical research creating opportun ities for transdisciplinary research that cuts across institute boundaries to exploit the newest scientific discoveries and ma naging the portfolio of extramural and intramural research with strategic planni ng openness and public accountability in december 2006 congress passed the nih reform act pl 109 482 addressing many of these issues through changes to nih authorities implementation of the laws provisions is under way on number of fronts congress also monitors ethics rules on conflicts of interest

agencies background and funding by pamela w smith et althe national institutes of health nih organization funding and congressional issues overview of the national institutes of health introduction the national institutes of health is the primary agency of the federal government charged with the conduct nd support of biomedical and behavioral research it also has major roles in research training and health information dissemination in both budget and personnel it is the largest of the eight health related agencies that make up the public health service phs within the department of health and human services hhs1 for fy2008 it has total budget of 292 billion and total employment of more than 18000 people the presidents fy2009 budget requested level funding congress maintains high level of inte rest in nih for variety of reasons the nih budget is by far the larg est and most visible component of federal civilian research and development spending it garners great interest during delibera tions on the annual appr opriations bill for the departments of labor health nd human services and education and related agencies nih funds extramural researchers in every state and widespread constituenci contact congress about funding for particular diseases and levels of research support in general nih has increasingly come to the attention of congress and the american people in the last decade thanks to greater awareness of science advances for example the human genome project and its potential for guiding more personalized medicine and public policy debates for instance the use and regulation of human embryonic stem cells special interest rrounded the fiveyear doubling of the agencys budget between fy1999 and fy2003 since then during five years of low or growth congress has increasingly scrutinizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33695crs2 how nih has used its expanded resources how it can most efficiently adapt to budgetary constraints and how its 27 semi autonomous institutes and centers can best coordinate their efforts in order to identify and respond n imbly to important public health challenges at the end of the 109th congress the house and senate agreed on the first nih reauthorization stat ute enacted since 1993 the nih reform act of 2006 pl 109482 for more than dozen years most policy changes had come in th appropriations arena or through agency initiatives under its broad research authority work by the authorizing committees the house committee on energy and commerce and senate committee on health education labor and pensions had led to passage of number of laws focusing on individual diseases or othe r nihrelated topics but comprehensive consideration of the agencys structure and policies had been undertaken in the fall of 2006 after many hearings and solicitation of comments and reactions from the disparate stakeholders of the medical re search community congress passed hr 6164 which the president signed on january 15 2007 the act focused on enhancing the authority and tools for the nih director to do strategic planning especially to facilitate and f und crossinstitute research initiatives other issues of concern to congress and the research community include clinical research and more broadl translational research meaning the movement of discoveries of ba sic science into new preventives diagnostics therapies and cures initiatives are under way to make the process quicker and more efficient and to encourage more medically trained young scientists to work in clinical research helping young investigators both ba sic and clinical obtain their first independent research grants more quickly congressional andor administrative restrictions on types of research funded particularly human em bryonic stem cell research conflictofinterest regulations for nih scientists and other employees concerning their financ ial holdings and their freedom to consult with industry and outside colleagues including questions of impact on recruitment and retention and development of policies for free public access to journal articlesstemming from nihs upported research nd weighing that access against the interests of publishers including scientific societies voluntary policy for submission of articles had little participation so congress made it mandatory this report provides background and analysis on the

decades spurred by constituents who have voiced their expectation that the federal government would take the lead in cuttingedge research on prevention and treatment of disease since the mid1990s the doubling of the nih budget and big projects like the sequencing of the human genome have fired the public s imagination generating much hope and anticipation of further advances more recently however budgetary realities and various issues facing the research enterprise are challenging nih and congress to rethink some approaches to nihs traditi onal mission congress is confronting those challenges in the three spheres of appr opriations authoriza tions and oversight appropriations budgeting within constraints background on agency budget formulation the nih budget request that congress receives from the president each february for the next fiscal year reflects both recent history and professiona l judgments about the future because it needs to support both ongoing research commitments and new initiatives the request is formulated through lengthy process that starts more than year before in the institutes and centers the budget then evolves over number of months as it progresses from the ics to nih then to hhs and finally to the office of management and budget omb at each stage ic and nih needs are weighed in the context of the larger budget of which they are part eventually congress is called upon to make similar judgments as continuing process ic leaders with input from the scientific community define the most important and promising areas in their respective fields they consider whether the research portfolio they are already supporting needs any rebalancing and they decide on possible new initiatives for the coming budget year an annual budget retreat in may brings together the ic leaders with top nih management to discuss polic ies and priorities under various budget scenarios they might consider for example what the di fferent emphases in their programs would be if the appropriation turned out to be certain percent decrease flat budget orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33695crs19 an increase the presentations and disc ussions allow nih mana gement to develop the budget request they will submit to hhs taking into account the estimate of the amount of funding needed to support the commitment base of continuing awards the funding desired for unsolicited new re search proposals the new initiatives that the director wants to incorporate an d guidance from the department about the request for example there might be an in struction to pay inflationary increases on grants at the hhs level nihs request is considered in the context of the overall department budget re sulting in notice back to nih on the departments allowance there are usually appeals and adjustments made before the final hhs budget goes to omb the process of s ubmission passback and appeals is repeated as omb considers the entire federal budget and tells hhs what amounts and policy approaches are approved for incorporation in to the presidents final budget that will be sent to congress once the budget is made public in early february all agency comments about the request are expected to support the presidents proposed levels setting research priorities some people feel that the main role of the congress in regard to nih should be to pr ovide money with as few strings attached as possible they favor trusting the creativity of investigatorinitiated research and the nih prioritysetting process to the exte nt that good science is driving research priorities with funding ta rgeted toward the maximum exploitation of scientific opportunity as defined by the peer review system they object to influences that skew research priorities in directions they would judge not scientifically sound in support of that general philo sophy appropriators have tr aditionally tried to minimize congressional microma nagement of nihs budget nd have avoided specifying dollar amounts for particular fields of res earch or mechanisms of funding below the level of the institute and center accounts at the same time it is recognized that both congress and nih do weigh numerous other factors when they make prioritysetting decisions nih has made information about setting res earch priorities and other as pects of research planning available on its website at httpwww nihgovaboutresearchplanninghtm of paramount importance are judg ments about public health needs which may reflect for example information on the health ndor economic burdens posed by particular diseases the populations affected and the degree of threat to the general public another factor may be the potential applicability of research on one medical condition to broader related fields advocacy groups i n c n g r s s t h n n u l appropriations process has always been magnet for t hose seeking to bolster fundi ng for biomed ical research generally or to influence research prior ities in favor of some disease or field of science every congressional district includes multiple parties with an interest in nih patient advocacy organizations so metimes termed disease lobby groups are active in sending information to their members by mail and over the internet advocacy groups have become more organi zed and more demanding of role in setting research priorities they educate their contacts and the interested public about the latest developments in research and new therapies in their disease area they frequently track federal and st ate legislation pertaining to

scientists can customize with facts from their own institutions17 scarce resources congresss flexibility in helping nih respond to scientific pportun ity and public health needs has been severely reduced since fy2004 the prior five years when congress provided for the doubling of the nih budget coincided with time of economic expansion and federal budget surpluses more recent years on the other hand have b een characterized by return to federal deficits and new commitments to spending on defense and homeland security the result has been tightening of funds ava ilable for domestic disc retionary programs caps on spending in recent congressional budget resoluti ons have left the labor hhsed appropriations subcommittees with difficult choices when allocating funds for range of social and public health programs nihs budget shifted from annual increases of around 6 to 7 before fy1999 to twice that around 14 to 15 during the doubling to between 0 and 3 since fy2003 levels below the rate of inflation as indicated in figure 2 above if the amount proposed in the presidents fy2009 request were to be accepted by c ongress nih would have about 14 less purchasing power than in fy2003 the extra resources provided during th doubling period allowed the number of new grants to be increased though not doubled the average dollar size of grants to go up to cover the needs of more sophis ticated research pr ojects and research institutions especially universities to expand their research faculties and create more laboratory space such increases tend to driv the need for yet more resources in the future it seems not to have been antic ipated in some quarters that the nih budget increases might change so dramatically after the doubling the research community had hoped for softer landing after the doub ling with increases of perhaps 8 to 10 per year to maintain the momentum of their work in more recent years the advocates have urged congress to again provide increases in the neighborhood of 65 nih appropriations that have consistently grown less than the rate of inflation have strained certain areas of the biomedical research enterprise particularly investigatorinitiated research success rates key marker for the research community of the adequacy of nih grant funding is the success rate of research project grant applications

of about 18 compared with 25 in fy2004 during the doubling years the success rate averaged 30 to 3218 changes in the success rate can be driven by changes in either the numerator number of applications funded or the denominator number of applications reviewed the rate has dr opped in some years even when the number of competing awards increased because the number of applications soared even more the increase in the number of applications received in the two years following the doubling fy2004 and fy2005 exceeded the increase of the previous four years at time when the number of competing awards was dropping19 in other words more and more applicants were chasing fe wer and fewer awards pattern which has continued the increase in applicati ons stems from both the expanded research capacity at many academic medical centers and the increase in the number of applications submitted per applicant as researchers try more than one route to obtain funding young investigators nih is concerned that prospects for lower number of grants and lower success rate will further discourage young scientists from pursuing careers in medical research new investigators with creative ideas are the lifeblood of the research enterprise but the path to becoming an independent researcher is long and challenging ma ny young doctoral stude nts and postdoctoral scientists already observe that their more senior colleagues have had increasing trouble in getting funded especially if they are physicians with the option of going into clinical practice they may wonder bout the wisdom of devoting themselves to years of research training that may not lead to successful competition for independent grant support some may decide on othe r career paths and some may choose to pursue research opportunities overseas in january 2006 nih announced new pathway to independence program to increase pport of oung investigators in order to address the everlengthening time that it has been

supporters of such amendments to the lhhsed appropr iations bills say that nih should not be devoting scarce resources to research studies whose value they question researchers however including nih leadership have expressed alarm at what they view as an assault on the peer review syst em saying that such studies were funded because of their technical merit and the im portant research questions they addressed new approaches while advocates warn that tight budgets will slow research advances on the major chronic conditions that burden american society other commentators note that coping with the reality of budget constraints has increasingly required nih and the research community to rethink some of their traditional approaches to pla nning and organizing research as nih director dr elias zerhouni has advised s science grows more comple x it is also converging on set of unifying principles that link apparently disparate diseases through common biological pathways and therapeu tic approaches today nih research needs to reflect this new reality22 scientific leaders in and out of nih urge critical examination of the best ways to transfor m knowledge into medical applications and

modern biomed ical science represents th convergence of biological physical and information sciences and h wants to encourage investigators to break out of their traditional disciplines and take on new approaches for example two programs are meant to stimulate hi ghly innovative researchers the nih directors pioneer award httpnihro admapnihgovpioneer seeks to support investigators who will take

methods of conducting clinical studies however are slow complex costly and tend to be limited in the number of patients they can i nvolve to more quickly develop test and deliv er new interventions resear chers could work in closer proximity to patients the revamped clinical research enterprise will need integrated networks of academic centers linked to co mmunitybased health care providers and
