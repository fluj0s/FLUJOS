costbenefit analysis has long been used to try and measure the effects of individual regulatory actions and underlies at least part of many attempts to assess the cumulative effects of regulations on society some policy makers have expressed an interest in costbenefit analysis and in developing an accurate measure of total regulatory costs as first step in devel oping regulatory budgetthat would set cap on compliance costs although measuring total regulatory co sts and benefits is inherently difficult egdetermining what ffects would have occurred in the absence of the regulation and aggregating the results of studies with different methodologies and quality estimates of regulatory costs have been used in support of legislation eg hr 2432 in the 108th congress and are widely cited by policymakers the media and others this report examines one such study to illustrate the complexities of this type of analysis in 2001 w mark crain and thomas d hopkins estimated total regulatory costs at 843 billion in 2000 to arrive at that figure the authors developed estimates for different types of regulations environmental workplace economic and tax compliance using various sources and sometimes making assumptions to adjust the results from previous studies for example to estimate the cost of environmental rules the authors used only the upper end of previous estimate range 96 billion to 170 billion that had been produced by the office of management and budget omb and then they adjust ed it further upward also the authors estimate of the cost of economic rules 435 billion is heavily dependent on the accuracy of estimates from previous study the crain and hopkins study as well as other studies also indicated that federal regula tions cost small businesses more per employee than larger businesses since 1997 omb has been required to issu an annual report containing to the extent feasible an estimate of the aggregate costs and benefits of federal regulations ombs estimate of regulatory costs for 2000 146 billion to 229 billi on was significantly smaller than the crai n and h opkins timate 843 billion b ecause omb considered it inappropriate to include certain types of costs that the authors used transfers and tax compliance more recently omb has concluded that aggregate estimates of regulatory costs and benefits are not feasible and instead has provided 10year rolling summary of costs and benefits only for certain major rules ombs draft report for 2004 indicated that the estimated costs of 85 major rules that the office reviewed from october 1993 th rough september 2003 ranged from 34 billion to 39 billion with benefits estima ted at between 62 billion and 168 billion although accurate measures of the costs nd benefits of all federal rules would be useful decisionmakers using studies of aggregate regulatory costs and benefits to guide public policy need to be aware of those studies conceptu and methodological underpinnings this report will be

though the costs th at nonfederal entities pay to comply with federal regulations are not accounted for in the federal budget process costbenefit analysis has long been used to try to acc ount for the effects of individual regulatory actions and underlies at least part of most attempts to assess the cumulative effects of regulations on society policy makers have long expr essed an interest in cost benefit analysis and in developing an accurate measure of total regulatory costs some have suggested that the federal gove rnment use that information to adopt regulatory budget that could limit the to tal volume of regulatory programs expenditures and compliance costs by setting cap on the compliance costs each agency could impose on the economy howe ver measuring total regulatory costs and benefits is inherently difficult for example researchers must determine the baseline for measurement ie what effect s would have occurred in the absence of the regulation and aggregating the results of studies with different methodologies and quality can be highly problematic some observers including the office of management and budget mb currently doubt whether an accurate measure of total regulatory costs and benefits is possible nevertheless estimate s of total regulatory costs in the hundreds of billions of dollars are widely cited by policymakers business interest groups the media and others this report provides informa tion on how one widely cited study was developed to illustrate the complexities associated with this type of analysis the report also provides information on how ombs estimates of aggregate federal regulatory costs were developed and have varied over time and on estimates that have been made of aggregate regulatory costs to businesses finally the report indicates that estimates of aggregate regulatory costs need to be interpreted and used carefully first however the report pr ovides some background regarding the types of rules that federal agencies issue and current costbenefit analysis requirements background each year about 60 federal agencies issue more than 4000 final rules or regulations on topics ranging from the timing of bridge openings to the permissible levels of arsenic and other contaminants in drinking wa ter the federal government has long regulated economic activity often through independent regulatory agencies or commissions although economic regulation is often dated to the creation of the interstate commerce commission in the 1800s it began in earnest during the 1930s with the creation of such agencies as the securities and exchange commission sec the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the federal communications commission fcc social regulation in such areas ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs2 environmental quality workpl ace safety and consumer protection grew rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s with the creation of such agencies as the environmental protection agency epa the occupational safety and health administration osha and the consumer produc t safety commission cpsc in addition to these regulatory agenci most cabinet departments and other agencies issue regulations that affect the public in variety of ways for example the department of agricultu re regulates the price pr oduction import and export of agricultural crops the safety of meat pou ltry and certain ot her food products and broadreaching welfare programs agencies within the department of transportation set safety standards for highways and heavy trucks federal highway administration automobiles and light trucks national highway traffic safety administration or nhtsa and railroads federal railroad administration taken together federal regulations now affect virtually every person business and government in the united states types of rules the types of regulations that federal agencies issue have been categorized into the following groups economic regulations that directly restrict businesses pricing and output decisions as well as limit the entry or exit of businesses into or out of certain types of industries these regulations often affect the agriculture trucking banking or communications industries among others and as mentione d previously have often been administered by independent regulatory agencies such as the sec or the fcc environmental regulations that focus on protecting or improving the quality of the environment and include those issued by epa as well as the departments of transpor tation energy and the interior other social regulations that are designed to advance the health and safety of consumers and workers pr omote social goals such as equal opportunity provide equal access to facilities and protect the public from fraud and deception examples include regulations issued by osha nhtsa and the food and drug administration process regulations that involve paperwork such as income tax forms applications for procurement contracts and immigration papers the internal revenue service currently accounts for about 80 of the governmentwide paperwork estimate and transfer regulations that move payments from one group in society to another such as federal social security payments from taxpayers to recipients and agricultural price supports from taxpayers to farmershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs3 1 see for example lisa heinzerling and frank ackerman pricing the priceless cost benefit analysis of environmental protection washington george town university 2002 2 the most widely applicable costbenefit an alysis requirements currently in place are in executive order 12866 regulatory planning and review 58 federal register 51735 oct 4 1993 3 whitman v american trucking associations us 991257 feb 27 2001each of these types of regulations may have direct or indirect costs and benefits for example direct costs of environmenta l or other social regulations include the capital equipment and labor needed to meet the environmental or health and safety standard indirect costs can include st productivity or competitive disadvantages caused by the need to pay for the direct compliance costs most cost and benefit estimates for noneconomic rules do not include indirect effects because they are extremely difficult to measur and therefore may understate the total effects of the rules estimates for economic rules are primarily indirect in general the benefits of regulation are harder to measure than regulatory costs particularly in dollar terms for example the benefits of nvironmental protection are often presented in terms of improve d health quality of life preservation of ecosystems and other outcomes of environmental quality that are not traded in the marketplace as result the value of th benefits is ofte n estimated by economists through indirect willingness to pay models and statistical techniques these estimation methods have been strongly cr iticized by some who consider placing value on human life or health inappropriate particularly when regulatory benefits occur in the future and are di scounted in present value terms1 costbenefit analysis some form of costbenefit analysis underlie s at least some part of most attempts to assess the cumulative effects of regulations on society conceptually costbenefit analysis is rigorous procedure that invol ves systematically weighing the costs and benefits of various alternatives to pr oposed action the analysis is supposed to account for all of the effects of regulatory action including eff ects that are difficult to quantify or monetize although most ec onomists view costbenefit analysis as useful tool in making decisions about pa rticular rule others consider the technique inherently flawed because among other things they believe that the difficulty associated with measuring regulatory benefits often causes those benefits to be understated since 1981 cabinet departments and inde pendent agencies such as epa have been required to prepare costbenefit analyses before issuing major or economically significant rules eg rules with 100 million impact on the economy2 independent regulatory agencies such as the sec and the fcc are generally not required to conduct those anal yses and agency is required to do so for rules that are not major or economically significant also as the supreme court affirmed in 2001 some statutes prohibit the consideration of costs when setting certain health standards3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs4 4 hopkins is the dean of the college of business at the rochester institute of

committee on governmental affairs united states senate feb 8 1995 p 1 8 thomas d hopkins regulatory costs in profile policy study number 132 center for the study of american business aug 1996the costbenefit studies that agencies conduct are almost always done before the rules are promulgated these ex studies are often heavily dependent on assumptions particularly regarding longterm or uncertain effects where subtle interactions between various factors ar often not well unde rstood or directly measurable very few ex post studies ar done after rules are promulgated to try and determine whether the prev ious estimates were accurate hopkins estimates of aggregate regulatory costs as discussed in greater detail later in this report for the past several years congress has required omb to prepare report each year on the aggregate costs and benefits of federal ru others outside of govern ment have also published studies during the past 15 years attempting to measur total regulatory costs some of the most commonly cited of those studies have been published by thomas d hopkins4 and he has consistently concluded that the annual cost of federal regulations is in the hundreds of b illions of dollars for example in 1991 hopkins concluded that federal regulation may be cos ting american taxpayers 400500 bi llion dollars annually in 1988 dollars over nd above those costs of government that show up in the budget this works out to an average of roughly 40005000 per household5 hopkins also concluded in this study that total regulatory costs had declined from 1977 to 1988 but had risen steadily thereafter he also asserted th at costs associated with environmental and proce ss rules were rising more quickly than other types of regulatory costs hopkins has updated his estima tes of total regulatory costs several times over the years with the results consistently indicating that those costs were growing rapidly for example in 1993 he estimate d that total regulatory costs in 1991 were 542 billion6 in 1995 hopkins concluded that some 600 billion annually is spent by those regulated to comply with all fede ral regulation7 in 1996 hopkins said that total regulatory costs stood at 668 billion i n 1995 dollars and predicted that those costs would rise to more than 720 billion by the year 20008 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs5 9 w mark crain and

regu latory reform legislation eg hr 2432 the paperwork and regulatory improvements act of 2003 and has been widely quoted by policy makers the small business administration business interest groups such as the chamber of commerce academicians the media and others10 in some cases the study is cited with high degree of certainty for example some articles simply state that regulations cost the economy 843 billion11 less widely discussed however is how crain and hopkins devel oped that 843 billion estimate how the 843 billion estimate was developed in their study crain and hopkins pres ented estimates of bot h total regulatory costs 843 billion and for four types of federal regulations that comprised that total environmental rules 197 billion economic rules 435 billion workplace rules 82 billion and tax compliance rules 129 billion the authors used variety of sources of information to develop estimates for these types of rules sometimes using multiple sources and making multiple assumptions for single estimate crain and h opkins estimation methods for each type of regulation are summarized below environmental regulations to develop their estimate of environmental costs the authors used the upper end of cost estimate range that omb had reportedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs6 12 office of management and budget office of information and regulatory affairs report to

through april 1999 96 billion to 170 billion12 and adjusted it further upward to account fo r rules issued in 1999 and 2000 the omb estimate of environmental costs was in itially based on 1991 study by robert w hahn and john hird of regulatory costs in 1988 which was itself based on compilation of previous studi and original research13 in its 2000 report omb said it used the information in the hahn and hird study after making some adjustments and supplementing it with cost information from rules issued after 1988 even though it recognized that there were gaps and weaknesses in underlying studies that the authors relied on for their estimates crain and hopkins said their decisi on to use only the upperend of the omb estimate of environmental co sts 170 billion instead of for example the midpoint of the 96 billion to 170 billion range refl ected judgment on our part that cost estimates are absent for important environmental regulations and that government agencies tend to be conservative in estimating regulatory costs14 the authors decision to adjust this upperend estimate further upward to account for more recent rules stands in contrast to the approach that omb took in its 2001 report omb said that it did not adjust its estimate for more recent rules because among other things inclusion of some of those rules w ould have constituted double counting when combined with estimates from prior years15 economic regulations to estimate costs associated with economic regulations crain and hopkins combined da ta from various sources and made certain assumptions for example the authors based their estimate of the cost of domestic commerce regulations on study by the organization for economic cooperation and development that had estimated that refo rms in the transportation energy and telecommunications sectors would increase the us gross domestic product gdp by 116 because the gdp in 2000 was 101 trillion crain and hopkins multiplied that number by 001 and therefore estimated an efficiency cost of domestic commerce regulation at 101 billion because previous study suggested that transfer costs of rules could be at least twice as large as efficiency costs the authors doubled the efficiency cost estimate and therefor estimated domes tic transfer costs at 202 billion combining these two sets of timates they concluded that the total economic cost associated with domes tic commerce regulations was 303 billion 101 billion plus 202 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs7 17 oecd p 36 18 j scott moody the cost of complying with the us federal

2000 p 4crain and hopkins used similar appr oach to estimate the economic costs associated with international trade regulations citing previous studies indicating that removal of us trade barriers w ould reduce costs by 13 of the gdp the authors estimated that the economic cost of those trade ba rriers in 2000 wa s 132 billion 13 of 101 trillion combining the domestic and inte rnational estimates crain and hopkins therefore estimated that the total cost of ec onomic regulations in 2000 was 435 billion 303 billion plus 132 billion the authors estimates of economic cost s are heavily dependent on the accuracy of the previous studies estimates for example if the oecd study had concluded that reforms in the transportation ener gy and telecommunications sectors would increase the gdp by onehalf of 1 inst ead of 1 crain and hopkins estimate of the cost of domestic commerce regulations would have been 50 lower about 152 billion instead of 303 billion because crain and hopkins estimates of economic costs represent more than half of their estimate of all regulatory costs these changes would have had dramatic effect on their aggregate estimate it is also notable that the 1999 oecd st udy that crain and hopkins cite as the source of their estimate of the efficiency cost of domestic commerce regulation does not itself provide an estimate of economic co sts in this manner instead it cites 1998 omb study that concluded that reg ulations on entry and prices still cost consumers and producer s 70 billion annually17 tax compliance regulations to estimate tax compliance costs crain and hopkins relied on november 2000 report by the tax foundation which the authors said had used data from the internal re venue service irs on the number of hours of compliance time associated with tax paperwork18 the number of compliance hours was multiplied by various hourly wage rates reflecting either the value of the preparers time or the rate for tax professional to derive the estimated cost of tax compliance the tax foundation study c oncluded that tax pa perwork required 43 billion hours in 1999 and multiplied that by an average wage rate of about 29 per hour yielding tax compliance estimate of about 125 billion crain and hopkins adjusted that figure upward to 129 billion for 2000 to develop its estimate of 43 billion hours the tax foundation added together the irs estimates of compliance hours for number of tax forms in 1999 however in april 2000 irs estimated the tax comp liance burden as of september 30 1999 at nearly 59 billion hours more than 35 higher19 it is unclear why the tax foundation and crain and hopkins used the 43 billionhour estimate based on certain forms instead of the 59 billionhour estimate for all forms also omb hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs8 20 cited in the crain and hopkins report as joseph johnson the cost of workplace regulations arlington va mercatus center april 2001 johnson later published

louis center for the study of american business oct 1996 previously used wage rate of about 2650 per hour to estima tax compliance costs somewhat less than the 29 average cost that the tax foundation used had crain and hopkins used the irs estimate of its compliance hours about 59 billion hours and the omb wage rate 2650 the authors estimate of tax compliance costs would have been about 155 billion instead of 129 billion workplace regulations to estimate the costs of workplace regulations crain and hopkins relied on 2001 study by joseph johnson covering 25 statutes and executive orders governing such issues as labor standards employee benefits occupational safety and health and civil rights20 this study summarized the available research on each of the statutes and executive orders selecting the studies that the author considered to be the mo st accurate for exam ple johnson noted that the department of labor and the general accounting office estimated the nnual cost to employers of the family and dical leave act at 825 million but that the chamber of commerce estimated the cost at between 39 billion and 24 billion the author used the 39 billion estimate noting that the 24 billion estimate assumed an unrealistically high rate of leav taking by employees and that it diverged significantly from the government estimates however johnson did not explain why the government estimate nearly five times lower than the estimate he used was inappropriate johnson reported that occupati onal safety and health re gulations represented the largest single element of workplace costs and said the occupational safety and health act was by far the largest component within this category johnson said that based on oshas regulatory analyses 31 major rules associated with the act imposed total of 74 b illion in annual costs b ecause another author21 had estimated that total costs including fines for violations and costs for nonmajor rules were actually at least 555 times these direct costs however johnson used 41 billion as his best estimate of costs asso ciated with the act 74 billion times 555 use of this multiplier had dramatic effect on not only the estimated cost of regulations associated with occupational safety and health act regulations but also the estimate for all workplace regulations it is also unclear why fines for violations of osha rules should be considered compliance costs hopkins cautionary notes although some have treated hopkins estima tes of regulatory cost as matters of certainty the author himself has frequently cautioned readers that his estimates of regulatory costs are just that estimates and noted the sometimes limited nature of the data available for example in his 1991 report hopkins said that other than some general observations bout the overall trends in re gulatory activity the reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs9 22 these critics including omb argue that because transfer regulations move payments from one group in society to another one group s cost represents another groups gain as result the net cost to society as whole is zero 23 thomas d hopkins cost of regulation re port prepared for the regulatory information service center washi ngton aug 1991 p 7begins to resemble patchwork quilt with some important patches missing and others in rather threadbare condition for the available sources of cost information are spotty in their coverage diverse in their objectives and inconsistent in host of ways including definitions methodology and data adequacy existing studies do not utilize the same cost concepts and they do not for that matter share common view of what is to be considered regulation more recently in their 2001 report crain and hopkins noted that some experts do not consider transfer costs to be regulatory costs22 and therefore presented estimates later in their repor t showing regulatory costs without transfers their estimate of the cost of economic regulation dropped from 435 billion to 145 billion and the cost of workplace regula tions dropped from 82 billion to 24 billion their estimate of overall regulatory co sts went from 843 billion to 495 billion more than 40 lower however the co st figures from the crain and hopkins study that are quoted by others and the only fi gures reported in the authors executive summary are the costs including transfers also although none of hopkins studies of regulatory costs contained information on the benefits that regulations provide he has cons istently recognized that many regulations provide substantial benefits to society for example in his 1991 study hopkins said these benefits must be assessed before balanced picture of regulation can be produced and went on to say that if commensurate benefits are being provided rising regulatory costs we re not necessarily troublesome and may indeed be laudable23 in their 2001 report crain nd hopkins said developing data on regulatory benefits would be logical next step toward building more rational regulatory system omb reports on regulatory costs and benefits as noted previously for the past seve ral years congress has required omb to submit annual reports on the cost s and benefits of federal regulations the first such requirement was in section 645 of the treasury postal service and general government appropriations act 1997 public law 104 208 which required the director of omb to submit report by september 30 1997 that provided among other things estimates of th total annual costs and bene fits of federal regulatory programs including quantita tive and nonquantitative measures of regulatory costs and benefits similar requirements were contained in other appropriations bills in subsequent years more recently

tribal gove rnments small businesses wages and economic growth ombs estimates of total regulatory costs and benefits for the first several years omb provided estimates of total regulatory costs and benefits and those estimates particularly the benefits estimates varied substantially from year to year in its 1997 report omb estimated to tal federal regulatory costs in 1997 at 279 billion and estimated the benefits of federal regulations at 298 billion in its 1998 report omb estimated federal regulatory costs at between 170 billion and 230 billion in 1996 dollars as of 1998 and estimated regulato ry benefits at between 260 billion and 35 trillion24 the dramatic increase in the benefits estimate by factor of 12 was almost entirely due to the inclusion of an epa estimate of the benefits associated with the clean air act25 many observers had serious questions regarding the use of this epa estimate and epa itself said it had only small probability of being correct in its 2000 and 2001 re ports omb estimated the cost of all social regulations at between 146 b illion and 229 billion in 1996 dollars as of 1999 and estimated benef its at between 254 billion and nearly 18 trillion26 the nearly 50 drop in the upperbound benefits estimate fro m 35 trillion to 18 tr illion was primarily caused by significant drop in the previouslymentioned epa estimate of the benef its of the clean air act from 32 trillion to 145 trillion which omb said was epas more accurate expected value estimate each year omb presented its aggregate cost and benefit estimates with strong caveats for example in

professional consensu s on methods that would pe rmit complete consistent accounting of total costs and be nefits of fede ral regulation28 s m f t h methodological problems that omb poi nted out included the following the baseline for measurement is often not clear ie what costs and benefits would have occurred in the absence of the regulation it is difficult to attribute costs or benefits to federal regulations as opposed to state or local rules voluntary standards organizations insurance requirements or the tort system technological change can make pr evious estimates of benefits and costs extremely inaccurate regulatory requirements sometimes become standard business practice eg requirements to rem ove lead from gasoline or to put air bags in automobiles so co st or benefit re ductions would be unlikely to occur if the rules were eliminated entirely aggregating the results of different studies is highly problematic as the studies vary in the quality thodology and types of regulatory impacts they include it is unclear which rules should be included in any tabulation of regulatory costs and benefits eg transfer regulations such as crop subsidy payments in developing its estimates omb did not include transfer rules which omb said were about 140 billion in costs and benefits in 1997 because it considered them to be payments that reflect redistribution of wealth rather

timates were usually larger as noted previously the signif icant difference between the two studies aggregate estimates are primarily because crain and hopkins included certain costs that omb did not

agencies omb issued final version of those guidelines in february 2002 the act also required agencies to establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of

agency or omb specifically ombs report for 2002 presented information on the costs and benefits of all regulations meeting those criteria that it reviewed for sixandonehalf year period fro m april 1 1995 to september 30 200130 omb said the total cost of those rules was about 50 billion to 53 billion in 2001 dollars and the benefits ranged from 48 billion to 101 billion in its 2003 report omb provided timates of the co sts and benefits of 107 regulations meeting the above criteria that it reviewed during the 10year period from oct ober 1992 through september 200231 omb estimated that the total costs of these rules ranged from nearly 37 billion to nearly 43 billi on in 2001 dollars with benefits ranging from 146 billion to 230 billion omb noted that four rules issued by epa accounted fo r substantial fraction of the aggregate benefits for all 107 rules in its 2002 report omb said its decision to present data for only certain rules during limited timeframe was dr iven by the inconsistent and increasingly aged nature of many of the studies used to develop aggregate estimates omb went on to say that we do not believe that the estimates of the costs and benefits of regulations issued over ten years ago are reliable or very useful for informing current policy decisions therefore omb said that in keeping with the spirit of ombs new informationquality guidelin we have decided not to reproduce the aggregate estimates that were contained in appendix c of the draft report32 the report went on to say that the total costs and benefits of all federal rules then in effect could easily be factor of ten or more larger in its 2003 report omb said that estimates prepared for rules adopted prior to the 10 year period are of questionable relevance

billion to 168 billion all in 2001 dollars as table 2 below illustrates epas rules accounted for more th an half of the bene fits and about two thirds of the costs of these rules w ith the bulk of epas costs and benefits attributable to what omb described as handful of epa cleana ir rules that reduce public exposure to fine particulate matter with the exception of the department of homeland security dhs all of the agencies largest cost estimates are always smaller than the smallest benefits estimate34 omb said the substantial drop in the benefits estimates from the previous re port from 230 billion to 168 billion at the upper end of the range was caused by one epa rule implementing the sulfur dioxide limits of the acid rain provisions in the 1990 amendments to the clean air act that fell out of the 10year wi ndow because it was issued in the 19921993 period table 2 estimates of total annual benefits and costs of 85 major federal rules reviewed by omb between oct 1 1993 and sept

the estimates it provided for the 10year peri od some have questioned why omb only includes rules in its estimates that it reviewed within the previous 10 years estimates of regulatory costs to businesses in addition to developing estimates of total regulatory costs the 2001 crain and hopkins study also provided estimates of t hose costs to businesses specifically the authors estimated that 497 billion of the 843 billion in aggregate regulatory costs in 2000 were imposed on businesses to develop this estimate crain and hopkins assumed that business costs were 65 of environmental costs 50 of economic costs 100 of workplace costs and 54 of tax compliance costs the environmental and tax cost assumptions were reportedly informed by previous studies but the authors said the 5050 di vision of economic costs was default judgment the allocation for workplace re gulations was based on the simple fact that these only apply to business enterprises regulatory costs on small business and manufacturers in what they described as their most important finding crain and hopkins also concluded that small busine sses experienced about 60 greater costs per employee than larger firms nearly 7000 per em ployee in firms with fewer than 20 employees compared to less than 4500 per em ployee in larger firms as table 3 below illustrates crain and hopkins reported that envir onmental regulations and tax compliance paperwork were more than twice as costly per employee to small firms than to larger firms in contrast they said that the cost of economic regulations fell most heavily on large firms and the costs of workplace regulation were slightly greater per employee to mediumsized firms table 3 crain and hopkins estimates of total federal regulatory costs per employee by size

firm manufacturing tr ade wholesale and retail rvices and all other types of firms as table 4 below illustrates the authors concluded that regulations were most costly to manufacturing and other firms including such businesses as coal mining ore mining oil and gas extracti on coal gasification and electric utilities and they were particularly hardhit by environmental regulations in comparison to their trade and service counterparts manufacturing and other firms also had somewhat higher compliance costs per employee for workplace regulations in contrast service firms reporte dly experienced

administration 2001 p 27 crain and hopkins also pr ovided estimates of regulatory costs per firm and as percentage of receipts both of these m easures indicated that regulations were more costly for manufacturers than for other type s of firms for example the authors reported that on average us firms sp end nearly 90000 per firm to comply with federal regulations but said manufacturers costs were more than 440000 per firm in contrast they said regulatory costs for the service sector were less than 32000 per firm finally combining the two previous pe rspectives the authors reported that small manufacturing firms appeared to be the most affected by regulatory costs on peremployee basis for example they said that manufacturing firms with fewer than 20 employees averaged nearly 17000 in regulatory costs per employee whereas regulatory costs in manufacturin g firms with 500 or more employees were just over 7000 per employee in the service sector they said regulations cost more than 2200 per small firm but less than 1800 per large firm manufacturers and wo rkplace regulations in december 2001 w mark crain and joseph johnson reported the results of survey that they conducted of

as lawsuits if only recurring costs are included the authors said the cost of compliance would drop to 28 billionrights labor standards nd labormanagement relations35 crain and johnson said that in 2000 complying with those regu lations cost those 100 manufacturers an average of 22 million per firm or about 1700 per employee the authors also said that there were significant differences in regulatory costs by firm size for example in small manufacturing firms t hose with fewer than 100 employees the authors reported that compliance with wo rkplace regulations cost nearly 2600 per employee in large firms those with 500 or more employees they said the cost was 1530 per employee and in mediumsize firms those with 100 to 499 employees the cost was about 1360 per employee they said that if the results from these 100 firms were extrapolated to all manufact uring firms in the us about 300000 the total cost of compliance with workplace rules for manufacturers would be 32 billion36 the overall conclusion that the authors drew from this study is consistent with the conclusion in the previously menti oned study by crain and hopkins that regulatory costs per employee are greater for small businesses than for larger businesses the actual costs reported in these studies differ substantially for example whereas crain and hopkins found that compliance with workplace regulations in 2000 cost less than 47000 per manufacturing firm crain and johnson concluded that workplace regulations cost they manufacturers in their study an average of about 22 million per firm about 50 times higher aggregate cost and benefit estimates need careful interpretation the differences in the estimates resulting from studies of aggregate regulatory costs or benefits suggest that users of those estimates would be wise to understand how they were developed most of the st udies attempt to aggregate the results of previous studies which may themselves be aggregations of previous studies with significantly different methodologies s light changes in these studies assumptions or data can yield vastly different results even when done by the same author for example the addition of one study or even one rule has caused ombs estimates to fluctuate significantly from year to year there are also substantial differences of opinion regarding which types of rules shoul d be included in these tabulations while some studies include transfer costs and co sts associated with tax paperwork others do not yielding cost estimates for the same year that differ by hundreds of billions of dollars still other studies rely on surveys of regulated entities asking them to selfreport their regulatory costs the us of selfreported information from regulated entities about the costs associated with regulatory compliance may be problematic in the absence of corroborating data httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32339crs18 37 us general accounting office regulatory burden measurement challenges and concerns raised by selected companies gaoggd972 nov 18 1996 38 previously gao concluded that estimates of regulatory compliance costs reported in the banking industry were of little value due to serious methodological deficiencies see us general accounting office regulatory burden recent st udies industry issues and agency initiatives gaoggd9428 dec 13 1993in 1996 the general accounting office gao attempted to collect information from companies regarding their regulatory compliance costs37 gao discovered that none of the more than 50 companies it cont acted could provide reliable information on regulatory costs part of the probl em was that companies found it difficult to identify incremental regulatory costs ie the costs that would not have been borne in the absence of federal regulation for ex ample even if they were not required by osha most companies would take step s to protect their workers from obvious hazards therefore the real cost of regulation is what those companies are required to spend over and above what they would ve done anyway none of the companies that gao contacted had database capable of capturing incremental costs probably because there is regular business use for such data the companies also had difficulty developing list of federal regulations applicable to their firms and differentiating federa l regulatory costs from costs associated with requirements issued by other jurisdictions and othe r entities gao concluded that objectively measuring the aggregate cost of federal regulations in single company was extremely difficult and said decisionmakers using studies that attempt to measure total current regulatory costs to guide public policy need to be aware of those studies conceptual and methodological underpinnings38 studies of aggregate regulatory costs can provide some useful perspective on the effects that federal regula tions have on the economy in general and businesses in particular although relia nt on numerous assumptions and sometimes dated information the aggregate estimates of regula tory costs are the best measure of those effects currently available the estimates derived from those studies can vary widely and depend heavily on the quality of the information used and how the data are adjusted and combined the fragility of t hose estimates is further underscored by the fact that omb longer considers it feasible to report the costs and benefits of all federal regulations also to provide full picture estimates of regulatory costs should be accompanied by timates of regulatory benefits unfortunately regulatory benefits are even more difficult to measure th an regulatory costs differences in the cost and benefit estimates derived from those studies illustrate the degree to which they should be viewed as providing inte resting but not necessarily definitive information
