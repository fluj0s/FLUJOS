overview jeffrey w seifert resources science and industry division july 15 2005 abstract congressional policymakers are concerned about potential inefficiencies and inefficacies in the operation of the federal government particularly as it relates to decisions regarding information technology it investments these concerns have increased as federal it spending has grown to more than 60 billion annually one approach being implemented to address this issue is the use of enterprise architecture ea planning across the federal government an ea serves as blueprint of the business operations of an organization and the information and technology needed to carry out these functions as an information technology management and planning tool ea planning represents businessdriven approach to information technology management that emphasizes interoperability and information sharing the federal enterprise architecture fea was started in 2002 by the office of management and budget omb and continues to be developed today the fea is composed of five reference models performance business service data and technical each of the reference models represent specific aspects of the fea and provide common language for departments and agencies to use in developing common technology solutions some of the congressional oversight issues related to the fea include but are not limited to ongoing updates of the reference models progress in aligning the eas of individual departments with the fea and the role of the fea in developing second generation of egovernment initiatives order

egovernment initiatives this report will be updated as events warrant what is the purpose of the federal enterprise architecture the federal enterprise architecture fea is planning and management tool used to guide federal information technology it investments with specific focus on improving efficiency and identifying common applications that can be used government wide it is designed to ensure that it investments support the functions of government rather than allowing technology choices determine how the government carries out its operations as whole the fea is intended to enable the federal government to identify opportunities to leverage technology to congressional research service the library of congress crs2 reduce redundancy facilitate horizontal crossfederal and vertical federal state and local information sharing establish direct relationship between it and missionprogram performance to support citizencentered customerfocused government and maximize it investments to better achieve mission outcomes1 what is an enterprise architecture an enterprise architecture ea serves as blueprint of the business operations of an organization and the information and technology needed to carry out these functions both currently and prospectively as such it is an information technology management and planning tool it is designed to be comprehensive and scalable to account for future growth needs ea planning represents businessdriven approach to it management that emphasizes interoperability and information sharing the creation of eas long predates the development of the federal enterprise architecture fea in the mid1980s john zachman business planning consultant who worked for ibm at the time developed the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22194 zachman framework which was designed to serve as blueprint or an architecture to facilitate the integration of it systems2 the enterprise for which an architecture is created refers to either single organization or mission area that transcends more than one organizational boundary eg financial management homeland security3 since the development of the zachman framework various parts of the federal government have attempted to work with eas for example the clingercohen act passed in 1996 tasked agency chief information officers cios with among other responsibilities developing maintaining and facilitating the implementation of sound and integrated information technology architecture for the executive agency4 the clingercohen act defined information technology architecture as an integrated framework for evolving or maintaining existing information technology and acquiring new information technology to achieve the agencys strategic goals and information resources management goals5 in september 1999 the federal cio council issued its fea framework which was described as conceptual model that begins to define documented and coordinated 1 office of management and budget expanding egovernment

in the glossary of the document the fea itself is defined as strategic information asset base which defines the business the information necessary to operate the business the technologies necessary to support the business operations and the transitional processes necessary for implementing new technologies in response to the changing business needs it is representation or blueprint7 the egovernment act passed in 2002 tasked the administrator of the office of egovernment with overseeing the development of eas both within and across agencies the act defined enterprise architecture as means i strategic information asset base which defines the mission ii the information necessary to perform the mission iii the technologies necessary to perform the mission and iv the transitional processes for implementing new technologies in response to changing mission needs and b includes i baseline architecture ii target architecture and iii sequencing plan8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22194 state governments are also active in developing their own enterprise architectures the national association of state chief information officers nascio released the third version of its enterprise architecture development toolkit in october 2004 to serve as guide for state and local government agencies nascios adaptive enterprise architecture development program has received funding from the department of justice to support state ea efforts with particular emphasis on facilitating the development of state information sharing capabilities9 reference models the fea is composed of five reference models performance business service data and technical each of the reference models represents specific aspects of the fea and provide common language for departments and agencies to use in developing common technology solutions the reference models are updated to reflect changes in applications and services brief descriptions of the five reference models drawn from the ea website are included below performance reference model framework for measuring the output of major it investments and their contributions toward achieving organizational goals10 6 chief information officers

describes the data and information used to support government program and business operations13 technical reference model framework used to describe the standards specifications and technologies used to support and facilitate the delivery of service components applications14 the fea reference models were developed by omb through its fea program management office pmo in conjunction with the federal cio council and the general services administration gsa for federal agencies and departments to use in their it budget and planning process15 the performance reference model prm provides standardized framework for measuring the contribution of major it initiatives being httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22194 utilized to fulfill existing legislativelymandated management processes these processes that the prm emphasizes are drawn primarily from the egovernment act of 2002 the clingercohen act of 1996 and the government performance and results act gpra of 199316 while the prm emphasizes government performance goals applicable to nearly all executive branch agencies omb describes the business reference model brm as the foundation of the fea itself17 the brm is based on functional view of government operations rather than an organizational view this orientation reflects the business focused nature of enterprise architecture it management the service component reference model srm in turn is intended to identify applications and components that independent of their business function can provide foundation of technologies that are reusable governmentwide the technical reference model trm and the data reference model drm focus on the technologies data and standards that can support and enable the delivery of service components and capabilities18 11 for more detail see

relationship of the five reference models to each other as it appears in various omb documents and presentations is included below the federal enterprise architecture19 goals of the federal enterprise architecture the federal government spends more than 60 billion annually on it goods and services the fea has the potential to serve as critical it management tool for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22194 achieving greater efficiencies and breaking down the socalled stove pipes that separate individual departments and agencies the omb has described the fea as playing central role to ultimately transform the federal government into citizencentered resultsoriented and marketbased organization as set forth in the presidents management agenda pma20 the feas emphasis on developing interoperable standards facilitating information sharing and increasing crossagency collaboration the fea is also expected to play significant role in the future development of federal government initiatives in attempting to develop second generation of egovernment projects omb has expressed an interest in moving beyond the somewhat limited nature of the crossagency collaboration of some of the first generation quicksilver projects21 toward initiatives that have truly governmentwide character to that end in spring 2004 after reviewing data collected from agencies for the development of the fea and formulating the annual federal budget omb identified five major collaborative initiatives that represent core business functions common to many departments and agencies these five socalled lines of business lob initiatives include financial management human resources management grants management case management and federal health architecture these initiatives are currently in their operational phases and are predicted to create 5 billion in savings over 19 source httpwwwwhitehousegovombegova1feahtml 20 office of management and budget fy07 budget formulation fea consolidated reference model document may 2005 p 4 21 pursuant to the july 18 2001 omb memorandum m0128 an egovernment task force was established to create strategy for achieving the bush administrations egovernment goals in doing so the task force identified 23 interagency initiatives designed to better integrate agency operations and information technology investments twentyfourth initiative government wide payroll process project was subsequently added by the presidents management council these initiatives are sometimes referred to as the quicksilver projects list of the projects is available at httpwwwgpoaccessgovusbudgetfy06pdfap_cd_rom9_3pdf crs6 10 years22 in march 2005 omb established task force for sixth project the information technology it security lob initiative this new it security initiative is intended to address common security weaknesses faced by many agencies and generally improve the state of federal information security this initiative is currently in the planning phase23 with these activities in mind omb describes the three primary objectives or goals of the fea as improve the utilization of information resources to achieve citizen centered government resulting in proactive policy and improved decisionmaking increase ea practice maturity governmentwide resulting in better alignment of it investments with mission performance and increase crossagency intergovernment and publicprivate sector collaboration resulting in increased common solutions and cost savings24 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22194 oversight issues for congress as the federal enterprise architecture initiative continues to evolve there are several issues congress may decide to consider related to implementation and oversight these issues include but are not limited to the progress of ongoing efforts to update and enhance the five reference models how well the enterprise architectures of the individual departments and agencies are in alignment with the federal enterprise architecture potential collaboration opportunities andor lessons to be learned from state government ea efforts how the federal enterprise architecture is being used to address federal information security problems how the federal enterprise architecture is facilitating and benefitting largescale it projects such as agencylevel technology modernization efforts the 24 quicksilver egovernment initiatives and government wide information sharing and the development and efficacy of second generation of collaborative government initiatives based on the lines of business lob as identified in
