analyses of making these loans the department of housing and urban development hud could insist on reviewing these new products regardless of its decision on reviewing the programs hud would be

stimulus for the american people act of 2008 would increase the conforming loan limit for mortgages originated between july 1 2007 and december 31 2008 to maximum of 729750 in highcost areas this 1 hr 5140 was introduced in the 110th congress by representative nancy pelosi on january 28 2008 as bipartisan bill with 15 cosponsors it was passed by the house and sent to the senate on january 29 2008 the senate passed the bill on february 7 2008 crs2 means that the housing governmentsponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac could purchase qualifying mortgages above the current conforming loan limit of 417000 and at or below the new limit the limit for any area would be the greater of 1 the 2008 conforming loan limit 417000 or 2 125 of the area median house price but more than 175 of the 2008 conforming loan limit 729750 which is 175 of 417000 hr 5140 would grant the federal housing administration fha temporary authority to insure mortgages in highcost areas up to this 729750 limit the authority would expire december 31 2008 currently the fha limit ranges from 200160 to 362790 in highcost areas2 the secretary of the department of housing and urban development hud would be required to publish the increased gse and fha limits the fha limit for any area would be the greater of 1 the current limit 200160 to 362790 or 2 125 of the area median house price but more than 175 of the 2008 conforming loan limit 729750 which is 175 of 417000 many of those supporting the increases believe they would provide needed stimulus to housing and mortgage markets3 the immediate impact of the changes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22799 affecting fannie mae and freddie mac however is unclear the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo an independent office within hud which oversees the safety and soundness of the gses has announced that it is disappointed that increasing the limit was not part of general regulatory reform and that the gses should subject the higher priced mortgages to rigorous new product development risk management and capital reserves requirements4 this suggests that hud might require the gses to submit their plan to purchase the larger mortgages for regulatory review5 unlike the gses fha part of hud is not under independent regulatory authority given implementation delays and the limited lives of the programs it is not clear how much use the gses or fha would make of their temporary authority as stockholderowned companies the gses would balance their fiduciary responsibility to earn profits with the requirements in their congressional charters to assist housing markets fha would probably consider the risk to the financial soundness of their insurance fund against temporary assistance to parts of the housing market other factors tending to limit the impact of the increased mortgage limits are as follows 2 fha limits are available from huds website at httpsentphudgovidapphtmlhicost1cfm 3 james

existing loantovalue limits would continue to apply this would prevent homeowners who owe more on house than its appraised value from participating in the program for conforming loans using standard 5 downpayment this would affect homes worth 438900 to 768000 and for fha loans with 3 downpayment this would allow the purchase of homes worth 351900 to 752000 existing credit worthiness and debttoincome requirements would apply this would prevent those not current on their mortgage from refinancing the gses retained portfolios currently are close to the maximum amount that they can hold without raising additional capital they could however follow the sense of congress suggestion in hr 5140 to buy these mortgages add their guarantees package them into mortgage backed securities mbs and sell the mbs to large investors the gses have announced restrictions on the mortgages that they will purchase under the temporary increase for example fannie mae and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22799 freddie mac will only purchase mortgages on oneunit housing condominiums and planned unit developments6 the mortgage provisions of hr 5140 would help purchasers of homes above the current loan limits and below the temporarily higher ones who have good credit mostly help home buyers in high cost areas such as california new york city and its suburbs the boston area the seattle area and the washington dc area the monthly principal and interest payments on 30year fixedrate 600000 mortgage are likely to fall from 3824 to 3377 saving 447 per month7 fhas guidelines state that mortgage payments and insurance and taxes should not exceed 29 of monthly income combined monthly housing expense of 3377 would require minimum annual income of 140000 not count mortgages purchased by the gses

calculation is 658 and the conforming loan interest rate is 542 crs4 underserved areas goals hud establishes numeric goals based on the housing and community development act of 19928 and help fha compete against private sector lenders and possibly open homeownership to borrowers who for one reason or another could not qualify for conforming mortgage to purchase more expensive home the approach taken in hr 5140 to raising the conforming loan limit differs from that in hr 1427 federal housing finance reform act of 2007 which passed the house on may 22 2007 and s 2036 the protecting access to safe mortgages act which was introduced in the senate by senator charles schumer on september 10 20079 hr 1427 and s 2036 would increase the conforming loan limit for fannie mae and freddie mac to the area median house price subject to maximum of 150 of the national limit in 2008 absent hr 5140 the national limit is 417000 making the highcost limit 625500 hr 5140 has higher absolute maximum 729750 versus 625000 in 2008 is permanent instead of temporary and would increase the limit in areas where 125 of the median house price exceeds the current national limit of 417000 for example the most recent median existing home price data from the national association httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22799 of realtors third quarter 2007 in barnstable massachusetts was 400600 the conforming loan limit under hr 5140 would increase to 500750 in barnstable 8 12 usc 45624564 and 4566 9 representative barney frank introduced hr 1427 the federal housing finance reform act of 2007 on march 9 2007 the five
