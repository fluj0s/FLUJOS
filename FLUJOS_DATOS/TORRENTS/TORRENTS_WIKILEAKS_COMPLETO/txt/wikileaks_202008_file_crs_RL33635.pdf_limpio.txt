nd congress accentuate the institutional tensions between the executive and legislative branches inherent in the federal budget process impoundment whereby president withholds or delays the spending of funds appropriated by congress provides an important mechanism for budgetary control during budget implementation in the executive branch but congress retains oversight responsibilities at this stage as well president bush like his recent predecessors has called for an item veto or possibly expanded impoundment authority to provide him with greater control over federal spending the impoundment control act of 1974 title x of pl 93344 established two categories of impoundments deferrals or temporary delays in funding availability and rescissions or permanent cancellation of budget authority with rescission the funds must be made available for obligation unless both houses of congress take action to approve the presidents rescission request within 45 days of continuous session consideration of impoundment reform increasingly became joined with that of an item veto for the president while constitutional amendment proposals have not disappeared see hjres 38 many who originally favored an item veto constitutional amendment turned to expanded rescission authority for the president as functionally similar mechanism achievable more easily by statutory change the line item veto act was signed into law on april 9 1996 pl 104130 and it became effective january 1 1997 key provisions allowed the president to cancel any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority any item of new direct spending or certain limited tax benefits contained in any law unless disapproved by congress on june 25 1998 the supreme court in the case of clinton v city of new york held the law unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the presentment clause in order to grant the president true item veto authority constitutional amendment would be needed according to the majority opinion measures seeking to provide constitutional alternative to the 1996 law have been introduced in each subsequent congress in the 109 th congress the house passed hr 4890 the legislative line

g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 debate about the appropriate relationship between the branches in the federal budget process seems inevitable given the constitutional necessit of shared power in this sphere under the constitution congress possesses the power of the purse money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law but the president enjoys broad authority as the chief executive who shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed the constitution is silent concerning the specifics of budget system for the federal government informal procedures sufficed for many years the budget and accounting act of 1921 pl 67 14 for the first time required the president to submit consolidated budget recommendation to congress to assist in this task the act also created new agency the bureau of the budget to assemble correlate revise reduce or increase the estimates of the several departments or establishments in 1970 the budget agency was reconstituted as the office of management and budget omb 1 omb also plays an important role later in the budget process when funds are actually spent as appropriations laws are implemented impoundment of funds by the president represents an important component in this stage of budget execution presidential impoundment actions have sometimes been controversial the subject of granting the president item veto authority akin to that exercised by 43 governors also has elicited considerable debate with an item veto the executive can delete specific provisions in piece of legislation presented for signature and then proceed to sign the measure into law2 g4g155g146g142g143g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561g152g143g561g11g150g153g152g158g151g141g150g142g151g157g561 impoundment includes any executive action to withho ld or delay the spending of appropriated funds one useful distinction among impoundment actions which received statutory recognition in the 1974 impoundment control act focuses on duration whether the presidents intent is permanent cancellation of the funds in question rescission or merely temporary delay in availability deferral another useful contrast distinguishes presidential deferrals for routine administrative reasons from deferrals for policy purposes virtually all presidents have impounded funds in routine manner as an exercise of executive discretion to accomplish efficiency in management the creation of budgetary reserves as part of the apportionment process required by the antideficiency acts 31 usc 15111519 provided formal structure for such routine impoundments which originated with an administrative regulation issued in 1921 by the bureau of the budget and then received statutory base in 1950 3 impoundments for policy reasons

impoundment date back to the early nineteenth century but presidents typically sought accommodation rather than confrontation with congress 4 in the 1950s and 1960s disputes over the impoundment authority resulted from the refusal of successive presidents to fund certain weapons systems to the full extent authorized by congress these confrontations between the president and congress revolved around the constitutional role of commanderinchief and tended to focus on relatively narrow issues of weapons procurement president johnson made broader use of his power to impound by ordering the deferral of billions of dollars of spending during the vietnam war in an effort to restrain inflationary pressures in the economy while some impoundments during these periods were motivated by policy concerns they typically involved temporary spending delays with the president acting in consultation with congressional leaders so that protracted confrontation between the branches was avoided conflict over the use of impoundments greatly increased during the nixon administration and eventually involved the courts as well as congress and the president in the 92 nd and 93rd congresses 19711974 the confrontation intensified as the president sought to employ the tool of impoundment to reorder national priorities and alter programs previously approved by congress following president nixons reelection in 1972 the administration announced major new impoundment actions affecting variety of domestic programs for example moratorium was imposed on subsidized housing programs community development activities were suspended and disaster assistance was reduced several farm programs were likewise targeted for elimination perhaps the most controversial of the nixon impoundments involved the clean water act funds court challenges eventually reached the supreme court which in early 1975 decided the case on narrower grounds than the extent of the presidents impoundment authority 5

only with ad hoc efforts to restore individual programs but also with gradually more restrictive appropriations language arguably the most authoritative response was the enactment of the impoundment control act ica title x of the congress ional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 6 as result of compromise in conference the ica differentiated deferrals or temporary delays in funding

congress of all proposed rescissions and deferrals and to submit specified information regarding each the ica further required the comptroller general to oversee executive compliance with the law and to notify congress if the president failed to report an impoundment or improperly classified an action the original language allowed deferral to remain in effect for the period proposed by the president not to exceed beyond the end of the fiscal year so as to become facto rescission unless either the house or the senate took action to disapprove it such procedure known as onehouse legislative veto was found unconstitutional by the supreme court in ins v chadha 462 us 919 1983 in may 1986 federal district court ruled that the presidents deferral authority under the ica was inseverable from the onehouse veto provision and hence was null the lower court decision was affirmed on appeal in city of new haven v united states 809 f2d 900 dcc 1987 in the case of rescission the ica provided that the funds must be made available for obligation unless both houses of congress take action to approve the rescission request within 45 days of continuous session recesses of more than three days not counted in practice this usually means that funds proposed for rescission not approved by congress must be made available for obligation after about 60 calendar days although the period can extend to 75 days or longer congress may approve all or only portion of the rescission request congress may also choose after the 45day period to rescind funds previously requested for rescission by the president congress does rescind funds never proposed for rescission by the president but such action is not subject to the ica procedures the ica establishes procedures for congressional disapproval of rescission request during the 45day period however some administrations have voluntarily followed policy of releasing funds before the expiration of the review period if either the house or the senate authoritatively indicates that it does not intend to approve the rescission in the fall of 1987 as component of legislation to raise the limit on the public debt pl 100 119 congress enacted several budget process reforms section 207 prohibited the practice sometimes used by presidents when congress failed to act on rescission proposal within the allotted period of submitting new rescission proposal covering identical or very similar matter by using such resubmissions the president might continue to tie up funds even though congress by its inaction had already rejected virtually the same proposal the prohibition against such seriatim rescission proposals contained in the 1987 law applies for the duration of the appropriation so that it may remain in effect for two or more fiscal years section 206 of pl 100119 served to codify the decision in the new haven case allowing deferrals to provide for contingencies to achieve savings made possible through changes in requirements or efficiency of operations or as provided in statute the ica as amended longer sanctions policy deferrals 8 7 according to one account written by the staff members who put

veto it in its entirety however constitutions in 43 states provide for an item veto usually confined to appropriation bills allowing the governor to eliminate discrete provisions in legislation presented for signature ten states allow the governor to reduce amounts as well as eliminate items and seven states have an amendatory veto permitting the governor to return legislation with specific suggestions for change 9 the first proposal to provide the president with an item veto was introduced in 1876 president grant endorsed the mechanism in response to the growing practice in congress of attaching riders or provisions altering permanent law to appropriations bills over the years many bills and resolutions mainly proposed constitutional amendments have been introduced but action in congress on item veto proposals beyond an occasional hearing has been limited in 1938 the house approved an item veto amendment to the independent offices appropriations bill by voice vote but the senate rejected the amendment contemporary proposals for item veto are usually confined to bills containing spending authority although not necessarily limited to items of appropriation in the 101st congress the senate judiciary subcommittee on the constitution held hearing on proposed constitutional amendments permitting an item veto on april 11 1989 and reported two such amendments without recommendation on june 8 sjres 14 would have allowed the president to veto only selected items in an appropriations bill while sjres 23 would have authorized him to disapprove or reduce any item of appropriation excluding legislative branch items on april 26 1990 the full judiciary committee voted 86 to report both measures favorably but the report was not filed until september 19 1990 10 in the 102nd congress the house voted on language providing item veto authority for the president on june 11 1992 during debate on hjres 290 proposing constitutional amendment requiring balanced budget the house rejected by vote of 170258 an amendment by representative kyl hamdt 602 the kyl proposal sought to allow the president to exercise item veto authority in signing any measure containing spending authority broadly defined limit total outlays for fiscal year to 19 of the gross national product of that year and require threefifths vote of the congress to approve any additional funds 11 some contended that the president already had item veto authority as part of his constitutional powers an article by stephen glazier appearing in the wall street journal on december 4 1987 advocated this

constitution held hearing on june 15 1994 to receive testimony on the subject some continue to believe that statutory framework different from the line item veto act of 1996 may yet be devised to give the president authority akin to an item veto without the necessity of constitutional amendment one statutory alternative entails bills incorporating the separate enrollment approach which stipulate that each item of an appropriations bill be enrolled as separate bill since 1985 such separate enrollment measures have been introduced repeatedly in the senate the dole amendment to s 4 in the 104 th congress as passed by the senate in march 1995 samdt 347 incorporated the separate enrollment approach in the 109th congress hr 4889 likewise reflects this approach

reform became increasingly joined with the idea of an item veto during the ford and carter administrations the provisions of the ica proved relatively noncontroversial dissatisfaction increased during the reagan administration president reagan in his 1984 state of the union message specifically called for constitutional amendment to grant item veto authority which he considered to be powerful tool while governor of california in his last two budget messages president reagan included enhanced rescission authority among his budget process reform proposals president george h w bush also endorsed the idea of expanded rescission authority and an item veto for the president during the 1992 campaign thengovernor bill clinton advocated presidential item veto and he subsequently endorsed enhanced rescission authority during the 2000 campaign george w bush went on record in support of expanded rescission authority and as president he has repeatedly called for some kind of item veto authority 13 instead of granting true item veto authority to the president via constitutional amendment efforts came to focus on modifying the framework for congressional review of rescissions by the president legislative activity directed toward granting the president expanded rescission authority extended over several years such statutory alternatives sometimes have been referred to as giving the president line item veto while the nomenclature is not technically correct it does call attention to some functional similarities in examining impoundment reform legislation the distinction often has been drawn between enhanced and expedited rescission proposals with enhanced rescission the intent is to reverse the burden of action and thereby create presumption favoring the president such proposals usually stipulate that budget authority identified in rescission message from the president is to be permanently canceled unless congress acts to disapprove the request within prescribed period in contrast the expedited rescission approach focuses on procedural changes in congress to require an up or down vote on certain rescission requests from the president such measures contain expedited procedures to ensure prompt introduction of measure to approve the rescission fast report by committee or automatic discharge special limits on floor amendments and debate and so on under expedited rescission congressional approval would still be 12 this interpretation was explored at symposium held in 1988 see pork barrels and princi ples the politics of the presidential veto by

proposed rescissions and hence to reject them by inaction some bills are hybrids reflecting combination of item veto and rescission language and sometimes features of both expedited and enhanced

when hr 2164 gained house approval on october 3 1992 by vote of 31297 the measure would have established procedures for expedited congressional consideration of certain rescission proposals from the president submitted not later than three days after signing an appropriations act under the measure the prop osed rescission could not reduce program below the budget level of the previous year or by mo re than 25 for new programs funds would have become available after vote in congress to reject the proposed rescission 14 consideration of expanded rescission bills resumed in the 103rd congress on

management and budget dire ctor franklin raines and secretary of the treasury robert rubin were named as defendants because of their responsibilities for implementing key aspects of the law the plaintiffs contended that the act violated the constitutional requirements of bicameral passage and presentment by granting to the president acting alone the authority to cancel and thus repeal

which the powers and responsibilities of the congress under the constitution are placed in issue on march 21 1997 us district court judge thomas penfield jackson heard oral arguments in the case of byrd v raines less than three weeks later on april 10 judge jackson ruled that the line item veto act was unconstitutional because it violated provisions of the presentment clause in the constitution article i section 7 cl 2 his ruling found that compared with permissible delegations in the past the line item veto act hands off to the president authority over fundamental legislative choices in so doing congress has turned the constitutional division of responsibilities for legislating on its head 24 as already noted the line item veto act provided for expedited judicial review allowing for appeal of district court decision directly to the supreme court such request was filed and on april 23 1997 the supreme court agreed to an accelerated hearing the court heard oral arguments on may 27 and announced its decision in raines v byrd on june 26 1997 in 72 decision the court held that the members of congress challenging the law lacked legal standing so the judgment of the lower court finding the act unconstitutional was put aside and the line item veto act remained in force however the supreme court confined its decision to the 23 nteu v united states 929 fsupp 484 488 ddc 1996 24

establish standing having suffered ill effects directly as result of the cancellations on october 16 1997 two separate cases challenging the line item veto act were initiated complaint was filed by the city of new york and other interested parties seeking to overturn the cancellation of the new direct spending provision affecting medicaid funding in the balanced budget act in the us district court for the district of columbia case number 197cv02393 on the same day the national treasury employees union who had brought the first suit challenging the new law in the spring of 1996 even before it became effective filed another suit in district court seeking to overturn the veto of the federal pension provision in the treasury appropriations act case number 197cv02399 on october 21 1997 third case seeking to overturn the cancellation of the limited tax benefit affecting farm cooperatives was filed in the district court by snake river potato growers inc case number 197cv02463 on

nteu filed an amended complaint challenging the specific application of the cancellation authority as well as the constitutionality of the law hearing on the consolidated case was set for january 14 1998 meanwhile on december 19 1997 the clinton administration conceded that the presidents cancellation in october of the federal pension provision exceeded the authority conveyed in the line item veto act on january 6 1998 judge ho gan approved negotiated settlement in the suit between the justice department and the national treasury employees union and ordered that the previously canceled pension provision for an open season to switch pension plans be reinstated the order found that the president lacked authority to make this cancellation and so it was invalid and without legal force and effect the nteus constitutional challenge was declared moot but oral arguments for the two remaining parties in the consolidated case challenging the laws constitutionality were to proceed 27 enactment of pl 105159 already noted served to disapprove 38 cancellations in the military construction appropriations act and another cancellation was found impermissible under the law discussed below so 43 of the original 82 cancellations were force when the supreme court overturned the line item veto act in 1998

hogan arguments were presented by attorneys for the idaho potato farmers group and for new york city and coplaintiffs in the cases involving cancellations by the president in august 1997 of limited tax benefit provision and an item of new direct spending affecting medicaid funding judge hogan on february 12 1998 issued his ruling which held the line item veto act unconstitutional because it violates the procedural requirements ordained in article i of the united states constitution and impermissibly upsets the balance of powers so carefully prescribed by its framers 28 on february 20 1998 the justice department appealed that decision to the supreme court and on february 27 1998 the supreme court agreed to review the case the supreme court heard oral arguments in the case of clinton v new york city on april 27 1998 both sides conceded that true item veto lowing the president to sign some provisions and veto others when presented piece of legislation would be unconstitutional the solicitor general sought to distinguish the presidents cancellation of provisions under the line item veto act from formal repeal of the provisions but several of the justices seemed skeptical another key argument concerned the matter of delegation and whether the act conveys so much authority to the president as to violate the separation of pow ers the issue of standing for the two groups of plaintiffs combined in the case also was examined on june 25 1998 the court rendered its decision holding the line item veto act unconstitutional because its cancellation provisions were in violation of procedures set forth in the constitutions presentment clause found in article i section 7 29 in the immediate aftermath of the supreme court decision there was some uncertainly regarding how funding for projects canceled under the now unconstitutional law could be restored in the view of some omb might not be required to f und projects eliminated from appropriations acts because the cancellations in the consolidated case brought before the supreme court only involved limited tax benefit and direct spending provisions some suggested that each affected party might have to sue as did new york city in the case decided by the supreme court although it was widely expected that funding for projects not explicitly covered by the supreme court decision would be restored three weeks passed before the justice department and omb determined officially that the funds were to be released on july 17 1998 omb announced that funds for the remaining cancellations those not overturned by previous litigation or the disapproval bill covering the military construction appropriations would be made available

specific spending items and tax expenditures of which he disapproved for an expedited upordown vote president bush reiterated his support for restoring presidential line item veto authority in his speech to the republican national convention on september 2 2004 at his first postelection news conference on november 4 2004 in response to question about reducing the deficit he stated in part that the president needed line item that passed constitutional muster in order to maintain budget discipline at press conference on december 20 2004 the president again called for line item veto authority responding that he had not yet vetoed any appropriations bills because congress had followed up on his requested budget targets but further observing now i think the president ought to have the line item veto because within the appropriations bills there may be differences of opinion between the executive branch and congress on how the money is spent 37

bush reiterated his request for lineitem veto authority noting and we can tackle this problem of too many specialinterest earmark projects together if you pass the lineitem veto38 in his budget submission for fy2006 transmitted february 7 2005 president bush called for line item veto linked to deficit reduction on march 6 2006 president bush sent draft bill titled the legislative line item veto act of 2006 to congress39 and the measure was introduced the next day see hr 4890 and s 2381 below title notwithstanding the bills sought to amend the impoundment control act of 1974 ica to incorporate typical expedited rescission framework intended through procedural provisions to require an upordown vote on presidential requests to cancel certain previously enacted spending or tax provisions since congressional approval would remain necessary for the rescissions to become permanent expedited rescission is generally viewed as weaker tool than an item veto hr 4890 and s 2381 as introduced also contained rather novel provisions authorizing the president to withhold funds proposed for rescission or to suspend execution of items of direct spending for up to 180 days these provisions arguably might sanction the return of policy deferrals originally provided for in the ica subject to onehouse veto but invalidated by the chadha and new haven decisions as well as the statutory provisions in pl 100119 40 on march 15 2006 the house rules subcommittee on the legislative and budget process held hearing on hr 4890 testimony was received from representative paul ryan

veto perspectives on applications and effects and featured four witnesses representing private sector groups including former member and two former congressional aides the second hearing concentrated on constitutional issues with testimony received from charles cooper louis fisher and professor viet d dinh from the georgetown university law center 42 on june 14 the house budget committee held markup of hr 4890 representative paul ryan offered substitute amendment which was further amended an amendment offered by representative cuellar to add sunset provision whereby the act would expire after six years was approved by voice vote also successful was an amendment offered by representative neal as further amended by representative mccotter expressing the sense of congress regarding possible abuse of proposed cancellation authority president or other executive official should make any decision for inclusion or exclusion of items in special message contingent upon members vote in congress the ryan substitute as amended was adopted by voice vote the committee then voted 2410 to report the bill favorably 43 several amendments offered by minority members were rejected generally with straight party line vote democrats sought to exempt future changes in social security medicare and veterans entitlement programs from possible cancellations under the lliv democrats also attempted unsuccessfully to restore payasyougo budget rules to strengthen requirements for earmark disclosures and to facilitate enforcement of the threeday layover rule for appropriations bills before floor votes on june 15 the house rules committee met to markup hr 4890 and voted 84 to approve substitute amendment containing the same version as approved by the budget committee 44 several changes in the substitute version addressed concerns with the bill as introduced for example in response to concern expressed over return to policy deferrals by allowing the president to withhold spending for up to 180 calendar days the substitute would allow the president to withhold funds for maximum of 90 calendars days an initial 45 day period which could be extended for another 45 days submission of special rescission or cancellation messages by the president would occur only within 45 days of enactment of the measure and the president would be limited to submission of five special

separate messages would be prohibited on the other hand some changes in the substitute version approved by the budget and rules committees and subsequently by the full house arguably might be subject to additional critiques the substitute narrowed the definition of targeted tax benefit to revenuelosing measure affecting single beneficiary with the chairs of the ways and means and finance committees to identify such provisions the definition in hr 4890 as introduced referred to revenuelosing measures affecting 100 or fewer beneficiaries as did the line item veto act of 1996 the bill as introduced however would have allowed the president to identify the provisions by default whereas the 1996 law assigned the duty to the joint committee on taxation supporters of the substitute version suggested that it would treat targeted tax benefits comparably to earmarks in appropriations bills critics countered that the new definition was too narrow and that few tax benefits would be subject to cancellation 45 on june 21 the house rules committee voted to report hres 886 providing for the consideration of hr 4890 as amended favorably by nonrecord vote46 managers amendment offered by representative paul ryan was adopted as part of the rule for debate in response to concerns raised by the transportation and infrastructure committee the amendment added clarifying language that any amounts cancelled which came from trust fund or special fund would be returned to the funds from which they were originally derived rather than revert to the general fund the following day the house took up hr 4890 approved the rule hres 886 by vote of 228196 and passed the measure by vote of 247172 47 motion by representative spratt to recommit hr 4890 to the budget committee with instructions to report it back to the house with an amendment was rejected by vote of 170249 meanwhile on june 20 2006 the senate budget committee marked up s 3521 the stop over spending act of 2006 an omnibus budget reform measure containing provisions for expedited rescission in title i48 minority amendments to exclude medicare social security and veterans health programs from possible rescissions were rejected 1012 on partyline votes managers amendment was adopted by voice vote which among other things would prohibit the resubmission of items of direct spending or targeted tax benefits previously rejected by congress but would allow the president to resubmit proposed cancellations if congress failed to complete action on them due to adjournment whereupon the committee voted 1210 to report s 3521 as amended favorably the report to accompany s 3521 was filed on july 14 2006 49 on june 27 2006 the president met with some senators at the white house to discuss the legislative line item veto

chance of passage supporters have been unable to overcome democratic opposition and reluct ance among some republicans to address it in an election year 52 in addition to the alternative of possible action on s 3521 the senate could have chosen to consider stand alone item veto measure such as hr 4890 as passed by the house or s 2381 news story published shortly before congress departed for the august recess suggested that the issue remained an open question senate majority leader bill frist rtn has made decisions about timing or which line item rescission measure to bring up and is taking

legislative transparency and accountability act of 2007 an ethics and lobbying reform bill according to senator gregg the language in samdt 17 was similar to the expedited rescission provisions contained in democratic amendment known as the daschle substitute offered in 1995 during senate consideration of the line item veto act of 199655 the bush administration went on record in support of samdt 17 the administration strong ly supports senator greggs legislative line item veto amendmentan initiative that is consistent with the presidents goals56 samdt 17 would have provided for expedited consideration of certain rescissions of discretionary or new mandatory spending or cancellation of targeted tax benefits proposed in special messages from the president the president could submit up to four rescission packages year once with the budget and three other times at the presidents choosing the president could withhold funding contained in special message for up to 45 days the new authority would expire in four years at one point it appeared that the ethics and lobbying reform measure might become stalled with the minority leader insisting on vote on the gregg amendment before proceeding to final action on s 1 57 an agreement was worked out however between the majority leader and the minority leader with promise of vote on the line item veto amendment during debate on the minimum wage bill hr 2 the following week on january 18 2007 samdt 17 was withdrawn and s 1 passed by vote of 962 58 in accordance with the leadership agreement senator gregg filed another amendment samdt 101 to hr 2 on january 22 2007 and two hours of floor debate on the line item veto measure ensued59 senator gregg noted one major change in provisions from the previous samdt 17 incorporated into samdt 101 addition of the right to strike during consideration of rescission package proposed by the president senator with the support of 11 others could move to strike one or more of the rescissions included in the bill in other words congress could amend the presidents proposal by deleting selected items senator gregg suggested that this change brought samdt 101 even more in line with the daschle substitute in 1995 he also observed that several of the 20 cosponsors of the previous daschle amendment were still in the senate 60 senator kent conrad chair of the budget committee suggested that the two amendments differed in important respects the gregg amendment would allow the president to propose rescinding items of new direct spending in programs such as medicare whereas the daschle amendment did not cover such mandatory spending the gregg amendment would permit the president to propose rescissions from multiple bills in one rescission package whereas the 54

package cover just one bill according to senator conrad this latter arrangement would give the president less leverage over an individual member61 debate on samdt 101 resumed on january 24 2007 vote to invoke cloture on the line item veto amendment failed to attain the necessary 60 votes 494862 the amendment was subsequently set aside and formally withdrawn on january 31 in his budget submission for fy2008 transmitted on february 5 2007 president bush once again called for enactment of line item veto mechanism such as the administrations proposal from march 2006 that would withstand constitutional challenge63 expedited rescission bills have been introduced in the house in the 110th congress see below on the same day as the cloture motion on the gregg line item veto proposal failed in the senate representative paul ryan ranking republican on the house budget committee along with 83 cosponsors introduced hr 689 the legislative line item veto act of 2007 hr 689 is nearly identical to hr 4890 as passed by the house in the 109 th congress on april 23 2007 companion bills titled the congressional accountability and lineitem veto act were introduced as hr 1998 by representative paul ryan and as s 1186 by senator russell feingold in his introductory remarks senator feingold sought to differentiate this measure from previous bills noting the following there have been number of socalled lineitem veto proposals offered in the past several years but the measure congressman ryan and i propose today is unique in that it specifically targets the very items that every lineitem veto proponent cites when promoting particular measure namely earmarks when president bush asked for this kind of authority the examples he gave when citing wasteful spending he wanted to target were congressional earmarks 64 the universe of items subject to rescission or cancellation by the president in s 1186 shows noteworthy differences from those contained in the 109th congress bills as passed by the house hr 4890 and reported in the senate s 3521 tle i instead of allowing the president to propose rescission of any amount of discretionary spe nding in appropriations acts et as do the 109th bills in hr 1998s 1186 the newly expedited rescission authority only would apply to congressional earmarks as defined in the bill the provisions regarding the cancellation of limited tax benefits seen in hr 1998s 1186 reflect language both from the housepassed bill chairmen of ways and means and finance committees to identify them and senatereported version applicable to any revenuelosing provisions affecting single or limited group most significantly perhaps under hr 1998s 1186 the expedited rescission authority would cover mandatory spending but in departure from provisions in the bills receiving action in the109 th congress would apply to limited tariff benefits 61 ibid pp s797s798 62 congressional record daily edition vol 153 jan 24 2007 p s746 63 us office

provisions similar to those seen in one or more bills from the 109th congress for example language in hr 1998s 1186 regarding the relationship with the ica parallels that in the housepassed version of hr 4890 109th congress as does the language regarding seriatim rescissions abuse of the proposed cancellation authority and using any savings for deficit reduction the expedited congressional procedures in the 109th compared with the 110th bills are virtually the same in most cases when provisions in hr 1998s 1186 differ from those in the 109th congress bills the new features serve to further confine the boundaries of the additional rescission authority to be granted the president the deadline for submission of special rescissions or cancellation messages under hr 1998s 1186 would be within 30 days of enactment compared to 45 days in the housepassed bill in the 109th congress and one year in the senatereported bill s 3521 title i in similar manner s 1186 would set limit of one special message for each act except for an omnibus budget reconciliation or appropriations measure when two special messages would be allowed on the other hand stipulations regarding deferrals withholding of spending by the president in s 1186 appear to be less restrictive than those found in the housepassed and senatereported versions in the 109th congress both hr 4890 as passed by the house and s 3521 as reported allowed withholding for period not to exceed 45 calendar days s 1186 would permit the president to withhold funding for designated earmarks or suspend execution of limited tax or tariff benefits for period of 45 calendar days of continuous session 65 in addition s 1186 would allow the extension of the withholding for another 45day period if the president submits supplemental message between days 40 and 45 in the original period under the ica the president likewise may withhold funds included in rescission request for 45 calendar days of continuous session which often equals 60 or more calendar days under the provisions in hr 1998s 1186 the president could conceivabl withhold funds for 100 days or longer as noted already the original administration bill in 2006 allowed the president to withhold funds for 180 calendar days in 2006 some contended that the 180day withholding mechanism arguably might be viewed as sanctioning the return of policy deferrals originally provided for in the ica subject to onehouse veto but invalidated by the chadha and new haven decisions as well as the statutory provisions in pl 10011966 the extension of the withholding period in hr 1998s 1186 conceivably to over 100 days compar ed with the 45calendarday period in the housepassed and senatereported bills might arguably be appraised as representing facto return to policy deferrals two constitutional amendment proposals are pending in the 110th congress hjres 38 would allow the president to decline to approve any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority any 65 s 1186 contains definition for calendar day as standard 24hour period beginning at midnight but does not define calendar day of continuous session there is definition of the prescribed 45 day period in the ica however which stipulates continuity of session of the congress shall be considered as broken only by an adjournment of the congress sine die and the days on which either house is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to day certain shall be excluded from the computation of the 45day period pl 93344 sect 1015 the phrase calendar days of continuous session ge nerally means that days falling in recesses longer than three days are not counted 66 for further discussion of policy deferrals see crs issue brief ib89148 available from author
