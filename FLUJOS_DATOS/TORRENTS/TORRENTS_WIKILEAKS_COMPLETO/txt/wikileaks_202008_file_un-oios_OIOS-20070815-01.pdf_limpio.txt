redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 1 i introduction 1 this report resulted from an inves tigation conducted between december 2006 and june 2007 by the procurement task force the task force of the office of internal oversight services oios th task force was crea ted on 12 january 2006 to address all procurement matters referred to the office of internal oversight services the creation of the task force was the resu lt of perceived problems in procurement initially identified by the independent i nquiry committee into the oilforfood programme 2 under its terms of reference the task force operates as part of oios and reports directly to the undersecretary general for oios 1 the remit of the task force is to investigate all procurement cases including all matters involving procurement bidding exercises procurement staff and vendors doing business with the united nations the united nations or the organisation2 3 this investigation of the task force focu ses on subject 1 an op erations assistant at the united nations office for project services unops subject 1 was supervisory procurement official handling contract selection exercises for unops eastern and southern africa regional office in nairobi esaro the investigation has identified that subject 1 together with her husband subject 2 and certain unops vendors participated in scheme to steer cont racts to companies connected to subject 1 this was done through the submission of fi ctitious bids from companies that were purportedly but not truly independent in the process and were in fact associated with subject 2 subject 1 was instrumental to th is scheme as she steered unops contracts to companies with ties to her husband as well as improperly shared confidential united nations information with these companies to facilitate the alteration of bid documents by her husband and his associates 4 on 6 june 2007 the task force issued its interim report on subject 1 and unops procurement operations the interim report 3 the interim report focused on allegations that subject 1 had been systema tically corrupting the pr ocurement process in the esaro office after conducting thoroug h and independent revi ew of subject 1s activities while employed at unops the task force found that subject 1 together with her husband participated in scheme to steer contracts to depasse logistics owned and managed by subject 24 as result of this scheme subject 1 and subject 2 improperly benefited at the expens of the organisation 5 the purpose of this second report is to in form the organisation of the full scope of the illegal conduct perpetrated by subject 1 her husband subject 2 and associated 1 terms of reference of the procurement task force 12 january 2006 2 id 3 procurement task force interim report on concerned united nations staff member and unops procurement report ptfr00307 6 june 2007 4 the scheme was accomplished through the submission of purportedly independent bids from companies which appeared to be legitimate competitors in fact the bids were not independent as their submission was organized by subject 2 and his associates and in each case included proposal from depasse oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 2 companies as identified by the task force to this end this final report focuses on other companies in addition to depasse logist ics that are similarly controlled by subject 2 and his associates specifically it addresse s the full extent of the scheme to defraud the organisation that was executed by subject 1 and her husband this report sets forth clear and persuasive evidence that in add ition to improperly dir ecting unops contracts to depasse logistics subject 1 steered number of additional contracts to other companies such as microsun and solutions kenya ltd associated with and in some cases owned by subject 2 furthe r the task force has identified evidence that subject 2 and subject 1accepted kickbacks from at ast two other esaro vendors apart from those owned by subject 2 as result of this scheme the organisation has incurred substantial financial loss 6 the task force has made multiple requests for documents and records of number of companies associated with subject 2 and involved in the relevant procurement exercises several of these entities and thei r principals have failed to cooperate with the task forces requests including subject 2 who has not cooper ated at all ii overview 7 subject 1 was first employed at unops esaro in nairobi kenya in early january 2006 originally subject 1s job t itle was operations assistant although her title later changed to administrative associat as member of the operations section and assistant to the operations manager she played key role in esaro procurement in 2006 around marchapril 2006 she became the facto esaro procurement officer 8 subject 2 is the owner of two esaro vendors namely depasse logistics and microsun and solutions kenya ltd he is also associated with several other companies namely company 1 compfit systems joymart enterprises kenelec supplies ltd zambezi investments and joes freighters 9 subject 1 failed to disclose to the organi sation the conflict of interest created by her husbands and her own links to esar vendors as expressly required by the unops procurement manual 5 in fact not only did she dire ctly violate her obligation as unops staff member to excu herself from the procurement process in matters relating to these vendors s ubject 1 together with her husband and his associates conspired to steer contracts to companie s owned by or associated with subject 26 in so doing subject 1 and subject 2 defrauded the organisation and corrupt ed the procurement process for personal enrichment and to benefit her husband subject 2 10 as described in the interim report subj ect 1 initially instructed subject 3 the procurement assistant at the time in stion to pass contracts to her husbands company depasse logistics later once subject 1 became the facto procurement 5 see section 161 4 of the unops procurement manual rev 1 february 2007 individuals having personal or financial interest in supplier responding to solicitation are prohibited from any involvement in the procurement process any procurement personnel maintaining conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest should immediately notify his supervisor 6 id oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 3 officer she had full autonomy to decide which companies would receive requests for quotations during the solic itation process in furtherance of the scheme and in direct violation of staff regulat ions and unops procurement et hics subject 1 would send requests to her husbands private email addres s as well as to the email addresses of companies he owned or with which he was associated 11 one particularly compelling piece of evidence demonstrating subject 1s participation in this scheme is an ema il dated august 2006 from an esaro vendor to subject 1s brother this email reads ref mail from subject 1 that approx 3000 tender we can use mss kenya for that one ask subject 1 to brin g the big dogs the 30 million sic deals when do you get back7 this email is reference to subject 1s passing information to vendors in an attempt to steer contracts to pe rsons with whom she has personal relationship 12 the bids esaro received were therefor not from either wellknown or reputable local or international suppliers or from longstanding esaro vendors used prior to subject 1s employment rather bids were submitted by companies that were in effect brokers for actual suppliers operati ng from post office boxes and mobile telephones in certain instan ces the post office box number these companies gave out was in fact the same number as subject 1 had indicated as her own on an employment form for the equally striking is the fact that the telephone number utilized by these companies in transactions w ith esaro was exactly that of the mobile phone issued to subject 1 herself by unops likewise th laptop computer on which correspondence from these companies to esaro was drafted was subject 1s own issued to her in professional capacity by unops and kept in the private home sh shared with subject 2 13 posing as independent companies subject 2 and his associates arranged to rig bid prices for unops contracts this process wa s facilitated by subj ect 1 who would feed her husband confidential information to wh ich she was privy only as result of her position at esaro the evidence of wi despread and prolonged pattern of fraud includes admissions of fraudul ent activity by partic ipants in the scheme as well as material links between the companies and s ubject 2 and often subject 1 moreover the task force identified an array of evidence indicating close association between the various companies bidding for esaro contr actsnamely identical or linked owners and employees shared contact addresses as well as various similarities in appearance between the different companies bids suggest ing that they were dr afted using the same template or by the same person as result of this fra udulent scheme subject 1 and her husband subject 2 derived personal benefit from these companies contracts with unops since either i subject 2 owned or maintained proprietary interest in the company awarded an esaro c ontract or ii company associated with subject 2 7 james ochola email to subject 1s brother 18 august

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 4 andor subject 1 was awarded contract only after paying kic kback to either or both of them 14 in addition to this scheme the task fo rce identified two other methods by which subject 2 corrupted the esaro procurement pr ocess first subject 2 would obtain the invoices issued by the freight forwarding comp any joes freighters nd increase the bid price as it appeared on the invoices prior to submission to esar for payment the result of this scheme was that subject 2 poc keted the difference betw een the original cost set by joes freighters and the arti ficially elevated cost he ffered in its place second subject 2 routinely requested and in some cases received commission payments for work by vendors including kenelec supplies and zambezi investments on their contracts with esaro although the task fo rce has not yet been able to determine whether the award of these contracts was its elf result of fraud these payments to subject 2 clearly represent breach by th vendor of the unops general terms and conditions of contract as well as conflict of interest for subject 1 given that subject 2 is her husband 15 on more general level this report also details how the esaro procurement system failed to prevent subject 1 and her husband from systematically executing this scheme and thereby defrauding the organisation this was in part due to systems failures in the structure of esaro lack of oversig ht by subject 1s direct supervisors as well as number of esaro staff members fail ure to report the sconduct they knew or suspected was occurring iii allegations 16 in its interim report the task force identified four depasse contracts totalling us15441 awarded as consequence of scheme executed by subject 1 and her husband subject 2 this final report discusse s an additional eight contracts that the task force believes were ach ieved through fraud and corrup tion these eight contracts were awarded to six companies each of whic h is associated with subject 2 in addition this report discusses bject 2s connections to four othe r companies the total value of the contracts awarded to these ten companie s is in excess of us800000 as result of subject 1s actions it is quite possible that the majority of esaro contracts awarded to local companies during the year 2006 were in some way tainted with fraud irregularity and corruption 17 this report originally stems from complaint to the task force regarding procurements for the united nations interna tional strategy for disaster reduction this complaint included allegations that certain procurement exercises had been manipulated to favour companies connected to subject 2 in order to ensure that these companies achieved contracts with the organisation it was further alleged that subject 2 had received material benefit in connection with the award of these contracts as set forth herein after thorough investigation the task force has determined that these complaints are meritorious oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 5 18 in addition the complainant alleged ongoing systematic fraud at esaro carried out by subject 1 and subject 2 who collude d with several united nations vendors to assist them in obtaining unops contractsthereby imprope rly inflating the price of

information or witnesses to support their explanation 23 31 it is absolutely clear that subject 1 was afforded all of these rights in connection with the investigation throughout the investigation process the task force ensured that subject 1 was i made aware of new inst ances of misconduct that arose during the investigationnamely that the task force wa s investigating the aw ard of contracts to several companies in addition to the allegations initially brought against her concerning the award of contracts for the provision of goods and services to the united nations international strategy

interviews with subject 1 covered several issues including those surrounding contracts awarded to multiple companies in addition to the isdrrelated allegations the interviews covered the actions of all companies dealt with in this report 33 in her very first interview subject 1 was made aware that the task forces inquiry was of general nature and did not pertain to any one specific allegation24

interviews with the task for ce subject 1 was asked about multiple contracts awarded to several of these eleven companies she was also asked about her knowledge of the many individu als who figure prominently in this report since they are connected to these companies and to her hus band the procurement exercises discussed during the interviews concerne d those for both unops itself as well as for other united nations agencies including isdr in additi on during interviews with the task force investigators showed to subject 1 key documents relied on in this report and solicited her comments on them 37 further subject 1 prior to the issuan ce of the report was provided with an adverse finding letter which set out the proposed findings of the task force and 25 subject 1 interview 23

indication of the scope of the investigat ion including the task forces intention to report on her and notice of the intention of the task force to report upon her husbands links to multiple companies the purpose of this notice letter wa s to solicit and consider her views prior to the issuance of the report and comply with due process obligations in that regard the letter invited subject 1 to comment on ny of the proposed findings subject 1 did submit response to the adverse finding lett er but nowhere in this response did she complain that she was not aware of the scope of the task forces inquires 38 moreover the adverse finding letter also offered subject 1 the opportunity both to submit any evidence she wished for the task forces consideration and to make available for her review any of the document s on which the task force intended to rely subject 1 failed to avail herself of either of these opportunities 39 subject 1 cannot have had ny doubt after these processe s that the scope of the investigation covered much more than simply the allegation regarding isdr in nairobi specifically that the investigation covered all of her procurement activities as unops staff member in 2006 and focused on the actions of the companies detailed in this report in particular the investigation dealt with th associations of these companies with her husband as well as the procurement processes which lead to esaro having awarded contracts to these companies further subj ect 1 was afforded the opportunity to explain her actions and respond to all allegations brought against her includ ing the opportunity to present additional evidence explana tions information or witnesses vii methodology 40 in december 2006 task force investigators interviewed witness who asserted that subject 1 an operations assistant with esaro was committing systematic fraud by improperly steering contracts to companie s owned by or associated with subject 2 26 it was also learned at that time that subject 1 was planning to take an imminent leave of absence in light of this fact as well as because the task force was aware that staff members allegedly involved in corruption maintained ongoing access to relevant files the task force secured evidence including doc uments and computer hard drives and conducted preliminary interviews in additi on investigators later examined voluminous forensic data electronic media and hardcopy documents the use of forensic tools has been invaluable to this investigation 41 the task force has also sought coopera tion from relevant vendors their representatives and their principals on number of occasions cooperation was not provided this caused certain difficulties in collecting pertinent in formation and delayed the investigation as stated sewhere in this report as well as in other reports issued by the task force it is important to emphasize that the task force has limited coercive powers and lacks any ability to issue subpoe nas the vendors and other third parties involved in investigations ofte n view their cooperation as vo luntary therefore the task force must depend on their freely given consent when seeking their assistance

trading bid submission was sent in an email from thomas ochola102 however it is important to note that thomas and james ochola are brothers mr ochola was therefore bidding on the contract against his

subject heading of quote on this same day mr onyango also sent an email to mr ja mes ochola of mss kenya with the identical subject heading of quote104 from this information the task force surmises that mr oyango was sending metro tradings bid for the unops contract to mr ochola who was representing mss kenyaie the two ve ndors were sharing bid information with each other 103 the task forces belief that the ve ndors mss kenya and metro trading were colluding with one another with respect to bid prices is furt her supported by the fact that the responses to the original bid request form provided by mss kenya and by metro trading were both sent only to subject 1 and not copied to her superiors when mr ochanda one of the other invitees replied to the original bid s ubmission declining to bid he sent his reply not only to subject 1 but also copied her superiors the fact that mss kenya and metro trading both failed to copy subject 1s superiors in their responses suggests that subject

as approximately half of those quoted by the other bidders including mss kenya for four of the seven items to be procured despite read technologies lower quotes subject 1 recommended that ms s kenya be awarded the entire contract citing as her rationale the fact that mss kenya was the only company to bid for all seven requested items108 106 despite subject 1s recommendation that esaro award the

looked to other comp anies for comparable estimates which were approximately one quarter of the price asked by mss kenya115 111 on arrival the container sent by mss kenya was found to be of poor

at cost of kes 370904 us5155 mss kenyas quote for the container was three times as expensive as comparable containers given mss kenyas massive inflation of the pr ice of the container the portfolio

expresse d to subject 1 his disbelief that the two companiesnamely mss kenya and microsun nd solutions plc were the same in particular he questioned why esaro was as king microsun and solutions plc in dubai to provide shipping container given that it was an it company according to the companys website121 in light of these concerns aro management then ordered the containers removal and the cancellation of mss kenyas bid122 113 subject 1 however raised concerns ove r the decision to cancel the order claiming both that it was unfair to expect m ss kenya to bear the cost of removing the container and that there might be legal consequences123 in addition she contacted the procurement specialist at unops procurem ent headquarters in copenhagen for his opinion on whether esaro should cancel its contract with mss kenya for the container124 unops staff in copenhagen repl ied to subject 1s inquiry by recommending that the esaro office negotiate with the vendor however in response to this recommendation the po rtfolio manager at esaro not ed that he had tried dealing with the vendor mss keny but it seems to be one man show that is operated from his house and cell phone125 114 ultimately the portfolio manager and project manager agreed to accept the container from mss kenya but at lower price than the company had originally quoted126 however in the end esaro organized rebid

he had knowledge as to when the company was set up in kenya or as to the identity of kenya repr esentative of the company 132 119 however the evidence demonstrates that mr ocholas assertions are

at time either during the bidding proce ss or the subsequent performan ce of the contract or when she intervened to dissuade esaro from can celling the contract with mss kenya did subject 1 disclose

light of the evidence presented above it is evid ent that subject 1s husband subject 2 is closely tied to mss kenya and is li kely its principal owne r the evidence to support this conclusion is multipronged first the company shares the same post office box as both the depasse company owned by subject 2 and as subject 1 herself168 second in its corresponden ce with esaro mss kenya identifies subject 2s and subject 1s home telephone number as its own169 third the companys operations were at least in part run from subject 1s i ssued laptop located in the private home she shared with her husband 134 this conclusion is also supported by subj ect 1s material omissions and false statements about this subject not only did subject 1 fail to disclo to esaro staff her husbands close ties with mss kenya but she also took advantage of her position at the organisation to steer unops c ontracts to this company i ndeed there is evidence to suggest that mr ochola and s ubject 1s brother were rely ing on subject 1 to provide them with unops contracts for example an email from mr ochola to subject 1s brother in august 2006 regarding gps indicate s that subject 1 was passing information regarding esaro contracts to mr ochola the fact that mr ochola was involved with mss kenyas activities is highlighted in an em ail that he sent to subject 1s brother we can use mss kenya for that one another project 170 mr ocholas use of we in relation to using mss kenya suggests that he and subject 1s brother are both associated with the company 135 the bidding process for the contract awarded to mss kenya was further compromised when subject 1 issued the rfq to four individuals who were all in some way connected socially to her as well as to ach other one of the companies included in the bidding process mss kenya was cont rolled by subject 2 and james ochola another company metro trading included in the bidding process was represented by thomas ochola james ocholas brother171 136 the totality of the circumstances includi ng the family connecti on between at least two of the bidders for the esaro cont ract along with s ubject 1s husbands involvement with mss kenya another bidder as well as the excessive price quoted and the poor performance rendered by that compan all portray deeply compromised and tainted bidding process 168 mss kenyas po box as used in quotations invoices and

the company 1 stationary ct with esaro210 187 when task force investigators presente d subject 1 with the techbiz delivery note with her husbands signaturethereby confirming that subject 2 had indeed purchased stationery for company 1 to suppl to isdrshe stated that she could not recognize whether or not this was her husband s signature on the note the task force investigator then asked subject 1 how long she had been married to subject 2 she replied that they had been married for two years in the view of the task force in light of both the duration of her marriage to subject 2 and of subject 1s multiple misrepresentations to investigators in the past as detailed extensively in the interim 205 staff member 14 interviews 27 february and 1 march 2007 206 company representative 1 interview 7

report and herein subject 1s statement th at she would not recognize her husbands signature after two years of marriage is not credible211 the task force evaluation 188 after thorough and independent review of the evidence presented the task force finds that company representative 1s description of events with respect to the award and performance of the company 1 sta tionary supply is cred ible and corroborated by independent evidence several pieces of evidence discusse d above corroborate company representative 1s testimony that i subject 2 set the bid pr ices ii subject 2 was involved in the performance of the contr act and iii that subject 2 collected kes 450000 approximately us6500 kickback from the deal further in stark contrast to subject 1s contention that she had know ledge either of her husbands business connection with company representative 1 and company 1 or of scheme to defraud the organisation the evidence located by task force investigators also supports the conclusion that subject 1 was both aware of and an active participant in her husbands scheme in connection with the company 1 contract 189 the evidence which supports company repr esentative 1s description of events and subject 1 and subject 2s involvement in corrupting the bid process includes several documents that company representative 1 provi ded to the task force these documents record the involvement of i depasse and aero logistics in the suppl of the stationary ii the involvement of subject 2 and joshua musyokanzei in the bi dding process iii the payment of the kickback to subject 2 iv th fact that subject 1 distributed unops documents to her husband and his associat v the striking similarities in the handwriting of the bids of co mpany 1 and rison grace and vi the fact that rison grace does not appear to be re company further the fact that evidence exists of rfq having been sent out to any other companies suggests that other independent companies were invited to bid on the contract rather subject 1 instructed her husband to obtain stationery needs assessment this assessment purportedly from company 1 was sent to subject 1 in an email entitled passexls this is noteworthy since the name of her husbands company is depasse fo r this reason the task force draws the inference that company 1s bid was connected to subject 2 190 moreover subject 1s violated esaro policy both by signing lpo for more than us2500 without holding lpc and by faili ng to ever alert anyone at esaro of her husbands business association with either company representative 1 or mr musyoka 191 the task force was unable to locate any evidence that the staff members mentioned by subject 2 to company representati ve 1 personally received benefit from this contractthat is with the

bids for the curtains were engineered by mr and mrs koech and that subject 1 was an active participant in steering the esaro contracts to paso s ubject 1s participation in this scheme is apparent from the fact that originally subj ect 1 presented only the paso bid for the curtains contract to the budget fficer only later at the sp ecific request of the finance staff did she provide two further bids

office furniture at local retail show r oom antarc which had supplied the material to lins consult at approximately twenty five to fifty percent of the cost of what lins consult charged the organisation263 mrs koech originally declined to discuss with the task force details of where she sourced the furniture or her profit margins however at later point in time she then confirmed that she had bought the furniture from antarc when task force investigators asked mrs ko ech about the huge markups in her bids as compared to the price she had paid at antarc she said she knew through her contacts at antarc that this company wa s not bidding for the esaro cont ract she then stated i was just trying my luck since accord ing to mrs koech it was well known that contract with the united nations can change ur life she later said she had increased her markup even further when asked to rebid to reflect the commercial risk of dealing with isdr staff who were pr one to changing their minds264 thus lins made huge profit at the expense of the organisation whic h could have purchased furniture from the same supplier antarc for vastly less than the price ultimate ly paid to lins ms koech admitted to having greatly profited from the isdr contract265 239 task force investigators were unable to locate any evidence that antarc was invited to bid for the isdr contract instea d the four bids from companies other than antarc included in the bid analysis arri ved at esaros doorstep without subject 1 having engaged in any prior solic itation process indeed all four bidders appear to be linked and at least three of the bids appear to have been prepared by the same person see discussion above detailing similarities in the bi ds in each case the bids were not submitted by furniture firms but rather from brokers all connected in some way to the koechs the result of this collusion was th at the organisation paid huge sum for the same furniture it could have bought directly from furniture supplier eg antarc for fraction of the cost indeed an official in the unops finance office recalled having been concerned that esaro was receiving bids from companies other than from known furniture suppliers 266 moreover as detailed in the fo llowing section there is evidence to suggest that subject 1 recei ved kickbacks for steering contracts to the koechs 240 the bid

deal involving his and his wifes companies in addition mr koech denied any knowledge of rooks prices for furniture269 241 the owner of rook stated th at his normal business is in it consulting and the provision of aquariums he claimed that he sought out subject 1 in order to inquire whether esaro had requirement for an aq uarium according to him subject 1 informed him that esaro had need of an aquarium but asked him if he would be prepared to bid for furniture the owner of rook also stated that he informed mr and mrs koech that he was bidding on the furn iture contract after ving overheard them discussing the furniture deal in their office nd comparing suppliers he told the koechs that he was bidding out of good manners he denies collusion with mr and mrs koech regarding the pricing of bids270 242 mr samay singh represen tative of centurion ngineering and builders limited centurion another bidder for th furniture contract claimed that centurion was not aware of the identities of the other vendors who bid on the contract however mr singh confirmed that cent urion had an existing busine ss relationship with lins consult prior to the bidding exercise furthe r mr singh stated that he knows the owner of lins consult very well having worked with and for this company in the past271 243 mrs koech claims to have informed subject 1 of the connection between lins and paso upon submitting those companies bids for the furniture mrs koech told the task force that she priced both bids hers elf but offered differe nt range of furniture in each companys bid272 although she tried to explain the different pricing as related to the fact that paso carried more expensiv range of furniture th an lins consult her statement amounts to an admission that she fi xed the bid prices submitted by lins and pasothereby corrupting the procurement ex ercise when coupled with the other evidence of bid collusion as well as indirect benefits received by subject 1 for securing the contract with esaro the evidence s uggests that both mrs koech and subject 1 colluded together to steer the contract to lins 244 according to subject 1 lins consult was represented in its dealings with esaro by ruth munyiri273 in fact as noted above the co mpany is owned by mrs koech the owner of paso who presented herself to the task force as having conducted transactions with esaro on behalf of both paso and

paso and lins consult are both owned by the koechs th two other bidders centurion engineering and rook consulting also have links to the koechs particularly compelling is the evidence that three of the four bids submitted wi th regards to this contract appear to have been drafted by the same individualmo st likely mrs koech since she told investigators that she had drafted the paso and lins consult bids moreover mr and mrs koech admitted that information was sh ared between their companies with respect to unopsesaro bids including an admissi on by mrs koech that she dictated the prices for both the paso and lins consult furniture bids 246 subject 1s participation includes the fact that i she was the unops officer who received and processed the isdr request and handled the procurement ii she drafted the bid analysis and re viewed the strikingly similar bids and iii she failed to submit the bids for lpc review both initiall and when the contract price was amended further as will be demonstr ated below there is evidence to suggest that subject 1 received kickbacks from mrs koech for st eering contracts to the lins and paso companies c kickbacks provided by paso and lins consult 247 mrs koech did business with subject 1 in personal capacity for example in 2006 mrs koech supplied subject 1 with curt ains and lamp fittings for the latters private home276 mrs koech claims that subject 1s husband subject 2 eventually paid for the curtains kes 170000 or approximately us2300 but that he never paid for the lamp fittings she denied giving subject 1 special price on these goods due to the latters position at esaro 277 despite the task forces re quest that mrs koech provide proof that subject 1 paid market rate fo r the curtains and lamp fittings mrs koech failed to provide the task force with either breakdown of costs or sufficient proof of payment by subject 1 or subject 2278 248 mrs koechs contention that she sold curtains to subject 1 directly contradicts subject 1s denial that she d ever bought curtains from mrs koech this contradiction indicates that one of the two women made false statement to investigators 275 flat 19 kp flats milimani rd and po

addresses used by the two companies283 in response subject 1 told the task force that she was not bothered about this connection since paso was providing curtains while lins consult was providing furniture further she stated that she th checked the two companies incorporation documents but failed to note any further links between them 252 the task force requested details from mrs koech regarding the curtain contract as well as breakdown of costs of the curtaining provided to subject 1 in order to assess whether subject 1 paid market rates for these goods or received an in direct benefit from mrs koech as result of th latter securing contract with esaro mrs koech provided the task force with the invoice pur chase order and statement which purports to show payment from subject

failed to provide other information requested by the task force such as documentation of costs incurred for providing subject 1 with curtaining for the latters priv ate home this documentation was requested in order to ascertain whether subject 1 had received curtaining from mrs koech subject 1 claims that she did not and if so whether she had paid fair market price for the goods provided ie she had rece ived inappropriate benefit from mrs koech this failure on the part of mrs koech to produ ce corroboration to support her claims to the task force taken together with subject 1s denial of ever having received the curtains as well as the totality of the facts and circumstances of the other matters discussed herein gives rise to concern that an inappr opriate benefit was provided to

also complained to subject 1 that he believed compfit was generally inflating its prices 325 293 the unops management concerns about an excessive price charged by compfit were justified whereas mr

representatives from amiran questioned subject 3 about submitting bid for the contr act ultimately awarded to compfit they were told by subject 3 that bidding exercise was taking place327 subject 3 confirmed that he was asked about bidding by amiran however he contended that subject 1 had failed to inform him of the bid and his response to amiran was therefore truthful with respect to his knowledge at that time328 294 mr waigwa denied to the task force that he had either colluded with subject 2 to set the prices of the bids submitted or had passed any benefit to subject 2 in connection with esaro awardi ng the contract to compfit329 whereas there is evidence that mr waigwa colluded with subject 2 to rig bid prices the task force was unable to identify evidence that subject 2 or subject 1 received benefit from mr waigwa for this contract 295 the task force found evidence to suggest that this contract award was ever presented to the lpc as required by esaro regulations since the va lue of the contract was in excess of us2500 296 the task force did however identify evidence that subject 1 pushed for expedited payment of compfits invoices330 the task force evaluation 297 the award of the motorola radios contract to compfit was the result of compromised bidding process orchestrated by subject 2 specifically subject 2 as the owner of mss kenya colluded with the owners

with him she also included quote from her husbands company mss kenya in the bid analysis without disclosing to esaro staff that she knew that her hus band subject 2 owned mss kenya the contention that she was aware of her husband s ties to mss kenya at this time is supported by the fact that the mss kenya quotation for radios is dated 14 september 2006 on the same day subject 1 had sent atlas

page 80 303 according to the bid analysis esaro recei ved bids from all three companies however task force investigators were only able to locate bids from two companies compfit and savanis in the files in ddition the bid analysis was not signed until 8 november 2006337 304 on 17 october 2006 subject 1 noted to the unops project manager jack klassen the portfolio manager staff member 5 and the operations manager staff member 7 that savanis was the cheapes t bid although subject 1 recommended savanis for the award in th initial bid analysis she ad ded however that the company had not bid for all items savanis had not bid for an engraver nevertheless she requested that the portfolio manager not split the order be tween two different companies for logistics purposes and reminded him that the rfq required strict technical compliance which savanis did not meet338 305 therefore the bid analysis prepared by s ubject 1 was adjusted to reflect the fact that savanis had not bid on all items in particular the company had not bid on an electronic engraver w ith respect to the items for which savanis had not entered bid the company was listed in the bid analysis as having bid price eq ual to that of the highest bid submitted by the other bidders for the remaining items for which all companies had placed bid savanis bid was kes 125787 approximately us1795 as compared to compfits bid of kes 156261 approximately us2230 thus compfits price was total of kes 30474 pproximately us435 more expensive than that of savanis339 306 few days later subject 1 requested inst ructions as to how to proceed with the bids from the portfolio manager staff member 5 she also noted that the total value of the contract was below us2500therefore there was need for lpc review340 she was instructed by the portfolio mana ger staff member 5 to proceed following procurement rules341 307 the task force notes that the proc urement rules as found in the unops operations manual do recommend against spl itting orders where the cost savings are below us2500 however the task force beli eves that subject 1s motivation was to benefit her husbands associate rather than to save the organisation money342 337

report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 81 308 in support of this contention is the fact that subject 1 s statement that there was need for lpc review since the bid was below us2500 was incorrect at this time kes 199962 equated to approximatel us2739over the us2500 threshold for lpc review 343 apparently the decision was made with the consent of staff member 7 the operations manager to aw ard the bid to compfit as the next lowest most responsive bidder344 309 compfit was awarded contract in the amount of kes 199962345 310 other esaro staff members again raised c oncerns not only that the prices quoted by compfit were excessive but also that th engraverthe item which more than any other had led to the award of the entire contract to compfitwas unsuitable the item presented by compfit was in fact not an engraver but rotary tool since this was unsuitable for use as an engraver compfit ffered price for replacement to the project manager jack klassen however mr klassen complained that compfit tried to charge the same price for supplying considerably ss sophisticated model than that which the company had originally bid upon he also stioned whether there might have been bid collusion thus he recommended that aro conduct market price survey to establish fair prices for the requested items 346 311 subject 1 responded to mr klassens concerns with the claim that she had approached the three most relia ble stationery shops available347 on the one hand text book centre and savanis book centre appear to be wellestablis hed suppliers of books and stationery on the othe r hand from where subject 1 derived her confidence in compfit as reliable statione ry supplier is unknow n in light of the fact that unlike savanis and text book centre compfit was not wellestablished as supplier of stationary 312 ultimately the new price offered by compfit for the engraver was rejected by the portfolio manager staff member 5 as far beyond market prices348 the lpo amount 343 esaro uses the official united nations exchange rate in its calculations for october 2006 when subject 1 drafted the bid analysis the official united nations rate was kes 73 to the united states dollar in november 2006 when the award to compfit was recommended the official united nations rate was kes 7195 to the united states dollar at this time the value of this contract in us dollars would be us2779 even applying

joes freighters took over all customs clearing jobs fo r esaro from frankline and has been doing business with unops without any contract joe s freighters did not receive purchase order but rather the

that she had not read the correspondence address on quota tion submitted by mss nor had she ever looked at the addresses listed on th is correspondence see figure above575 504 in the interim report the task force cri ticized subject 1 for her failure to follow several procurement rules 505 in her response to the interim report s ubject 1 claimed that she was not aware of the directions by the then regional dire ctor of the necessity to submit to lpc procurement of any amount over us2500 until late october 2006ie much later than staff member 11 and others claimed that esaro had instituted this policy 576 further subject 1 claimed to have herself initiated the process of sending contracts over us2500 to the lpc and ensured that it the policy was implemented by the unops office however subject 1s claim seems highly unlikely given that staff member 11 informed the task force that when he questioned her as to why she was not sending certain procurements over the us 2500 threshold to the lpc subject 1 responded that even this threshold was too low577 506 subject 1 contends in her response that she was unaware of the us2500 threshold rule for contracts prior to late october 2006 sh told investigators when initially interviewed however that she was in fact aware that esar rules required that she refer to the lpc all contracts between us2500 and us90000 throughout her tenure at esaro578 in addition she stated that she was aware that the normal procurement procedure was to issue an official request for quotation then to have it signed by portfolio manager and finally to request quotations from multiple vendors579 507 moreover subject 1 claimed in her re sponse that the genesis for the local unopsesaro rule that procurements bove us2500 should be reviewed by the lpc was in fact her own the new rule of submission to lpc of goods under us 30000 to us 2500 was my idea and only endorsed on the 11th of august 2006 by mr randall then in november we had formal draft form for submission 508 subject 1s contention that she initiated this new rule is simply not true according to staff member 11 chair of the lpc at esaro in 2004 esaro held planning week and decided upon us2500 thres hold amount for contract to go to the lpc580 number of workshops were subsequently held between 2004 and july 2006 to train staff on this new policy staff memb er 6 confirmed staff member 11s testimony and explained to the task force that in lig ht of these training sessions he had doubt that all esaro staff members were aware th at bids over 2500 must be submitted to the 575 subject 1 interviews 23 and 25 february 2006 576 indeed staff member 11s testimony is corroborated by that of several other esaro staff members at that time see eg subject 3 interview 22 february 2007

aware of esaro requirements regard ing procurement contracts involving over us2500 indeed as described above subj ect 1 did attend various unopsesaro training sessions 509 subject 1 claimed that staff members at esaro were trying to set her up as she was not popular582 the overwhelming evidence gathered by the task force renders such theory beyond the realm of any legitimate possibility 510 the task force requested that subj ect 1 voluntarily provide information regarding finances for herself and for he r husband she has provided some degree of cooperation but has ceas ed responding to requests583 511 although subject 1 did provide bank stat ements from her barclays bank account she has failed to provide furthe r details of the transactions for this account to the task force despite multiple requests by the task force that she provide investigators with copies of the cheques listed in the bank statements subj ect 1 has never produced these copies similarly subject 1 wrote in an email to the task force that she grants the task force authorization to access her unfcu account records nonetheless this email was insufficient documentation for the unfcu to grant the task force access to her account records thus the task force requested that subject 1 write directly to the unfcu in order to confirm that she had authorized the task force to access the records subject 1 has not confirmed to unfcu her authorization as requested584 512 subject 1 has repeatedly claimed that she and her husband had only two bank accounts however the task force is aw are of third personal

had at least kes 600000 in it at one time585 513 further her husband subject 2 also has at least one additional bank account for his company aero logistics subject 1 fa iled to provide the details of this aero logistics account as well as those for accounts of depasse and mss kenya as per multiple requests made to her by the task force rather subject 1 stated that she could not provide this

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 124 514 in summary subject 1s claims that she was unaware of her husbands links to esaro vendors and contracts cannot be take n at face value when presented by the task force with evidence implicating her in the scheme to defraud the organisation subject 1 maintained her position of ignoran ce and provided implausible explanations moreover in view of the totality of the evidence laid out in this report subject 1 was not only fully aware of her husbands links to esaro contracts and vendors but also an active participant in the scheme to fraud the organisation by securing esaro contracts for several companie s to which subject 2 was tied xii findings 515 the task force incorporates by referen ce the findings of the interim report in connection with the award of four c ontracts to depasse logistics 516 the task force further finds that unops operations assistant subject 1 her husband subject 2 and others known and unknown hereinafter coconspirators participated in scheme to fraudulently steer unops cont racts to companies owned controlled or associated with subject 2 including mss kenya company 1 joymart enterprises compfit paso lins consu lt and depasse logistic s in violation of procurement financial and staff rules as well as criminal law the goals and object of the conspiracy centered on an effo rt by the coconspirators to favour these companies with respect to at least eight separate c ontracts awarded by unopsesaro in 2006 in addition to the four steered to depasse the scheme corrupted the contract selection exercises in unops and resulted in lack of integrity and transparency in the procurement process 517 the scheme was accomplished thr ough the submission of purportedly independent bids from companies which appeared to be legitimate competitors but in fact were colluding with one another and were entities in which subject 1 and her husband were controlling or associated with friends and family of subject 1 and subject 2 owned represented and controlled other aro vendors it was further part of the scheme that subject 1 assisted these comp anies to become unopsesaro vendors and steered solicitations to selected bidders owned by he r husband or connected to him and his associates in furtherance of the sche subject 1 subject 2 and their associates then submitted fictitious proposals on behalf of purportedly competing vendors the competing proposals were in fact illegitimate as they resulted from efforts of collusion orchestrated by subject 2 the evidence identif ied in furtherance of the scheme includes apparent connections between the vendors and subject 1 and subject 2 which are evident from the esaro documentation gathered and re viewed by the task force similarly the bid documents reviewed show striking similarities evidencing bid rigging in furtherance of the scheme subject 1 ensu red that the

create fictitious bid analyses subject 1 also avoided the oversig ht procedures such as lpc review once awarded subject 2 was an activeif covert participant in the pe rformance of esaro contracts both those awarded to his ow n companies and those with which he was associated 518 subject 1s participation in the scheme wa s integral to its ccess subject 1 unops staff member with responsibilities for unopsesaro procurements and in position to influence the process engaged in acts designed to further the scheme to achieve the contracts and obtain pa yment from the organisation 519 in the interim report the task for ce found that subject 1 had in early 2006 shortly after she was employed by unops in itially instructed subject 3 the then procurement assistant to pass contracts to her husbands company depasse logistics later once subject 1 became the facto procurement officer she personally controlled which companies received requests for quotatio ns during the solicita tion process the task force finds that in furtherance of this scheme subject 1 would send requests to her husbands private email address as well as the email addresses of companies which he owned or with which he was associated 520 in addition the task force finds that subj ect 1 facilitated the scheme by means of the following actions or inactions i her drafting and signing bid analyses which recommended that esaro award contracts to companies owned by or associated with her husband ii her failure to submit contract s to the lpc for review and to adhere with other proper procurement procedures in the aw ard of contracts iii her recommendation that esaro award contracts to companies which were not the cheapest but were associated with her husband or his associ ates iv her imprope r disclosure of unops documentation to vendors v her processing of invoices and documents with her own po box and telephone numbers on them for ms s kenya and depasse vi her defence of companies connected to her husband even af ter they had failed to meet the required standards vii her failure to disclose to any esaro staff the links between her husband and the majority of the vendors addressed in this final report and viii her failure to engage in proper and fair solicitation pro cesses for the contracts concerning the companies identified herein which were associated with her husband 521 subject 1 was issued unops laptop to ssist in her work which was improperly used by other persons not employed by ps or esaro including her husband subject 2 in furtheranc of the scheme to defraud the organisation 522 subject 1 was an active participant in th scheme when viewed cumulatively her actions to secure contracts for companie s associated with or owned by her husband demonstrate that she acted with the intent to defraud the organi sation and improperly favour the subject companies in light of th plethora of evidence c onnecting subject 1 to this scheme it is evident th at subject 1 was more than mere innocent actor but an active participant 523 subject 2 subject 1s husband also played central role in the scheme subject 2 owned aero logistics company whic h shared contact details and employees

bids by various bidders on the sa contracts in the case of the company 1s stationary contract comp any representative 1 supplied cogent and credible evidence that subject 2 had rigged the bids further the task for ce finds that proper inference can be drawn from the totality of evidence monstrating that subjec t 2 played pivotal role in rigging bids submitted for additiona l contract awards this evidence includes subject 2s links to the vari ous individuals and companies that submitted purportedly independent bids for esaro contracts as well as ma ny of the individuals who represented bidders indeed many of thes individuals are associated with aero logistics subject 2s company further number of the biddi ng companies shared contact information with aero logistics th erefore subject 2 and aero logistic were often the central link between various bidders for the same contract 525 subject 2s role in manipulating the bi dding processes is also evidenced by his participation in the actual performance of these contractsthis participation was secretive and was not disclosed by subject 1 to any esaro staff members the task force finds that subject 2 was involved in vendors performa nce of contracts subsequent to esaros awarding contracts to them th is involvement included i sourcing the goods to be supplied ii serving as the liai with esaro for several of the companies iii requesting payment for the companies from esaro and iv collecting payments from the organisation on behalf of several companies 526 the scheme was further accomplished with the participation of other vendors and individuals mss kenya contract 527 the task force finds that mss kenya company owned by subject 2 was awarded contract to provide sea container and it equipment to the kenyan diplomatic police unit it is evident th at mss kenya obtained the contract through corrupt acts the task force has determined that subject 2 along w ith his associates mr james ochola subject 1s br other and mr denis odipo lso director of depasse subject 2s other company created and contro lled mss kenya and used it to exploit an esaro contract 528 the task force finds that subject 1 was aware of her husbands involvement with the company on this contract and assisted him in the execution of this scheme in that regard subject 1 passed information regard ing esaro contracts to james ochola who oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 127 was involved with mss kenya further subj ect 1 compromised the bidding process for the contract ultimately awarded to mss kenya by issuing the rfq to four individuals who were all connected socially to her and to each other in some way one of the email addresses that subject 1 sent the rfq was that of mss kenyanamely mss_kenyayahoocouk 529 subject 1 was an active participant in this process and was well aware that her husbands companyand subject 2 personallywer involved in the bidding exercise in addition to making the initial recommenda tion to award the contract to mss kenya subject 1 also signed for delivery of electrical goods by mss kenya587 subject 1s manipulation of the bidding process as well as her failure to disclose to anyone at esaro that her husband was in fact the owner of the vendor to which the contract was assigned resulted in the orga nisation being supplied with p oor quality overpriced goods by supplier with direct links to her it also resulted in th compromise of the integrity of the process 530 subject 2 was also an active participant in the scheme to steer unops contract to mss kenya acting in association with other known and unknown individuals given the totality of circumstances it is evident that subject 2 owns or controls mss kenya and not only was aware of but so participated as well in th scheme to steer contract to his company the task force additionally relies on the following facts to reach this conclusion i subject 2 established mss kenya ii subject 2 was involved in the subsequent performance of the contract iii mss kenyas c ontact details were identical to those of his other company aero logistics iv the email account mss_kenyayahoocouk to which the original i nvitation to bid was sent was accessed on several occasions using subject 1s united nations laptop computer kept in the private home she shared with her hus band v other documents wh ich included mss in their title were accessed from this computer an d vi subject 2 had ties to the other individuals to which the invi tation to bid was sent 531 the task force finds that mr james ocholavariously also known as kaka and james otienowas involved in mss ke nyas transactions with esaro since mr ochola was involved in establishing mss kenya the task force does not find credible mr ocholas denial of any involveme nt with the company further mr ochola and subject 1s brother relied on subject 1 to pr ovide them with information regarding unops contracts mr ochola in turn used this information and proposed to subject 1s brother the use of mss kenya to bid on certain unops contracts 532 in addition the task force finds that metro trading colluded with mss kenya sharing bid information with each other this information was sent by mr tom onyango of metro trading to mr james ochola the task force understands that mr tom onyango is mr thomas ochola brother of mr james ochola 533 mr denis odipo was involved in the blishment of mss kenya but otherwise his role if any in obtaining the mss kenya dp u contract is unknown to the task force similarly there is evidence that mr bl uye haddis owner and ceo of the parent 587 receiving and inspection reports for mss kenya deliveries 12 and 13 october 2006 oios procurement task force

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 128 company microsun and solutions plc based in dubai was involved in any corrupt activities 534 the contract awarded to mss kenya was initially for kes 603704 us8261 however the actual amount paid was kes 232800 us3235 as the delivery of the sea container by mss kenya was cancelled by unops precise calculation can be made as to the actual loss incurred by the organi sation since in this instance goods were delivered by mss kenya the task force fi nds that the payment made to mss kenya indirectly benefited unops staff member bject 1 since it was made to company owned by her husband as such this payment represents breach of warranty b c ompany 1 contract 535 company 1 was awarded contract to s upply the isdr office with six months worth of stationery supplies the process was tainted by corrupt acts as set for the herein 536 there is evidence of inappr opriate links between depasse and company 1 prior to esaros award of the stationary contract to company 1 an email attaching the original stationary assessm ent sent from company 1s email address included an attachment entitled passe xldoc subject 1 received this assessment and forwarded it to isdr second the task force finds that subject 2 and company representative 1 together with the assist ance of mr musyoka prepared two earlier fictitious bids in the names of the compan ies depasse and company 1 while subject 1 had draft of the company 1 bid the task force found evidence that she received the bids in final form however it can reasona bly be deduced based upon totality of the circumstances that the impetus for these two bids was the transmission of information by subject 1 to subject 2 regarding isdrs n eeds indeed compa ny representative 1 was in possession of original unops documenta tion concerning the requisition as well as an unops email subject 1 inappropriately passed these unops documents to persons unconnected to the organisation for an unkno wn reason the two final versions of the bids appear not to have been considered nonetheless the two documents indicate an intention by depasse and company 1 and their respective owners subject 2 and company representative 1 to engage in bid collusion 537 further the task force finds that comp any representative 1s description of events with respect to the award and performance of the company 1 stationary supply contract is credible the totality of evidence supports company representative 1s testimony that the bids submitted by compan 1 joymart and rison grace were fraudulent that subject 2 set the bid pr ices that subject 2 was involved in the performance of the contrac t and finally that subj ect 2 collected kes 450000 approximately us6500 kickback for his involvement with the deal the evidence also supports the conclusion th at subject 1 was not only aware of but also an active participant in this scheme to defraud the organisation through the stationary contract awarded to company 1 oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 129 538 further the evidence supports the finding that the companies joymart and rison grace were also involved in the bidcollu sion while subject 2s companies depasse and aero logistics were involved in the performance of the contract 539 the evidence supporting company repres entative 1s description of subject 1 and subject 2s involvement in corrupting the bid process include s various documents that company representative 1 presented to th task force these documents record the following i the involvement of both depasse and aero l ogistics in the supply of the stationary ii the involvement of subject 2 and jo shua musyokanzei in the bidding exercise iii company 1s payment of the kick back to subject 2 as well as the fact that subject 1 distributed unops documents to her husband and his ssociates iv the striking similarities in the handwriting of the bids submitted by company 1 and rison grace v the fact that rison grace does not ppear to be real company and vi the lack of evidence of rfq having been sent out to any other independent companies with regards to the absence of evidence of rfq having been issued in fact instead of creating rfq subject 1 simply instructed her husband to obtain stationery needs assessment this assessment purportedly from company 1 was sent to subject 1 in an email entitled passexls th name of her husbands co mpany in addition subject 1s violated esaro policy by signing lp for more than us2500 without holding lpc moreover subject 1 failed to aler t anyone at esaro of her husbands business association with company representative 1 as well as the known associations between subject 2 mr musyoka and company representa tive 1 evidence detailed in this report indicates that these individuals engaged in bid collusion with respect to other unops esaro contracts 540 the involvement of subject 1 and subject 2 in the corruption of bidding exercise for the stationary contract is further co rroborated by the following evidence i that subject 1 and subject 2 simila rly corrupted the aw ard of previous contracts to depasse the competitor bidder in this instance see in terim report and ii following an initial email request from isdr for the supply of office equipment subject 1 immediately produced two strikingly similar bids th bids were from depasse owned by her husband and company 1 owned by company representative 1 longtime friend of her husband 541 the task force did not locate evidence to suggest that any of the staff members mentioned by subject 2 to company represen tative 1 personally received any benefit from this contractthat is with the ex ception of subject 2s wife subject 1 who indirectly benefited as result of the approximately us6500 kickback paid to her husband 542 the value of the contract awarded to and received by company 1 was kes 1624620 us22113 precise calculation can be made as to actual loss incurred by the organisation as result of the fraudulent bidding proce ss leading to this contract since goods were delivered by company 1 at minimum however the loss can be calculated as an amount equivalent to the kickback paid to subject 2namely kes 450000 approximately us6500 further this payment to subject 2 was made in connection with

similarities in the bids submitted by all three vendors for this contract suggest that they were drafted by th same individuals in addition the three biddersjoymart depasse and company 1are linked to one another and maintain associations with subject 2 viewed together and in the context of the other exercises detailed herein the evidence supports c onclusion that the contract was achieved through corrupt acts and collusive fforts by the parties and subject 2 544 the task force finds that subject 1 wa s not only aware that bid collusion had occurred but was an active participant in the effort for example subject 1 sent out the rfq and drafted the bid analysis in addi tion subject 1 was awar that depasse owned by her husband was one of the bi dders for the contract and ne vertheless failed to disclose this conflict of interest to any esaro staff member further subject 1 also failed to alert anyone at esaro of the fact that company representative 1 of company 1 was her husbands friend and business associate 545 subject 2s precise actions nd assistance in the case of this contract award are unclear from the documents found by the task force in the unops files however subject 2s role in submitting the three tainted bids is properly established by preponderance of the evidence the eviden ce supporting this conc lusion includes i subject 2s ownership of depasse one of th bidders who submitted fraudulent bids ii subject 2s relationship with the owner of company 1 company representative 1 iii subject 2s relationship with mr claudio husband of the owner of joymart and iv the fact that depasse and joy mart share fax numbers subject 2s involvement is corroborated by the fact that th is is not the only instance in which the task force has evidence that depasse and company 1 as well as depasse and joymart have collaborated previously in connection with corrupted bidding exercise the numerous other instances of subject 2s involvement in bid rigging with respect to other companies discussed further corroborates this inferen ce of subject 2s involvement with the bid collusion 546 the exact role of joymart its owner joyce k muthoni and her husband mr claudio in the scheme to steer the contract to joymart is unknown the task force was unable to locate evidence of ny payment direct or indirect having been made to subject 1 or subject 2 in connection with the award of this contract nonetheless it is clear that three strikingly similar bids were receive d and processed and that joymart was the beneficiary of bid rigging scheme furthe r joymart received payment

involved in bid collusion or otherwis acted inappr opriately 548 the value of the contract awarded to and received by joymart was kes 1348300 approximately us18350 precise ca lculation can be made as to actual loss incurred by the organisation in this instance as goods were delivered however this company was unjustly enriched by the value of the contract d c ompfit systems contracts 549 compfit has been awarded two unopsesar contracts these contracts were to supply motorola radios and stationary this vendor was so recommended by subject 1 for the award of third co ntract to supply gps equipment 550 there are clear indications of corrupt ac tivity during the bidd ing process for the contract for the supply of gps the task force finds that the bids submitted were manipulated in furtherance of scheme to secure that compfit won the contract the other bids came from subj ect 2s company depasse and from kenelec which was owned by mr claudio relative of compfit s owner mr waigwa ultimately this contract was not awarded to compfit on acc ount of objections raised by other united nations staff members as to the exce ssive prices charged by the company 551 the task force finds two of the bids f rom depasse and kenelec were prepared in collusion to allow the third bid submitted by compfit to win the two alternative bids were clearly drafted from the same mplate one of mr waigwas employees at compfit signed the supposedly competing bid of depasse notably the three bids were all excessive but within the same range resu lting in compfit winning the contract with an overpriced bid further there are strong ties between all three companies the owner of compfit selassie waigwa is close re lative of joseph cla udio the owner of the second bidder kenelec both these individu als met regularly with subject 2 the owner of the third bidder depasse mr waigwa shares offices with subject 2s other company aero logistics mr claudio and mr waigwa both made false statements to the task force about their connections to subject 2 nd to each other these factors are clear indications of collusion and evidence of the existence of the conspiracy 552 the task force finds that subject 1 was aw are of this bid collu sion and assisted in the effort subject 1 copied the rfq to her husbands email address in an email recommending the award to compfit subject 1 attached the bid analysis which listed depasse as one of the bidders although she was aware that depasse was her husbands company subject 1 did not disclose this fact to esaro staff at this or any other time additionally even cursory review of th depasse and kenelec bids would have revealed them to have been draf ted by the same individuals 553 compfit was awarded ct to provide motorola radios to the dpu which it did so at exorbitant prices 554 the task force is of the view that this bid was also tainted nd that subject 2 as owner of mss kenya colluded with the owners of the other bidders to steer the contract oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 132 to mr waigwas company compfit the evidence to support this conclusion includes i mr waigwas initial multiple misrepre sentations to the task force about his relationship with subject 2 nd mr claudio ii subject 2s and mr waigwas regular meetings the sharing of information pertaini ng to this contract between mr waigwa and subject 2 iii compfits involvement in other rigged bids with subject 2s company depasse see discussion of the gps equi pment bid above iv the correspondence between mss kenya and compfit and v th ties between mr ochola of mss kenya and mr john kamau of cp intertrade the third bidder 555 the evidence also supports the conclu sion that subject 1 was aware of and participated in this collusive effort in furt herance of the scheme subject 1 emailed the rfq to her husbands email address as well as the email addresses of companies and individuals associated with him she also included in the bid anal ysis quote from her husbands company mss kenya company sh knew to belong to her husband further she failed to present the contract to the lpc for review 556 the second contract awarded to compfit fo r the supply of stationary to the dpu was also obtained through fraud 557 after thorough review of the evidence presented above the task force concludes that subject 1 intervened to steer th contract for stationary to compfit this conclusion is based on the following evidence i subject 1 sent the rfq to compfit company owned by mr waigwa who has links to her husband and history of bid collusion with her husband on unops contracts ii she recommended the award of the contract to compfit despite the fact that the company was not the cheapest bidder on all items and iii subject 1 did not forwar d the contract to the lpc for review 558 the task force finds that compfit and mr waigwa were aware of and participated in the scheme to steer contracts to compfit mr waigwas participation can properly be inferred from the following eviden ce i mr waigwa as owner of compfit benefited from the scheme ii mr waig wa signed the compfit bid of 22 august 2006 for the gps equipment which was for an excess ive price but matched closely the price of the two other bids that were clearly drafted from the same template iii mr waigwa is related to mr claudio owner of kenelec nd another bidder for the gps equipment iv mr waigwa meets regularly with subject 2 whose companies depasse and mss kenya also bid on the gps equipment and motoro radio contracts and v mr waigwa shared information with subject 2 concerning th motorola radios bids the exact illicit involvement if any of mr waigwa in the third procurement for stationary is unknown 559 the task force finds that subject 2 pa rticipated in the corruption of the procurement process for the awar d of the gps and motorola radios to compfit in both cases he was copied on the rfq by subject 1 and his companies depasse and mss kenya were competing bidders the task fo rce believes that subject 2s involvement in the other instances of bid rigging outlined in this report is further evidence that his and his companies involvement was neither coinci dental nor innocent the involvement of subject 2 if any in the third proc urement for stationary is unknown oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 133 560 mr claudio of kenelec is also believed to have participated in the gps bid rigging mr claudio claims that the signature of hi s name on the gps bid is forgery the task force finds reason to question the veracity of th signature particularly in light of the fact that mr cl audio made false statements to the task force on numerous occasions for example he initially denied that he knew that compfit was owned by his relative mr selassie waigwa 561 the task force finds that all four comp anies depasse mss kenya kenelec and compfit and their owners subject 2 mr claudio and mr waigwa engaged in bid collusion as described herein 562 the task force has evidence that ither subject 1 or subject 2 derived personal benefit from the award of the compf it contracts mr wa igwa denies having provided any benefit to them 563 the precise loss attributable to the corruption of the award of the compfit contracts is difficult to speci fy as goods were suppliedexcept with respect to the stationary contract the engraver was return ed in the case of the gps contract the initial bids did include significantly uplifted prices but the organisation did not incur any loss because the high prices were noted by ps staff prior to the contract having been awarded nonetheless the organisation did suffer harm and therefore incurred financial damages in connection to the two c ontracts awarded to compfit since they were awarded as result of fr audulent bidding process fu rther the companies which achieved these contracts were unjustly enri ched through the abil ity to achieve the contracts l paso and lins consult contracts 564 paso and its sister company lins consult were awarde d unops contracts to supply furniture and curtaining the task for ce finds that these contracts were achieved through corrupt acts subject 1 assisted in this scheme to steer contracts to these companies 565 paso secured two contracts to supply curtains for the esaro offices at greatly marked up prices the task fo rce finds that the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therein demonstrates that the bi ds for the curtains were engineered by mr and mrs koech and that subject 1 was an activ participant in steering the contract to paso paso and the other bidder lins c onsult have shared owners and controllers who admit submitting parallel bids for ot her esaro contracts eg the supply of furniture originally subject 1 presented only the paso bid to the budget officer only later did she provide two further bids there is evidence that proper bid solicitation exercise was conducted or that ither of the two curtaining contracts was presented to the lpc despite their value in excess of us2500 566 after reviewing the eviden ce presented above the task force concludes that subject 1 steered the isdr furnitu re contract to lins consult further all f our bidders in this exercise and in particular the koechs colluded when submitting their bids oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 134 567 two of the bidders paso and lins consult are each owned by the koechs who admitted that their two companies sh ared information with respect to unops esaro bids this includes an admission by mrs koech that she dictated the prices for both the paso and lins consult bids fo r the furniture the two other bidders centurion engineering and rook consulting also have links to the koechs particularly compelling is the evidence that three of the four bids submitted with regards to this contract appear to be drafted by the same individualmost likely mrs koech as she acknowledged to investigators th at she had drafted the paso and lins consult bids 568 subject 1s participation andor acquiescen ce in this scheme is supported by the following evidence i subject 1 was the ps officer who received and processed the isdr request and handled the procurement i i she drafted the bi d analysis and would have reviewed the strikingly similar bids nd iii she failed to submit the bids for lpc review both initially and when the contract price was amended 569 further there is evidence that suggests subject 1 received indi rect benefits from mrs koech in connection to the award of contracts to paso and lins consult evidence exists that subject 1 was supplie d curtaining lighting and furnishings from mrs koech although subject 1 denies receivi ng any curtaining from mrs koech mrs koech claimed that she had suppl ied curtaining to subject 1 nd that it was provided at fair market price mrs koech provided th task force with few documents in support of her contention but the task force finds these to be inconclusive 570 company representative 1 has stated th at subject 2 was paid kes 20000 by the koechs however this evidence is uncorroborated 571 the task force is unable to identify precise monetary amount for the loss incurred by the organisation attributable to th actions of subject 1 in securing contracts for paso and lins consult this does not however mean that there was loss or that it cannot be cal culated the curtains and furnitu re were undoubtedly above market rate therefore the loss can be deemed to be the difference between fair and reasonable price and that char ged by paso and paid by unops the value of any benefits provided to subject 1 and possibly bject 2 can also be said to represent an additional loss to the organisati on as this represents ma rk up on the contract price which absent the corruption woul d not have been paid further as result of these actions the organisation sustai ned additional damages as the integrity of the process was compromised f b icycles for the democratic republic of the congo 572 the evidence concerning the intended awar d of contract for the supply of bicycles for the congo reveals that the scheme continued to exist until at least december 2006 subject 1 remained an active participan t in the scheme throughout this time period 573 the task force finds that subject 1 and subject 2 derived personal benefit from the scheme as i subject 2 owned the comp any awarded an esaro contract or ii company associated with subject 2 or subject 1 was fraudulently awarded the contract oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly

benefits to subject 2 and subject 1 have been identified subject 2 as owner of mss kenya r eceived kes 232800 approximately us3235 company representative 1 provided eviden ce that he had paid subject 2 kes 450000 approximately us6500 the task force finds this payment to be kickback evidence suggests that subject 1 and he r husband subject 2 may have improperly benefited from the supply of curtaining ligh ting equipment and furnishings from the koechs the owners of lins consult and pas it would appear that these benefits were conferred in connection with the award of unopsesaro cont racts to these companies the task force does not reach the question whether subject 2 and subject 1 properly paid for the receipt of these good and services if they did not this would represent kickback 574 in addition to the corrupt and fraudulent scheme the task force finds that subject 2 corrupted esaro procurement in two othe r ways firstly subject 2 obtained the invoices issued to esaro by the freight fo rwarding company jo freighters and uplifted these prior to their submission to esaro for payment with subject 2 pocketing the difference between the two costs secondly subject 2 asked for and in some cases received commission payments for work by esaro vendors on esaro contracts namely from kenelec and zambezi 575 the task force finds that subject 1 was aware of her husbands links to the companies joes freighters diesel care and kenelec but at time made these links known to the organisation g j oes freighters 576 subject 1 introduced joes freighters to esaro in early 2006 the company replaced frankline cargo as esaros freight forwarding and clearing company subject 1 knew that her husband subject 2 was associ ated with the company but failed to bring this conflict of interest to the attention of others at esaro the task force finds subject 1s claim that she was not aware of her husbands involvement with joes freighters to lack credibility 577 in addition the task force finds that s ubject 2 uplifted joes freighters invoices in furtherance of the scheme the task force finds the evidence of company representative 1 in respect to this matter cred ible as his claims were against his interest and supported by documents further compa ny representative 1s evidence in respect of other matters is co rroborated by documents and the ta sk force believes him to be credible witness in general the statements made by company representative 1 are against his penal interest and theref ore have the indici of credibility 578 there is also evidence of potential double billing in respect of joes freighters invoices 108 and 109 oios procurement task force final report on concerned staff member and unops procurement redacted and strictly confidential ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ page 136 579 the task force has not been able to determine identity of the ultimate beneficiary of payments made to joes freighters in re spect of the uplifted invoices or the double billing this money was paid into bank account controlled by mr claudio 580 the task force has found evidence that subject 1 had knowledge of or was implicated in the joes freighters invoice uplifting and double billing 581 the total amount paid to joes freighters in 2006 was kes 273973 approximately us3759 preci calculation can be made as to actual loss as goods were cleared and forwarded at minimum however the loss can be calculated as an amount equivalent to the uplift of in voice 108kes 4640 approximately us60 and the value of invoice 109kes 17400 approximately us242 which represents double billing therefore at least us300 can be d eemed as loss incurred by the organisation h k enelec 582 kenelec was awarded an esaro contract to supply bitumen to the seychelles certain anomalies exist with regards to the aw ard of this contract the task force has not identified evidence th at the award of this contract was corrupted 583 the task force does however find that subject 1 was aware of subject 2s involvement with kenelec as well as his c onnection with the bitumen contract secured by kenelec and failed to report this conflict of interest to the ppropriate persons at esaro 584 mr claudio admitted to the task fo rce that subject 2 was paid kes 40000 approximately us570 by kenelec in connection with the contract to supply bitumen to the seychelles this payment was purportedly for subject 2s work as consultant on the contract at the very least this payment amounts to breach of contractual warranty i d iesel care 585 subject 2 sought to secure esaro contracts for mr claudios company diesel care limited subject 1 assisted him in his efforts and did not make esaro management aware of the obvious conflict of interest presented by her involvement with the company 586 further subject 3 admitted to the task force that he was aware that subject 2 was subject 1s husband but failed to in form anyone at esaro of subject 2s involvement with diesel cares atte mpts to obtain unopsesaro contracts j z ambezi investments 587 zambezi investments was awarded cont ract to supply

the lp moreover she issued instructions to her brother in connection with the perfor mance of the contract 589 mr ochola made number of false statements to the task force investigators when interviewed further he used his cont acts with subject 1s brother to improperly gain information from subject 1 regarding unopsesaro contracts 590 while the task force does not have evidence of any direct payments the task force finds however that it is unlikely that subject 2 s assistance to mr ochola of zambezi investments would have been provi ded absent payment indeed mr ochola described subject 2 as someone whose offers of assistance in facilitating matters with the united nations were contingent upon commission payments 591 the task force finds that subject 1 d pivotal role in securing the esaro contract for zambezi until her intervention the company was not even under consideration by esaro for the contract as zambezi was not in the business of supplying trucks and was essentially broker due to the companys poor performance the contract has now been cancelled as re sult the organisation has incurred loss of both time and money this loss can be attributed to subject 1s actions k ctions of unops staff 592 some junior staff aware of problems in the procurement process did make appropriate attempts to alert more senior st aff of these issues there were procurement systems in place as per the unops procuremen t manual which should have in theory prevented the fraud from occurring these systems were not adequately enforced and there was insufficient oversight the real problem however lay in deliberate and calculated effort by subject 1 her husband and the other individuals and vendors identified herein to circumvent thes systems and defraud the organisation l
