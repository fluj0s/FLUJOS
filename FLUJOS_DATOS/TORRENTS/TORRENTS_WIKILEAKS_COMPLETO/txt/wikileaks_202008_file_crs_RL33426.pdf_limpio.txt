program for cleaning up the nations contaminated waste sites and protecting public health and the environment from releases of hazardous substances enacted into law as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla pl 96510 the program became known as superfund because congress established large trust fundoriginally supported by taxes levied on specific petroleum products and chemicalsto provide the majority of the programs funding needs although the 26yearold program has seen less attention compared with earlier years superfund issues continue to generate debate this report provides background and overview of the superfund program and examines four topics that received interest in recent years the first issue concerns superfund program funding who should pay for the program general taxpayers or dedicated tax on industry the program was originally funded by tax on industry that expired at the end of 1995 without dedicated taxes and with relatively small balance in the trust fund congress has been using general revenues for larger percentage of cleanup funds members introduced bills to reinstate the taxes in the current and past three congresses but so far these efforts have lacked the necessary support the second issue regards superfund program appropriations recent evidence indicates that appropriations from the past several years have fallen short of program needs the administrations fy2007 budget proposal for superfund also fell below levels that according to some estimates are needed to meet program obligations without reinstating the superfund taxes any increased appropriation would be funded through general treasury revenues the third issue involves superfund interaction with abandoned and contaminated hardrock mines the number of hardrock mining sites requiring cleanup in future years particularly those without identifiable responsible parties could play an important role in the superfund funding debate there is also concern that the threat of cercla liability may act as cleanup disincentive for good samaritans who might offer cleanup assistance at abandoned hardrock mines the fourth issue concerns superfunds role at animal feeding operations stakeholders argue about whether these operations should be requ ired to report ammonia air emissions primarily resulting from animal waste as hazardous substance releases this issue also concerns the responsibility for releases of animal waste that reach water bodies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33426g21g158g153g142g155g143g158g151g141

cercla pl 96510 1 to create the hazardous substance cleanup program the program became known as superfund in reference to the trust fund established by the law the fund was originally supported by taxes levied on specific petroleum products and chemicals and corporate environmental income tax until recent years the superfund taxes provided the majority of the funding for the needs of the program at the time of cerclas enactment other federal environmental statutes provided federal agencies with only limited authority to addre ss contamination at abandoned sites cercla gave the federal government the authority to take direct action to respond to instances involving uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances or pollutants and contaminants that may endanger public health or the environment cercla also enables the environmental protection agency epa to compel the persons responsible to clean up their contaminated sites if the potentially responsible parties prps cannot be located or they are unable generally for financial reasons to perform cleanup epa is authorized to use monies from the superfund trust fund to clean up the site cercla was expanded and reauthorized by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 sara pl 99499 2 amendments after sara have been narrowly focused in 1992 and 1996 congress enacted legislation allowing for easier transfer of military bases with contaminated areas to local entities in 1996 and 1999 congress provided conditional liability exemptions for financial institutions and recycling facilities in 2002 congress enacted the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act pl 108118 which added further liability relief and authorized the brownfields program table 1 lists the various cercla

ncp contains the procedures and regulations for implementing the superfund program3 generally epa leads the response to releases on land and in inland waters whereas the coast guard leads the response

of release of hazardous substance into the environment th cercla environment includes all media water surface and groundwater soil and air cercla defines hazardous substance to include all the materials identified as hazardous under the resource conservation recovery act rcra the clean water act cwa the clean air act caa and the toxic substances control act tsca cercla also authorizes epa to respond to releases of pollutants or contaminants which are broadly defined to include virtually anything that can threaten the health of any organism petroleum is specifically excluded from the definition of hazardous substance and pollutant or contaminant this means that neither cercla authority nor trust fund monies may be used to respond to releases of petroleum 4 however the 2002 brownfields law authorizes the cleanup of some petroleumcontaminated sites 3 the ncp is codified at 40 cfr part 300 4 petroleum spills are covered under other statutes such as the oil pollution act of

release sites of concern can be discovered by various parties citizens state agencies or epa regional offices cercla 103 requires release notification facilities must notify the national response center if there has been release of hazardous substance above certain threshold termed reportable quantity rq5 since the inception of the superfund program epa has catalogued more than 47000 potentially contaminated sites in the agencys database the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability information system cerclis6 after site has been identified epa or state agency performs preliminary assessment to judge the sites potential hazards7 after further screening epa uses the hazard ranking system hrs to score the sites contamination and its risk of exposure to surrounding communities g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g18g155g146g152g155g146g157g146g142g156g561g14g146g156g157g561 sites that score high enough on the hrs are eligible for the national priorities list npl which is generally considered the official list of the most hazardous sites in the nation only small percentage of the sites assessed are placed on the npl over superfunds history epa has placed 1569 sites on the npl as of october 1 2007 of these sites 321 have met cleanup goals and have been subsequently removed deleted from the npl at an additional 1030 sites all physical construction activities have been performed and operation and maintenance such as treatment of contaminated groundwater is ongoing these sites are referred to as construction complete 8 the npl has been described as the centerpiece of the superfund program and thus it has been focal point for superfund criticism as noted in comprehensive report prepared by resources for the future rff9 hereafter referred to as the rff report10 the expense and pace of cleaning up npl sites has been and continues to be contentious topic among followers of the superfund program even though more than half of all npl sites have been deemed construction completemeaning that all physical remedies are in place and immediate risks posed by the site have been addressedthere remain hundreds of sites placed on the npl during the early years of the program where cleanup remedies have still not been fully implemented some interest groups have questioned the listing process itself and the slow pace of cleanup at npl sites the decision to list site on the npl is ultimately at epas discretion11 many factors 5 40 cfr 3026 epa codified the list of hazar dous substances and their respective rqs in 40

g346g561other than the hrs score influence whether s ite is proposed for listingfor example state support12 community concerns13 and superfund budgetary issues14 epa has stated that the npl is only of limited significance however as it does not assign liability to any party or to the owner of any specific property neither does placing site on the npl mean that any remedial or removal action necessarily need be taken15 there are two categories of response activity in the superfund program 1 shortterm removal action and 2 longterm remedial action the trus t fund can support removal action at npl or nonnpl sites however trust fund monies can be used for remedial activity only if the site is on the npl16 g22g145g142g561g20g142g150g152g159g138g149g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 the removal program grew out of the recognition that certain hazardous substance releases would necessitate quick response removal action seeks to stabilize site and in some cases this minimizes the need for further cleanup removal action can be undertaken at sites regardless of their npl status and historically most removal actions occur at nonnpl sites17 cercla limits removal action to oneyear effort and expenditures of not more than 2 million18 this limit applies only to efforts led by epa and funded by trust fund dollars not at sites where the responsible party is performing cleanup not all actions under the removal program are considered equally urgent epa groups removal actions into the following three categories 1 classic emergencies those actions where the release requires that onsite activities be initiated within minutes or hours of the determination that removal action is appropriate 2 timecritical actions those actions where based on an evaluation of the site epa determines that less than six months is available before site activities must be initiated continued be done resources fall 2005 p 20 12 pl 10419 an fy1995 appropriations bill directed epa to obtain letter of concurrence from the governor of state prior to listing site in that state on the national pr iorities list pl 104134 an fy1996 appropriations bill provided similar direction epa as matter of policy to further enhance the role of states in the superfund program continues to request governors letter of concurrence prior to npl listing 13 an npl designation generally carries stigma and local communities often worry about the effects an npl site will have on nearby property values 14 for example epa might be hesitant to list mega sites on the npl unless the parties responsible for the site have been identified rff report p 89 15 see for example us epa nati onal priorities list for uncontrolled hazar dous waste sites 70 federal register 54329 september 14 2005 16 40 cfr 300425b1

g348g561solution congress consistently apportions about half of the annual superfund appropriation to the remedial program see figure 1 20 the remedial program consists of multiple process steps each with its own term of art although the remedial process does not typically follow linear stepbystep progression simplified version of events is discussed below highlighting the main milestones the remedial program first involves comprehensive investigation of the site and analysis of cleanup alternatives or remedies this examination process the remedial investigationfeasibility study or rifs can take months or even years21 following completion of the rifs epa selects remedy to address the sites contamination epa must solicit public comment when determining the remedy for the site and states typically play an active role in the remedy selection process cercla directs epa to select permanent remedy or treatment whenever possible the lesspreferred option is to leave the waste in place and reduce human exposure eg soil cover or security fence if the method chosen is not permanent epa must review the site every five years to ensure remedy protection after epa decides the sitespecific cleanup remedy and issues formal record of decision rod the remedial design rd phase commences the rd is the engineering plan used to implement the remedy chosen by epa developmen t of the rd takes on average approximately two years 22 after the rd is complete the actual cleanup process remedial action begins for sites where cleanup has been completed the total process from start proposed listing on the npl to finish cleanup goals achieved takes between 8 and 11 years on average23 g5g149g142g138g151g158g153g561g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g156g561 cercla directs epa to assure that superfund site cleanups protect human health and the environment24 cercla specifically requires cleanups to meet any standard requirement criteria or limitation under any federal or state environmental law25 epa may waive this requirement if for example meeting the standard will not provide balance between 1 the need for protection of health and the environment at the site and 2 the availability of monies in the trust fund for other locations26 20 other substantial accounts in the total appropriation include the removal program 194 million enforcement 180 million and operations

cites epas estimate at 17 years but the report authors calculated an average rd duration of 225 years rff report at p 210 23 epa estimates the average duration is eight years but the rff report finds this calculation to be inaccurate because only completed actions are included if incomplete actions are also included as demonstrated in the rff report the average duration increases to 11 years pp

contains liability scheme that is by any measure stringent if hazardous substance is released or threatened to be released from facility cercla liability may attach to wide variety of persons potentially responsible party prp is any individual or company that may have contributed to contamination at superfund site prps may include current or former owners of facility or vessel current or former operators of facility or vessel generators who sent hazardous substances to the site and transporters who brought hazardous substances to the site27 cercla liability is considered to be strict joint and several and retroactive28 strict liability means that party can be held responsible regardless of negligence moreover under cercla proof of causation is not necessary joint and several liability means that any liable party can be held responsible for the full cost of cleanup regardless of the degree of involvement retroactive liability means that parties can be held responsible for actions that caused contamination prior to the passage of cercla cerclas liability scheme provides epa with strong enforcement authority to require prps to address site contamination the joint and several component creates an incentive for one prp already identified by epa to locate other prps so that the cleanup costs can be shared the statute does provide several defenses exemptions and mechanisms for eliminating or reducing partys cercla liability29 this report does not discuss these devices for information regarding several of them see crs report rl31911 innocent landowners and

position and chosen not to renew the superfund taxes the tax authority expired in 1995 but the funds balance remained positive until fy2003 without dedicated taxes and with relatively sm all balance in the trust fund congress has been using general revenues for larger percentage of cleanup funds although several members of congress have introduced bills to reinstate the taxes during these years such efforts have lacked the necessary support cercla established the superfund program and its trust fund in 1980 although general treasury revenues have provided some support for the program since its inception 40 the trust fund traditionally provided most of the funding for the superfund program congress raised trust fund revenues primarily through excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical

to conduct cleanup activities in general the current superfund funding debate ie whether dedicated tax or general treasury revenues should support the trust fund applies to this subset of npl sites43 proponents of reinstating the superfund taxes argue that the cleanup of orphan sites should rely on taxes paid by the chemical and petroleum industries and companies that use cercla hazardous substances not ordinary taxpayers they refer to this as the polluter pays principle when bush administration spokespersons indicate support for the polluter pays concept they generally mean that cleanup should be funded by the parties directly involved ie prps rather than by industrial sectors or corporations that did not directly contribute to specific sites contamination opponents of reinstating the tax argue for example that the tax is overreaching and unfair as it applies to all industry sectors and to both compliant and noncompliant companies superfund tax proponents contend that in the context of federal budget deficits it may be difficult to maintain spending at needed levels without dedicated taxes amendments to cercla have addressed some of the claims of unfairness the asset conservation lender liability and deposit insurance protection act of 1996 pl 104208 limited banks and other lenders exposure to superfund liability at contaminated site to the amount of their loans businesses engaged in recycling were absolved of liability if they met certain criteria showing that their activities were genuine recycling and not shams to disguise illegal disposal of hazardous substances superfund recycling equity act pl 106113 additional limits on cercla liability were provided in the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act pl 107118 wh ich made contributors of small amounts of hazardous substances at an npl site exempt from liability if the wastes were disposed prior to april 1 2001 also exempted were residential property owners small businesses and small nonprofit organizations that sent only municipal so lid waste to npl sites as well as property owners whose land abuts superfund site prospective purchasers of contaminated property and innocent landowners since the 107 th congress legislation has been introduced that would reinstate the superfund taxes but these efforts have failed in the 110th congress several members including senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer and subcommittee on superfund and environmental health chair hillary clinton have spoken in favor of restoring the taxes representative maurice hinchey hr 1887 and senator robert casey s 1179 introduced companion bills that would reinstate the taxes and for the first five years would increase them by 50 to fund response at megasites where cleanup costs exceed 50 million and at sites that present high health risks representatives earl blumenauer and frank pallone introduced hr 3636 which would reimpose the taxes beginning with the date of enactment until january 1 2018 representative pallones hr 3962 would restore the taxes at their previous rates through the end of 2015 43 although 70 of the npl cleanups are performed by prps the rff report chapter 5 finds there may be many orphan sites eligible for the npl ie have high enou gh hrs score that remain unlisted for various reasons discussed in the npl subsection above thus one might ar gue that the 7030 ratio understates the universe of orphan sites that need federal funding for cleanup

related to the superfund program funding debate is the concern that the superfund program is not receiving enough funding to match its annual obligations recent evidence indicates that appropriations from the past several years have fallen short of program needs if congress decides to increase annual appropriations without reinstating the superfund taxes general treasury revenues contribution to the program will increase possibly conflicting with deficit reduction goals as noted above in july 2001 resources for the future rff released comprehensive study mandated by congress 44 that estimated future program needs for fiscal years 20002009 rff calculated that the base case program needs for fy2008 would be 17 billion the report also estimated high and low case 15 billion and 18 billion per year respectively rff concluded that funding needs would remain above 16 billion annually through fy2009 using rffs base case as figure 3 indicates annual superfund appropriations in recent years have consistently been several hundred million dollars less than the funding needs projected by rff several factors contributed to rffs projections for increased funding needs first rff anticipated that numerous mega sites would move beyond the analysis and design phases and into the actual construction and cleanup phases 45 in the rff analysis the cost of remedial action at mega sites was projected to remain above historic levels through fy2007 and the cost of the superfund program as whole was projected to remain above fy2001 levels thr ough at least fy2009 the final year in the analysis 46 second epas office of inspector general ig highlighted the concern that hardrock mining sites may have significant financial impact on the trust fund the ig identified 156 hardrock mining sites nationwide that have the potential to cost between 7 billion and 24 billion to clean up although the ig points out uncertainty regarding the risks to human health and the environment at these sites 47 there is also uncertainty concerning prps and their ability to pay for cleanup48 44 in the fy2000 vahudindependent agencies appropriation pl 10674 conference report congress directed epa to contract with rff to analyze the projected federal costs of the superfund program for the period fy2000 fy2009 45 mega sites are sites at which the projected cleanup cost is 50 million or more the average cost

estimated that approximately 20 of abandoned mine lands amls60 may present concern to water quality public safety or both61 in its 1997 report epa found that only small percentage of amls contribute significantly to threats to human health or the environment but the aggregate impact is substantial with many localized areas suffering serious environmental impacts in 2002 an epa team found that 510

one might question why such small percentage of the sites are listed on the npl there are several factors particular to the mining industry that may explain this first aml ownership often goes back

g343g349g561sites65 second the average cleanup costabout 22 millionat nonmega mining site is more than double the average cost of nonmega sites in other industries cleanup activities at mega mining sites can cost hundreds of millions of dollars third states may provide some resistance to fundled ie sites without prps cleanup at mining sites because the superfund statute requires the state to pay 10 of the remedial costs and 100 of operation and maintenance costs66 at mining sites these costs could be significant and last for an indefinite period of time67 on the other hand several factors may lead epa and the states to increase the number of amls on the npl for instance growing populations in th west due either to business development or purchases of second homes may bolster the pressu re to remove contamination from local water sources moreover cwa requirements may provide further pressure to address the pollution from amls section 303d of the clean water act requires states to identify pollutantimpaired water segments and develop total maximum daily loads tmdls that set the maximum amount of pollution that water body can receive without violating water quality standards 68

joint and several liability epa can hold one prp responsible for the entire site cleanup under the statutes broad liability structure good samaritans could potentially become liable as site owners operators or as persons who arrange for the disposal of hazardous substance73 for example good samaritans who conduct remediation activities such as the treatment of acid mine drainage might be considered site operator many groups argue74 that the threat of cercla liability creates chilling effect discouraging volunteer cleanup at abandoned mining sites these parties have called for federal legislation that would provide good samaritans with protection from superfunds liability scheme in general most parties support the concept of encouraging good samaritan assistance at amls however some environmental groups are concerned about providing exemptions from cerclas liability pointing out that the strong liability provisions often drive cleanup at mining sites 75 furthermore some argue76 that the superfund statute already provides liability protection for good samaritans cercla 107d often referred to as the good samaritan provision77 might allow good samaritans to provide cleanup assistance at the direction of epa without the threat of liability the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act of 2002 pl 107118 which amended portions of superfund added the bona fide prospective purchaser bfpp exemption 78 this provision allows parties to purchase contaminated property without accepting the liability for historical contamination notwit hstanding that they knew of the contamination when they purchased the bfpp exemption is conditional79 for example bfpps must take reasonable steps to 1 stop continuing releases 2 prevent threatened future releases and 3 prevent or limit human environmental or natural resource exposure to earlier hazardous substance releases80 thus bfpps may need to address the releases related to the actions of former owneroperators regarding this issue epa stated congress did not intend to create as general matter the same types of response obligations that exist for cercla liable party eg removal of contaminated soil extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater nevertheless it seems clear that congress also did not intend to allow landowner to ignore the potential dangers associated with

including ambient air that are above reportable quantities rq 85 the rq for hydrogen sulfide and ammonia is 100 pounds per day the rq for phosphorous is 1 pound per day86 in recent years there have been questions as to how cercla applies to animal feeding operations for example are afos required to report ammonia air emissions as releases under cercla and if so how should the releases be counted in regards to the rq several federal courts have addressed this particular issue by examining the cercla definition of facility 87 instead of counting each barn lagoon or land application area as separate facilities these courts have ruled that the entire site should be considered facility for purposes of cercla under this interpretation large afos referred to as concentrated animal feeding operations or cafos will be more likely to breach the reportable quantity levels because multiple release locations at given site will be aggregated continued purchaser contiguous property or innocent

g344g342g561at hearing before the house appropriations subcommittee on interior environment and related agencies on february 28 2007 epa administrator stephen johnson testified that the agency was developing regulation to exempt cafos from superfund mandates to report air emissions he said this would be very narrow regulation88 another question concerns cercla liability for manure that reaches water bodies via erosion or leaching into groundwater89 manure is often applied to the land as fertilizer but cercla excludes the normal application of fertilizer from the definition of release90 interested parties have argued that some afos are taking advantage of this exclusion by applying more manure to the land than is necessary in the past three years two federal district courts have looked into this matter but both cases were settled the terms of the settlements were not made public and the settlements effectively ended the court proceedings without formal ruling on the cercla applicability issues 91 however third case92 involving this issue is currently in the federal system this court activity has increased concern in the agricultural community that other legal actions will follow and that the courts will continue to apply cercla to afos this concern has led to recent congressional interest members in the 109th congress made several attempts to exempt manure from the requirements of cercla althoug h one of these legislative proposals hr 4341 gained considerable support 191 cosponsors the proposals also generated opposition from environmental groups and state and local governments none of the bills were enacted in the 110 th congress hr 1398 and s 807 follow similar approach there has been action on either bill senator blanche lincoln submitted senate amendment 1556 to the energy bill hr 6 on june 13 2007 it would have added an exemption for manure from the definitions of hazardous substance and pollutant or contaminant and would have provided exceptions from other provisions of cercla however during debate the amendment was not offered hr 6 passed the senate on june 21 2007 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 superfund issues such as the four described above continue to generate debate and interest the selected topics discussed in this report are not mutually exclusive activity in one of the issues may influence policy in another for example if more abandoned hardrock mining sites are added to the npl congress may consider increasing annual appropriations to the superfund program this action could affect the argument
