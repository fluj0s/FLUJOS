recent and projected large federal budget deficits have generated congressional interest in the feasibility of raising revenue by reducing the tax gap the internal revenue service irs defines the gross tax gap as the difference between the aggregate tax liability imposed by law for given tax year and the amount of tax that taxpayers pay voluntarily and timely for that year the net gap is the amount of the gross tax gap that remains unpaid after all enforced and other late payments are made for the tax year for tax calendar year 2001 the irs estimates gross tax gap of 345 billion equal to noncompliance rate of 163 for the same tax year irs enforcement activities coupled with other late payments recovered about 55 billion of the gross tax gap resulting in an estimated net tax gap of 290 billion the estimated gross tax gap of 345 billion consists of underreporting of tax liability 285 billion nonfiling of tax returns 27 billion nd underpayment of taxes 33 billion taxes on illegal activities are excluded from these estimates most of the underreporting of tax liability concerned underreporting of individual income liability 197 billion the percentage of individual income that was underreported varied significantly depending on the degree of information reporting and whether or not withholding was required the irs has replaced the taxpayer compliance measurement programa systematic approach for estimating the tax gapwith the national research program nrp one of the guiding principles for the nrp is to minimize the compliance burden on those taxpayers selected for audit in the nrp sample the new methodology of the nrp was applied to the underreporting gap for the individual income tax for tax year 2001 estimates of the gross tax gap have been heavily publicized perhaps as result some public officials have emphasized better enforcement of tax laws in order to raise revenue three factors affect the dollar amount that can be collected by increased enforcement first much of the gross tax gap for individual income tax filers is due to types of unreported income that are difficult to detect second some of the detected tax liability cannot be easily collected particularly from those taxpayers who are currently unable to pay third many detected tax liabilities are so small relative to enforcement costs that it is not costeffective to pursue collection from fy2001 to fy2006 greater tax enforcement efforts by the irs increased enforcement revenue from 338 billion to 487 billion for fy2007 the irs reported an increase in enforcement revenues to 592 billion the office of tax policy developed strategy it terms comprehensive integrated and multiyear to reduce the tax gap in his fy2009 budget president bush proposed 16 legislative changes as of november 6

only 12 of the sum of wages sa laries and tips was underreported but 571 of nonfarm proprietor income was und erreported these data suggest that increased information reporting and withholding would reduce the tax gap the increased revenue would have to be we ighed against higher administrative costs of the irs and higher compliance costs of individuals

data from the tcmp to estimate the gross tax gap for individual income taxpayers and small corporations less than 10 million in assets the irs formulated upper and lowerbound estimates of the gross income tax gap the irs completed linebyline examinations of several different types of tax returns 11 the upperbound estimates of the gross tax gap were calculated from the tcmp and regular audits of large corporations for larger corporations 10 million or more in assets the irs relied on regular operational audits of tax returns if an audit showed an underpayment of taxes the irs examiner determined the tax deficiency 12 the lowerbound estimate of the gross tax gap was based on the amounts eventually assessed after the appeals and litigation process some of the tax deficiency found from audits was negated by taxpayers appeals and court decisions leading to lower estimate of taxes owed but unpaid13 the eventual assessment may be considered to be the true legal liability in the sense that irs cannot attempt to assess more later except in unusual cases 14 the net tax gap differed depending on whether the upper or lowerbound estimate of the gross tax gap was used

new tcmp but some members of congress objected because of the high cost to the irs and the compliance burden placed on taxpayers who were selected in the tcmp sample consequently irs developed the national research program nrp according to the irs the goal of national research program nrp is to design and implement successful strategy to collect data that will be used to measure payment filing and reporting compliance and to deliver the data to the irs business operation division to meet wide range of needs 11 internal revenue service income tax compliance research net tax gap and

the development of strategic plans and improvements in workload identification15 guiding principle for the nrp was to minimize compliance burden on taxpayers selected in the nrp sample16 the npr methodology was applied to the underreporting gap for the individual income tax for tax year 2001 and consisted of three major processes 1 casebuildingcreating information files on returns selected for the nrp sample 2 classificationusing that information to cl assify the returns according to what if any items on the returns cannot be verified without additional information from the taxpayers and 3 taxpayer audits limited to those items that cannot be independently verified 17 the irs applied the nrp approach to about 46000 randomly selected returns it deliberately oversampled high income returns in order to draw conclusions about important subcategories of taxpayers18 currently the irs is examining subchapter s corporations as part of the nrp the irs estimates that large portion of the tax gap is attributable to small businesses including subchapter s corporations the random sample consists of approximately 5000 returns covering two tax years 2003 and 2004 the case building and classification phases of the study are completed the examination phase of the study began in october 2005 19 g22g138g161g561g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561 the estimates of the gross

taxpayer evasion should both be addressed sources of noncompliance should be targeted with specificity enforcement activities should be combin ed with commitment to taxpayer service policy positions and compliance proposals should be sensitive to taxpayer rights and maintain an appropriate balance between enforcement activity and imposition of taxpayer burden 31 the resulting strategy developed by the treasury strategy it terms comprehensive integrated and multiyear included the following seven components reduce opportunities for evasion the administrations fy2007 budget includes five legislative proposals to reduce evasion opportunities and improve the efficiency of the irs the treasury departments office of tax policy is working with the irs to develop additional legislative proposals for consideration as part of the fy2008 budget process make multiyear commitment to research research is essential to identify sources of noncompliance so that irs resources can be properly targeted regularly updating compliance research ensures that the irs is aware of vulnerabilities as they emerge continue improvements in information technology continued improvements to technology
