visit classified by dcm gerald m feierstein reasons 14 bd 1 c summary embassy islamabad warmly welcomes your february 24 visit to pakistan you will participate in trilateral cooperation meeting with pakistani interior minister rehman malik and afghan interior minister hanif atmar followed by bilateral meetings with senior pakistani officials including federal investigation agency fia director general zafarullah khan intelligence bureau ib director general javed noor and interservices intelligence isi director general ahmed shuja pasha 2 c you should express to your pakistani interlocutors appreciation for ongoing law enforcement cooperation and express our readiness to enhance such efforts you may want to register us concerns about terrorist threats to us citizens and us interests that emanate from pakistan and encourage continued pakistani action to counter these threats you should press the pakistanis to follow through on their prosecution of the seven mumbai defendants end summary domestic overview 3 c pakistan continues to face extraordinary challenges on the security and law enforcement front the country has suffered greater military law enforcement and civilian casualties in fighting extremism and terrorism than almost any other country pakistans military is currently engaged in combat operations against militant groups in the malakand division of north west frontier province nfwp and six of the seven agencies of the federally administered tribal areas fata along the pakafghan border at the same time pakistan has experienced an alarming increase in terrorist attacks against government and civilian targets in pakistans major cities resulting in several hundred deaths in recent months in your meetings you should acknowledge the sacrifices made by pakistans law enforcement agencies and the pressure the terrorist attacks have placed on their resources 4 c in the midst of this difficult security situation pakistans civilian government remains weak ineffectual and corrupt domestic politics is dominated by uncertainty about the fate of president zardari he enjoys approval ratings in the 20 percent range and has repeatedly clashed with key power centers including the military politically ambitious supreme court chief justice iftikhar chaudhry and opposition leader nawaz sharif in december the supreme court ruled unconstitutional the november 2007 national reconciliation ordinance promulgated by thenpresident musharraf which provided legal amnesty for benazir bhutto zardari and key figures in their party enabling them to participate in 2008 elections the courts ruling has paved the way for revival of corruption cases against number of officials including interior minister rehman malik whether corruption cases can be revived against zardari himself is less certain as pakistans constitution includes clause providing sitting presidents with criminal immunity 5 c while we have had major successes in our military and law enforcement cooperation with pakistan cooperation has frequently been hampered by suspicion in pakistans military and intelligence establishment about us intentions and objectives among other things the pakistanis believe that we have favored india over pakistan most notably by approving civilnuclear cooperation with india and that we aim to dismantle pakistans nuclear weapons program which in light of their conventional military disadvantage visavis india they consider critical to their national security the military and intelligence establishment is also concerned that we are working with pakistans civilian leadership to limit the militarys prerogative in determining pakistans national security policies as result of these concerns the military and intelligence establishment has taken steps since spring 2009 to hamper the operations of the islamabad 00000416 002 of 004 embassy these steps include holding up the issuance and renewal of pakistani visas for permanent embassy staff and tdyers denying import permits for armored vehicles for embassy use sabotaging our contract with dyncorp international to provide enhanced protective support for consulate general peshawar personnel slowing down importation of us assistance for the pakistani government including equipment for pakistani law enforcement agencies shutting down our antiterrorism assistance ata training program at pakistans sihala police academy putting up roadblocks for our acquiring additional land for the embassys expansion and harassing embassy personnel by stopping and detaining embassy vehicles some of these problems have recently abated in response to our repeatedly raising them with the highest levels of the pakistani government however we expect we will have to continue to push back against such impediments for the foreseeable future federal investigation agency 6 c the fbis primary pakistani counterpart is the federal investigation agency fia on december 7 the government replaced fia director general tariq khosa with zafarullah khan while khosa was ostensibly given promotion by being named secretary of the ministry of narcotics control number of press reports maintained that khosa was removed from his fia position for his aggressive pursuit of corruption cases against government officials and businessmen khosa had developed close cooperation with the us on host of law enforcement issues including on the mumbai case while khan has strong law enforcement background he has not shown an inclination to be as forwardleaning on cooperation as khosa was counterterrorism finance 7 s in the past year pakistan has made steady progress in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism earlier this year the fia partnered with the state bank of pakistan to crack down on large licensed and unlicensed money service businesses that were violating foreign exchange laws and contributing to money laundering in january the national assembly passed new antimoney laundering aml legislation the bill is currently awaiting senate action in the interim the legislation is in force through its promulgation as an ordnance signed by president zardari separately during february 12 meeting in islamabad assistant treasury secretary david cohen provided the pakistanis with compilation of tearline information on the financial activities of terrorist organizations in pakistan including their use of the formal financial sector and affiliated charities businesses and individuals cohen encouraged the pakistanis to exploit these leads in the pursuit of additional inform ation to identify key terrorism donors fundraisers and financial facilitators cohen also passed declassified terrorism finance information to four pakistani banks law enforcement assistance 8 sbu pakistans terrorism threats necessitate substantial strengthening of the countrys law enforcement capabilities the state departments international narcotics and law enforcement inl bureau is providing significant training equipment and infrastructure assistance to the police in north west frontier province nwfp ie the province most affected by terrorist attacks this assistance 405 million in fy2009 and 346 million in fy2010 focuses on the nwfp polices elite force heavy police force with swatlike capabilities established in 2008 equipment we are providing the elite force includes vehicles armored personnel carriers protective vests night vision goggles and communications gear we are hardening police checkpoints with hescolike barriers and are rebuilding three police islamabad 00000416 003 of 004 stations in nwfps malakand division that were destroyed by militants inl is also funding variety of police training courses implemented by the department of justices icitap program that are open to nationwide participation 9 c the department of states antiterrorism assistance ata program has separate activities aimed at enhancing the counterterrorism capabilities of pakistans law enforcement agencies key component of the ata program is focused on hard skills tactical training including explosives detection and disposal quick reaction and vip protection unfortunately the ata program is now under threat of termination following false press reports that our ata trainers are using the training center provided by the pakistani government ie the sihala police academy for nefarious purposes including to gather information on nearby pakistan nuclear installation the government has decided to end our use of that facility and has not yet provided an acceptable alternative site mumbai case 10 c pakistans prosecution of the seven suspects it arrested in the mumbai case ie lashkaretayiba let operatives zakiur rehman lahkvi zarrar shah alqama shahid jamil riaz and hammad amin saqid and terrorism financiers jamil ahmed and younos anjum is proceeding though at slow pace the defense lawyers have aggressively filed motions challenging varying aspects of the case on november 25 an antiterrorism court finally framed the charges against the seven defendants allowing the court proceedings which are being held in camera to move to the trial phase four fbi expert witnesses are expected to be called to testify for the prosecution the government has continually reassured us that the prosecutors will win convictions against all the defendants after trial lasting several months though it has stronger case against the five let operatives than against the two terrorism financers there are concerns that some of the convictions could be overturned at the appellate level where the courts set an extremely high evidentiary bar on october 12 pakistani court quashed all remaining cases against hafiz saeed the head of let alias jamaatuddawa jud those cases were not related to the mumbai attack the government has repeatedly told us that it would need much more evidence of saeeds direct involvement in the mumbai attacks to move forward with mumbairelated charges against him david coleman headley 11 s in december an fbidoj team briefed pakistani officials from the isi ministry of interior fia ib and mfa on the david coleman headley investigation providing them with tearline information on headleys statements to us authorities isi officials said they had very little information to identify the pakistanis mentioned in the statements they discussed their investigation into first world immigration service business front used by headley and his coconspirators the isi said while they would not grant direct fbi access to coconspirator major retd abdurrehman syed who was in isi custody the fbi could submit questions for syed through the isi the fia and ministry of interior informed the fbi that it would be difficult to introduce headleyrelated evidence in the governments prosecution of the mumbai defendants including because headleys statements to us authorities would be treated as hearsay with little evidentiary value in court sargodha five 12 c the pakistanis continue to pursue their own case against the five american citizens from northern virginia who were arrested in sargodha punjab province on december 8 following suspicions they had travelled to pakistan to engage islamabad 00000416 004 of 004 in jihadist activities they have not acted on our request that the five be returned to the united states the pakistani prosecutor has repeatedly asked for continuations in the case because he is not yet prepared to move forward with charges the five suspects who claim to have been abused while in custody were denied bail at february 16 court hearing the next hearing will take place sometime in march aafia siddiqui 13 c there has been widespread condemnation here of the february 3 guilty verdict against dr aafia siddiqui pakistani citizen who was tried in federal court in new york on charges of attempting to murder us soldiers and law enforcement authorities in afghanistan many pakistanis were taken by surprise by the verdict because onesided pakistani media coverage of the case reported only on her defense and not the prosecutions case leading local observers to conclude her acquittal was near certainty we have stressed to the pakistanis that siddiqui received fair trial and has right to an appeal number of our pakistani interlocutors have suggested that president obama consider pardoning siddiqui and prime minister gilani told senator kerry on february 16 that siddiqui should be transferred to pakistan to serve out her sentence here patterson
