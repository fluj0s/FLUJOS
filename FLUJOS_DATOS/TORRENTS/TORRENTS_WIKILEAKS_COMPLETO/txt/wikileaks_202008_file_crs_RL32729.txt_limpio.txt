moloney figliola specialist in internet and telecommunications policy resources science and industry division the vchip and tv ratings monitoring childrens access to tv programming summary to assist parents in supervising the television viewing habits of their children the communications act of 1934 as amended by the telecommunications act of 1996 requires that as of january 1 2000 new television sets with screens 13 inches or larger sold in the united states be equipped with vchip to control access to programming that parents find objectionable use of the vchip is optional in march 1998 the federal communications commission fcc adopted the industry developed ratings system to be used in conjunction with the vchip congress and the fcc have continued monitoring implementation of the vchip some are concerned that it is not effective in curbing the amount of tv violence viewed by children and want further legislation in july 2004 the fcc initiated notice of inquiry noi to seek comments relating to the presentation of violent programing and its impact on children the report in this proceeding was released by the fcc on april 25 2007 in the report the fcc among other findings 1 found that on balance research provides strong evidence that exposure to violence in the media can increase aggressive behavior in children at least in the short term 2 stated that the vchip is of limited effectiveness in protecting children from violent television content and observed that cable operatorprovided advanced parental controls do not appear to be available on sufficient number of cableconnected television sets to be considered an effective solution at this time and 3 found that studies and surveys demonstrate that the voluntary tv ratings system is of limited effectiveness in protecting children from violent television content congress may wish to consider number of possible options to support parents in controlling their childrens access to certain programming some of these options would require only further educational outreach to parents while others would require at least regulatory if not legislative action specifically congress may wish to consider ways to promote awareness of the vchip and the ratings system whether the current set of mediaspecific ratings will remain viable in the future or whether uniform system would better serve the needs of consumers and whether independent ratings systems and an open vchip that would allow consumers to select the ratings systems they use would be more appropriate than the current system contents

twothirds of parents say they are very concerned that children in this country are being exposed to too much inappropriate content in the media and substantial proportion think sex 55 and violence 43 in the media contribute lot to young peoples behavior thirtytwo percent of parents cite tv as the medium that concerns them the most but the proportion who cite the internet has increased over the past two years from 16 to 21 sixtysix percent of parents say they favor government regulations to limit the amount of sex and violence on tv during the early evening hours proportion that is virtually unchanged from 2004 although exposure to inappropriate material has long been concern to parents only since the telecommunications act of 19961 has there been nationwide effort to provide parents with tool to control their childrens television viewing the v chip2 the vchip which reads an electronic code transmitted with the television signal cable or broadcast3 is used in conjunction with television programming rating system using remote control parents can enter password and then program into the television set which ratings are acceptable and which are unacceptable the chip automatically blocks the display of any programs deemed unacceptable use of the vchip by parents is entirely optional4 1 telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 february 8 1996 available at

for us television broadcasting 4 this report focuses on the use of the vchip and the ratings system as tool to assist parents in selecting appropriate television programming for their children however both the vchip and the ratings system can be used by wide range of viewers from individuals continued crs2 since january 1 2000 all new television sets with picture screen 13 inches or greater sold in the united states have been required to be equipped with the vchip5 additionally some companies also offer devices that can work with nonvchip tv sets development of the vchip ratings system the initial ratings system was developed during 1996 and 1997 but encountered criticism from within congress as well as from groups such as the national parent teacher association in response to those concerns an expanded ratings system was adopted on july 10 1997 and went into effect october 1 1997 initial ratings system the first step in implementing the mandate of the law was to create ratings system for television programs analogous to the one developed and adopted for movies by the motion picture association of america mpaa in 1968 the law urged the television industry to develop voluntary ratings system acceptable to the fcc and the rules for transmitting the rating within one year of enactment the ratings system is intended to convey information regarding sexual violent or other indecent material about which parents should be informed before it is displayed to children provided that nothing in the law should be construed to authorize any rating of video programming on the basis of its political or religious content after initial opposition media and entertainment industry executives met with thenpresident clinton on february 29 1996 and agreed to develop the ratings system because of political pressure to do so many in the television industry were opposed to the vchip fearing that it would reduce viewership and reduce advertising revenues they also questioned whether it violated the first amendment industry executives said they would not challenge the law immediately but left the option open should they deem it necessary 4 continued who themselves do not wish to view content they find objectionable to individuals who may be babysitting on an intermittent basis in their homes further the vchip and the television ratings are closely related to another issue that of broadcast indecency and how to define and enforce the appropriate use of the public airwaves by the television media that issue is discussed in greater detail in crs report rl32222 regulation of broadcast indecency background and legal analysis by henry cohen 5 47 usc 303x crs3 beginning in march 1996 group of television industry executives6 under the leadership of jack valenti thenpresident of the mpaa and leader in creating the movie ratings met to develop tv ratings system on december 19 1996 the group proposed six agebased ratings tvy tvy7 tvg tvpg tv14 and tv m including text explanations of what each represented in terms of program content in january 1997 the ratings began appearing in the upper lefthand corner of tv screens for 15 seconds at the beginning of programs and were published in some television guides thus the ratings system was used even before vchips were installed in new tv sets ratings are assigned to shows by the tv parental guidelines monitoring board the board has chairman and six members each from the broadcast television industry the cable industry and the program production community the chairman also selects five nonindustry members from the advocacy community for total of 24 members news shows and sports programming are not rated local broadcast affiliates may override the rating given particular show and assign it another rating the current svld ratings system critics of the initial ratings system argued that the ratings provided information on why particular program received certain rating some advocated an svl system sex violence language to indicate with letters why program received particular rating possibly with numeric indicator or jointly with an age based rating another alternative was the home box officeshowtime system of ten ratings such as mv mild violence v violence and gv graphic violence in response to the criticism most of the television industry agreed to revised ratings system see box below on july 10 1997 that went into effect october 1 1997 the revised ratings system added designators to indicate whether program received particular rating because of sex s violence v language l or suggestive dialogue d designator for fantasy violence fv was added for childrens programming in the tvy7 category on march 12 1998 the fcc approved the revised ratings system along with vchip technical standards and the effective date for installing them7 in may 1999 the fcc created vchip task force chaired by then commissioner gloria tristani among other things the task force was charged with ensuring that the blocking technology was available and that ratings were being transmitted encoded with tv programs educating parents about vchip and gathering information on the availability usage and effectiveness of the vchip the 6 the group included the national broadcast networks independent affiliated and public television stations cable programmers producers and distributors of cable programming entertainment and movie studios and members of the guilds representing writers directors producers and actors 7 as of january 1 2000 all new television sets with picture screen 13 inches or greater sold in the united states must be equipped with the vchip crs4 task force issued several reports and surveys8 february 2000 task force survey found that most broadcast cable and premium cable networks and syndicators were transmitting ratings encoding and those that were not either planned to do so in the near future or were exempt sports or news networks of the major broadcast and cable networks only nbc and black entertainment television do not use the svl d indicators using the original ratings system instead table 1 us television industrys revised

children9 in the report the fcc found that on balance research provides strong evidence that exposure to violence in the media can increase aggressive behavior in children at least in the short term noted that although viewerinitiated blocking and mandatory ratings would impose lesser burdens on protected speech skepticism remains that they will fully serve the governments interests in promoting parental supervision and protecting the wellbeing of minors stated that the vchip is of limited effectiveness in protecting children from violent television content observed that cable operatorprovided advanced parental controls do not appear to be available on sufficient number of cableconnected television sets to be considered an effective solution at this time stated that further action to enable viewerinitiated blocking of violent television content would serve the governments interests in protecting the wellbeing of children and facilitating parental supervision and would be reasonably likely to be upheld as constitutional 9 in the matter of violent television programming and its impact on children fcc 04175 mb docket 04261 notice of inquiry noi adopted july 15 2004 released july 28 2004 the noi is available at httphraunfossfccgovedocs_publicattachmatchfcc07 50a1pdf crs6 found that studies and surveys demonstrate that the voluntary tv ratings system is of limited effectiveness in protecting children from violent television content stated that congress could develop an appropriate definition of excessively violent programming but such language needs to be narrowly tailored and in conformance with judicial precedent suggested that industry could on its own initiative commit itself to reducing the amount of excessively violent programming viewed by children eg broadcasters could adopt family hour at the beginning of prime time during which they decline to air violent content observed that multichannel video programming providers mvpds could provide consumers greater choice in how they purchase their programming so that they could avoid violent programming eg an carte regime would enable viewers to buy their television channels individually or in smaller bundles and found that congress could implement time channeling solution andor mandate some other form of consumer choice in obtaining video programming such as the provision by mvpds of video channels provided on family tiers or on an carte basis eg channel blocking and reimbursement congressional action since 2003 the television industry and the fcc faced increasing scrutiny for what was perceived by many in congress as well as the public as sharp increase in the amount of indecent programming two of the most notable events that have taken place with respect to this issue were the fccs determination that the use of the fword by an artist during an award ceremony was not indecent and four days later an incident during the super bowl xxxviii halftime show that included performance in which one of the entertainers breasts was revealed 110th congress on november 17 2008 s 602 see also srept 110268 the child safe viewing act of 2007 was cleared for signature by president bush this bill was introduced by senator mark pryor and will require the fcc to begin notice of inquiry within 90 days of the laws enactment to examine the existence and availability of advanced blocking technologies that parents could use across variety of communications devices or platforms the senate and the house of representatives have each held one hearing on issues related to the vchip crs7 the senate committee on commerce science and transportation held hearing impact of media violence on children on june 26 200710 the hearing focused on issues related to the impact of violent television programming on children including issues raised by the fcc report violent television programming and its impact on children the house committee on energy and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet held hearing images kids see on the screen on june 22 200711 the hearing included discussion of advertising for junk food aimed at children and on the inability of the vchip to screen out undesirable advertising 109th congress during the 109th congress senators john rockefeller and kay bailey hutchison introduced s 616 the indecent and gratuitous and excessively violent programming control act on march 14 2005 specifically with respect to the television ratings and the vchip s 616 would have required the fcc to assess the effectiveness of both the ratings system and the vchip and report annually on its findings further if the fcc were to find that the ratings system and vchip did not adequately protect children from excessive violent and sexual content it would be required to undertake rulemaking to require broadcasters to do more to protect children from such content including whether to use new system not developed by the industry the bill would also have required more consistent and meaningful labeling of violent and sexual content to include rebroadcasting such labeling for 30 seconds every 30 seconds whether the programming was received via broadcast cable or satellite s 616 was referred to the committee on commerce science and transportation on march 14 2005 further action was taken12

for parents to control access to undesirable television content13 in the foundations most recent report published in june 2007 twothirds of parents say they are very concerned that children in this country are being exposed to too much inappropriate content in the media and substantial proportion think sex 55 and violence 43 in the media contribute lot to young peoples behavior thirtytwo percent

government regulations to limit the amount of sex and violence on tv during the early evening hours proportion that is virtually unchanged from 200414 overall the parents interviewed for the study stated that they were more concerned about inappropriate content on tv than in other media 32 said tv concerned them most compared to 21 who said the internet 9 movies 7 music and 8 video games half 50 of all parents said they have used the tv ratings to help guide their childrens viewing including slightly more than one in four 28 who said they use them often15 furthermore the study revealed that while use of the vchip has increased substantially since 2001 when 7 of all parents said they used it it remains modest at just 15 of all parents or about four in 10 42 of those who have vchip in their television and know it nearly twothirds 61 of parents who have used the vchip said they found it very useful16 other significant findings reported included after being read arguments on both sides of the issue nearly two thirds of parents 63 said they favored new regulations to limit the amount of sex and violence in tv shows during the early evening hours when children were most likely to be watching 35 are opposed17 majority 55 of parents said ratings should be displayed more prominently and 57 said they would rather keep the current rating systems than switch to single rating for tv movies video games and music 34 favor the single rating18 when read the competing arguments for subjecting cable tv to the same content standards as broadcasters half of all parents 52 13 see

that cable should be treated the same while 43 said it should not19 most parents who have used the tv ratings said they found them either very 38 or somewhat 50 useful20 about half 52 of all parents said most tv shows are rated accurately while about four in ten 39 said most are not21 many parents do not understand what the various ratings guidelines mean for example 28 of parents of young children 26 years old knew what the rating tvy7 meant directed to children age 7 and older while 13 thought it meant the opposite directed to children under 7 and only 12 knew that the rating fv fantasy violence is related to violent content while 8 thought it meant family viewing22 in releasing the survey results vicky rideout vice president and director of the kaiser family foundations program for the study of entertainment media and health commented while many parents have used the ratings or the vchip too many still dont know what the ratings mean or even that their tv includes v chip23 number of groups conducted research and published opinion pieces questioning the usefulness andor legality of the vchip and the ratings system after the 1996 telecommunications act was enacted eg the progress and freedom foundation the american civil liberties union cato institute morality in media since that time opposition has waned and even the controversies over inappropriate content being broadcast live did not renew it further while the vchip and the ratings system can block objectionable or indecent programming when used in tandem since the incidents were broadcast live and did not have ratings that would have blocked them neither the vchip nor the ratings system would have been effective in either case therefore some could claim that the vchip and the ratings system while useful tools in many cases remain unreliable tools for parents because they cannot guarantee all objectionable content will be blocked 19 ibid 20 kff study p 5 21 ibid 22 kff study p 6 23 kff news release parents favor new limits on tv content in early evening hours half of parents say cable tv should adhere to same standards as broadcast tv use of the vchip is up september 23 2004 available at httpwwwkfforgentmedia entmedia092304nrcfm crs10 issues for congress congress may wish to consider number of possible options to support parents in monitoring and controlling their childrens access to certain programming some of these options would require only further educational outreach to parents while others would require at least regulatory if not legislative action awareness of the vchip and the ratings system according the 2004 kff study parents also indicated that they would like to see the ratings displayed more prominently to make it easier to notice them such findings are consistent with lack of widespread usage or even awareness of the v chip specifically as noted above the 2004 kff study indicated that even after years of being available only 42 of parents who have vchip and are aware of it actually use it however of the parents that had used the vchip 89 found it somewhat to very useful24 those figures would indicate that increased knowledge of the vchip would substantially increase parents perceptions of control over their childrens television viewing one of the easiest approaches to increasing the use of the vchip may likely be to step up parental awareness programs through for example public service announcements on television educational materials on the fcc website and possibly pubic service advertisements in print media additionally such educational materials could be made available on congressional member websites for constituents to download such actions would not require any new legislation or additional work by the ratings board or related entities however some initially may require funding mediaspecific vs uniform ratings one of the ongoing issues related to the use of the vchip is that according to the kff study only about half of parents actually use the television ratings that is low in comparison with the movie ratings which are used by approximately 78 of parents but in line with the use of ratings for music and video games25 one contributor to the low use of the ratings is likely that so few parents actually understand the ratings for example as stated earlier only 12 of parents of young children knew that fv is the rating for fantasy violence further 8 believed it to mean family viewing as noted by the researchers in their report the fv rating is the only rating that denotes anything about the violent content of childrens programming one of the impetuses for the development of the ratings system in the first place finally overall 20 of parents had never even heard of the ratings system26 in light of those figures it could appear that parents might prefer single unified ratings system that would be applied across different media however while 24 kff study p 7 25 kff study p 4 26 kff study p 6 crs11 34 of parents said they would prefer unified system 57 opposed unified system27 given the overall findings by kff regarding parents knowledge and use of the ratings system there appears to be enough ambiguity on this issue to warrant further investigation by congress independent ratings systems and an open vchip under current legislative and regulatory mandates the vchip is only required to read the tv parental guidelines and the mpaa movie ratings this means that any independent system can only be used to augment parental knowledge not to program the vchip so while range of varied independent ratings systems can serve to provide additional information to parents they cannot be used with the current closed vchip technology in order for these ratings to become as useful as possible the vchip would have to be able to read them the opportunity to encourage the further development of private ratings systems exists in the transition to digital television beginning in april 2005 all broadcasters must simulcast 100 percent of their national television system committee commonly referred to as ntsc programming on their digital channel by the end of 2006 broadcasters must turn off their analog signal28 through either regulatory ie fcc or legislative action television manufacturers could be required to install an open vchip that could be reprogrammed to read altered or even completely new ratings an open vchip requirement would allow changes to the current system to be read as well as accommodate any other ratings systems this issue is currently under consideration at the fcc29 27 kff study p 8 28 the december 31 2006 deadline may be extended under number of circumstances detailed in crs report rl31260 digital television an overview by lennard kruger 29 in the
