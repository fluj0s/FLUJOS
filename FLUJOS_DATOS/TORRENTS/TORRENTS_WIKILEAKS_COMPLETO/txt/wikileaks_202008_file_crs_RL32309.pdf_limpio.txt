for the care of its building and grounds by authority of the act of may 7 1934 pl 73211 the architect of the capitol is responsible for the structural and m echanical care of the supreme court building including care of its grounds the architect however ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs47 not charged with responsibility for custodial care which is under the jurisdiction of the marshal of the supreme court traditionally in practice dating back to the 1920s one or more of the courts justices appear before either house or senate appropriations subcommittee to address the budget requirement s of the supreme court for the upcoming fiscal year focusing primarily on the courts salary nd operational expenses frequently if not always in conjunction with the justices testimony the architect of the capitol submits request for the courts building and grounds account although it is at the apex of the federal judicial system the supreme court represents only very small share of the judiciarys overall funding for fy2004 the total appropriations enacted for the supreme courts two accounts 812 million were less than 16 of the judiciarys overall appr opriation of 516 billion the rest of the judiciarys budget pr ovides funding for the lower federal courts and for related judici services among the lower court accounts one dwarfs all others the salaries and expenses account for the us courts of appeals district courts and other j udicial services the account covers not only the salaries benefits and operating expenses of circuit and district judges including judges of the territorial courts of the united states but also those of retired justices and judges us court of federal cla ims bankruptcy and magistra judges and all other officers and employees of the federal

the omnibus bill hrept 108792 was agreed to in the house nd senate on november 20 2004 earlier hr 4754 the cjs bill passed by the house on july 8 2004 provided 555 billion for the judiciary 80 above

contained provision authorizing costofliving salary adjustment for justices and judges during fy2005 the housepassed bill how ever was without such language the judiciarys fy2005 budget request r eceived two hearings before the house cjs appropriations subcommittee on ma rch 112004 for the lower courts and on march 17 2004 for the supreme court at the march 11 hearing officials for the judiciary stated that 71 of thei r requested increase 421 million was required simply to maintain current services this amount they said would fund uncontrollable expenses such as judges compensation and rent payments to the general services administra tion allow the courts to return to fy2002 endofyear staffing levels fund requi red adjustments to pay an d benefits maintain the judiciarys core information technolog infrastructure and provide legal representation for indigent defendants the remaining 29 of the increase 168 million was requested for prog rammatic and workloadrela ted needs primarily due to increases in criminal and bankruptcy filings and in the number of offenders released from prison requiring supervisi on and drug and mental health treatment as part of its fy2005 budget the judici ary also requested additional funding for 17 costofliving adjustment for judges effective january 2005 this adjustment the judiciary explained in its budget submission was consistent with an expected 2005 salary increas for federal employees in addition the judiciary said it was seeking an fy2004 supplemental appropriation of 557 million of this total 392 milli on would be appropriated for the salaries and expenses of the courts of appeals district courts and other judicial services account to avoid adve rse personnel actions in the courts the remainder 164 million would be appropriated for the defender services account to avert near the end of fy2004 threeweek suspension of payments to court appointed attorneys who represent indige nt defendants in federal criminal cases ultimately this judiciary ffort was partially successful for when the house andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs49 senate on july 22 2004 approved an fy2005 department of defense appropriations bill pl108287 they included in title x sec 11003 260 million in supplemental funding for the judiciarys defender services account specifically for compensation of attorn eys representing indigent defendants the judiciary maintained that the fede ral courts were cr itically underfunded in fy2003 and fy 2004 and that its fy2005 budget request in conjunction with its request for the fy2004 supplemental was one of catching up from 2002 to 2004 according to the judiciary criminal cases were projected to increase 10 activated pretrial services cases by 17 bankruptcy filings by 11 and criminal justice act representations of indigent defendants by 19 yet overa ll funding for the courts in fy2004 according to the judiciary was in real dollar terms less than fy2002 levels as result judi ciary official said at the march 11 2004 hearing the courts were freezing the filling of most v acant positions and are planning for the involuntary separation and buyout of hundr eds of employees and the furlough of thousands of court employees to meet the budget squeeze in the rema inder of fy2004 the courts as of the end of april 2004 reported th layoff of 126 court staff provided early outs and buyouts to 268 staff and furloughed proba tion officers and other court staff for total of 745 days more adverse employ ee actions were proj ected for the months immediately thereafter at the march 11 2004 hearing the chai rman of the house cjs subcommittee representative frank r wolf of virginia and the subcommittees ranking democratic member jose serrano of ne w york expressed their desire to do all within the subcommittees power to meet the judiciarys funding needs chairman wolf however commented that in light of the subcommittees limited budget allocation for fy2005 the overall budget incr ease requested by the judiciary in addition to the supplementa l appropriation requested for fy2004 was unlikely on june 23 2004 the house appropr iations committee approved its cjs judiciary appropriations bill for fy2005 the committeeapproved measure hr 4754 provided 555 billion for the judici ary 4144 million or 80 above the judiciarys total appropriations for fy2004 and 1588 million below the judiciarys request in its report on hr 4754 hrept 108576 p 85 the committee stated that its recommendation included increases t provide inflationa ry pay and benefit adjustments for court staff to enhance court security measures to increase the number of positions to handle workload incr eases and to support the judiciarys core information technology infrast ructure upon the report s release staff member on the appropriations committee told the weekly publication legal times that the recommended 80 increase for the judiciar was one of the largest percentage increases for fy2005 received by any partment under the committees purview the legal times story also reported the fears of the judiciary that congress might approve governmentwide fy 2005 budget under which overall nondefense nonhomeland security discre tionary appropriations woul d be set at fy2004 levels referred to on capitol hill as h ardfreeze federal judges the legal times reported fear such hardfreeze on spending will leave courts with money to pay for jury trials or cour tappointed lawyers the legal times said it remainedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs50 unclear what funding the senate will deci upon noting that over the past two years the senate slashed increases proposed by the house in related development the chairman of the senate judiciary committee senator orrin hatch rut wrote to the ch airman and ranking member of the senate appropriations committee to urge sufficien t funding for the judiciary in fy2005 hard freeze senator hatch said would truly cripple the federal judiciary in the coming year and for years to come the senator acknowledged that the appropriations committee faces difficu lt task in fy2005 nonetheless he added i ask that as the committee proceed s it considers the fact that fully operational federal judiciary contributes significantly to the security and stability of our country judiciary funding should be c onsidered priority i urge at minimum the courts funding for fy2005 be sufficien t to allow for current services and operations to be continued subsequently on july 8 2004 the full house in its passage of hr 4754 followed the recommendation of its ppropriations committee in approving 555 billion for the judiciary the housepassed bill made changes in any of the judiciary budget accounts approved earlie r by the appropriations committee during congress ensuing august recess the judicial conference the policy making body of the federal judiciary unan imously adopted resolution regarding the judiciarys fy 2005 budget the resolution adopted on august 18 2004 urged congress and the president to exempt the judicial branch from any fy2005 continuing resolution and to provide fullyear fy2005 funding for the judiciary at least at the current services level appr oved in hr 4754 the housepassed cjs bill the resolution stated that it was imperative that an exemption from any continuing resolution be provided by october 1 2004 t remain at the sa funding level at the beginning of fy2005 the judicial conf erence said would re quire the judiciary to begin unprecedented action cutting opera ting expenses by 50 percent and either firing or furloughing 10 to 20 percent of all judiciary staff the equivalent of 2000 to 5000 probation pretrial serv ices and clerks office empl oyees this action would be necessary due to the uncertainty of time and amount of fu llyear appropriation shortly after congress rec onvened in september th chief justice william h rehnquist reiterated the concerns of the judicial conferen ce in identical letters sent to senate majority leader bill frist and senate democratic leader thomas daschle in the september 13 2004 letter the chief justice requested that congress take timely action to provide funds needed by the federal judiciary for fy2005 to meet its constitutional and statutory responsib ilities the chief justice said he was making this request because of reports th at congress might adjourn for the upcoming elections without passing an appropriations bill for the judicial branch and that funding for the federal courts would be included in longterm continuing resolution cr he added that the judicial c onference was very concerned that under such cr the courts would have to operate at fy2004 funding levels for up to five months until congress enacts final appropr iations bill this he said amounts to hard freeze in appropriations that would be devastating to the judiciary two days later on september 15 2004 the senate appr opriations committee approved its cjs bill s 2809 which pr ovided 536 billion for the judiciary inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs51 fy2005 2302 million or 45 above the judiciarys fy2004 total and 3430 million below the judiciarys request in its written report srept 108344 at p 121 the committee declared that its budget recommendation for the judiciary funds programs necessary to maintain current services and retain current employees the committee said it did n ot support the judici arys request for program increases for personnel at time when the judiciary is planning significant furloughs layoffs and early out programs it urged the judicial conference to consider directing all available funds to th local courts to prevent adverse personnel separations instead of attracting new employees less than week later on septembe r 21 2004 the judicial conference agreed to implement what the legal times reported were 225 million in co stcutting measures including substantial layoffs and moratorium that will freeze plans for 42 new federal courthouses the legal times quoted the chair of the conferences executive committee as saying that be tween 2000 and 4800 judicial employees might be laid off in fy2005 if funding fo r the judiciary under hard freeze were indefinitely kept at fy2004 levels judiciary news releas explained that 42 courthouse projects on the judi cial conferences fiveyear courthouse project plan would be delayed to help redu ce the rate of growth in future rental expenses that the judiciary pays to the general services administration for court facilities for fy2004 the news release said the judi ciary was paying gsa about 900 million in rent for court facilities in anticipation of action by house and senate conferees on the two cjs bills hr 4754 and s 2809 the chairman and the secretary of the j udicial conferences budget committee sent letter dated oct ober 12 2004 to the chairmen and ranking members of the house and senate cjs appropriations subcommittees the judiciary officials stated that while for most of th judiciary the housepassed funding levels were sufficient to provide for current rvices we face significant shortfalls in almost every account if funding is provide d at the levels reco mmended in the senate bill moreover they said the levels of funding contained in both the house and senate bills fell short of the judiciary s fy2005 requirements nonetheless they said the judiciary was well aware of the overall budget constraints under which you congressional appropriators are forced to operate this year thus they continued we have decided not to appeal for the funds necessary to met our fy2005 workload requirements but instead to appeal for the minimum funding needed to maintain fy2004 levels of services and operations for most judiciary accounts that is the housedpassed level of funding but there are couple of exceptions where we find the need to appeal to funding level that is greater than that in both the house and senate bills on november 20 2004 the house nd senate agreed to the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818 as reported by conferees for the omnibus bill and on december 8 2004 president bush signed the bill into law pl 108447 fy2005 funding for the judiciary is provided for in title iii of division b of the act and is discussed in the act s conference report hrept 108792 at pp 814818 as noted above the act after adjusting for two rescissions provides 543 billion in total spending for the judiciary 52 increase over fy2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs52 funding of 516 billion specifically th act appropriates 550 billion for the judiciary as whole 65 increas over fy2004 with total discretionary spending however reduced by 134 as resu lt of two acrosstheboard cuts in the act one of the cuts reduces discretiona ry spending in the cjs division of the act by 054 and the other reduces n ondefense and nonhomeland security discretionary spending throughout the act by 80 the fy2005 omnibus bill includes provision authorizing costofliving salary adjustment for justices and judges in the omnibus bill only one of the judiciarys 13 accounts judiciary retirement funds was unaffected by the 134 acrosstheboard cuts in discretionary spending prior to adjusting for the cuts funding amounts for nine of the 13 judiciarys accounts were identical to those in the earlier housepassed cjs bill hr 4754 while the other four accounts received less funding than in the house bill the increased funding levels approved for the judiciary in the omnibus bill averted disaster according to the legal times there was talk the journal reported on november 29 2004 of additi onal furloughs nonpayment of court appointed lawyers and closing courthouses one day week if substantial budget increases were made in 2005 but such dr astic scenarios were reportedly avoided when congress in the omnibus bill afford ed the judiciary enough funding to avoid further reductions the bottom line is were pretty lucky judiciary spokesman told the legal times adding given the budgetary nvironment its about the best you could have hoped for fy2005 funding issues supreme court the budget request of the supreme court for fy2005 as customary was in two parts for its fi rst account salaries and expenses the court requested 581 million an increase of 33 million or 61 over budget authority of 548 million for fy2004 most of the increase 29 million was requested to fund required increases in sala ry and benefit costs and infl ationary increases in fixed costs the rest of the increase 440000 was requested to fund eight additional positions the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 after adjusting for two rescissions provides 574 million fo r this account 47 increase over the fy2004 amount specifically the act as requested by the c ourt appropriated 581 million for the account with total di scretionary spending however reduced by 134 as result of two acrosstheboard cu ts in the act earlier the full house and the senate appropriations committee in their respective cjsjudiciary appropriations bills also approved 581 million for sa laries and expenses for its second account care of the bu ilding and grounds the court requested 106 milliona decrease of 158 million or 600 from the fy2004 available appropriation of 264 million t he fy2004 total for this account consisted of an enacted appropriation of 106 million with in the judiciary title of the fy2004 consolidated appropriations act pl 108 199 transfer to this account of 160httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs53 million from division h section 106 of th consolidated act and an fy2004 rescission of 206000 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act after adjusting for the two rescissions provides 98 million for care of the building and grounds account 734000 below the courts request th act specifically appropriated 100 million for the account with total discretionary spending however reduced by 134 as result of the two acrosstheboard cuts not ed above earlier the house following the recommendation of its appr opriations committee approved 1 00 million while the senate appropriati ons committee recommended the full 106 million requested by the court the funding requested by the court for fy2005 for building and grounds was divided into budget adjustments to maintain current services and program increases to maintain current services in fy 2005 the court said 39 million was required 225 million less than required in fy2004 n early all of this downward adjustment was due to decrease of 218 million re quested for the courts building modernization project in its budget s ubmission the court stated that funding appropriated in prior years was sufficien t to meet planned obligations for the modernization project through fy2005 and th at additional funding to complete the project would be requested in fy2006 requested program increases for bu ilding and grounds totaled 67 million this funding the court said would cover various projects including modernization of elevators seismic safety study restoration of the or iginal exterior bronze on the court building restoration of stonework additional roof fall protection for worker safety kitchen renovations design for exterior pr operty renovation and building security upgrades the largest portion of funding for program increases would be 36 million to upgrade building security this amount the court explained in its budget submission would provide for the initial costs of the complex and comprehensive installation of security intrusion alarms surveillance monitoring and communications systems in the new operati ons center for the supreme court police force this upgrade to the building s ecurity will effectively accomplish the police force mission and enhance the protection of the justices visitors personnel and building assets hearing on the courts budget reque st was held

the ju stices about particulars of their budget request representatives on the subcommittee sought the justices views concerning the idea of constructing tunnel between the court and the capitol visitors center justice kennedy expressed rese rvations about the feasibility of such tunnel but told the subcommittee that the justices would get back to the subcommittee on the question of whether in their view the c ourt could be linked in some way to the visitors center some members of the subcommittee also expressed concerns that the court might not be publishing or othe rwise making publicly available sufficient information about the courts operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs54 on june 23 2004 the house appropria tions committee approved its cjs judiciary appropriations bill for fy2005 hr 4754 for the courts salaries and expenses account the appropriati ons committee recommended 581 million the same amount as requested by the court for the building and grounds account the committee recommended 100 million 600000 belo w the courts request the recommendation did not include requested funding for renovation of the courts kitchen in its report the committee noted that it had been assured by architect of the capitol staff that the requested modifi cations to the courts kitchen could be deferred and that funds are needed in fy2005 on july 8 2004 the house passed hr 4754 leaving unchanged ll funding amounts that the house appropriations committee had recommended for the judiciary including those for the courts salaries and expens and building and grounds accounts along with its fy2005 funding reco mmendations the house appropriations committee made several requests of the court specifically in its report hrept 108576 at pp 8788 the committee requested from the court within 30 days of enactment of the appropriations bill report on providing improved public access to supreme court proceedings related to this request the committee encouraged the court to pursue internet and audio release of court proceedings in near realtime the committee explained it wants to ensure that the public is provided sufficient insight into the supreme courts ope rations this request language subsequently in november 2004 wa s adopted by reference in the conference report for the fy2005 c onsolidated appropriations act hrept 108792 at p 815 urged the court and the architect to remain diligent in their efforts to control the cost of the courts modernization project and to inform the committee if any changes to the scope of the original project are made in so urging the committee said that it appeared the some of the renovation costs initially included in the modernization project may have been removed and requested separately in the fy2005 request this house report language as well was adopted by reference in the conference report for the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act said the court and the architect of the capitol should provide to

judiciarys request for program increases for salaries and expenses and was extr emely concerned about not furloughing or laying off personnel the committee urged the judicial confer ence to reconsider this course of action by ma king the retention of current personnel top priority and directing funds to the courts to the greates t extent possible to assist them in this perilous situation the conference report for the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hrept 108792 at p 815 noted that its agreement provides 418 billion for salaries and expenses as proposed by th house this amount the

committee recommended 6481 million an 84 increase the housepassed amount and the senatereported amount for defe nder services both included funding to substantially increase the rate of hourly compensation pa id to panel attorneys appointed under the criminal justice act to represent indigents in federal death penalty cases apart from its requests for fy2005 funding the judiciary in its fy2005 budget submission also requested 164 million in supplemental funding for defender services in fy2004 this amount was sought to avert near the end of fy2004 budget shortfall that according to the judiciary would result in threeweek suspension of payments to panel attorneys representing indigent clients in federal criminal cases in response to this re quest congress on july 22 2004 in approving the fy2005 department of defense ppropriations bill pl108287 included 260 million in supplemental funding for the judiciarys defender services accounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs57 specifically for panel attorney compensati on the supplemental brought the total fy2004 appropriation for this account up to 6241 million the consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 enacted december 8 2004 appropr iates6764 million for defender services in fy2005 an 84 increase over total fy2004 funding of 6241 million the appropriation however is subject to 134 cut in discretionary spending s the result of two rescissions in the act which affect judiciary budget accounts leaving defender services with 6673 million in available funding for fy2005 nearly all 95 of the judiciarys requested increase for fy2005 was sought for inflationary and other adjustments to maintain current services inflation and current services adjustments included 459 million to cover increased costs of an additional 11000 projected representations of indigents in noncapital cases cases in which federal prosecutors do not seek to impose the death penalty 3300 representations not funded by th fy2004 appropriation and 35 million in additional costs associated with capital cases cases in which prosecutors do seek the death penalty the increase also incl uded 129 million to provide pay and benefit adjustments to federal fender organization staff and 27 million for 17 hike in the hourly rate paid to pa nel attorneys the hourly rates paid would increase from 90 to 92 for noncapital casts and 125 to 127 for capital cases effective january 1 2005 the judiciary also requested one program increase for the defender services account specifically an increase in the hourly rate of compensation to panel attorneys in capital cases in these cases the current hourly pay rate for panel attorneys in place since 1989 is 125 the judiciary re quested 30 million to allow for the rate to be increased beyond the inflationary increase referred to above to 159 the judiciary noted that the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 established 125 per hour as the statutor maximum while also however providing for annual cost of living adjustments to th is rate the 159 figure according to the judiciary represented the culmination of all statutorily authorized adjustments since 1996 testifying before the house cjs appropriations subcommittee on march 11 2004 judiciary spokesman underscored the n eed for substantial increase in the hourly rate paid to pa nel attorneys in capital cases in his prepared statement us district judge john g heyburn ii said that very limited number of attorneys have the qualifications set by law to re present defendants charged with the death penalty consequently the same lawyers are asked repeatedly to assume this very burdensome respons ibility when lawyers take on capital case he said the remainder of their practice is foregone for the length of the case which frequently lasts at least two years since most of these lawyers are sole practitioners or in very small firms their sole source of inco for the duration becomes the 125 an hour paid by the government well below the ra tes charged in private practice the 125 rate judge heyburn said must cover not only the attorneys salary but also overhead expenses including retirement nd benefits and salary for office staff during the case future work is foregone and the law practice has to be rebuilt at the cases conclusion furthe r judge heyburn observed the number of capital cases is increasing he concluded that the hourly pay for panel attorneys in capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs58 cases needs to be raised to level wher upon finishing capital case lawyer will be willing to take on more such cases in the future on june 23 2004 the house appropr iations committee approved hr 4754 its cjsjudiciary appropriations bill for fy2005 for the defender services account the appropriations committee recomme nded 6765 million the recommendation as the judiciary requested provided panel attorneys with an inflationary pay rate increase and increased the hourly rate fo r representation in capital cases from 127 to 159 the co mmittee noted that its recommendation also included as the judiciary requested an increase of 459 million above the fy 2004 appropriation for additional representations of indigents in noncapital cases the committee approved funding amount for defender serv ices in fy2005 was left unchanged when the house passed hr 4754 on july 8 2004 on

than the judiciaryre quested and housea pproved rate this increase the committee said was needed to maintain high quality of panel representations in addition s 2809 as reported increas ed the maximum compensation limits for panel attorneys specified under section 3006ad2 of title 18 of the us code the bill for instance increased the maximum compensation for panel attorney representing defendant before federal magistrate or dist rict court judge in case in which one or more felonies are charged from 5200 to 7000 other pay rate maximums such as for representing defendant in an appellate court or in case in which only misdemeanors are charged also are increased in the bill in its report the appropriations committee said the increase in maximum pay limits was included in s 2809 to make the representation co mpensation more accurately reflect actual expenses the committee said that the case compensation maximum amounts currently in effect are creating an unnecessary hardship on panel attorneys court staff and judges as noted above the consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 enacted december 8 2004 appropria tes 6764 million for defender services in fy2005 compared with 6765 milli on earlier approved by the house and 6481 million recommended by the senate appropria tions committee the appropriation however is subject to 134 cut in discretionary spending as the result of

request the committee however stated it would reconsid er the expenditure of additional funds for court security in fy2005 when the partment of homela nd security provided sufficient justification for federal protective service charges assigned to the account the consolidated appropriations act pl 108 447 enacted d ecember 8 2004 appropriates 3320 million for the cour t security account 209 increase over fy2004 f unding 476 million less than proposed by the house and 573 million more than proposed by the senate the appropriation in the omnibus act however is subject to 134 rescission in discretionary spending leaving court security with 3276 million in available funding for fy2005 in the judiciarys fy2005 request 753 million was included for federal protective service fps charges which in previous fiscal years were charged as general services administration gsa rent and funded from the judiciarys salaries and expenses and defender services account s specifically for fps charges the judiciarys fy2005 request shifted to c ourt security 740 million from salaries and expenses and 13 million from fenders services in its budget submission the judiciary explained that with the relocation of the fps from gsa to the department of homeland security fps basic security rvices are longer component of the rental charge and funds will not remain with gsa consequently these security services should be funded out of the c ourt security account as are other security functions shifting fps cost s to court security the j udiciary explained is budget neutral ie the costs are neither increased nor decreased by being shifted to court security apart from the 753 million transfer for fps charges the largest funding increase requested for court security was 201 million for security systems and equipment the court security appropriation the j udiciary noted in its budget submission was approximately ven percent of the judiciarys total budget and with the nationwide emphasis on security it has become one of the highest priority programs of the judiciary the majority of f unding provided for court security each fiscal year is transferred by the judiciary to the us marshals service in the department of justice which is responsible for administering the judicial facility security program hr 4754 which passed the house on july 8 2004 provided 3796 million for court security an increase of 1050 million or 382 above the fy2004 level and 37 million below the judiciarys request the housepassed amount was the same as that recommended earlier by the house appropriations committee in its report hrept 108576 at p 90 the committee said its recommendations among other things httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs60 shifted funding for fps costs from the salaries and expenses account to court security as the judiciary requested provided for inflationary incr eases additional equipment and security systems and new contr act court security officers and funded program increase for add itional staff to assist the us marshals service in managing the judicial facility security program in its report the appropriations committee said as well that it remained concerned about the administration of the j udicial facility security program the committee directed the marshals service and the administrative office of the us courts to submit quarterly reports to the committee on courthouse security equipment and systems spending throughout fy2005 s 2809 which was approved by the senate appropriations committee on september 15 2004 provided 27465 llion for court security an increase of 73000 or less than 1 above the fy2004 appropriation and 1086 million below the judiciarys request the senate committee in its report sr ept 108344 at p 126 noted that the judiciarys budget request assumed the transf er of fps security costs previously paid for under the judiciarys salaries and expenses and defe nder services accounts to the court security account th committee however stated that its recommendation did not include this transfer rather the committee said it was concerned over the size of the increase in fps costs in fy2005 and prohibits the expenditure of any additiona l funds until sufficient justification for the 34 percent increase to the judiciary is provided to the administrative office of the us courts by the department of homela nd security once breakout of the full fps security costs by federal agency is provided the committee explained it would reconsider both the prohibition on the expenditure of the additional funds and the transfer of these funds to this account the issue over the appropriate amount of f ps security costs to transfer to the court security account was addressed by conferees for the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108 447 in their report hrept 108792 at p 816 the conferees explained that thei r agreement includes funding for most but not all of the fps charge for security services the conferees understand that the fps has not provided the administrative office ao of the us courts with detailed justification to substantiate the 34 percent increase in fps security costs ssessed to the judiciary in fiscal year 2005 as discussed in the senate report the conferees are unable to confirm the need for an increase and therefore the conference agreement only provides 58000000 for security charges which is the fiscal year 2004 payment plus an inflationary cost increase httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32309crs61 table 8 fy2005 funding for the judiciary millions of
