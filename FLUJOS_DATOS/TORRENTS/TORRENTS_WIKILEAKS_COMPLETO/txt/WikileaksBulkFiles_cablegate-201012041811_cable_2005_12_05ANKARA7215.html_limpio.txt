12072015 tags econ pgov pinr political parties subject splits in turkeys governing akp parliamentary group for now ref ankara 6543 b ankara 6251 c ankara 6337 classified by polcouns janice g weiner eo 12958 reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary despite media reports and opposition rumors of splits among pm erdogans justice and development partys akp 357 parliamentarians the group remains intact for now among akp mps there are distinctive pious pragmatic and nationalist currents with crosscutting personal loyalties recent events in turkeys heavilykurdish southeast have heightened tensions between akps kurdishorigin mps and the rest of the parliamentary group while akp mps numbers may slowly erode over the next year ref major split is unlikely as long as akp and in particular pm erdogan retain power and popularity end summary despite wishful thinking akp not crumbling yet 2 c over the past year the turkish press has repeatedly predicted open splits in the 357member akp parliamentary group while akp has ideological and personalitybased fault lines there appears to be little chance of major split while akp remains turkeys number one party and erdogan the countrys most popular politician even ankara akp mp ersonmez yarbay maverick frequently openly critical of his own party downplayed to us the rumors of party splits saying they have been fueled by the opposition to force early elections akps ideological currents 3 c akps parliamentary group is composed of politicians with widely differing viewpoints there are three main ideological currents pious nationalist and pragmatic most akp mps do not fall neatly into any one category and personal loyalties crosscut ideology mostly among pious mps pious 4 c almost all akp mps are religiously observant to some degree for example the vast majority fast during ramadan however there is large and distinctively more pious group of mps comprising former members of the banned islamist virtue fazilet party former members of the national view islamist youth group and members of wide range of officially banned muslim brotherhoods most of akps top leaders fall into this group pm erdogan dpmfm abdullah gul parliament speaker arinc vice speaker alptekin former pm and islamic saadet party head erbakans righthand man and all five of akps parliamentary whips pious mps generally represent the central anatolian heartland speak english and have traveled little 5 c while most turkish islamists oppose the eu akps islamist mps toe the akp line and support it albeit less enthusiastically since october 3 typical of turkish islamists they dislike turkeys military and have ties to it other than their required military service attitudes about the us vary widely from friendly to suspicious but most favor better ties with the muslim world although the got under erdogans leadership has taken politically courageous public stand favoring privatization and foreign investment many pious mps oppose both 6 c akps pious mps are widely rumored to be deeply unhappy about pm erdogans inability to ease restrictions on the wearing of headscarves and on religious schools however since akp came to power in november 2002 akp mp has resigned and gone over to the happiness saadet party on akps islamist flank nationalists 7 c it is hard to find turk who is not nationalistic yet significant number of akp mps as many as 50 according to one former mp many of them former members of the ultranationalist national action party mhp or centerright true path party dyp are strong nationalists even by turkish standards this group includes justice minister and party spokesman cemil cicek deputy pm abdullatif sener state minister kursad tuzmen and parliament vice speaker sadik yakut 8 c among akp mps nationalists take the hardest line against concessions8 to the eu and on cyprus mfa officials have told us on several occasions that the got is delaying bringing the ankara agreement extension protocol to parliament for ratification out of concern for the reaction of nationalist akp mps ref b nationalist akp mps are deeply suspicious about the motives of turkeys ethnic kurds and were vocal critics of pm erdogans august declaration in diyarbakir that turkey has kurdish problem8 like their pious colleagues nationalists attitudes about the us vary widely from friendly to suspicious however even prous nationalists become extremely prickly at any perceived us slight to turkish national honor pragmatists 9 c akps pragmatic mps generally speak english are foreigneducated and tend to be bettertraveled than their colleagues they often come from large cosmopolitan areas particularly ankara or istanbul some were previously members of the centerright motherland party anap three of akps five vice chairs who frequently deal with foreigners are from the pragmatic wing bulent gedikli reha denemec and saban disli all are useducated and represent either istanbul or ankara the same is true for pragmatic erdogan translator and foreign policy advisor egemen bagis who accompanies the pm on his trips to europe and the us 10 c although the pragmatic mps are often akps most visible face to foreigners they have less influence inside akp than their pious and nationalist colleagues in early 2005 there were signs of frustration among akps moderates when spate of akp mp resignations went mostly to anap culture minister mumcu akps highestprofile resignation who went on become anaps chairman said publicly he had only felt like guest8 in akp ref c 11 c erdogan can ill afford to lose the pragmatists in addition to giving akp reasonable bigtent image that plays well in the us and europe akps pragmatists are links to istanbul and ankara elites these mps are akps friendliest face toward the us bagis heads parliaments turkeyus friendship committee and most receptive to liberal political and open market economic reforms needed for eu accession crosscutting personal loyalties 12 c akp mps are as divided by personality as by politics but personalitybased fault lines crosscut ideological ones pm erdogan is the glue that holds akp together chunk of akp mps were part of erdogans team when he was istanbul mayor and have followed him onto the national stage they include finance minister unakitan transportation minister yildirim state minister cubukcu akp whip irfan gunduz and erdogan speechwriter huseyin besli all are personally pious or in cubukcus case at least have consistently supported positions of the partys pious wing cubukcu female was one of the few mps who publicly supported erdogans 2004 proposal to recriminalize adultery 13 c erdogan has consistently protected all three istanbul ministers despite repeated calls for their resignation many other akp mps profess staunch loyalty to tayyip bey8 and seek to stay close to him one contact suggests that erdogans strategy is to keep subordinates competing with each other for his attention so they are too busy to be threat to him 14 c dpmfm gul remains erdogans chief political rival within akp their differences are not ideological gul and erdogan are both pious but spring from guls ambitions for greater power gul who represents the parliamentary faction of the banned virtue party has small quiet following among ak mps that includes whip salih kapusuz from guls home town of kayseri former akp public relations vice chair murat mercan sacked for incompetence by erdogan earlier this year and taner yildiz also from kayseri 15 c parliament speaker arinc is akps third leading personality and potential future rival to erdogan however arinc is well behind gul in influence and according to our contacts currently without significant group of mp loyalists akps kurdish mps 16 c about 60 akp mps mostly from turkeys southeast are of kurdish origin political and legal affairs vice chair dengir mir firat is akps most visible kurdish mp the kurds who joined akp and were elected to parliament tend to be pious stressing the common bonds among all muslims over kurdish nationalism the strongest kurdish nationalists ran from the prokurdish democratic peoples party dehap in 2002 elections and failed to enter parliament because dehap did not cross the ten percent electoral threshold one former kurdishorigin mp himself pious has consistently told us even he considers akps kurdish mps extraordinarily passive on kurdish issues 17 c yet recent events in the southeast including akp nationalists reaction against pm erdogans august kurdish problem8 speech in diyarbakir and alleged jandarma involvement in november bombing in the southeastern town of semdinli have created tension between akps kurdishorigin mps and the rest of the parliamentary group an ankara provincial akp official told us recently that tension with akps kurdishorigin mps has infected akps pious wing weakening it relative to other akp factions 18 c comment akps parliamentary strength so far springs from erdogans ability to keep such diverse group of mps united and the lack of any viable opposition the question is whether erdogan can continue to keep the parliamentary group together without turning akp into an internallyundemocratic personalitybased party in the classic turkish tradition akps opposition will eventually come from inside akp itself however for now erodgan appears well in control and there is viable political alternative for dissatisfied akp mps end comment wilson
