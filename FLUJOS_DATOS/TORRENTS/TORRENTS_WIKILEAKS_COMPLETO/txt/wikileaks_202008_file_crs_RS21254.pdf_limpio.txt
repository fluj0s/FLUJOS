proponent s of vouchers claim that americas elementary and secondary educati onal system are in disrepair and can only be revitalized by making schools compete to attract students vouchers they argue are the most feasible way to inject competition into education critics of vouchers decry the loss of money to public schools and charge that when vouchers can be used to attend religious school the

1 1947applying the establishment clause of the first amendment against the states 3 403 us 602 1971was to give poor families in the cleveland public school system an opportunity to send their children largely at state expense to schools they prefer to their local public school as designed the program provided scholar ships worth up to 2250 year for children to attend either private sc hools within the city limits including sectarian schools or public schools in the school districts around cl eveland participa ting schools could give preference in admission on the basis that the students parents were affiliated with any organization that provides fi nancial support to the school but could not discriminate on the basis of race religion or ethnic back ground the program does not place restrictions on the use of the funds monies received thr ough the program could apparently be used by the schools to further religious manda and not just secular purposes as an alternative to the voucher prog ram parents may also accept torial aid to obtain special help for students opting to remain in the clev eland schools vouchers and tutorial aid are only one aspect of ohios school choice progra m the cleveland school district also offers parents the choice to send their children to community or magnet school which are secular public schools within the city limits of cleveland but opera independently of traditional cleveland schools the program went into effect in the 1996 97 school year over the years none of the surrounding public school districts has chos to participate in the program and 82 percent of the private schools that participat ed were sectarian however the ratio of secular to sectarian private schools participating in the voucher program does not appear to be disproportionate ce 81 percent of the private schools in ohio are religious schools of the participatin g religious schools most were pervasively sectarian they wove religion into traditional courses of study mandated partic ipation in religious services and required students to take religious courses most students in the voucher program attended these schools in the 1999 2000 school year 96 percent of the students participating in the voucher pr ogram chose to attend sectar ian schools up from 78 percent in the 19971998 school year however wh including the population of students participating in other aspects of ohios school choice program by opting to attend community or magnet school the number of students attending sectarian schools drops from 96 to 20 percent discussion when public dollars flow from public to religious coffers as they do when vouchers are used by parents for relig ious schools it may violate the fourteenth amendment which applies the establishment clause of the first amendment against the states directing them to make law respecting an establishment of religion2 in lemon v kurtzman the supreme court set forth the following test to determine whether statute withstands constitutional scrutiny 1 the statute must have secular legislative purpose 2 the principal or primary effect of the statute must neith er advance nor inhibit religion and 3 the statute must not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion3 in agostini v felton case involving direct aid to religious schools the court folded the second and third prongs of the test together since both inquiries largely rely on the same evidence and the degree of tanglement has implications for whether ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21254crs3 4 zelman 536 us __ slip op at 7

in cases of direct governmental aid the court has been consistent in cases involving true private choice pr ograms or indirect aid and has affirmed the use of this test in those cases particularly the primary effects prong5 the ohio voucher program may result in indi rect aid of religion since public dollars may flow from state to religious coffers through private citizens an independent choice not governmental decree determines whet her religious school receives public aid as in most indirect aid cases the primary question posed by zelman v simmonsharris is how to apply the primary effects prong in other indirect aid cases the court has reached mixed results in committee for public education v nyquist the court struck down new york tuition subsidy program for lowincome students in private elementary and secondary schools6 the program failed the lemon tests second prong since it was confined to children attending private sc hools most of those schools 8590 were pervasively sectarian and as consequen ce the programs had primary purpose and effect of subsidizing such schools7 moreover the use of th aid was not restricted it could be used by participatin g schools to further their religious mandate on the other hand the court has upheld vouche r and tax programs that be nefit religious schools in mueller v allen the court upheld program that llowed parents of elementary and secondary school children to deduct educational expenses fro m their state taxes which would include deductions of tuiti on payments to sectarian schools8 in witters v washington department of services for the blind the court upheld vocational rehabilitation program that allowed blind student to attend bible college9 in upholding the programs the court stressed that they were designed as general welfare programs and did not specifically aim to provide aid to religious organizations instead they distributed funds to religious organiza tions based on religiously neutral criteria and only as result of the independent c hoices of the individual beneficiaries10 the sixth circuit held that the ohio program was closer to nyquist than mueller or witters and accordingly held it unconstitutional11 given that public school and few secular private schools opted to participate ohios program created an incentive for parents to send their children to religi ously affiliated school s the court found accordingly the choice the program provi ded was illusory and clearly had the impermissible effect of promoting sectarian schools the court held12 the low level scholarship amount the court found was the pr ograms primary flaw since it essentially locked out most private secular schools from participating but encouraged sectarianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21254crs4 13 id at 961 14 zelman 536 us at __ slip op at 7 oconnor j concurring 15 zelman 536 us at __ slip op at 7 opinion of the court 16 id at __ slip op at 10 17

truly private choice when available choices resulting from the program design are predominately religious the court concluded13 reversing the sixth circuit the supreme court held that the ohio program was closer to mueller and witters than nyquist according to the five justice majority this result did not signal major departur from the courts prior establishment jurisprudence even though th majority never cited the lemon test14 as there was dispute that the voucher program was enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children the only question before the court was whether the program had the forbidden effect of advancing or inhibiting religion15 where government aid program is neutral with respect to re ligion and provides assistance directly to broad class of citizens who in turn direct governmental aid to religious schools wholly as result of their own ge nuine and independent private choice the program is not readily subject to ch allenge under the establishment clause16 under such programs the court found that the in cidental advancemen t or endorsement of religion through the use of public dollars is reasonably attributable to the individual decisionmaker not to the government w hose role ends with the disbursement of benefits17 empirical data suggesting that the ohio voucher program had th primary effect of advancing religion did not significantly in fluence the courts analysis the court attached constitutional significance to the f act the majority of participating private schools were religious and found it irrelevant that most pare nts receiving vouchers chose to use them at religious school since the court could perceive principled standards by which such statistical evidence might be evaluated18 for instance statistics indicate that 96 percent of the students participa ting in the voucher prog ram chose to attend sectarian schools up from 78 percent in the 19971998 school year however when including the population of stude nts participating in other as pects of ohios school choice program eg those opting to attend co mmunity or magnet school the number of students attending sectaria n schools drops from 96 to 20 percent the court found that it would be arbitrary to onl sample students pa rticipating in the voucher program and exclude students attending comm unity or magnet schools thus the court deemphasized the significance of empirical data in evaluating whether the program had the primary effect of advancing religionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21254crs5 19 id at

qualities of the voucher program and held that it was program of true private choice19 the court found that the program was entirely neutral with respect to religion since it provided aid to wide spectrum of individuals who were defined only by fi nancial need and resi dence and made reference to religion as condition for partic ipation in the program moreover it found that there were financial incentives that skewed the program toward religious schools20 the court also found that the prog ram permitted qualifying individuals to exercise genuine choice among options pub lic and private secular and religious21 specifically parents may remain in public sc hool as before remain in public school with publicly funded tutoring aid obtain scholar ship and choose religious school obtain scholarship and choose nonr eligious school enroll in community school or enroll in magnet school22 accordingly the court concluded that the principal or primary effect of the voucher program neither advanced nor i nhibited religion and held that the program did not violate the establishment clause four dissenting justices emphasized that under existing precedent tax in any amount large or small can be vied to support any religious activ ities or in stitutions whatever they may be called or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion23 under this general rule the dissent would have held the voucher program unconstitutional since the overwhelming proportion of larg appropriations for voucher money must be spent on religious schools and therefore will pay for eligible students instruction not only in secular s ubjects but in religion as well 24 the dissent critiqued the majority opinion as dramatic departure from basic establishment clause principle25
