system finally some proposals that do not involve amending the imfs article s might also be expressed in legislation the imfs articles have been amended three times and appropriately th changes have been designated the first second and third amendments the first amendment created the special drawing right sdr an international reserv asset issued by the imf the second amendment was the first and so far onl comprehensive rewrite of the imfs articles of agreement it legitimized the floating exchange rate system that replaced the fixed exchange rate bretton woods system in the early 1970s the third amendment approved in 1992 addressed the problem of buildup of arrears that were owed by the poorer countries and that threatened the imfs own liquidity the period 19971999 has been one of enormous economic and financ ial turmoil an examination of the history of amendments to the imfs charter however shows much that is familiar including increased levels of crossborder capital flows increased economic integration increased marketpricing of exchange rates th preeminence of the market over the regulator and financial innovation the significant difference is the extent to which emerging market countries transitional economies and the poorer less developed countries have become part of the global economy this has been abetted by major advances in communications technology these changes turned financial crisis in thailand into global crisis number of proposals are emerging that are intended to reform the imf and the architecture of the international monetary syste m proposed fourth amendment like the third amendment reflects the n umber of transitional and poor countries that form the imfs membership and loan base the fourth amendment would provide additional liqu idity to some 39 member countries by permitting targeted allocation of sdrs this would require congressional approval but not u s budgetary funding finally controversi proposal to amend the imfs

articles of agreement today the imf with nearly universa l membership of 182 countries is still the centerpiece of the world financial system that system however underpins world economy that is vastly different from th wartorn and underdeveloped world of the immediate postwar era thus as th world economy has changed the imf has also had to change major changes in the imf and the international monetary system have bee n reflected in amendments to the imfs articles of agreement these have bee n amended three times and appropriately the changes have been designated the first second and third amendments the f irst two amendments were driven by systemic changes while the third amendment was driven by an institutional problem build up of loan arrears to the imf itself likewise some of the proposals emerging out of the rece nt global financial crisis are likely to be expressed as and embodied i n amendments to the imfs articles of agreement under the imfs rules amendments to the imfs articles require approval by an 85 majority of the imfs total v oting power this requirement gives the united states with 1756 of the total voting power veto authority over changes in th imfs articles more importantly under the bretton woods agreement act p l 79171 22 usc 286 any proposed amendment to the imfs articles f agreement r equires congressional approval thus by extension the us congress has veto power over any proposed changes in the imfs articles of agreement beyond the specif ic issue of amending the imfs articles the us congress is certain to play an active oversight role in regard to any proposed changes in th structure of the imf or in the architecture of the international monetary system finally some proposals that do not involve an amendment to th imfs articles might also be expressed in legislation this report provides brief history of past reforms to the imfs articles f agreement it also examines briefly actions taken by the 105 congress and someth of the new proposals for reforming the imf and the arch itecture of the international monetary system two paired and related questions underlie the analysis wha t aspects of the present debate rep resent continuation of earlier trends what is new about the present debate thus the report is intended to provide to the congress an understanding of the historical conte xt and partial framework for understanding the emerging reform debate this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs2 the balance of payments is statistical statement summarizing the economic transactions1 during given perio d usually one year between the residents of one country and the rest of the world the balance of payments is based on doubleentry book keeping thus it must always balance that is statist ically its total is always 0 when analysts speak of deficit or surplus the are referring to specific components of the balance of payments in the 1960s and 1970s analysts of the us balance of payments position tended to focus on the sum of two specific components of the balance of p ayments the current account and the long term capital account the current account is the net balance of payments arising from th export and import of goods and services together with unilateral transfers the latte r including gifts emigran ts transfers and remittances the capital account represents the net transfer of short and longterm financial movements including loans credits direct an d portfolio investment longterm is defined as more than one year deficit on curren t account must always be financed by surplus on capital accountthe first three amendments brief history the first amendment to the imfs articles of agreement effective in 1969 resulted from systemic problem with regards to liquidity the exchange rate system established at bretton woods was g olddollar standard that is all major currencies were convertible at fixed rates into the us dollar which in turn was convertibl into gold at the fixed price of 35 per fine ounce an expansion in international trade and economic growth required an increase in international liquidity that is n increase in central bank holdings of the two major international reserve assets gold and the us dollar by the 1960s with the economic recovery of europe well advanced the slow growth in gold supplies was hampering the growth of international reserve assets as result the system became largely dependent on the other major international reserve asset the us dollar the expansion of doll ar reserves in turn was dependent on an outflow of dollars from the united states an increase in dollar reserves thus depended on the continuation of large u s b alanceofpayments deficit the us1 deficit was largely caused by huge longterm capital transfers from both the public and private sectors continued us deficits how ever were turning the dollar shortage of the immediate postwar years into dollar glut the international monetary system had become depe ndent upon the continuation and expansi on of the us balanceofpayments deficit for the provision of adequate liquidity to support international trade and economic growth major systemi c problem this systemic re liance on the us dollar as reserve asset gave rise to the socalled triffin dilemma after economist robert triffin if on the one hand th united states did not curb its def icit there would eventually be crisis of confidence in the us dollar because the united states would eventually have insufficient gold reserves to convert outstanding foreign holdings of dollars into gold as the bretton woods system required if on the other hand the us did curb its deficit th creation of international reserves would be inadequate to support expanded worl d trade and economic growth stated another way the choice was between instability and deflation the response to the triffin dilemma was the first amendment to the imf s articles of agreement the first amendment created new international reserv ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs3 for more information on the sdr see crs report 97738 the imfs proposed special2 drawing rights sdrs allocation background paper by patricia wertman asset the special drawing right sdr then sometimes referred to as pape r2 gold the sdr was to stand along with the us dollar and gold as an international reserve asset it was intended to sever the link between dollar surpluses and th creation of international liquidity by the time of the ratification of the first amendment events in the worl d economy were already m oving beyond the liquidity issues of the 1960s instead the focus was now on the adjustment process both with regard to balanceofpayments adjustment in general and exchange rate adjustment in particular large an d prolonged us balance of payments deficit was mirrored by its counterpart larg surpluses in the balance of payments of other major industrial countries as result much of the 1960s was cha racterized by substantial currency instability as liberalized capital flows brought about repeated exchange rate crises in the supposedly fixed exchange rate bretton woods system in 1970 resumption in capital outflows from the united states which d briefly been reversed in 1968 and 1969 reflected continuation of inflation within the us domestic economy and declining confidence in the us dollar foreig n central banks increasingly became reluctant holders of us dollars and bega n exchanging their dollar reserves for us gold holdings this led to us suspension of gold convertibility on august 15 1971 at the socalled smithsonian meeting in december 1971 the finance ministers of the major industrial countries realigned their exchange rat and the united states devalued the dollar by raising the official price of gold from 35 to 38 per fine ounce with continued currency instability however the bretton w oods system of fixed exchange rates finally collapsed amidst generalized floating of the major currencies in march 1973 the major purpose of the imf as originally conceived at bretton woods to maintain fixed exchange rates was thus at an end the second amendment to the imfs articles of agreement was the upshot of the collapse of the bretton woods system of fixe d exchange rates and the generalized floating of the worlds major currencies in march 1973 the second amendment was ratified on april 1 1978 it was the first and so far the only comprehensive rewrite of the imfs articles it enshrined the floatingrate exchange rate system that wa s already in place officially ended the international monetary role of gold althoug h gold remains an international monetary asset and nominally but unsuccessfully made the sdr the worlds principal reserve asset from the vantage point of todays international financial turmoil it is important to note that the crisis of the early 1970s was underpinned by increased capital account liberalization that is by the liberalization of financial flows between countries in this case between th major industrial countries beginning in the late 1950shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs4 the united kingdom was the last of the g10 industrial countries the g7 countries which3 include the united states germany ja pan france united kingdom italy and canada plus belgium netherlands and sweden to borrow from the imf its last use of fund credi t occurred in 1982reflected increasing levels of world t rade and economic growth and therefore greater economic integration terminated fixed exchange r ate regime for the major currencies and replaced it with floating exchange rates was marketd riven and thus to some extent placed regulators and financial officials in the position of playing catch up to systemic change and involved an early postwar example of financial innovation that is th emergence of the eurodollar and other offshore currency markets thus in some sense the recent global fin ancial crisis looks not like something wholly new but rather like continuation and expansion of existing trends major effect of the demise of the system of fixed exchange rates among th major industrial countries was that the imf virtually ceased lending to the majo r industria l countries after 1978 when the united states drew its reserve tranche 3 decolonization however meant that many newly emerged developing countries had become imf members substantially altering the imfs membership base othe r developmen ts also helped to change the character and direction of the imf th 19731974 run up in international oil prices as result of concerted action by th organization of petroleum exporting countries opec created large international payments imbalances while the major industrial countries were able to finance their balanceofpayments deficits in private financial mar kets the oilimporting developing countries turned to the imf and to the major private comme rcial banks which needed to recycle these socalled petrodollars that is to put to work the financial surpluses that they were receiving as deposits from the oilexporting nations by fostering the buildup of external debt among the developing countries the 1970s petrodollar crisis in turn set the stage for the third world debt crisis tha t began in august 1982 with default by mexico with us support perhap s insistence the imf was placed at the center of the strategy to solve the 1980s debt crisis similarly in t he 1990s it was placed at the center of western efforts to assist the formerly communist nations that are now making the difficult transition to market economies thus by february 28 1999 the i mfs total loan portfolio an amount totaling about 884 billion sdr 647 billion was comprised solely of loans to developing countries and transitional economies arguably the changed com position of the imfs loan portfolio led to the third amendment of the imfs articles of agreement beginning in the early 1980s the imf began t experience difficulties with the overdue repayment of its loans since the imf is r evolving fund arrears impair its ability to continue making loans raisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs5 on october 8 1985 us secretary of the treasury james ba ker iii speaking at the joint4 annual meeting of the imf and the w orld bank in seoul korea made proposal for solving the international debt problem key aspect of the proposal was its recognition of an d emphasis on the structural aspects of the debt problem it was this microeconomic emphasis that represented maj or policy shift from earlier approaches to the problem for additional information see crs report 97661 us i nternational debt strategy the brady plan revisited by patricia wertman for more information on the quota increase and the nab see crs report 9856 the5 internation monetary funds imf proposed quota increase issues for congress and crs report 97468 the imfs proposed new arrangements to borrow nab n overview both by patricia wertman the cost of its loans to borrowers and potentially constit ute threat to the imfs own financial viability the imf undertook several steps both to resolve and prevent problems wit h arrears the third amendment which entered into effect on november 11 1992 was the most important of the steps the imf t ook to resolve its problem with arrears it applies only to imf members that have already been declared ineligible to use the imfs general resources because of arrears in their payments to the imf the third amendment allows the imfs executive board to decide by 70 majority of the total voting power to suspend the voting and certain related rights of any ineligible member persisting in arrears suspension is an intermediate step between declaration of ineligibility and compulsory withdrawal as of april 1998 th executive board had suspended the voting and related rights of two imf members the democratic republic of the congo and sudan the arrears problem peaked i n 1992 and has since been substantially reduced it is important to note that some of these arrears arise from political causes for example the breakup of yugoslavia finally the cha nged character of loan recipients meant that beginning at least with the baker plan in 1985 as somewhat arbitrary marker imf loan s4 increasingly involved structural or m icroeconomic conditionality along with the more traditio nal macroeconomic conditionality in the view of some particularly loa n recipients imf conditionality has thus become more extensive and intrusive this has also certainly made imf conditionality more controversial the 105 congress and the imf laying theth groundwork congress is responsible for authorizing and appropriating all us financia l commitmen ts to the imf with the passage and signing of the omnibu s consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy 1999 hr 4328 p l 105277 cong ress appropriated the full funding requested for the imf the dollar equivalent of sdr 106225 million for us par ticipation in the imf quota increase is scored in the fy 1999 budget as 145 billion the sdr 2462 millio n funding required for us participation in the new arrangements to borrow nab as 34 billion5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs6 in an unprecedented move the 105 congress stipulated that the newl yth appropriated funds could not be made available until 15 days fter the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the federal reserve board provided writte n notificati on that the major shareholders had publicly agreed to act to implemen t specific policies within the imf specifically conditionality on imf loans is t promote policies that liberalize restrictions on trade in goods and services tha t eliminate the practice of governmentdirected lending on noncommercial terms and that establish legal basis for nond iscriminatory treatment in insolvency proceedings in addition the imf is to begin making its executive board minutes and loa n documents letter s of intent memoranda of understanding and policy framework papers pub licly available finally when country is experiencing shortterm loss of confidence imf loans are to carry shorter maturi ties and bear higher interest rates requirement that is now em bodied in the imfs new supplemental reserve facility srf number of statements issued on october 30 1998 by the imfs majo r shareholders the g7 countries are taken as fulfilling this requirement for public declaration of support for the specified policies certification was sent to congress on november 2 1998 the nab entered into effect on november 17 1998 th quota increase became effective on january 22 1999 historically requests for funding the imf have been the occasion for vigorous congressi onal oversight of the imfs policies programs and performance at th same time congressional oversight also has been limited largely to those occasion s when funding has been requested thus the last previous instance of intensiv oversight occurred in 1992 when the quota increase that immediately preceded this one was appr oved in p l 105277 however the 105 congress laid th eth groundwork for much more active and continuous oversight f the imf particularly with regard to the emerging issue of international fin ancial reform this was achieved in number of ways notably including establishing for duration of six mo nths an international financial institution advisory commission with br oad mandate to advise and report to congress on international financial issues especially system reform requiring an annual report and testimony by the secretary of the treasury on the state of the international financial system imf reform and complianc with imf agreements providing for annual audits of the imf by the general accounting offic gao and instructing the secretary of the treasury to seek to establish permanen t advisory committee to the interim committee of the imf that would consist of elected members of the national legislatures of the five countries tha t appoint mem bers to the imfs executive board including the united states which is the imfs largest shareholderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs7 list of the reporting requirements is contained in table 1 at the end of this report6 on february 12 1999 the democratic leade r of the senate and the minority leader of the7 house announced the appointment of richard l huber jerome l levinson jeffrey d sachs esteban torres and paul volcker to the internationa l financial institution advisory commission members proposed by th majority apparently include charles w calormiris alan meltzer lawrence lindsay edward fuelner and manley johnsonthese provisions are ampli fied by additional reporting requirements notably by two6 reports on the architect ure of the international monetary system due on july 15 of 1999 and 2000 and by requirements for greater imf transparency taken as whole the newly enacted legislation opens up the imf for congressional examination to an unprecedented degree pl 105277 mandates that the international financial institution advisor commissi on include eleven members the house and senate majority and minority leadership appoint the commission member s originally to have been not later than 45 days after enactment of the law that is by october 21 1998 four of the 1 17 appointees must have been officers or employees of the executive branch prior t january 20 1992 but more than two of these are to have served under presidents from the same political party the commission could contribute to broader an d fuller discussion of international financial issues at this critical time finally p l 105277 so included significant number of policy prescriptions or admonitions regarding the imf and its programs alt hough it remains to be seen exactly what the impact of these provisions will be it would appear that given their broadranging nature they are likely to strengthen the imf and expand its activities this is perhaps ironic given the extreme controversy that surrounded the imf s performance in the ongoing global financial crisis during the last congress p l 105277 instructed the us executive director to the imf to use th voice and vote of the united states to advocate p olicies within the imf that would among other things promote exchange rate stability and avoid competitiv devaluations promote marketoriented reform and t rade liberalization open domestic markets to competition and deregulation strengthen social safety nets encourage the opening of markets to agricultural commodities strengthen the financial systems of developing countries and promote sound banking practic facilitate the development of domestic bankrup tcy laws and burdensharing by private creditors strengthen the imfs crisisprevention mechanisms and surveillance promote good governance including reductions in excessive military spending improve core labor standards promote environmental protection and promote credit to small business much f this suggests much more intrusive imfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs8 for more information on the sdr see crs report 97738 the

sales see crs report 96810 internationa l9 monetary fund imf gold auctions current proposal history and congressional role by patricia wertman the proposal was initially stalled by the objections of the german and italian governments these two gover nments have now dropped their opposition and the proposal has been revitalized by renewed support from the us government and its linkage to the hipc initiativeimf reform current proposals for amending the imfs articles in september 1997 proposal to again am end the imfs articles of agreement the fourth amendment was adopted by the board of governors of the imf the proposed fourth amendment like the third amendment reflects the imf s position as lender to developing and transitional economies it would permit special onetime targeted allocation of sdrs the last allocation of sdrs wa s8 approved in 1978 and allocated in 19791981 since then 39 countries have joined the imf in ad dition some countries that were imf members at the time of the last allocation did not participate finally as result of past quota increases som members that did participate in the last allocation now have very low ratios f cumulative sdr allocations to their total quotas on the grou nds of equity therefore the imfs executive board recomme nded that onetime targeted sdr allocation be undertaken imf articles however require the nondiscriminatory treatment of all imf members thus to undertake targeted and therefore discriminatory sdr allocation the imfs articles must be amended while the proposed amendmen t would provide additional international reserve assets to the recipients it is largel peripheral to the immediate reformist debate that has arisen out of the recent global financial crisis the proposed fourth amendment has however important longter m implicat ions for the stability of the international financial system by easing th external financing constraint on the po orer countries it will hasten the day when they can achieve healthy economic growth in this respect the proposal is companion to the prop osal to sell imf gold in support of the hipc highly indebted poo r countries debt relief initiative of the world bank and the imf which also would ease the external financial constraint on select group of poor countries finally the9 proposed fourth amendment might well be seen as part of the imfs continuin g effort to address the needs of and the problems arising from the poorer countries that are part of its membership in this strictly limited sense the proposed fourt h amendment is linear descendent of the third amendment the fourth amendment would requir congressional approval but to date has not been brought before the us congress for consideration as of february 9 1999 40 imf members accoun

any budgetary funding by the united states far more controversial proposal would amend the imfs articles to permit the imf to play central role in capital account liberalization issues this proposal has been under study for some time on september 21 1997 the imfs interi m committee stated that the imfs central role in the international monetary system and its near universal membership made it uniquely placed to help assure that th liberalization of capital flows occurred in an orderl manner backed both by adequate national policies and solid multilateral system for surveillance and financia l support the interim committee recommended phased but comprehensiv e11 approach that would tailor capital account liberalization to the circumstances f individual countries it recommended that t he executive board complete its work on the proposed amendment which would extend as needed the imfs jurisdictio n through the establishment of carefully defined and uniformly applied obligation s regarding the liberalization of capital account movements 12 the proposed amendment would turn the imfs facto authority in this area into jure authority and would represent counterpart to the authority that it has had on current account issues since 1945 some dispute whether this change i s necessary others are more concerned about whether capital account liberalization per is desirable goal still oth ers have been concerned about what constitutes an orderly process of liberalization must country for example wait until certai n preconditions are met how can standards for banking supervision and soundness be ensured at the internat ional level and what are the problems and consequences of uncontrolled shortterm capital flows the imf held seminar on march 910 1998 to further study this issue in april 1998 the in terim committee reaffirmed its views provisional agreement on that part of the amendment dealing w ith the imfs purposes has been reached significantly however in its october 1998 communiquÃ© th e13 interim committee enco uraged the imf to continue its work in the context of its surveillance activities and adjustment programs but made mention of th e14 proposed amendment even while mentioning the proposed fourth amendment an d other measures to strengthen the imf this very important issue therefore apparently remains

rethinking the structu re or architecture of the international monetary system this process has been substantially accelerated by the current global financial crisis an early product is the new arrangements to borrow nab which went into effect on november 17 1998 nevertheless the process appears to be in its early stages in addition to capita l account liberalization issues several other areas in which work is under way include 15 standards this denotes the development and dissemination of internationally accepted norms to raise the transparency of economic policy and to enabl financial market s to better assess borrowers creditworthiness an imf code on fiscal transparency has been completed one on monetary and financia l policies is under development other international areas where codes ar sought include corporate governance accountancy and insolvency regimes trans parency this issue has become something of buzzword that s achieved motherhoodandapple pie status nobody is in theory against it but agreement on specific proposals is certain to be substantially more difficult apropos of the importance f capital flows in the current crisis agreement on the need for timely and detailed disclosure of international reserve positions external debt positions and shortterm capital flows including private flows is priority greater transparency regarding the position of private financial market participants including hedge funds is also being sought by regulatory and supervisory authorities finally the imf itself is becoming mor transparent an issue that was very much at the forefront of congressional oversight of the imf last year private sector contributions the inter im committee has noted that greater participation of the private sector in preventing and resolving financial crises is importa nt and has asked the imf to study the use of marketbase d mechan isms to cope with sudden shifts in investor sentiment this issue i s central to

expectation that if the loans went bad the lenders would be made whole by rescue package backed by the imf the moral hazard issue has been important an d controversial in connection both w ith the

imf is certain to be working with other major international institutions such as the world bank and the bank for internat ional settlements bis the items that hav been mentioned above are already under consideration are often extremely technical and are likely to take co nsiderable time to achieve reform of the international monetary system is however also certain to receive broade r discussion proposals may be expected to cover virt ually the entire spectrum on the one end of the spect rum some suggest turning the imf into lender of last resort16 lender of last resort nearly always countrys central bank provides liquidity in the form of mergency credit to the financial system to forestall panic or th collapse of the banking or financial system adoption of such proposal might well require providing additional fundi ng for the imf on the other end of the spectrum some would like to eliminate the imf 17 conclusion the period 19971999 has been one of enormous economic and financ ial turmoil the imf has been at the center of efforts to deal with this global crisis as it was in earlier periods of financial turmoil an examination of the history of the amendments to the imfs articles of agreeme nt shows that much about todays crisis is familiar including increased levels of crossborder capital flows increased economic integration increased marketpricing of exchange rates the preeminence of the market over the regulator and financial innovationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30132crs12 the significant difference between today and earlier periods is the extent to whic h emerging market countries transitional economies and the poorer less develope d countries have become part of the glo bal economy this has been abetted by major advances in communications
