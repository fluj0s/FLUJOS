investigation against four former gtmo detainees reftels and b appears to be proceeding well all appeals for pretrial release have been denied and the investigating judges feel confident that the trial likely to begin this summer will result in conviction however in related action frances highest appeals court for criminal matters overturned two previous courts decisions and referred to the paris court of appeals for action complaint brought by the families of two exgtmo detainees requesting an investigation into their detention 2 c summary continued separately the public trial against suspected terrorist djamel beghal and five accomplices accused of plotting to attack us interests in france including an attack against the embassy began january 3 thus far the trial has been highlighted by the defiance of the defendants during questioning post will continue to report on these cases as well as that of mohamed aljundi the syrian driver of the two french journalists kidnapped in iraq septel aljundi filed suit against us forces alleging torture while in us custody following his liberation from insurgent captivity end summary exgtmo detainees 3 s the ongoing investigation against the four exgtmo detainees currently in french custody is progressing well and the trial is likely to begin this summer thus far all appeals by defense attorneys for the release of their clients from pretrial detention have been rejected recent defense appeal to obtain transcripts from alleged interrogations by french authorities while the detainees were still at gtmo was similarly denied the antiterrorism judges investigating the case communicate regularly with post and they are confident the evidence obtained by french authorities since the four were remanded to french custody is overwhelming 4 c frances highest appeals court the cour cassation ruled january 4 that the paris court of appeals would have to address complaint filed by the families of two former gtmo detainees seeking criminal investigation into certain unknown and unnamed persons undoubtedly us officials for the illegal detention of the two in guantanamo the complaint had initially been filed in 2002 and was dismissed by judge in lyon the lyon court of appeals upheld this initial decision in 2003 arguing that that the detention could not be investigated because it was the result of an american military operation covered by unanimously adopted resolution however yesterdays appeal court decision indicated that the complaint could not be dismissed without investigating whether there was evidence related to the complaint that could be applicable under french law the complaint is now remanded to the paris court of appeals which technically could rule with the lyon decisions but will likely have to open an investigation itself or designate judge to investigate the complaint media reports indicate that requests for us judicial explanations are likely it is not yet clear how this complaint could affect the french investigation against the detainees post will continue to follow the developments of this case closely djamel beghal trial 5 c the trial of six men suspected of plotting in afghani terror training camps to target us interests in france specifically to bomb the us embassy in paris in 2001 began january 3 the proceedings have thus far been dominated by combative responses from the defendants suspected cell leader djamel beghal 39yearold algerianborn french citizen who was arrested in the uae in july 2001 after leaving afghanistan told authorities in dubai that he was the head of an alqaedalinked cell intent on attacking us interests in france including the us embassy in paris however beghal later retracted his confession and told the chief judge in the trial that he had given it under methodical torture in beghals testimony he referred to himself in the third person responded to the judges questions with questions of his own referred at one point to the proceedings as an inquisition court and refused to explain his reasons for visiting afghanistan kamel daoudi arrested in britain and extradited to france in september 2001 posed multiple definitions for the term jihadist and proclaimed his innocence as terrorist despite being arrested in possession of texts by ayman zawahiri and other islamic extremists claiming that when someone reads das kapital he is not necessarily marxist french authorities allege that beghal admitted in questioning that abu zubaydah gave the order to attack us interests in an afghani terror camp in march 2001 both beghal and daoudi deny having met zubaydah the trial is expected to last seven weeks and if convicted the six defendants face up to 10 years in prison leach
