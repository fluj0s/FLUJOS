and military exchanges introduction and background uschina relations have been tr oubled since the 1989 tiananmen square crackdown an event from which china has not yet been rehabilitated in american eyes with an ambiguous policy direction from th executive branch concrete overtures or concessions from beijing and with congressional attitudes and actions increasingly fractionalized uschina re lations drifted through the early 1990s state visits occurred after 1989 congress increasingly ch allenged chinas mostfavorednation mfn trading status although the clinton administration by 1994 was fielding policy of engagement with china several informal meetings between president clinton and senior chinese leaders were only marginally productive one such meeting brief 1995 meeting in new york between president clinton and chinese president jiang zemin was especially illustrative of uschina problem s not state visit the only accomplishment of the meeting was the symbolic one of its having occurred at all tensions in uschina re lations reached peak in 1996 when china conducted live fire missile exercises in the taiwan strait to protest the policies of taiwans president lee tenghui the united states responded by sending two carrier battle groups to the area the 1996 missile crisis appeared to surprise many policymakers in both washington and beijing and both governments appeared to

bold denotes official state visits italics refer to informal visits involving at least one head of state us summit position administration officials have been working hard to find summit deliverables that could demonstrate improvement in uschina relations in the past the clinton administration has been criticized domestically at times heavily for vacillating on foreign policy decisions including those rela ting to china the executivecongressional disagreements over china policy that began in the bush administra tion have continued in the clinton administration with va rious members of congress pushing the administration toward more forcef ul policy line on human rights weapons proliferation trade tibet nd taiwan the administration s flexibility has been further hampered recently by allegations that china was the source of illegal campaign contributions in the 1996 election in an atte mpt to buy influence and favorable policy decisions in early october administration officials began series of briefings for members of congress and congressional staff about us objectives and expectations for the summit administration officials have described the summit as holding out positive

communique dealing with taiwan say administration briefers instead the summit will help revive and impr ove the strategic sinous dialogue of the early 1980s administration officials say they believe that beijing has reassessed its policy toward the united states of the early 1990s and that ch inese leaders now place high priority on developing good uschina relations ad ministration officials have described the following baskets of issues likely to be discussed at the summit securityforeign policy issues the summits most direct achievement is likely to be the extent to which it results in enhanced strategic dialogue and security cooperation once fairly regula r and high level uschina cooperation in strategic and military matters was halted after the tian anmen square crac kdown and dialogue interrupted until 1992 continued only intermittently and at sser levels us officials expect the summit to result in the start of regular highlevel meetings in both capitals this would include regular presidential summits routine visits by cabinetlevel and other top officials charged with defense arms c ontrol and foreign polic briefs and regular militarytomilitary exchanges in new development us officials ex pect to set up special telephone hotline reminiscent of that once established with the soviet union us officials expect that other potential security coopera tion could include the conclusi on of agreements in several areas such as an agreement on incidents at sea bilateral talks on humanitarian response agreement and regular discussions on nuclear security and safety issues1 cooperation in several fore ign policy areas notably the situation on the korean peninsula also have helped to improve the strategic dialogue in uschina relations us officials hope that the summit will help strengthen this dialogue not only on issues involving korea but on cambodi vietnam and the persian gulf related to this us officials also expect that the summit dialogue will broach the subject of reform including possible tradeoff in which the ited states would pay its arrears and reduce its current contribution level while ch ina would increase its contribution now at 1 of the uns budget to perhaps 3 nonproliferation issues administration officials so expect developments on the nuclear nonproliferation front based on what one fficial termed dramatic transformation in chinas attitude toward nuclear proliferation in recent years according to one us official the administr ation believes there is doubt that china now sees nuclear nonproliferati on to be in its own security interests and that china is winding down its peaceful nuclear coopera tion with iran based on us assessment of chinas current nuclear nonproliferation policies nd on chinese pledges on nuclear nonproliferation expected to be reinforced at the summit administration officials have suggested that the united states could soon be able to proceed with sinous nuclear cooperation under the 1985 nuclear energy cooperation agreement2 under us law before initiating nuclear energy cooperation the president must first certify that china hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97941crs4 3irans nuclear

inspections by the international atomic energy agency iaea3 administration officials are less optimistic about chinas commitment to nonprolif eration of medium range ballistic missiles or che mical weapons or its willingness to join the zanger group or the wassenauer arrangement and they ve said that the 1997 summit is not likely to produce any agreement in these areas human rights chinas human rights record has been chief irritant in us china relations throughout the 1990s human ri ghts issues in par ticular have involved chinas arrests of people for the peaceful expression of their political views prison conditions and treatment of pr isoners export of products made with prison labor policies toward tibet and more recen tly restrictive policies towa rd religious practices and treatment of socalled underground churches us offici als indicate that they have seen some hopeful signs on human rights issues recently they cite in particular chinas recent release of new namelist of pris oners the first release since 1994 us officials say that they have advise d their chinese counterparts that progress on human rights would have greater impact on american attitudes toward china than would progress on any other issue us fficials hope that the summit may result in the release of some prominent dissidents and in chinas agreement to discussions of human rights in other fora perhaps through non governmental organizations ngos us officials have said for instance that the in ternational red cross is now taking the lead in pushing for inspections of chinese prisons administration officials also anticipate chinas signature on international human rights agreements such as the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights icser and the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr4 finally us officials are encouraging china to resume dialogue with the dala i lama although they are doubtful of progress on this issue economic and trade issues although it was once thought that the october summit could produce an agreement on chinas accession to the world trade organization wto administration officials have indicated that this is now highly unlikely what the united states is seeking according to administration officials is downpayment by china on the wto some trade concessions that will be seen as steps in the right direction for eventual wto membership downpayment that is substantial enough say us officials coul d allow the president to advocate permanent mfn for china law enforcementrule of law in discussions with beijing the united states has emphasized the importance it ascribes to the rule of law and administration officials judge that china is serious in wanting to develop its legal system the united states

administration officials would like to further mutual cooperation and exchanges in both of these areas areas of particular focus include clean coal tec hnology and rural electrification programs achieving chinese cooperation on environmen tal issues may also be facilitated by american willingness to implement the nuclear energy cooperation agreement science and tec hnology cooperation since 1979 the united states and china have had an umbrella agreemen t on science and tec hnology cooperation that includes over 20 protocols involving diffe rent us govern ment departments administration officials would like to try to consolidate these diverse aspects of sinous cooperation in addition the ad ministration would like to see an expansion of the us china fulbright scholarship program and w ould like to initiate re search cooperation in space technology chinas summit position unlike the clintonjiang meeting of october 1995 president jiang zemin in october 1997 appears to be in more secure position having emerged from the recent 15th party congress as stronger authoritative figure nevertheless it seems clear that jiang very much wants the further validation and prestige at home that us summit would give him reports in recent weeks by official chinese media quoting seni or chinese officials are emphasizing positive aspects of uschina relations saying that the overall

nuclear energy cooperation agreement signed by presiden t reagan in 1985 beijing wants the united states to strongly reiterate the principles of the existing us communiques with china about taiwan9 one of which involves statement about the level of us arms sales that will be made to taiwan chinese leaders also have wanted the united states to lift the socalled tiananmen sancti ons put into place in 1990 after the tiananmen square crackdown10 primarily such move would allow the overseas private investment corporation opic and the trade and development progra m to resume working with us investors in china finally chinese leaders would like the administration to refrain from bringing resolutions before the human rights commission that criticize chinas human rights record and work to restrain us legislation criticizing china implications for the united states even in the improved atmosphere of u schina relations the october 1997 summit is not without its controversies some members of congress and others object sometimes strenuously to the administrati ons reinvigorated policy of engagement they believe that washington should not imp rove its contacts with china until beijing has improved its record on human rights wea pons proliferation trad and treatment of taiwan chinas pursuit of undesirable policies according to these observers should not be without cost and the leader in imposin g that cost must be the united states emphasizing this position cong ressional critics of china have introduced legislation in the 105th congress that would target china for sa nctions and increase spending for radio free asia human rights monitoring and other us programs11 members supporting this legislation may object to some possible outcomes of the summit particularly on an already sensitive issue such as the nuclear energy cooperation agreement other observers argue that this is g ood time for the united states to achieve progress in uschina relations the united states has sanctioned and criticized china for years say these observers and has been rewarded with deeply troubled relationship beset by crises us inte rests would be better served by focusing on the common ground in uschina relations building some elements of trust between chinese and us leaders and dealing with key bilateral problems incr ementally also these observers argue summit meeting with president jiang would further bolster his position in beijing and us interests could be advanced by having chinese l eader who is secure enough in his position to make bolder commitments in negotiating with the united states
