from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom crowley tomoceantamuedu michael mann mannvirginiaedu subject re mill records date mon aug 7 135854 2000 tom and mike what tom said is essentially correct tim osborn here recalibrated each series as composite against the same nh series for the april sept average north of 20n using land only data all this does is rescale the series as it is simple regression yaxb because is based on temps wrt 6190 this means that the axis is then wrt 6190 doing this we can then add the same instrumental temp series it also brings the series together and the web page was just for illustrative purposes for mikes series you get pretty much the same result by subtracting 012 from mikes numbers as this is the difference between mikes base period and 196190 there is nothing sinister going on ill summarise this to rob cheers phil ps i seem to be stirring up loads of emails about historical data you are both on those emails so you can see what crap is being written and my time wasting for replies apologies for replying i should know better and keep quiet we can all expect more of this if ipcc stays in roughly the same form previctoria its relatively easy to knock historical records so as long as it gets worse than this well be fine
