have influenced all of the departments efforts intended to enhance our nations ability to prevent respond to and recover from future terrorist attacks nd natural disasters while the practice of risk analysis may be advanced in the insurance and financial industries it is relatively less developed in the homela nd security field although there are numerous reasons that account for this dynamic two primary reasons include 1 the dynamic nature of terrorism and ability of terrorists to adapt to successful countermeasures and 2 the lack of rich hist orical database of terrorist attacks which necessitates reliance on intelligence and terrorist experts for probabilistic assessments of types of terrorist attacks against critical assets andor regions this report begins with an overv iew of the evolution of risk assessment methodologies from the depa rtment of justice in fy2002 to dhs in fy2007 and then discusses the discipline of risk management and risk assessment as applied to homeland security grant program hsgp terrorism risk analysis and assessmen t do not exist in vacuum risk is analyzed and assessed as means to mitigate or buy down risk over time by developing certain capabilities across the country at dhs the state homeland security grant program is the primary tool the agency has to influence the behavior of state and local partners to take actions that reduce what both parties agree are the risks of terrorist attack and to respond effectively to such an attack or other catastrophe regardless of the complexity of the risk assessment methodology due to the inherent uncertainties associated with assessing risk in dynamic counterterrorism context some level of flexibility in managing risk may be necessary empirical data on historical terrorist attacks in the united states may therefore continue to play an important role in resource allocation to reduce risk this report presents several risk asse ssment and related gr ant program options for

assessment met hodology evolution issues and options for congress introduction as early as his senate confirmation hearing homeland security secretary michael chertoff advocated riskbased approach to homeland security under secretary chertoffs direction the use of risk assessment has become pervasive throughout dhs increasingly risk assessment and subsequent risk mitigation efforts influence many aspects of the department s work intended to enhance our nations ability to prevent respond to and recover from future terrorist attacks and natural disasters indeed secretary chertoff has stated dhs must base its work on priorities driven by risk1 the purpose of this report is to analyze how dhs assesses risk2 in the absence of sound risk assessment methods the prio ritization of homela nd security activities at the federal state and local level is problematic if dhs is to prevent terrorist attacks within the united states3 one of its primary statutory missions it needs to assess risk in an accurate manner however risk assessment does not occur in vacuum the end goal is to reduce and mitigate risk all of dhss employees work to reduce risk respond to terrorist att ack or natural disaster should one occur andor protect the country by preventing dangerous materials or individuals from crossing us borders the primary tool dhs has to buy down or minimize risk and to influence the behavior of state nd local public safety and law enforcement officials who collectively represent substantial force multipliers is the homeland security grant program others have written extensively about dhs grant programs and the allocation of such programs across the country4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs2 4 continued distribution formulas issues for the 109th congress jan 20 2006 by shawn

to re construct grant prog ram research but to examine the concept of dhs risk assessment itself and how the evolution of risk assessment flows through the dhs grant prog rams the report has three sections 1 the evolution of risk assessment from th department of justice in fy2002 to dhs in fy2007 2 fundamental questions about risk analysis as applied to homeland security and 3 possible options for congress it will examine strategic questions about risk and how risk is defined and distinguishable from other terms such as vulnerability finally the report will discuss possible range of approaches for congress with respect to dhs risk ssessment practices dhss organization to assess risk and the implementation of risk mitigation efforts using the dhs grant tool given the focus of this report an analysis of the dhss risk assessment methodology through the lens of the hom eland security grant process some background information on the grant process is necessary as previously stated the risk assessment process cannot be examined in isolation rather the context of the homeland security grant program is discussed to illuminate the homeland security risk assessment methodology and its imple mentation throughout various homeland security initiatives th is report may be updated background in fy2004 the allocation of homeland secur ity grant monies inspired debate in states across the country one often reported anecdote noted that wyomings fy2004 state homeland security gran t program shsg award was 14360000 while new york and calif ornia received 78827000 and 133964000 respectively5 on its face it seemed intuitive that new york and california would receive more money than wyoming but when examined in light of 2004 census bureau estimates it appears that wyo ming received approx imately 2834 in shsg funding per capita while new york and california r eceived 410 and 373 per capita respectively6 the rationale behind the disbursement of funds seemed counterintuitive to many especially given the recent attacks and continued plots against locations in new york and cali fornia to include the 1993 world trade center bombing the 1994 blind sheikh pl ot the millennium plot against loshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs3 angeles international airport lax and the september 11th attacks amongst others numerous interested stakeholders at all vels of government sought to learn more about the homeland security grant allocation methodology and process figure 1 below provides time line to track major milestone events in the evolution of risk assessment in homeland security context source crs presentation of signifi cant events and current law risk experts appear to agree that all communities have some level of risk from terrorism yet homeland security offi cials acknowledge that it is impossible to protect every target and harden every community to the extent that they become impervious to future attacks it seems clear that it is necessary from national perspective to identify the areas and entitie s across the country most at risk and to work to reduce that risk what is less clear is the best way to evaluate relative homeland security risk and establish an acceptable level of risk while attempting to close the most dramatic gaps between risk and capabilities what follows is chronological overview of the dhs risk assessment methodology examined through the prism of the homeland security grant program evolution of the dhs risk assessment methodology the federal governments approach to distributing funds to statelocal governments to enhance the tters ability to prepare for and respond to terrorist acts has evolved in the last six years it is im portant to understand the genesis of this grant program and the reactions to each stage of its development in order to better comprehend the current methodology the volution of the grant program and the risk methodologies it employs has ccurred against the backdrop of the transformation of the nation s understanding of homeland security itself borne out of the september 11 attacks the term homeland security and the department designed to enhance it were initially solely terrorismfocused with time and other catastrophic incidents the focus of the partment expanded to include range of figure 1 tracking time linehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs4 7 for the past several grant cycles many states and local leaders have expressed frustration and disappointment with dhss risk assessment process and the related distribution of grant funds much of the disappointment with respect to fy2006 grants was the result of the first post911 decline in funds provided to state and local communities for fy2006 the total amount allocated for homeland security grants was 17 billion dhs dhs announces 17 billion in homeland security grants grants will build states and urban areas preparedness may 31 2006 significan t decrease from 25 billion in fy2005 dhs homeland security grants fy2005 update d december 3 2004 office of grants and training another source of frustration was perceived lack of transparency regarding the risk assessment process especially with regard to the sources of information used and the weighting of the formulas variables and underl ying data subelements furthermore the continued shift towards riskbased approach may have caused consternation amongst some jurisdictions due to the inference that future grant funding may be threatened spurred on by congressional pressure the department has continued to move toward methodology that is more heavily riskbased 8 national commission of terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report final report of th national commission of terrori st attacks upon the united states authorized edition new york ww norton and company 2004 p 396 9 ibid 10 ibidpotentially destabilizing nonterrorism threat s such as natural disasters this evolution in mission has significant ramifications for the calculation of the threat aspect of the risk formulas utilized to allocate some of the homeland security grant funds as will become evident in the followi ng sections overview of grant allocation and related risk methodologies over the years there have been numerous criticisms from various groups7 over how risk is assessed and as result dhs grants are allocated following the fy2004 homeland security grant allocation process the 911 commission hereafter commission weighed in on the funding controversy when it issued the following recommendation in its final repor t published in late july 2004 homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities now in 2004 washington dc and new york city are certainly at the top of any such list we understand the contention that every state and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency response but federal homeland security assistance should not remain program for general revenue sharing it should supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support congress should not use this money as pork barrel8 the commission report asks second question can useful crite ria to measure risk and vulnerability be developed that assess all the many variables9 t h commission lists variety of factors that should be considered in the assessment of threats and vulnerabilities to include population population dens ity vulnerability and the presence of critical infrastructure within each state10 the commission suggests that the federal gove rnment should then require each state that receives such funds to provide an analysis based on the same criteria to justify the distribution ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs5 11 ibid 12 ibid 13 the intent of this section and the appendix is to provide snapshot of recent historical and current legislative activity with respect to risk assessment this section is not provided with intent to track this legislation over time and as such will not be continually updatedfunds within that state11 the commission understood that the benchmarks chosen to evaluate sites threat and vulnerability w ill be imperfect and subjective but they will continually evolve12 given the criticisms associated with the dhs risk assessment methods look at congressional interest in risk assessment as it relates to the homeland security grant programs may be instructive risk assessmentrelated legislative activity13 concurrent with the commissions critique and internal efforts within dhs to move to more riskbased approach members of congress put forth series of bills and amendments to the homeland security act that sought to reform the criteria for distributing homeland security grant funds each effort sought to remedy the perceived issues associated with the hom eland security risk assessment process some suggested the creation of new oversight or coordination bodies most importantly for purposes of this report each bill and amendment proposed changes to reduce guaranteed allotments and enha nce the percentage of funding allocated based on risk to varying detail each gislative initiative suggested definitions or approaches to evaluate risk with regards to homeland security the appendix provides additional information on the legislative initiatives referenced in this section understanding the criticisms of the dhs risk assessment process and the proposed congressional remedies an analys is of how the various stages of risk assessment have evolved over time may be useful risk assessment stages of development there have been at least three stages in the evolution of risk assessment methodology as it pertains to homela nd security these stages and unique developments within each era are summarized below stage i rp this period covers from fy2001 when the department of justice doj had primary responsibility for assessing risk to fy2002fy2003 when this responsibility was transferred to dhs this first stage of risk assessment could be characterized as early stage deve lopmental during this period risk was generally assessed and measured according to population numbers in short risk r was equated to population phttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs6 14 it should be noted that population density numbers can be misleading cities define geographic boundaries differently which may lead to municipalities with similar populations having very different density ratios while population density is often good indicator of individuals that may be affected by terrorist attack such criteria may not be useful for cities where the citizens are located far aw ay from the center of the municipality 15 secretary michael chertoff us department of homeland security second stage review remarks july 13 2005 available at h ttpwwwdhsgovxnewsspeechesspeech_0255 shtm accessed jan 26 2007 we must make t ough choices about how to invest finite human and financial capital to attain the optim state of preparedness to do this we will focus preparedness on objective measures of risk and performance our risk analysis is based on these three variables threat vulner ability and consequences these variables are not equal for example some infrastructure is quite vulnerable but the consequences of an attack are relatively small other infrastruct ure may be much less vulnerable but the consequences of successful attack are very high even catastrophicstage ii rtcipd this period covers from fy2004 to fy2005 during this period the importance of criti cal infrastructure population density14 and number of other variables was included in the assessment of risk however the formula for risk remained additive and risklike as probabilities were not an essential element of the risk assessment pr ocess risk was assessed as the sum of threat t critical in frastructure ci and popul ation density pd stage iii rtvctvc this period covers from fy2006 to today time when probability of par ticular events was systema tically introduced into the formula as will be discussed more in depth below fy2006 also marked another important departure from the previous ri sk assessment methodology for the first time when calculating risk dhs chose to examine both risk to assets and geographic areas with the swearing in of michael chertoff as secretary of the dhs in february 2005 the department underwent both organi zational and strate gyrelated changes concurrent with dhss reorganization secretary chertoff announced that new riskbased methodology would dictate department activ ities and all fu ture federal funds would be distributed accordingly15 this new approach to allocating the remaining funds required an assessment of risk using formula that considers the threat to targetarea multiplied by vulnerability v of the targetarea multiplied by consequence c of an attack on that targetarea as result the risk assessment formula became rtvc va riables were longer dditive but were multiplied implying weighting of variables and some assessment of the likelihood that certain events would occur the current process fy2007 the fy2007 homeland security grant guidance describes the dhs approach to risk assessment as risk will be evaluated at the federal level using risk analysis model developed by dhs in conjunction with other federal entities risk is defined as the product of three principal variables threat t the likelihood of an attack occurringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs7 16 us department of

value of one in effect then consequence is weighted at 80vulnerability and consequence vc the relative exposure and expected impact of an attack 16 although dhs continues to discuss its ri sk methodology in terms of the rtvc formula it appears as if the department is treating vulnerability v and consequence c as an amalgamated single variable as depicted in figure 2 as mentioned above due to difficulties associated with differentiating vulnerability values across areas and states according to dhs it has in effect assigned value of one to vulnerability as result while three variables may formally remain in the formula in effect only two exist for fy2007 in addition significan t changes to the underlying elements of each variable were made for the fy2007 process17 while the fy2007

questions and some concerns in the following areas the transparency of the risk assessment process the implications of an evolving risk formula minimum grant allotments and the responsibility for buying down risk transparency the additional information pr ovided by the department in fy2007 should allow applicants of dhs gr ant funds to have better understanding of the types of information contained in the underlying datasets and how each is assessed and weighted during the risk assessment process while this transparency in the methodology may satisfy some grant process critics others remain concerned with the formulas effectiveness in meeting the needs of those most at risk21 risk formula evolution with the adoption of rtvc many see fy2006 as the first significant change to dhss risk assessment methodology some observers could express concern that c ontinued changes to the methodology will not allow the united states to establish baselin of risks to the nation thus jeopardizing any attempts to spot current trends or fo recast future security concerns others might view the changes to the methodology as st eps toward improving the risk assessment process and suggest that as dhss unders tanding of risk volves and its access to data increases the asso ciated methodology will st abilize and provide sound foundation from which to make an alytic and grant

facing the department of homeland security dec 2006 p 8contemplating questions of allocati on as mentioned above the commission recommended that the allocation of grants should be based on risk and emphasis added vulnerability vulnerability is but one of three elements of risk as defined by dhs27 in recent senate testimony former congressman and vice chair of the 911 commission lee hamilton suggested that experience serve as guide for risk assessment and resource allo cation mr hamilton noted three elements worthy of consideration when allocating homeland s ecurity spending 1 historical and empirical data on what has been attacked not only within the united states but overseas washington dc new york city new york madrid spain and london england all large c ities 2 qaeda statements according to mr hamilton so far as we know they qaeda continue to target symbols of american power and 3 the best available intelligence28 while this approach is reasonable and based on sound logic some might argue that broader questions and more anticipatory approach may need to be considered to arrive at some credible and predictive value for future risk according to recent rand study the following three questions might be addressed by policymakers before re source allocation decisions are made should resources be allocated base d on risk risk reduction or some other basis how can terrorism risk be estimated what are the tolerable levels of risk29 another fundamental question in this area is what is the risk to and from what sources does the risk originate is the risk to people infra structure the economy or all of the above is the source of ri sk acts of terrorism or the broader all hazards approach where the interests lie in responding to incidents of national significance as defined in the national response plan does dhs as suggested by the department s inspect or general need to conti nue refining its riskbased approach to award first responder grants that ensure the areas and assets that represent the greatest vulnerability to th public are as secure as possible30 with respect to the threat element of th risk equation to what extent is unique data collected by state and local officials being incorporated into the threat element of risk state and local law enfor cement and public safety personnel provide substantial amounts of data to dhs and other federal entities with the understanding that the information will be used in part to assess threat yet according to dhs official the methodology for incorporatin g that data are underdeveloped and as

meaningful manner31 it may be possible that the emergence and proliferation of state local and regional intelligence fusion centers could become funnel through which such state and local data could be aggr egated and provided to the federal government in manner that would allow it to contribute to threat assessment an element of the risk equa tion that is weighted at 20 in fy2007 the answers to these questions can ve fundamental impact on how grants are allocated while the risk management process may be similar whether the source of risk is hurricane or terrorist attack arguably th inputs provided into the risk assessment model will be far different dhs guidance shows that both the uasi and letpp programs are largely designed to provide state and local governments with funds to prepare and protect against as well as respond to and recover from acts of terrorism32 while this purpose also exists in the shsp it has the additional purpose of supporting the implementation of the na tional preparedness goal the other two grants currently under the homeland s ecurity grant prog ram umbrella the metropolitan medical response system mmrs and the citizen corps program ccp are almost completely focuse d on preparedness for postevent response consistent with need to ensure all phases of catastrophe are considered and program objectives are clearly defined th dhs inspector general found that the department must incorporate sound risk management principl and methodologies to successfully prepare for respond to recover from and mitigate acts of terrorism and natural disasters33 in short while dhss risk assessment methodology is largely geared toward countering terrorism the resu lts of the assessment along with other factors such as effectiveness are us ed for purposes which go beyond terrorism once the fundamental questions of risk to and risk from what are answered it is necessary to form methodology to measure relative risk and to draft and implement strategy to reduce it to this end and from an economic efficiency perspective it could be argued that the optimal manner in which homeland security grants might be allocated would be according to comparative analysis of how historical homeland security grants have actually reduced risk from september 11 2001 through fy2008 approximately 12 billion will have been provided to state and local governments by dhs to prepare for and respond to terrorist attacks and other disasters34 central question that may be as ked is what has been the rate of return as defined by identifiable and em pirical risk reductions on this 12 billion investment it does not appear however that there is an established methodology to engage in such analyses nor are the da ta sets necessary for such analyses well developed according to one dhs official while the departme nt is planning to assess the impact of dhs grants on risk reduction in fy2008 it has been somewhat constrained by resources and the abse nce of methodology to

however the absolute risk to certain critical asset or infrastructure may be highly relevant to state local and private sector officials for example risk management analyses have been conducted on the

and recovery to assess security risk these variables are of course relevant to assessing relative risk as well however in order to assess the attractiveness of lng terminals as target clarke uses the

operation forces intelligence and electronics warfare operation sept 30 1991 the aforem entioned rhode island lng report states p76 that ce we are aware that qaeda has adopted much of us army doctrine for use in its training camps it is fa ir to assume the principals in the carver matrix apply to their targeting with its highly tactical focus on specific assets and characteristics of those assets this model ma have limited utility for the relative homeland security risk assessmentsassessment35 as result some might argue the next best method to allocating resources is to assess meas ure and rank relative risk this is in essence the approach currently being used by dhs risk management and assessm ent complex activities the concept of risk how to define assess and manage it is relatively complex according to dhs risk is cl assically represented as the product of probability of particular outcome and the results of that outcome36 as mentioned above it was not until fy2006 that dhs move d from risklike or additive approach to assessing risk to one that is guided by more classically defined or probabilistic methods of assessing risk as will be expanded upon below dhs differentiates between two different but complementary types of risk asse tbased risk and geographicbased risk because dhs is assessing risk as means to allocate resources to buy down risk it is imperative according to dhs that its risk calculations be relative that is b ecause of the dynamic nature of temporal valuations in the many elements that figure into risk an absolute value even if it could be calculated would be meaningful for very limited time37 moreover dhs differentiates between risk analysis and risk management according to the society for risk analysis risk analysis is broadly defined to incl

countermeasures are then designed implemented and monitored to see how they perform with continual feedback loop for decision maker input to improve countermeasures and consider tradeoffs between risk acceptance and avoidance39 r i s k assessment pertains to the quantification or measurement of identified risk and probab ilistic assessment that certain risks will manifest themselves40 according the government accountability office gao risk assessment is the process of qualitatively or quantitativ ely determining the probability of an adverse event and the severity of its impact on an asset it is function of threat vulnerability and consequence risk assessment may include scenarios in which two or more risks interact to create greater or lesser impact risk assessment provides the basis for the rank ordering of risks and for establishing priorities for countermeasures41 the practice of risk management is welldeveloped within the insurance engineering finance and political risk industries it is clear however that risk management remains relatively immature in its application to the homeland security field some might that argue the implementation of risk assessment and management in the homeland security and counterterrori sm fields may be more complex than in its industrial application wher the primary objective is to protect against financial loss financial loss is of course one element of assessing and mitigating risk in homeland security context but of equal if not more importance are threats to human health and strategic nationa l missions among other factors according to dhs the following issues must be taken into consideration in the assessment of risk in the homeland security context historical data in the insurance or financial sectors the assessment of risk benefits from rich and voluminous set of data which can be mined for patterns of historical behavior while there are various governmental and nongovernmental databases on terrorism these data sources are relatively less robust as resulthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs17 42 dhs risk analysis for fiscal ye ar 2006 homeland security grants pp 812 43 see henry h willis andrew r morral terrence k

equal to threatvulnerabilityconsequence by mathematical principle if any value on the right side of the equation is assessed to be zero risk is also zero for example because the vulnerability of bridge to chemic attack is zero the risk to bridges from chemical attacks is also zero 45 some would argue that given the statutor formula in the usa patriot act pl 107 56 1014 codified at 42 usc 3711 stipulating that 75 percent of the total amount of grants shall be allocated to each state plus th district of columbia and puerto rico and 25 for the territories of guam american samoa northern mariana islands and the virgin islands the risk threshold is minimal as this formula assumes that all states experience some level of risk and receive funding as result as will be discussed in the options section of this report whether this fundi ng was intended to be perpetual or to bring all states up to minimal level of security nd capability and then allow the states to assume financial responsibility for continued operations and maintenance of established security programs and activities may be an issue for the 110th congress in fy2006 this 75 formula equates to 40 of the total 17 b illion homeland security grant appropriationthe subjective judgment of intelligence and terrorism experts become relatively more important in the projection of likely threat scenarios directed against categories of assets andor geographic areas risk inheritance because grant candidates include states and urban areas and individual assets exist in both spaces risk can be inherited from one candi date to another for example the risk score for port will be inherited by the city and state in which that port is located as such according to dhs it utilizes various mathematical techniques including weighting normalization and order of computation to cont rol for such unique factors42 there are numerous other complicating factors associated with assessing risk in the homeland security context43 notwithstanding common framework for assessing risk at an aggregate level one of the central problems is that risks need to be defined at micro level for example the risk to certain asset or geographic area given terrorist capabilities and intentions to be very useful44 at least with respect to assessing risk from terrorism the na ture of the risk is dynamic as terrorists continually monitor successful countermeasures and adapt their targets tactics and modes of operation to surmount the count ermeasures moreover as alluded to above related problem is the absence of definitive answer to the question of how much risk is acceptable secretary chertoff has been open and frank in discussing the department s riskbased approach that is the fact that the country has to accept some level of risk as it is not feasible to protect against every real or perceived risk yet that level of acceptable risk the thre shold over which fede ral resources will be dedicated to managing risk is not yet defined45 in short the successful risk reduction measures of today may not nece ssarily be as successful in the nearto medium termhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs18 46 yacov haimes founding dir ector of the center for risk management of engineering systems at the university of virginia argues quantitative risk assessment and management cannot be conducted on an ad hoc basis or by addressing selective sources of risk this engineering or systems based approach may be one of the areas where there is commonality between an engineering approach to risk management and homeland security approach as terrorist threats infrastructur vulnerabilities and the consequences associated with successful attack are also in terrelated see yacov v haimes risk modeling assessment and

and refine their understanding to incorporate both new nd old data see httpwwwbayesianorg accessed jan 26 2007as will be outlined below even if there is agreement on the central elements of risk these elements are not necessarily inde pendent of one anothe r thus requiring sophisticated understanding of how each of the elements or variables of risk are interdependent46 stochastic and sens itivity tests for each variable and regression between variables may be of some u tility in understanding how strong the relationships between variables are47 for fy2007 as mentioned above dhs has in effect assigned value of one to vulnera bility while understanda ble at some level this essentially eviscerates any interplay between vulnerability and consequence by having the effect of weightin g the consequences of such an attack at 80 it could be argued that if the vulnerability of pa rticular asset is exceedingly low regardless of how grave the consequence the risk to the asset may also be very low and therefore allocating relatively scarce homela nd security resources to such an asset may be inefficient and ineffective insofar as measuring risk is concerned it could be argued that it is essential to identify the primary drivers of risk and coll ect the most appropriate data to quantify those risks collecting and measuring data that is readily available but not central to risk yields quantifiable risk scores ye t some could argue that the results would be indefensible and relatively meaningless if data which drive risk are not currently being collected perhaps in the shortterm such data deficiencies might be clearly recognized and controlled for in calculating risk reducing variable value to zero or one based on the difficulty of collecting appropriate data to measure that variable should only be used as temporary stopga p technique as invariably such practices result in inaccurate risk assessments mo reover the level of confidence decision makers have in data collected to assess risk is important re source allocation could be based for example solely on population figures statistic for which high confidence data exists however detrime nts of such system are that population in and of itself may not necessarily be terrorist target if the population is not particularly dense or exists in an area of marginal national economic impact or exists in an area where there are few critical na tional infrastructure assets the population may not necessarily be target for various terrorist groups there may be balance to be struck between risk assessment methodology

regardless of the complexity of the risk assessment methodology due to the inherent uncertaintie s associated with assessing risk in dynamic counterterrorism contex t some level of flexibility in managing risk may be necessary empirical data based on histori cal terrorist attacks in the united states may therefore continue to play an important role in resource allocation designed to buy down

factors drive risk and are ssential to understandi ng risk assessment and management this section will provide some basic definitions common to the risk assessment and management field alt hough they

is defined as the product of three principal variables 1 thre at or the likelihood of type of attack occurring 2 vulnerability or the rela tive exposure of an attack and 3 consequence or expected impact of an attack49 as alluded to above dhs also differentiates between the fo llowing two types of risk the attributes of which are depicted in figures 3 and 4 below assetbased risk employs

assessing risk whether it is assetbased or ge ographicbased is risk threatvulnerabilityconsequence otherwise expressed as rtvc this formula is central not only to the llocation of dhs grant programs but to all of the departments activities as secretary chertoff has stated52 it is important to define these variables fo r number of reasons without common understanding of the lexicon it is difficult to assess risk at the strategic and tactical levels in order to gather the appropriate da ta which serves as an input to the risk assessment process state nd local agencies must understand how dhs is defining th elements of risk in the absence of an understandi ng of each of these elements individually it becomes increasingly difficult to comprehend how they are interrelated and interdependent there are numerous dhs elements including the us coast guard office for domestic preparedness and the homeland infrastructure threat and risk analysis center hitrac among others that are responsible for risk analysis and management53 an example of how one compone nt defines and practices risk assessment is instructive hitrac is the entity within dhs that is tasked with combining intelligence threat data as assessed and accessed by the dhs office of intelligence and analysis with infrastructure vulnerabilities according to hitrac representative while inherently the most subjective component of the risk equation threat of enemy attack is derived from study of enemy intent and capability intent of this adversary is assessed after study of all available information about they want to accomplish by attacking the united states we work with our partners in the intelligence community to understand as much as we are able about the terrorists goals plans and desires we match what we know about the intentions of the adversary with inform ation we have about what the enemy is capable of accomplishing for this part of the equation we rely both on what wehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs23 54 see testimony of melissa smislova ac ting director hitrac before the house homeland security committee subcommittee on intelligence information sharing and terrorism risk assessment nov 17 2005 how subjective data are treated the extent of expert input into strategic dynamic and c ontinual risk assessment process the continually updated weighting of various factors and the presence of both intent and opportunity are all critical elements of the risk assessment process whether hitrac has the appropriate mix of personnel resources and singularity of focus on risk assessment methods to serve as potential permanent dhs entity to tinually refine and implement dynamic risk assessment model is an open question 55 michael chertoff dhs secretary

specifically defining its components it should be noted that although dhs headquarters has adopted pa rticular risk methodology it is unclear how pervasive that approach has become outside headquart ers specifically within agencies brought under the department in 2004 given the evolution of dhss risk assessment methodology and associated complexities translating risk assessments into welltargeted allocations of hsgp funds to buy down risk there are numbe r of possible approaches for congress to consider in this area possible approaches for congress more than natural disasters assessing risk emanating from manmade actions is an extremely difficult task methodological tension is created when attempting to apply quantitative formula to humandriven activities that require subjective

consistent application of the methodology are important when attempting to measure terrorism risk to the us and systematically buy down the risk to particular location or asset such clarity and c onsistency are particularly im portant as the funds granted based on the dhss risk methodology are th primary tools the federal government has to influence the behavior of state and local partners who will be the first on the scene of terrorist attack and will be res ponsible for returning the community to pre incident conditions congress has number of apparent options concerning dhss risk

assessment methodologies and their affect on hsgp allocations some might argue that in the absence of measures to assess historical effectiveness of dhs grant programs changing formulas and

illustrate how to identify specific capability gaps which might serve as an input for future allocation of homeland security grants and 2 articul ation of this methodology including the data necessary

effective and efficient way to target relatively scarce homeland security resources further enhance transparency while safeguarding the intelligence law enforcement and other sensitive information weighted and analyzed through dhss risk methodology disclosure of the mathem atical equation used to determine threat vulnerability and consequence may allow all applicants and stakeholders to understand and have basis to confirm or challenge the re sults prior to funds being allocated it could be argued that provi ding this level of detail regarding the methodology and underlying quation may allow those who would seek to attack us facilities to reverseengineer the formula thus increasing the probability of successful terrorist attack others might maintain that allowing the risk formula equations to be revealed would encourage state and municipalities to manipulate the data provided to dhs thus increasing thei r chances of receiving additional funding without sufficient riskbased justifi cation homeland security observers could counter these arguments by suggesting th at though there may be the potential for those wishing to take advantage of the transparency of the system the positives include possible increases in information sharing between dhs and state and local governments due to an understanding of ho w data is used and as such result in increased confidence in the other entity some could argue more transparency would allow dhs to more confidently allocate re sources as enhanced transparency may reduce the surprised outcries that seem to arise

departments risk assessment process could potentially be vulnerable to budget fluctuations and political influence this is especially important given the apparent division of ri sk assessment responsibilities throughout various offices and dir ectorates within the department arguments can be made that such an overarching risk philosophy needs to be adopted throughout the federal governme nt in december 2005 report on homeland security risk manage ment gao concluded that for the results of risk management system to be meaningful and useful all related agencies should be using simila r methods if agencies methods are not compatible then comparisons between agencies become difficult and sector or national risk assessments becomes less reliable in our earlier work we concluded that structured systematic pproach to risk management offers the best assurance that activities designed to protect the homeland and combat the effects of terrorism will produce the most effective and efficient results56 cohesive risk strategy and agreement on core terms amongst disparate agencies is desirable because many aspects of the risk assessment process are dependent on functions performed by agenci outside the department57 however the necessity of common definitions and standards goes beyond the federal government as states and localities continue to provide information to be included in the risk assessmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs26 process to include information on critical infrastructure sites within their respective jurisdictions and eventually investigative information the rationale for attempting to develop nationalwide ri sk assessment strategy at all levels of government becomes stronger appointment of dhs risk assessment manager ram with regards to dhss risk assessment efforts the department might potentially create risk assessment manager ram position charged with better integrating the various elements working on as pects of the risk assessment process in addition the ram might be assigned the respons ibility of creating and subsequently implementing departmentwide strategic risk strategy such position could be in an advisory capacity to the secretary or entail operational and ove rsight functions of permanent dhs risk assessment center see below the creation of ram within dhs responsible for coordinating all interdepartmental risk methodology activities would provide congress other federal government agencies and state and local homeland security leaders with si ngle person accountable for explaining the complexities of future risk management strategy efforts and specific office to receive suggestions regarding improving current processes the ram could also serve in liaison capacity to ensure external agencies are familiar with dhss approach to risk and facilitate agreement on key terms and processes amongst other agencies creation of dhs risk advisory board rab as previously stated secretary chertoff has made it clear that ri sk assessment underlies all elements of the departments operations risk management and assessment are disciplines which are relatively welldeveloped across the privat sector moreover within the us government there are numerous experts on risk assessment to ensure that the secretary is getting the best possible advice as to how dhs should continue to refine its risk management activities formal board of senior level risk management professionals might be established to dvise the secretary while not having program management respons ibilities the risk advisory board rab might advise the secretary on the best risk management practices across industry and government it could also lead the dhs effort with substantial input from potential risk assessment center see below to draft longterm risk manage ment strategy creation of permanent risk assessment center rac while the proposed rab would operate on strategic vel it could be beneficial for dhs to examine its current efforts to apply risk strategy to its various programs and initiatives risk is central to dhss opera tions dhs may not n ecessarily have the appropriate resources dedicated fulltime to 1 proactively assess the dynamic drivers of risk 2 lead the collection of th right types of data to assess risk and 3 develop methodology to analyze how eff ectively past homeland security grant investments have bought down risk these tasks are relatively complex and it could be argued require the formation of group of profe ssional methodologists whose sole function is risk assessment while elements of this capability may exist now within the preparedness directorate single group has this sole responsibility for example hitrac is charged largely with mapping vulnerabilities to threats which is an

assessment process second continued ttention to this issue and sufficient time to address it would probably allow dhs to create more effective assessment tools and use those multiple tools in tandem to analyze various risk areas third the risk center would potentially allow dhs to draw on the existing expertise and resources of all the offices and divisions within dhs as well as external entities such as other intelligence community agencies implement 911 commission recommendation as mentioned above the 911 commission recommended that hom eland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risk s and vulnerabilitiesb ut federal homeland security assistance should not remain program for general revenue sharing it should supplement state and cal resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support58 some homeland security obs ervers could interpret this literally to mean that after six ears and 12 billion of homeland security investments most states should be at so minimal level of s ecurity and capability therefore some might argue the time may be appropriate to revisit the usa patriot act formula which results in 40 of the total dhs grant funding being allocated based on formula which is not base d primarily on risk others might argue that until methodology is developed to as certain how prior years grant allocations have decreased each states risk levels it may be premature to alter the formula questions that might be addressed wh considering this options include what duration did congress origin ally intend when it created the doj and now dhs homeland security grants what measures are in place to ensure that state and localgovernments are spending resources in manner that is consistent with congressional intent to what extent if at all has congressional oversight yielded any indications that state and local governments have come to view homeland security grants as entitlements has dhs or congress entered into discussions with state and local governments about sustainable bur densharing arrangements with respect to state and local progra ms assessed as being worthy of continued fina ncial support treat terrorism prevention grants uniquely secretary chertoff recently stated that one of the unique areas in which the dhs can add value is in the area of prevention he st ated obviously when it comes to terrorism our best solution is solution that prevents terrori st act before it actually comes about and critical element in that is our early warning system which is intelligence59 notwithstanding this statement review of aggregate budget data for homelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs28 60 see office of management and budget analytical perspectives budget of the united states government fiscal year 2007 table 32 p 33 intelligence and warning is one of six critical mission areas outlined in the national strategy for homeland security there is at least one caveat to these figures wh ile the figures for the intelligence and warning include those reported by the departments of defense and justice and the intelligence community management account other intelligence community funds dedicated to the homeland security intelligence and warning function might not be captured in the omb datasecurity expenditures suggests that less than 1 of what the us government spends on homeland security is dedicated to intelligence and warning an essential element in the prevention component of homeland security60 while there are many similarities in the response capability wh ether the response be to successful terrorist attack or natural disaster terrori st acts can be prevented natural disasters cannot information related to meteorology is different from intelligence related to national security the threat element of the risk reduction formula is what differentiates terrorism from ll other hazards as men tioned throughout this report terrorist threats are dynamic and evolve over time some might argue the risk assessment methodology and atte ndant grant allocation pro cess should be as agile as the adversary against which its resources are directed dhs currently has an intelligence enterprise strategic plan and the fy2007 grant application kit provides guidance for state local and regional intelligence fusion centers yet the linkages between these two documents and the grant process some would argue is tenuous one of the homeland security presidential directive hspd8 derived universal tasks is prevention drawing upon the national strategy for combating terrorism congress may ultimately consider recommending that dhs provide specific and articulable strategy and pproach to terrorism prevention which would include focus on how the grant allocation process is tailored to fully leverage intelligence across levels of government to prevent terrorist actshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33858crs29 appendix legislative activity on dhs risk formula for grants s 1013
