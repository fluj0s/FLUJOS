and canada have undergone several changes in tenor over the past three decades the 1980s and early 1990s were marked by an increasingly close partnership whose milestones included the mid 1980s shamrock summits named after the irish heritage shared by the two countries leaders brian mulroney and r onald reagan the 1988 uscanada free trade agreement and the 1993 north am erican free trade agreement nafta to many canadians however ottawa seemed at times to have drawn bit too close to washington dc with canada casting itself too willingly in secondary role in 1994 one canada watcher observed that in the foreign policy arena canada politely distances itself from the united states in certain ways2 in an interview that year for nationally syndicated american magazine the newly elected liberal prime minister jean chrétie n summed up his view of the bilateral relationship we like each other i just dont want canada to be perceived as being the 51st state of america with more mature relation w ill exist between us and the united states3 some believe however that this initial show of mild reserve was intended for domestic consumption particularly dur ing election campaigns and that canada and the united states in fact continued to enjoy excellent relations chrétien and clinton are said to have had congenial meetings they focused on areas where the two countries were able to reach agreement including envi ronmental issues cooperation on border measures and technology projects in february 2001 president george w bush met with chrétien the two leaders discussed energy missile defense and trade since september 11 however economic and environmen tal issues have often taken back seat to joint efforts to improve security both at home and abroad canada became involved in the crisis at the outset and has cooperate d closely with the united states in efforts to combat international terrorism in the immediate aftermath of the 911 attacks us airspace was temporarily closed and canada allowed more than 200 flights to american destinations to be divert ed to canadian airports nevertheless chrétien did not establish with presid ent bush the same rapport

harpers c onservatives may be similar to that of the republicans in washington differences have still arisen on certain issues particularly those that touch upon matters of percei ved sovereignty for example on january 26 2006 days before his inauguration harper sharply took exception to comments made earlier by us ambassador to canada david wilkin s and asserted canadas sovereignty over the

contracts to québec advertising firms associated with the liberal party the auditor general who characterized the program as such blatant misuse of public funds that it is shocking reported that

they currently hold 127 out of 308 seats in the house of commons and are governing as minority the libera ls have 96 seats the bloc québécois 48 and the ndp 30 four members are seated as independents and there are three vacancies7 some analysts caution that the tory victory does not necessarily represent paradigm shift to the right in canadian politics they note that the conservative party won only 37 of the popular vote because minority gove rnments only last an average of about 18 months in canada pr ime minister harper has been keeping one eye on the next elections8 in addition harper has relied upon the ad hoc support of the other three parties to ensure passage of the various items on his legislative agenda many therefore believe that is why he has advocated fairly centrist policies by for example seeking legislative appr oval of the five priorities on which he campaigned 1 greater government acc ountability 2 shorter health care wait times 3 tax cuts 4 child care

during his twoplus years as prime minister harper has dealt with severa l other issues including th environment crime senate reform and health care for the most part he has not forcefully advocated controversial social issues however harper has been willing to challenge public opinion over canadas participation in the international stabilization effort in afghanistan where the liberal government deployed troops in 2002 in march 2006 he made surprise visit to canadian troops in kandahar two months later he w on narrow vote in parliament to keep canadian troops in afghanistan for two additional year s harper initially characterized the mission as humanitarian in nature and also asserted that it was in canadas national interest to demonstrate its ability to play leadership role internationally over the past two years however canadian ope rations have shifted from peacekeeping to counterinsurgency and public support for canadas presence in afghanistan has diminished the government has been banking on new approach that emphasizes training afghan troops to replace departing canadians in the fall of 2007 harper appointed an adviso ry panel headed by former liberal foreign affairs minister john manley to review options on the mission in december 2007 the commission found that th troop presence was justifiable and that the mission should be maintained until 2011 but recommended that canadian forces be withdrawn unless nato allies stepped up their contributions the recommendation became the basis of february 2008 compromise between the liberals and

scheduled to hold its next elections by october 2009 in recent months the conservatives have been ch allenging the opposition to defeat major legislation and thereby trigger snap vote but the liberals

was reduced steadily each year until 1998 when then finance minister paul martin introduced canadas first balanced budget in nearly three decades this dramatic eliminati on of the deficit was accomplished in part through higher than anticipated tax reve nues and through such politically risky measures as cutting federal funding for hea lth and education tran sfers and applying means test to those eligible for seniors benefits for the past eleven years canadian politicians have been in postdeficit environment in which they have had to select among competing demands on annual budget

is committed federalist which rules out another s overeignty referendum during his tenure in the early part of hi s first term charest lost popularity when he attempted to reduce the economic role of the provincial government those efforts prompted strong protests from the powe rful public service unions some québec watchers assert that charest learned from this experience and changed his tactics charest was said to have been encourag ed by the victory of harper who favors greater government decentralization the two also share an opposition to sovereignty and for pragmatic political r easons have cooperate d with one another in several areas16 many believe that harper and by association charest won favor in the province in november 2006 by gain ing parliamentary pproval in ottawa of

continually repeating the threepoint mantra that the united states enjoys excellent relations with strong and united canada that the québec question is an internal issue that is for canadians to decide and that the united states does not wish to interfere with canadas domestic matters however some analysts detected slight tilt on the part of clinton administration toward the federalists dur

between certain ports it could also be used by commercial fishing or crui ships ships supporting arc tic scientific research or resource exploration or military ships th presence of ships in the passage could require the establishment and enforcement of shipping lanes and other rules for ensuring safe ship operations while in the passage add to existing demands for maritime search and rescue capabilities and create risk of environmental damage to the arctic due to engine exhaust fuel spills dumping of waste or release of ballast water containing contaminan ts or nonnative marine organisms the use of the passage by foreign military ships might be viewed as creating potential security risks to canada and the united states successive canadian governments have maintained that such passage would be an inland waterway and would therefore be sovereign canadian territory subject to ottawas surveillance and regulation the united states the european union japan nd others assert that the passage would constitute an international strait between two high seashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs23 background and analysis arctic sovereignty has been an issue for canada for decades in the 1980s the mulroney g overnment proposed the purchase of large icebreaker to patrol the region but the proposal was scrapped due to budget constraints in 1985 us icebreaker the polar sea caused an uproar in canada when it traversed the waters of the nor thern archipelago without first seeking permission afterward washington and ttawa came to an agreement under which the united states pledged to notify canada when its ships would transit the region and canada agreed to grant its consent in recent years however the question over who if anyone would have control over the regional waters has intensified as scientific consensus has gr own that the melting of the polar icecap will open up northwest passage during the summer months the debate over the northwest passage has commercial environmental and security considerations the opening of channel of water during the summer months through canadas 36000 island arctic archipelago would cut shipping routes between europe and asia by 30004000 miles saving time and fuel costs also it is believed that larger vessels which cannot use the panama canal would be able to sail the passage however many ca nadians are concerned that unfettered maritime traffic through the region could result in serious environmental hazzards ranging from the catastrophe of an oil sp ill to more cumulative pollution caused by ocean dumping of ballast and garbage by tran siting vessels in terms of security the canadians are concerned that recognition of the passage as international waters would result in free access to naval warships and submarines including for example those of russia and china canada seeks recognition of its sovere ignty over the entire area among other reasons because of strong national identif ication with its northern regions ottawa argues that it has historical claim based on centuries of inuit inhabitation of the islands and of the ice extending from th em from practical standpoint canada wishes to have the ability to enforce protection of the fragile arctic ecosystem and to ensure sustainable commercial fishing pr actices in addition the canadians want there to be doubt that they have rights to the regions abunda nt natural resources including oil natural gas min erals and precious metals the harper government has been seeking to bolster canadas sovereignty claim by establishing stronger military presen ce in july 2007 harper announced plans for the construction of 68 ar med mediumsized icebreakers to patrol the north the following month he traveled to resolu bay nunavut and announced plans to construct winter warfare training cente r and deepwater port in the region he declared that canadas new government understands that the first principle of arctic sovereignty is use it or lose it some canadians however have criticized harper for seeking to militarize the debate the prospective passage raises jurisdicti onal questions canadians maintain that it would be an internal waterway and would likely require all vessels to register with their coast guards vessel traffic reporting system they contend that this would facilitate possible searchandrescue missions and would dissuade ships bearing contraband from sailing through the region there is general agreement that the natural resources in the region are canadian the debate concerns free transit rights analysts note that the convention on the law of the seas calls for the right ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs24 57 prepared by blas nuñezneto analyst in domestic security domestic social policy divisiontransit passage between one part of the high seas and another part of the high seas in addition some anal ysts believe that the recogn ition of the northwest passage as canadian inland waterway would set an international precedent that might be viewed as applicable elsewhere in the world other governments could echo canadas sovereignty claim nd prohibit the passage of u s naval ships as well as of oil tankers bound for the united states the straits of malacca and hormuz have been cited as examples others however such as former us ambassador to canada paul cellucci argue that it would be in the interests of us national security if canada were to ma nage and police shipping through the straits several possible solutions have been put forward some argue that canada could achieve its objectives through regu lations approved by the international maritime organization als it has suggested that nor ad and the arctic council might be able to coordinate cooperative patrolling of th passage others though not the united states have proposed that the countries bordering the arctic adopt an agreement prohibiting military residentia l or commercial use of the region as was done for antarctica in 1959 status of the issue the bush administration has not made major issue of the future northwest passage at the tr ilateral leaders summit of the security and prosperity partnershi p held in august 2007 in montebello quebec president bush reiterated the administrations policy that any future northwest passage would be considered straits for inte rnational navigation for the time being the ottawa and washington have agreed to disagree however canadian analysts have argued that the debate over who should manage the st raits will intensify if ships carrying hazardous materials or illegal immigrants ar discovered in the region because it has been highlighted as priority area for the harper government this issue will likely continue to be the subject of bila teral discussions betw een us and canadian policymakers questions 1 several governme nts have taken issue w ith canadas assertion of sovereignty over the arc tic waters do any foreign countries support canada on this question has the canadian government offered legal precedent for its claim 2 if canada were to win recognition of its sovereignty over the passage how might it regulate shipping traffic through the straits 3

such an approach is already present at canadian airports there has been interest in expanding it to areas away from land ports of entry what is the canadian government doing to facilitate this objective what was the reason that negotiations over the landborder pilot program failed are there any potential solutions for the problems that led to the precl earance pilots to be scrapped border security trade and commercial concerns58 issue definition the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 increased scrutiny of the canadian border as possible point of entry for terrorists or for weapons of mass destruction the potential for economic disruption that closing the border would cau has spurred coope ration between the united states and canada to improve border security in an atmosphere conducive to continued and expanded commerce this brief details commercial considerations in uscanadian border security discussions background the issue of border security is linked to the increased integration of the united st ates and canadian economies this integration has been aided by several trade agreements culminating in the north american free trade agreement of 1994 nafta these trad agreements not only eliminated tariff barriers between the two nations but also reoriented canadas industrial structure towards the united states industries in each country are now able to produce goods for larger continentwide market and productivity has increased through increased economies of scale and specialization such specialization led to increased bilateralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs28 trade much of it in intermediate products this integration has in turn led to industrial practices such as just in time parts procurement that depend on relatively open border the volume of economic activity across the border underscores the extent of economic integration between the united st ates and canada today the united states and canada have th largest trading relationship in the world with over 15 billion per day in goods and services cro ssing the border in 2007 canada purchases 213 of us exports share larger than japan and the entire european union and supplies 16 of all us imports the united states supplie d 649 of canadas imports of goods in 2007 and purchased 763 of canadas rchandise exports twoway trade with the united states represents nearly 40 of canadian gdp the ambassador bridge that links detroit mich igan and windsor ontario is the largest trade link in the world with more than 7000 daily truck crossing s totaling more than 120 billion per year action programs and initiatives new initiatives to increase security of the border without impeding the flow of commerce are being developed under the security and prosperity partnership spp which was launched by the leaders of the united states canada and xico in march 2005 many of these initiatives expand upon previous bilateral efforts by the unite d states and canada including the smart border action plan of december 2001 consis ting of 4 pillars the secure flow of people the secure flow of goods s ecure infrastructure and coordinated enforcement and information sharing th pillar concerned with the flow of goods consists of initiatives on harmonized commercial processing supply chain management clearance away from the border joint or shared facilities enhancement of information sharing nd infrastructure improvements the us bureau of customs and border protections customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat and the canadian border security agencys partners in protection program are supplychain security initiatives in which companies undertake auditbased co mpliance measures to enhance security along the supply chain goods shi pped under these programs are eligible for preclearance away from the border the spp calls for the two programs to be harmonized within two years the free and secure trade fast is joint harmonized commercial processing initiative at 21 border locations which provides for dedicated inspection lanes to goods carried by approved lowe rrisk shippers to goods purchased from preauthorized importers such as ctp at and to goods transported by pre authorized drivers and carriers complementary program nexus to expedite the secure movement of people has also been established for frequent travelers who have undergone security clearances on both sides of the border another objective of the border security efforts has been the screening of goods entering north america the ongoing us container security initiative csi is designed to prescreen high risk containers entering the united states at overseas ports of departure under the spp the three countries will develop common screening methods and technology establish criteria to identify high risk cargo and harmonize cargo information technology preclearance and prescreening is possiblehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs29 first step in the creation of north ameri can security perimeter concept whereby clearance occurs at the first point of trance rather than at the final border status land preclearance away from the border by us and canadian customs agents working in each others territory is an issue that has proven controversial primarily due to concerns about sovereig nty joint uscanada customs teams already operate in the csi ports of lifax montreal and vancouver as well as newark and seattletacoma lthough the visiting agent serves only an advisory role with enforcement powers the spp calls for negotiations on uscanada preclearance agreement with implementation of two pilot sites the peace bridge buffalo nyfort erie on and the thous and islands bridge alexandria bay ny landsdowne on however these nego tiations were susp ended on april 26 2007 over the issue of fingerprinting canadian citizens crossing the border canadian law does not provide for fingerprinting canadian citizens that have not been charged with crime second issue is the ability of the tran sportation infrastructure to cope with increased security measures the aging condition and limited capacity of the land border infrastructure preceded the terrorist attacks for example the ambassador bridge and the detroitwindsor tunnel wh ich together carry 25 of total us canada crossborder traffic both opened in 1930 approaches to the crossings often city streets have been criticized as inadequate to the commercial needs of the 21st century this issue affects the efficient implementation of security measures thefast system provides for dedicated nes at land border ports for expedited preclearance however these lanes will not save time if the fa st participant cannot access this lane due to congestion or delays at the points of access the spp completed pilot program that attained 25 improvement in border crossing times at the detroitwindsor gateway in decembe r 2005 yet the aging and adequacy of the border infrastructure may affect whether such improvements are sustainable binational partnership to c onstruct additional crossing capacity at the detroit windsor gateway is engaged in technical and environmental asse ssments of potential new crossing sites however the opening of new bridge or tunnel capacity is not envisioned before 2013 questions 1 is canada doing enough to s ecure the border against the transit of terrorists or weapons of mass destruc tion do canadians think that the united states has placed too much emphasis on securing the northern border against terrorists to the detriment of efficient trade relations 2 is canadian sovereignty threatened by having us customs agents with enforcement powers active on canadian soil do you believe the fingerprinting issue is makeorbreak issue concerning land preclearance what are the elements of sovereignty that most concern you is legislative action necessary to permit this cooperation 3 are canadian business and government officials concer ned that another terrorist related border shutdown could cause the re location of business to the united states or dampen the attractivene ss of canada as recipien t of foreign investment httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs30 59

should busine ss pick up part of the tab immigration and refugee policies59 issue definition should the united states be concerned that canadas immigration and refugee laws and policies pose threat to its national security background and analysis although canada doe s not have country or worldwide immigration quotas the government does tablish annual targets in 2005 and 2006 canada accep ted approximately 260000 and 250000 new permanent residents respectively an additi onal 100000 persons were accepted annually as temporary residents many of these temporary residents were unskilled workers or students new arrivals as permanent and temporary residents total more than 1 of the entire canadian population asian countries such as china india pakistan and the philippines are heavily represented at the top of the list of countries from which canadas immigrants come but one nation dominates iran is the country closest to the middle east that recently has been in the top ten security checks are conducted by federal authorities because quebec however has an agreement with the federal government that allows it to select immigrants intending to settle in that province quebecs system adds second screening process for its applicants quebec also has addressed security concerns by adjusting its programs for recruiting immigrants the federal government and quebec use point systems for assessing independent applicants that were changed ten years ago to attract more highly skilled and educated immigrants regardless of whether they had arranged employment or not under this system canada accepts much higher percentage of independent immigrants and much lower percentage of family class immigrants than does the united states immigrant groups and the opposition parties that support increases in the family reunification program fear that recent government proposal to give priority to the processing of certain app licants who have arranged employment will drive the skilled worker category even higher one notable feature of canadian immigration is that nearly threequarters of the persons accepted settle in the three larges t cities toronto m ontreal and vancouver this tendency combined with the high ra of immigration has ra ised some concerns about destructive diaspora nationalism emerging in these concentrated communities the 2006 arrests of group of muslims who had been raised in canada and had planne d attacks in southern ontario fueled this concern however this problem is not unique to canada and opposition to immigration has not been voiced nearly as loudly or as forcefully as it recently has been in parts of western europe in fact immigration still generally is viewed as an opportunity for growth in what would otherwise be declining population the canadian policy for asylum applican ts is far more contentious issue within the country than immigration not so much for its negative effects withinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs31 canada but because it genera lly is believed to invite fraud and abuse between 1989 and 2004 an average of about 30000 refugee claims were presented annually in 2006 the number of refugees was appr oximately 32500 and bout 47 of the applications were accepted this number is higher than the corresponding figure in the united states of particular concern to canadian officials prior to 2005 was the fact that approximately 40 of the overall total claimants and some 70 of portofentry claimants had entered canada through the united states there was significant evidence that illegal migrants were abusing the us nonimmigrant visa system to access north america and the canadian asylum system to stay in canada canada is attractive to these persons because it detains fe w undocumented refugee claimants pending independent identificati on and because the federal and provincial governments grant immediate assistance to applicants who have yet to substantiate their claims the result has been that the majority of canadas refugee claimants arrive in canada without an documents and are allowed free entry into the country even though it is clear that many disposed of the documents they had before coming to canada while canadian officials do not often tain undocumented arrivals canada has created new facilities for the detention for persons who may be viewed as posing security or flight risk number of us television programs that have portrayed the canadian refugee system as extremely liberal have received considerable attention in canada most of these segments have mentioned four highp rofile cases of terrorists from the middle east who entered canada as refugees with the intention of launching attacks against us targets among these examples was the case of ahmed ressam who was captured in 1999 while crossing the border with explosives that he planned to set off at angeles international airport also highlighted have been the cases of suspected terrorists who have remained in the country for many years while fighting their way through very lengthy appeal process in 2002 the supreme court of canada ruled that two persons linked to terrorist organi zations could be deported to countries where they might f ace torture when security c oncerns so require one of these individuals was returned to iran fa irly quickly but the other has continued fighting his extradition to sri lanka american media coverage of the canadian refugee system has elicited wide range of responses while number of ca nadian commentators agree that the united states has good reason to fear that canada s refugee policies can be easily employed by terrorists to enter north america others contend that terrorists are more likely to use other means to enter both canada and th united states many analysts point out that there is evidence that any of the september 11 hijackers had canadian connection and that the refugee system esse ntially has been used for queue jumping by enterprising persons who might not qualify under canada s immigration laws proponents of this view question how great th security risk to the united states can be if significant number of claimants are coming to canada from this country in december 2002 the united states and canada signed safe third country agreement to allow immigration officials in both countries to require most persons seeking asylum at border crossing to go back and present the claims in their respective countries this type of agreem ent had been called for in the action plan to the smart border declaration signed in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks in the united states implementation of the agreement was delayed by the lengthyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs32 and complicated process for drafting and pproving appropriate regulations in the united states but it finally went into for ce at the beginning of 2005 in 2007 judge of the federal court of canada held that the law implementing the agreement was unconstitutional because the united states doe s not fully comply with international conventions on refugees this action follo wed two other court decisions in which part of the definition of terrorism in th antiterrorism act and the procedure for detaining suspected terrorists under the immigration laws were both struck down the government has appealed the deci sion respecting the safe third country agreement to the federal court of appeal and the agreement remains in force pending resolution of the case by that body or the supreme court of canada although the safe third country agreement aims to limit asylum shopping and the filing of multiple claims it is limited in scope and subject to several major exceptions one major limitation is that it only covers the presentation of claims at land border crossings air port and marine fac ilities are not covered because as the drafters of the agreement have explaine d authorities know that persons are in the other country only in instances where they are seen crossing the border however critics contend that this will simply encourage wouldbe refugee claimant to sneak into his or her country of choice illegally or fly into country of choice in order to present claim the agreement also cont ains very broad exceptions for relatives including relatives of other asylum seekers and it allows the parties to examine any refugee status claim made to that party where it determines that it is in the public interest to do so because the safe third country agreement generally is opposed by refugee groups in both countries it is lik ely that internal pressure will be put on both countries to invoke this rese rved right in particular cases statistics show that the number of refug ee claims presented at border crossings in canada declined by pproximately 40 in the firs t half of 2005 and fewer than 20000 total claims were filed for the enti re year in 2006 the number of refugees admitted for permanent residence was down about 3000 from 2005 although the data would suggest that the safe third county agreement had dramatic immediate impact it also has been noted that claims presented at airports which are not subject to the agreement initially were down bout 25 thus the safe third country agreement appears to have gone into ffect during period in which the number of refugee claims already was declining since then increased enforcement in the united states has helped offset some of the immediate benefits to canada of the safe third country agreement by encouraging mo re persons to seek refuge in canada one longstanding problem in canada is that deportati on is very complicated and lengthy process the number of persons deported has been growing but canadas auditorgeneral recently found that the government does not know the whereabouts of approximately twothirds of the over 60000 persons who are subject to deportation or removal or ders included in this gr oup are persons who were found to be inadmissible on the gr ounds of criminality while the auditorgeneral was critical of the situation she did not find that the missing persons constituted clear national security risk questions 1 could the safe third count ry agreement have had broader application and will it eventually withstand judicial scrutiny on legal including constitutional grounds in cana da and the united states

agricultu re industrial tariffs services and the special needs of developing countries in the international trading system background and analysis canadas interest in the world trading system can be partly attributed to its dependence on it in the halfcentury since the signing of the gatt canada has developed an export driven economy in 1947 canada exported approximately 2 of its gdp that figure was 29 of gdp in 2007 imports of goods represent 27 of gdp it has been estimate d that onethird of canadian employment is dir ectly dependent on internationa l trade the united states is canadas largest trading partner buy ing 76 of its merchandise exports and supplying 65 of canadas goods imports in 2007 it must be noted however that much of this trade relationship is due mo re to the canadaus free trade agreement of 1988 which was incorporated into th north american fr ee trade agreement in 1994 than to multilateral tr ade liberalization recently some commentators have questioned

or desirability of furthering the process of north american integration while concerns in the united states over the uscanada border are focused primarily on border security and immigration issues the debate in canada has become much broader encompassing such issues as sovereignty the desirability and feasibility of further economic integration with the united states and even the adoption of the us dollar this disc ourse is not unusual in canada questions concerning its relationship with the united states continually loom large in policy discussions recent initiatives however may spur the process of economic integration the venue for discussion of further econo mic and security cooperation in north america has become the security and pros perity partnership spp in 2005 the leaders of the united states canada and mexico pledged to develop series of security and economic coopera tion measures among the thr ee countries of the north american free trade agreement nafta ministerial working groups were established to develop conc rete proposals the first t of which were announced in june 2005 additional measures were nnounced at the trila teral cancun summit in march 2006 montebello quebec in august 2007 and new orleans louisiana in april 2008 the impetus for the establishment of the spp has been the effect on trade from the increase in security along the border following the 2001 terror attacks as well as the growing perception among some that nafta needs to be reinvigorated in order to compete with the growing economic power of asia many of the security planks expand on the smar t border action plan of 2001 for further information see security and prospe rity partnership of north america many of these initiatives reportedly were chosen because they could be undertaken through the regulatory process and would not require legislation some initiatives are being developed by the north american competitiveness council formed after the 2006 summit business groups in the united states and canadahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs36 have generally supported th is effort and some have called for its expansion however other groups have decried what they consider the unde mocratic nature of implementing regulatory changes without gislative approval and what they consider the businessdriven agenda of the initia tives some canadians also fear that regulatory harmonization given the wi disparity in population and economic power of the two nations would inevitably l ead canada to adopt us standards and implicitly the policies behind them more generally some in canada believe th lesson from september 11 is that increased cooperation with the united states is both necessary and inevitable given the reality of canadian tr ade flows and economic interd ependence several long term economic options have receive d renewed attention including customs union common market or monetary union these concepts are not new they have been discussed in conjunction with deepeningnafta consequently these discussions often involve mexico as well customs union the first step usually discussed regarding the further integration of the north american economy is the creation of customs union members of customs union commonly eliminate tariffs among themselves and erect common barriers against the rest of th world both the us and canada have already eliminated all tariffs between each other under nafta and have similar though not identical tariff schedules with third countries however the continued use of trade remedy laws against each ot her would be called into doubt although customs duties would be paid at ports of entry at the perimeter of the customs union border agents would still enforce immigra tion sanitary and phytosanitary and environmental laws as customs union does not imply harmonization or mutual recognition of each nations regulations common market or economic union in addition to common tariff policy and free trade in goods and serv ices common market would imply free movement of capital and labor at this point harmoniza tion of certain investment and immigration issues would need to be agreed upon type of economic union approaching that of the european union would also require harmonized or mutually recognized standards and regulations and perhaps some supranational institutions although the united states and canada share many devel oped country level standards this form of integration woul d require regulatory harmonization or mutual standards recognition for example would the united states adopt the metric system to fulfill its obligations to harmonize standards could the two nations adopt common forestry practices and management policies that have been at the heart of the softwood lumber dispute these questi ons illustrate the extent to which north american economic integration may affect the governance of the united states canada and possibly mexico monetary union the concept of monetary union took hold in canada during the 1990s and early 2000s when the canadian dollar steadily depreciated against the us dollar however since 2003 the looni named after the bird on the c1 coin has risen over 40 from 2002 levels to pa rity in november 2007 and has hovered around that point since then the loonie is benefitting from record high prices for energy and other primary products hence talk of the desirab ility of monetary union has been muted however those who s upport monetary union argue that it wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs37 62 prepared by angeles villarreal specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionforce canada to make the necessary structural adjustments that would make it more competitive with the united states in add ition business would also reap significant savings in transaction costs associated with the huge volume of bilateral trade opponents of monetary union contend that it would lead to an unacceptable loss of political and economic sovereignty acco rding to them monetary policy would be dependent on or tied to actions of the u s federal reserve with which canada would have little influence status of the issue the active pursuit of north american integration is not frontburner issue for either the united st ates or canadian government however the evolution of the spp indicates that the three nafta countries are beginning to think about the parameters of economic integrati on and may be taking the first steps towards the creation of north american economic space questions 1 how does the canadian public feel about closer economic ties with the united states is there perceptible difference on this issue among canadian political parties 2 has the loonies appreciation since 2002 hurt the canadian manufacturing sector that previously relied in part on weak currency to maintain competitiveness 3 has the security and prosperity partne rship received much attention in canada has it proved controvers ial do you think parliame nt and congress should be more involved in making these decisions security and prosperity partnership of north america62 issue definition how can the united states cooperate with its north american neighbors on issues related to tr ade transportation and security what has been the impact of the security and pr osperity partnership of north america in improving security and competitiveness in north america background and analysis the security and prosperity partnership of north america spp is trilateral initiative launched in march 2005 that is intended to increase cooperation and information sharing in an effort to increase and enhance prosperity in the united states canada and mexic the spp is government initiative that wa s endorsed by the leaders of the three countries but it is not signed agreement or treaty nd therefore contains legally binding commitments or obligations it can at best be characterized as an endeavor by the three countries to facilitate communication and cooperati on across several key policy areas of mutual interest although the spp builds upon the existing trade and economic relationship of the three countries it is not trade agreement and is distinct from the existing north american free trade agreement nafta some keyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs38 issues for congress regarding the spp concern possible implications related to national sovereignty transportation corridor s cargo security and border security these issues are discussed in vari ous sections of the report since 2005 the spp working groups have made annual recommendations to the north american leaders on how to accomp lish the goals of the spp in 2008 the working groups agreed to continue to advance the agenda of the spp by identifying and focusing on set of high priority in itiatives they decided to 1 increase the competitiveness of north american businesses and econo mies through more compatible regulations 2 make borders smarter and more secure by coordinating longterm infrastructure plans enhancing services and reducing bottlenecks and congestion at major border crossings 3 st rengthen energy security and protect the environment by developing framework for harmonization of energy efficiency standards and sharing technical informa tion 4 improve access to safe food and health and consumer products by increas ing cooperation and information sharing on the safety of food and products and 5 improve north american response to emergencies by updating bilate ral agreements to enable government authorities from the three countries help each other more qui ckly and efficiently during times of crisis goals of the spp in the area of prosperity are to increase cooperation and sharing of information in order to improve productivity reduce the costs of trade and enhance the quality of life leaders from the three countries have highlighted the need to enhance north american competitiveness through compatible regulations and standards that would help the three c ountries protect health safety and the environment as well as to facilitate trade in goods and services across their borders in the 2008 joint statement the leaders hi ghlighted the need for the three countries to implement compatible fuel efficiency regimes and high safety standards to protect human health and the environment and to reduce the costs of producing cars and trucks for the north american market they also emphasized their efforts to advance intellectual property rights protection in north america through the intellectual property action strategy the spp is not trade agreement nor form of economic integration and goes only as far as leading to some measure of regulatory harmonization among the united states canada and mexico the spp working groups are not contemplating further market integration in north america such move would require government approval process within each of the three countries in the united states such an agreement would require the pproval of the us congress the goal of the security components of the spp is to coordinate the security efforts undertaken by each of the three par ticipating nations to better protect citizens from terrorist threats and transnational crime while promoting the safe and efficient movement of legitimate people and goods working groups were established to address the security aspects of the spp and are grouped by three broad themes 1 external threats to north america 2 streamlined and secured shared borders and 3 prevention and response within north america one of the stated goals of the spp is to improve the safety security and efficiency of the flow goods between the three

concerns how to design policies that facilitate the efficient entry of legitimate cargo while simultaneously ensuring that sufficient level of security and scrutiny is applied to deny the entry of illegitimate cargo since 911 the us government has undertaken number of initiatives aimed at improving cargo security and the facilitation of legitimate or lowrisk cargo two spp security working groups are devoted to cargo security and bor der facilitation some critics of the spp believe that it may be more than an initiative to increase cooperation and that it could lead to th creation of common market or economic union in north america others contend that it may ultimately lead to socalled nafta superhighway that would link the united states canada and mexico with supercorridor however if the united states were to potentially consider the formation of customs union or co mmon market with its north american neighbors it would require pproval by the us congress the federal government has stated that there are plans to build nafta superhighway and that supercorridor initiative of any sort is part of the spp further legal authority exists and funds have been appropriated to c onstruct such superhighway nor are there current plans to seek such authority or funding status of the issue the united states canada and mexico have made progress in recent years in addressing issues related to north american competitiveness and security through the spp the spp serves as mechanism to increase communications among north american trading partners on issues of mutual concern but because it is not binding agreement its role in improving prosperity and security may be limited questions 1 how effective has the spp been in improving north american competitiveness through its focus on intellectual property rights protection and regulation harmonization what other steps can be taken within the spp to improve competitiveness and is this the appropriate mechanism to do so 2 how effective has the spp been in improving safety security and the flow of goods and services among the north ameri can partners what other steps could be taken in these areas us imports of canadian softwood lumber63 issue definition the us lumber industry has long argued that imports of subsidized canadian lumber were injuring us producers in may 2002 after the us lumber industry filed antidumping and countervailing petitions to restrict imports agency determinations of canadian subsidies dumping and injury to the us industry led to duty of 29 on most canadian softwood lumber imported into the united states canada challenged these findings under nafta and before thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs40 wto negotiations led to sevenyear agreement with canadian export charges depending on us lumber prices and th united states revoked the countervailing and antidumping orders recent us in terest group complaints have asserted unfaithful implementation of the agreement background and analysis us lumber producers have long expressed concerns about imports of subsidized canadian lumber the current lumber agreement is termed lumber iv because it is the result of the fourth dispute since 1981 with various findings of subsidy vels and agreements in the previous disputes tension between the united states and canada over softwood lumber trade may be inevitable both countries have exte nsive forest resources but vastly different population levels and development pressures vast stretches of canada are still largely undeveloped while less area in the united states outside alaska remains relatively pristine these differences have led to divergent forest policies in canada 90 of the forests are owned by the provincial gove rnments which have allocated and priced timber to encourage development of the extensive timber reserves and settlement of unpopulated areas in the united states 58 of timberlands are privately owned and private markets dominate the allocation and pricing of timber us federal and other governmentowned forests are regionally important but the timber is typically sold in competitive market us lumber producers assert that subs idies have given ca nadian producers an unfair advantage in the us market ca nadian provincial stumpage fees for the right to harvest trees are asserted to be subsidized leading to lumber prices that are less than their fair market value the pr ovinces generally use leases and administered fees to allocate and price timber administered fees are unlikely to match market values but determining whether the fees are below market values has been controversial because of differences in tree species sizes and grades in measurement systems in requirements on harvesters in envi ronmental protection and in other factors log export restrictions in british columbia are also alleged to be subsidies because they assure more supply less co mpetition for timber and thus lower costs for canadian producers evidence from the us pacific northwest where private logs can be exported but public timber cannot indicates substantially higher prices for exported logs injuries to us lumber producers are di fficult to establish decisively although the us international trade commission itc has found injury every time it has examined the issue canadas share of the us lumber market has risen substantially from less than 7 in the ear ly 1950s to more than 33 since the mid 1990s under the 1996 agreement the quantity of imports continued to rise but the market share was relatively stable the impact of restrictions on us lumber prices is not easily estimated but restrictions have probably put upward pressure on prices status of the issue in 2001 after the 1996 uscanada softwood lumber agreement expired the us coalition for fair lumber imports filed countervailing duty and antidumping petitions asking the doc to investigate canadian importshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs41 again the department of commerce issued final determinati ons of subsidies on march 22 2002 on may 3 2002 the itc deter mined that the us lumber industry was threatened with material injury by canadian imports duty averaging 27 was imposed on may 22 2002 canada challenged each of the agency determinations under the north america free trade agreement nafta and in the world trade organization wto the nafta panels largely supported the ca nadian positions the wto proceedings resulted in mixed decisions canada was also concerned that the us5 billion in estimated duties on softwood lumber collected by the united states would eventually be distributed to us lumber producer s under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act byrd amendment canada obtained us court decision however holding that the byrd amendment di d not apply to canadian imports on april 26 2006 tentative 7year ag reement with an optional twoyear renewal to resolve the dispute was announced the united states revoked the countervailing and antidumping duty orders and returned about us4 billion to the importers of record the remaining posits about us1 billion were split evenly between the members of the coalition for fair lumber imports and jointly agreed upon initiatives canada is collecting ex port charges ranging up to 15 depending on weighted average lumber price or up to 5 with volume restraints surge mechanism would raise export charges if canadian regions exports exceed its allocated share lumber from logs rvested in the atlantic provinces yukon northwest territories or nunavut is exempt from the export charges disputes are to be resolved through b ilateral consultati ons nonbinding mediation or binding arbitration in the london court of internationa l arbitration us interest groups have questioned wh ether canada is fa ithfully implementing the agreement in august 2007 us fficials requested ruling from the london court on export quota volumes and export tax levels in march 2008 the court ruled that canada had violated the export quota volumes for its eastern provinces for the first six months of 2007 but was not required to collect taxes related to export surges from alberta and british columbia during that period decision on the remedy for the violation is pending in january 2008 us officials filed another arbitration case alleging that ontario and quebec lumber industry subsidies violate the agreement decision is due by september separately in january us officials sent letter to canadian officials expressing concern about possible subsidies from the proposed 1 billion community development trust questions 1 the dispute over us imports of canadian lumber has persisted for more than 25 years do canadian producers have significant cost advantage because of canadian timber prac tices andor subsidies should canadian practices be modified to enhance competition for timber do the systems and situations vary sufficiently to warrant di fferent responses to each canadian province what might be the environmental cons equences of various possible changes 2 the 2006 agreement terminated the duties returned most of the money collected and established

weak lumber markets without providing subsidies to the lumber industry what unilateral us enforcement measures might be accepta ble to canada under the agreement us agricultural support dispute64 issue definition in january 2007 canada reque sted consultations with the united states under the auspices of the world trade organizations wtos dispute settlement process to discuss three specific charges against us farm programs 1 us farm support resulted in serious prejudice ag ainst canadian corn producers 2 us domestic support exceeded its wto commitments and 3 us export credit guarantee programs contained implicit wtoillegal subsidies the request for consultations represented the first step in instituting wto dispute settlement case against the united states the assigning of an official dispute settlement case number ds357 thus tting in motion the explicit rules and timetables of the wto dispute settlement process canadas first allegation in its wto case built upon previous trade complaints against the united states initiated by ca nadian corn producers starting in 2005 while the latter two allegations were based on previous wto ruling in case wto case ds267 brought by brazil against the us cotton program the first charge of serious prejudice against ca nadian corn producers was dropped but the second and third charges retained when canada re quested the formation of wto panel to review its case against the united states in june 2007 however the importance of the case has not been diminished to the us agricultural community us agriculture depends heavily on international markets to sell its surpluses in fy2007 us agricultural exports were record 819 billion and represented 24 of gross farm income background and analysis canada and the united states have history of commodity trade disputes traditionally focused on various wheat support programs and trade practices in 2005 af ter several years of wrangling over wheat trade issues canada extended its disagreemen t with us farm programs to the corn sector when canadian corn producers sought legal ac tion for alleged unfair subsidization and dumping of us corn in canadian market s canadas intern ational trade tribunal ultimately ruled on the 2005 antidumping and countervailing duty case in favor of the united states however canadian corn producers continued to press their concerns upon the canadian government about perceived unfair subsidization of ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs43 corn in response in early 2007 the cana dian government re quested consultations with the united states to discuss several allegations against us commodity subsidies under the auspices of the wtos di spute settlement process three specific charges against us farm programs we re identified in ca nadas request for consultations including charge that us farm subsidies resulted in serious prejudice against canadian corn producers howe ver the serious prejudice charge was eventually dropped by canada from its wto case in large part because of substantial increases in us and in ternational corn prices since mid2007 the remaining two charges in canadas wto case allege that first the united states has exceeded its annual wto co mmitment levels for total aggregate measurement of support ams for agriculture in each of the years 1999 2000 2001 2002 2 004 and 20 05 and second that the us export credit guarantee program for agricultural commodities operates as wtoillegal export subsidy these charges stem in large part from previous negative ruling against us farm programs in previous case ds267 br ought by brazil against the us cotton program in that case wto panel ru led and subsequently was upheld by wto appellate body that first direct paym ents made under us farm programs do not qualify for green box exemption status b ecause of restriction prohibiting the planting of fruits vegetables or wild rice on payment acres and second the us export credit guarantee program operates as prohibited export subsidy program because the financial benefits returned by these programs failed to cover their long run operating costs as result expor t credit guarantees should be subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments canada claims that since they fail to qualify for inclusion in the green box us direct payments should be added to its ams when calculating total domestic support in addition they also charge that the ited states has imprope rly notified several of its farm support programs as exempt from the ams limit while several other programs were improperly excluded from us notifications canada also claims that when all of the outlays from these allegedly misnotified programs are included then the us ams total exceeds its wto commitment level in response to canadas charges th enus secretary of agriculture mike johanns declared in early 2007 that the ited states would vigorously defend us farm programs against any possible wto challenge by canada spokesman for the us trade representative ustr said that this dispute was an unnecessary diversion of resources and time from the doha round negotiations the official also stated that us farm programs were designed to be in compliance with its wto obligations and believed that the panel would agree status of the issues in late 2007 brazil initiated its own similar case against us farm support canada and brazil appear to have coordinated their efforts as both countries submitted offi cial requests on november 8 2007 for the dispute settlement body dsb to add the establishment of panel to its next meeting agenda in accordance with wto rules the united states blocked this first panel request at the novemb er 27 2007 dsb meeting however at its next meeting on december 17 the dsb announced the estab lishment of single panel to jointly hear both cases brought by canada ds 357 and brazil ds365 against us farm programs in their requests brazil and canada asked for single panel to

public in accordance with the understanding on rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes once the establis hment of panel has been announced the dsb has up to 45 days for panel to be appointed plus 6 months for the panel to conclude its work as result it is not likely that the panel once appointed will finish its work and issue final ruling be fore late 2008 subseque nt appeals of any negative ruling and disagreemen t over appropriate retaliatory levels etc could push resolution of the dispute well into the futu re should any eventual changes in us farm policy be needed to

anticipated that the final measure will contain some changes in cool requirements if not the implementation deadline in light of this uncertainty currently pressing issue is whether cool will in fact be implemented by september 30 or even whether usda could complete the necessary rulemaking by then background and analysis under the tariff act of 1930 as amended most unprocessed agricultural commodities have l ong been exempt from requirements that every import be clearly marked to indi cate country of origin for the ultimate purchaser the 2002 farm bill required those retailers covered

continued to argue that recordkeeping and verification costs will far exceed any perceived economic benefits to producers that smallersized farms and firms will have the most difficulty with compliance that there is little evidence consumers actually want labeling and that cool is protectionist policy that undermines free trade supporters have countered th at compliance would not be nearly as burdensome as some large industry groups and usda have attemp ted to portray it that studies show us consumers if offered clear choice will pay extra for fresh foods of domestic origin thereby strength ening demand and prices for them and that consumers have right to know where thei r foods were produced they have pointed out that all but two of the north ameri can cases of mad cow

during the 2003 blackout both countries are interconnected and operational control issues in one country can affect the electric system in bot h countries the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 requires the formation of an electric reliability organization ero with enforceable standards and mandatory membership the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has selected the north american electric reliability corporation nerc as the ero and has approved 102 of the eros 142 proposed re liability standards nerc is an industry organization whose membership had been voluntary prior to enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 its mission is to ensure that the bulk power system is reliable adequate and secure the ten regional re liability councils of nerc account for virtually all the elect ricity supplied and used in the united states canada and small portion of mexico at issue is whether the provincial and federal governments of canada will approve and enforce fercapproved reliability standards in addition the us electric i ndustry relies on canadian natural gas to generate appr oximately 16 of us electri city generation at issue is whether canada will be able to continue to increase its exports of natural gas to the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs51 background and analysis there are three com ponents of electric power delivery generation transmission and distri bution electric generators need to move their power to their ultimate customers through the transmission system crossing state and international borders the current system allows for power transfers within but not between three major regions of the united states canada and parts of mexico the area west of the rockies western interconnection texas and the eastern interconnection because of these international interconnections operational control issues in one country may affect the reliability of the power supply in the neighboring country the united states is net importer of electricity from canada in 2006 net imports of electricity from canada we re 174 terawatthours 1 terawatthour1012 watthours which increased to 296 terawa tthours in 2007 during 2006 the latest published data total sales to ultimate consumers of electricity in the united states were 3670 terawatthours on september 15 2006 the national energy board of canada entered into memorandum of understanding recognizin g nerc as the ero for jurisdictional transmission lines this allows the national energy board to promote ero standards for international transmission lines but not for lines located within canadas borders ontario is the only province that has approved nerc reliability standards transmission constraints power transfers between the united states and canada are limited by the physical infrastructure of the transmission system and its operation one method to imp rove reliability is to in crease transmission capacity bangor hydro maine and new brunswick power energized the newly constructed northeast reliability interconnect trans mission line in december 2007 sea breeze power corporation has applied for us presidential permit for the construction of 550megawatt high voltage transmission line the us department of energy has not completed its consideration of the pe rmit the proposed line would extend from vancouver island to the olympic peninsula in washington state sea breeze power corporation obtained the necessary permits from the national energy board of canada on september 7 2006 three types of constraints limit the tr ansfer capability within the existing transmission system thermal constraints voltage constraints and system operating constraints thermal constraints limit the capability of transmission line or transformer to carry power because the resistance created by the movement of electrons causes heat to be produced overheating can lead to two possible problems the transmission line loses strength which can reduce the expected life of the line and the transmission line expands and sags between the supporting towers this presents safety issues as the lines approach the ground as well as reliability concerns voltage can be likened to the pressure inside the transmission system constraints on the maximum voltage levels are set by the design of the transmission line if voltage levels exceed the maximum shortcircuits radio interference and noise may occur low voltages are also problem and can cause customers equipment to malfunction and can damage motors system operating constraints refer to reliability and security maintaining synchronization among generators on the system as well as preventing the collapse of voltages are majorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs52 aspects of the role for transmission operators ero standards require utilities to be able to handle any single outage throug h redundancy in the system reducing the constraints on the system through technol ogy improvements is one way to increase the transfer capability over existing lines status of the issue the energy policy act of 2005 provides for an electric reliability organization to develop and enforce mandatory reliability standards ferc issued final rule on the certifica tion of the ero on february 2 2006 the rulemaking included provisions for the approval and enforcement of mandatory electric reliability standards on april 4 2006 nerc filed its application to become the ero in both the united states and canada ferc approve d nerc as the ero on july 20 2006 natural gas supply significant part of us gas consumption is used to fuel power plants currently about 20 of electric generation in the united states is produced using natural gas in 2006 ge nerators consumed about 62 trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas quivalent to 29 of total c onsumption 217 tcf under the energy information administrations current annual energy outlook reference case gas used for power generation is expect ed to remain near current levels in the midterm before slowly declining to 50 tcf by 2030 however this projection is based on current laws and re gulations and does not account for prospective actions such as climate change regulation that c ould encourage the use of natural gas over coal in new power plants recent eia study of the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2007 investig ated several imple mentation scenarios including cases in which natural gasfired generation increases by up to 88 as early as 2020 and accounts for over third of all power production secure and affordable supply of natura l gas is therefore important to the us power sector today and in some scenario s that importance could grow substantially the united states does not however produ ce enough natural gas to meet its own needs the united states is the worlds rgest natural gas importer in 2006 imports totaled 42 tcf compared to consumption of 217 tcf over 80 of gross us imports are delivered via pipeline fro m canada 36 tcf in 2006 however canadian imports are expected by eia to decline steadily to under 1 tcf by 2025 the canadian national energy board neb also expects net exports to decline under current trends with ca becoming net importer of gas by 2030 the decline in exports is due to increases in canadian consumption demand for gas and competition for investment capital from oil sands extraction projects and reduced productivity from gas production fields in we stern canada the decline in canadian exports may cause the united states to rely increasingly on potentially less secure sources of natural gas imports brought into the country by tanker as liquefied natural gas questions 1 will canadian regulators approve and enforce identical electric reliability standards without identical st andards and enforcement the reliability of the electric power system could be reduced 2 encouraging investment to improve reliability has not been goal of electric regulatory restructuring in more

in oil sand production even if the expansion includes upgrades in heavy oil processing canada is also pursuing additional refinery capacity for its heavier oil refinery expansions will have environmental impacts and congress will continue to face controversy over the balance between energy security and the environment another matter of concern is secti on 526 of the recently enacted energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 110140 that prohibits federal procurement of an alternative or synthetic fuel unless the contract specifies that the lifecycle ghg emissions are less than or equa l to such emissions from the equivalent conventional fuel produced from conventiona l petroleum sources the provision is intended to ensure that federal agencies are not spending taxpayer dollars to promote new fuel sources that will exacerba global warming and would apply to fuels derived from tar sands term synonymous with oil sands which are currently associated with producing high er greenhouse gas emissions than fuels derived from conven tional petroleum background and analysis when it comes to future oil supplies canadas oil sands will likely make up larger share of us oil

from oil sands would be the first new refinery in the united states in over 25 years environmental groups continue to promote standards for lowcarbon emission fuel and oppose the permitting of these refinery projects on the basis that proce ssing heavy crude from canadian oil sands would generate much higher greenhouse gas emissions than from conventional petroleum sources the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2009 as marked up by the senate armed services committee would authorize tenyear contracts for the purchase of alternative and synthetic fuels while incorporating

section 526 natural gas pipeline from alaska70 issue definition in october 2004 congress pproved the alaska natural gas pipeline act angpa which authorizes in principle pipeline to carry natural gas from alaskas north slope establishe s rules governing its construction and authorizes federal guarantees on pipeline project loans in 2006 the thengovernor murkowski of alaska and the three north slope oil producers and the state of alaska agreed on contract to build the pipeline but the contract never received the necessary approval of the state legislatur and new gover nor sarah palin took office in december 2006 she has called for new contract with firm or consortium of firms to build the pipeline in accordance with new legislation that has been introduced in the legislature in 2007 transcanada corporation the alberta canada based pipeline ope rator submitted the only proposal that met state guidelines governor palin has not sent the proposal to the legislature for considerati on in 2008 bp and conocophillips proposed pipeline project that required state money for construction the destination of the gas is expected to be markets in the lower 48 states proviso of angpa effectively prevents the pipeline from passing through or near the mackenzie delta gas fields in northwest canada this prohib ition appears likely to limit the potential gas throughput inasmuch as canada is moving to construct its own pipeline from the mackenzie delta fields it is the sense of congress as stated in angpa that there is sufficient demand fo r gas from both projects also if the mackenzie pipeline is built it appears at this time that all the gas from that project would be used to operate the oil sands projects in northern alberta background and analysis alaskan natural gas is major potential us energy resource that has been hardly ta pped the alaska depa rtment of natural resources estimates rec overable gas reserves in the rth slope oil fields at about 30 trillion cubic feet tcf which is the ergy equivalent of about 53 billion barrels of oil natural gas is believed to be under the arctic na tional wildlife refuge anwr as well although seemingly not as much as already discovered in the rest of the north slope the already disc overed natural gas resource has not been developed because of lack of costeffective means of transportation to major markets estimated costs of construction have precluded serious consideration of transporting the gas by pipeline most of the gas produced so far on alaskas north slope 80 of the 89 billion cubic feet produced annually has been reinjected into the ground the small amounts produced are used for operations in conjunction with oil production and tran sportation such as powering oil through pipelineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs56 construction of pipeline to transport natural gas to north american markets andor warmwater port for shipping li quefied natural gas lng could enhance north slope oil and gas economics and the commercial promise of anwr recent steep increases in gas prices and projections of continued high prices have suggested improvement in the relationship between market prices and the combined cost of known north slope gas resources and of pipeline transpor tation potential profitability of the authorized pipeline is enhanced by the 18 billion in loan guarantees approved by congress for the project estimated in 2004 to cost as much as 20 billion since then however the ri sing costs of steel other material and construction labor have driven estimated co sts of the pipeline to approximately 30 billion the lng alternative possibility c onsidered by the state of alaska has so far not found favor with the north slope producers congress had previously creat ed statutory framework for an alaska natural gas pipeline in the mid1970s legislative author ity for designation of the route and for the us role in the approval construc tion and operation of such pipeline were established in the alaska natural ga s transportation ac t of 1976 15 usc 719 et seq under that authority still in force gas pipeline would parallel the existing alaska oil pipeline from the north slope to fairbanks then head southeastward along the alaska highway and into canada via the yukon territory british columbia and alberta this the alaska natural gas

point in alberta in the directions of the us west coast and the midwest respectively deliver onet hird of canadas to tal annual gas exports to the united states the construction of the third leg connecting north slope to the prebuilt network has never been started alaska has enacted separate legislation that bans construction of gas pipeline in northern state waters while supporting pipeline to the south under the shorter less costly northern route wellhead prices determined by subtracting transportation cost from market price would be higher and royalties to the state would be higher the gas resources are stateowned but state officials see greater gain through the income multiplier effect of construction within the state and alaskan communities greater access to the gas supplies there are some questions concerning who will construct and operate the canadian portion of the pipe line originating in alaska but the canadian government has promised that these issues will not impede completion of the project the usauthorized pipelin likely would not enter service for ten years after an initial construction contract is approved canada supports natural gas pipeline that would travel from the north slope through canada and has opposed any unilateral selection of routes by the united states the canadian government believes that the private sector is best suited to decide the route subject to regulatory nd environmental review procedures canada has an interest in selling more oil and natural gas to meet us energy needs both the canadian government and the bush administration opposed supporting development of pipeline by setting g overnmentguaranteed price floor under gas delivered from alaska and such pr ovision was not included in the angpa

heavily used by gwichin in both countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs58 background and analysis during the 110th congress anwr has not been major element of the energy debate until the runup in energy prices some bills in the second session of congress have been introduced to address energy supply and these bills include titles to open the refuge the debate is the extent to which any anwr discoveries might wer energy prices and b whether to approve energy development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr in northeastern alaska and if so under what restrictions or whether to continue to prohibit development to protect the areas biological resources anwr is an area rich in fauna flora and oil potential development proponents argue that anwr oil would reduce us energy markets exposure to recurring crises in the middle east create many jobs in alaska and elsewh ere boost north slope oil production and extend the economic life of the trans alaska pipeline system they maintain that anwr oil could be develope d with minimal environmental harm with footprint limited to 2000 acres of the 19 million acre refu ge opponents argue that intrusion on this ecosystem cannot be justifie d on any terms that it should be designated as wilderness that oil found if any would provide little energy s ecurity and could be replaced by costeffective alternatives and that job claims are exaggerated with the change in control of the house and nate chance of action on anwr development appears much reduced especially since any anwr oil would come online in 7 to 12 years and therefore have little immediate effect on gasoline prices at the same time prospects of legislation to protect th area as statutory wilderness are also dim due to the likelihood of senate filibuster and presidential veto global warming has added new factor to the debate in recent years if the arctic ocean becomes navigable in the summer northern oil and gas may be more readily transported to lucrative markets in the north atlantic this reduced cost would make marginal finds in either country more prof itable and lead to increased industry interest canada opposes energy development in anwr primarily because it might disturb calving of the porcupine caribou he rd pch the pch is covered under the agreement between the united states of america and canada on the conservation of the porcupine caribou herd which tered into force on july 17 1987 the objective of the agreement is to conserve the herd for customary traditional uses by peoples on both sides of the internationa l boundary with disputes to be settled by consultation between the parties since it was an executive agreement implementing legislation was required the us agency primarily responsible for implementing the agreement is the fish and wildlife service the range of the pch is centered on th porcupine river in the united states and canada the herd winter s south of the brooks range in both nations the

alaskan gwichin would receive rela tively little economic benefit from development successful or otherwise canadian gwichin would receive direct economic benefit there ar known reports of indirect

development can proceed without significant risk to the pch other alaskan inuit are more cautious with villagers such as some in nuiqsut west of anwr arguing that nearby existing development has not generated expected levels of employment or dividends while exacerbating social problems or driving local caribou herd farther away the canadian portion of the pch calvi ng ground is protected in ivvavik national park while some energy exploration has taken place in the canadian portion of the calving area canadians argue that that activity occurred only before the government was aware of the importance of the area to the pch indeed some canadian industry officials have complain ed of government hostility to development in the northern areas of the country ba sed on what they perceive as overzealous environmental concerns critics note that the canadian part of the calving area was protected not only after the areas importa nce to caribou was known but also after it was known to lack

implementation of the strategy relies on existing authorities programs and funding at federal state and local vels of government as well as some new actions that may require enac ting new federal legislation restoring areas of concern the great lakes the great lakes legacy act of 2002 was enacted to address sedime nt contamination in areas of concern aocs within the great lakes ecosystem aocs are geographical areas within the great lakes that represent the most degraded portions of the ecosystem aocs contain contaminated sediment wastew ater and other nonpoint source pollution in 1987 the united states and canada iden tified 43 aocs in the great lakes basin twentysix aocs are in us waters 12 in canadian waters and 5 shared by both countries the act author izes 50 million annually in appropriations for fy2004 fy2008 for contaminated sediment remedi ation projects in aocs in the united states from fy2004fy2008 there has been approximately 126 million appropriated to all programs authorized under the legacy ac t approximate ly half the authorized amount the act also authoriz funding for research and development of remediation technologies and public outreach and ducation about remediation the environmental protection agency epa administers the selection and funding of projects authorized under the legacy act six projects are currently being evaluated one projects is underway and four projects have been completed under the legacy act aocs have been deliste d in the united states and two have been delisted in canada water withdrawals from the great lakes several laws policies and governing bodies regulate the use withdr awal and diversion of water from the great lakes basin however the concern over dom estic and international demand for great lakes water has prompted officials from th united states and canada to reevaluate these laws and policies the council of great lakes governors cglg partnership of the governors of the ei ght great lakes states and the canadian provincial premiers of on tario and quebec was tasked with creating new common conservation standard to manage water divers ions withdrawals and consumptive use proposals in 2005 the cglg released 1 the great lakesst lawrence river basin sustainable water resources agreement agreement and 2 the great lakesst lawrence river basin water resources compact compact these water management proposals ban ne w and increased diversions of water outside the great lakes basin with only limited highly regulated exceptions and establish framework for each state and province to enact laws protecting the basin the compact needs to be approved by each state legislature as well as the us congress to achieve full force and effect as an interstate compact each of the great lake states are considering the compact currently one state michigan has introduced related bill three states ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin have passed bills in one chamber and four states illinois indiana minnesota and new york have enacted legislation approvi ng the compact the canadian federal government and the provinces of ontario or quebec are not parties to the compact however the provinces are

birds and specific projects that may restore portions of the great lakes ecosystem water withdrawals guidelines for the great lakes as prescribed in the compact and agreement have not been addressed in the present congress questions 1 given that the boundaries of the great lakes ecosystem extends across the united states and canada what major efforts are being done in canada to restore the great lakes is canada considering comprehensive restoration plan that may invol ve binational pa rticipation 2 what efforts are being done to clean up aocs in canada and have they been successful is there scientific technical or programmatic colla boration between the us and canada in cleaning up aocs shared by both countries 3 the compact and resulting water withdrawals could potentially affect the environment and the economie s of and relationship betw een canada and the united states what is the canadian position on the compact and agreement is canada considering similar measures to govern its use of great lakes water would parallel compact in canada be considered at some time 4 water quality is concern for many in the us and canada and is currently addressed by the great lakes water quality agreement the agreement is being considered for revision by the government s of canada and the united states what is the status of the review of the agreemen t is canada consid ering revisions to the agreement great lakes water levels73 issue definition great lakes water levels have been decreasing steadily since 1997 with lake superior setting record low for september in 2007 and lakes michigan and huron near their reco rd lows for december in 2007 low water levels disrupt shipping lter coastal and aquatic ecosystems reduce recreational boating and fishing and adversely affect water quality water levels are directly related to precipitation runo ff evapotranspiration and out flows eg through the st lawrence river and diversions climate change and new precipitation patterns arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs63 cited as possible causes for low water leve ls some also contend that dredging in lake st clair in the 1960s might have led to widening the channel in the st clair river and increasing outflows from the lakes understanding the causes of declining water levels in the great lakes is concern for many because of their potential economic and environmental costs background the great lakes watershed is the largest system of fresh surface water in the world the great lakes contain nearly 95 of the surface freshwater in north america and 20 of the surface freshwater of the world an estimated 40 million people rely on the great lakes basin to provide jobs drinking water and recreation among other things the water vels of the great lakes are affected by number of factors including precipita tion evaporation groundwater surface water runoff diversions into and out of the sy stem and regulation some of these factors are controlled by the seasons which can bring varying amounts of precipitation and runoff to the lakes for example water levels are high in the spring and summer when runoff amounts are high but low in th winter when little or runoff occurs as system the great lakes annually lose approximately 1 of their water through natural outflows ie vi the st lawrence river decline in water levels water levels in the great lakes have been declining since 1997 according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa this decline is mo st prominent in lake superior which recorded historic low fo r september and october 2007 some contend that recent declines in great lakes water levels are following pattern of fluctuating lake levels that have been recorded since the 1800s for example lakes huron and michigan experienced record highs in 1886 and 1986 and experienced record lows in the 1930s corresponding to drought conditions during the dust bowl others suggest that low water levels are combination of several natural and manmade factors noaa collects data on historic water levels in the great lakes and the us army corps of engineers corps maintains models that predict changes in great lakes water levels corps models for example predict below average water levels for lake michigan lake huron and lake superior for the remainder of 2008 potential threats to water levels potential changes in water levels may come from existing and new diversions climatic variations geologic processes variations in precipitation evaporation and runoff popul ation growth and changes in land use ie farm to ur ban many contend the greates t threat to water levels in the great lakes is excessive consumptive withdrawals most experts believe that there is still much to be learned regarding the effects of water withdrawals climate change and consumptive uses on the great lakes moreover trying to determine the individual impact of single factor may be difficult to quantify because more than one factor might contributing to declining water levels accordingly many have become concerned with the cumulative effects of these factors on the great lakes th international joint commission ijc began an investigation in the causes of water vel decline in lake superior in march 2007 effects of climate change dredging and channel widening in the st clair river and changes in precipitation are some of the f actors being considered with respect to climate change some hypothesize that warmer winters in the great lakes basin will lead to less ice formation on the lakes and consequently greater evaporation ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96397crs64 water into the atmosphere if precipita tion does not correspondingly increase then lower water levels could result uncertainty in predicting future water levels in conjunction with the cumulative impact that many of the above factors may have on lake levels has stimu lated many to consider pr ecautionary approach addressing water withdrawals and diversions out of the great lakes watershed potential impacts of low water levels variations in water levels can have potentially significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences lower water levels can reduce hydroelectric power generation and increase costs to commercial shipping the great lakesst lawrence shipping corridor which is more than 2300 miles in length would need more dredging to maintain current levels of navigation if water levels decr ease dredging may also be necessary for recreational boating lower water levels could also affect water quality by limiting the ability of the lakes to flush out toxic substances and excessive levels of nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen coas tal wetlands can dry up if water levels significantly recede along the shoreline and wetland habitat may be replaced by forested lands or dunes receding shorelin could also creat problems in accessing marinas and necessitate chan ge in other infrastructure eg extending water intake pipes to maintain recreational and other activities some contend that changes in scenic areas and the environment would decrease tourism and recreation lower water levels may have some positive impacts such as decreasing the potential for flooding and increasing the area of beach in some regions of the basin status of issue congress is addressing dec lining water levels in the great lakes through proposed legislation that w ould authorize the secretary of commerce to study and continue monitoring fluctua ting water levels in the great lakes s 2355 introduced november 14 2007 and h r 250 introduced january 5 2007 great lakes water levels ar indirectly addressed thr ough proposed legislation that would authorize national strategy to ensure the recovery resiliency and health of coastal and great lakes ecosystems from climate change effects s 2211 introduced october 19 2007 lastly the ijc is conducting fiveyear 15 million study to examine declining water levels in the great lakes the duration of the study is from 20072012 questions 1 understanding the cont ribution of potential causes for declining water levels in the great lakes is concern is canada sponsoring any studies to address this issue have any results been released 2 the socioeconomic consequences of declining water levels in the great lakes might be significant for both canada and the united states does canada have any existing programs that are implementing mitigation strategies for declining water levels 3 climate change might be significant factor in declining water levels is canada addressing the effects of c limate change on natural resour ces such as water supplies in the great lakes and if so has canada developed any strategies for adapting to climate change that involve the

effectively stopping us citizens from hunting polar bear in canada could compromise successful ca nadian communitybased conservation programs background and analysis polar bears depend on arctic sea ice which most scientists ac knowledge will be affected by climate warming causing at minimum an earlier annual or seasonal thaw and later freeze of coastal sea ice globally less than onethird of the 19 know n or recognized polar bear populations are declining more than onethird are increasing or stable the remaining third have insufficient data available to estimate population trends nd their status has not been assessed two polar bear populations occur within us jurisdiction polar bears are affected by climate change contaminants and subsistence and sport hunting environmental organizations have voiced public concern that polar bear populations are threatened by climate change scientists have confirmed that in recent decades the extent of arctic sea ice has declined significantly as the result of climate warming annual ice breakup in many areas is occurring earlier and freezeup later arctic sea ice is experiencing continuing decline that may not easily be reversed and some models project that arc tic sea ice could disappear completely during summer by the second half of this century in addition three groups of contaminants are implicated as potentially
