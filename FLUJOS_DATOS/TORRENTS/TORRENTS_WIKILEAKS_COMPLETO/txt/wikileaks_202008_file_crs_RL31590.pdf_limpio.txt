surplus the policy issues were whether or not it w ould be worthwhile to pay off the national debt and whether or not the existen ce of public debt pr ovided some economic benefits for the time being those are longer issues instead the question is what are the risks associated with rising federal debt at the beginning of 2008 total gross federal debt is over 9 trillion while gross federal debt is the broadest meas ure of the debt it may not be the most important one the debt meas ure that is relevant in an economic sense is debt held by the public this is the measure of debt that has actually been sold in credit markets and which has influe nced interest rates and private investment decisions at the beginning of 2008 the debt held by the public is over 5 trillion the remainder is held by va rious federal agencies in the short run growth in the public debt affects the composition of economic output federal government borrowing adds to total credit demand and tends to push up interest rates higher interest rates increase the cost of financing new investment in plant and equipment and thus may nd to reduce the stock of productive capital below what it might otherwise have been in the long run the relationship between th growth rate of the federal debt and the overall rate of economic growth is critical to financial stability as long as the debt grows more rapidly than output the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp will rise perpetual bt growth in excess of econo mic growth is an inherently unstable situation whether or not the bttogdp ratio is on such path depends on the budget deficit the rate of inte rest and the rate of growth in gdp what matters most as far as financial stability is concerned is what investors believe to be the longrun trend in the bttogdp ratio if large deficits are expected to persist or if the interest rate on the debt is expected to exceed the growth rate indefinitely then at some point the federal government may begin to find it more difficult to sell new securities the federal government however has source of credit not available to individual bus inesses the federal reserve bank should the federal governme nt be unable to find private sector buyers the federal reserve might buy the securities that otherwise the government would be unable to sell should it decide to do so then the threat is longer one of government insolvency but rather of in flation this re port will be updated as warrantedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590contents introduction 1 m s u r i n g t h f d r l d b t1 h i s t r i c l b h v i r f t h f d

surplus between fy 1998 and fy2001 the federal budget has now registered deficits for each of the last six fiscal years the budget given current policies is now projected to remain in deficit through at least fy20111 during those four years of surpluses the federal debt fell but is now rising again when the budget was in surplus the polic issues were whether or not it would be worthwhile to pay off th national debt and whether or not the existence of public debt provided some economic benefits t hose are longer issues the return of budget deficits and rising debt compelle d congress to increase the statutory debt limit most recently in september 2007 the president signed legislation increasing the statutory debt limit to 9815 trillion pl 110912 at the beginning of 2008 the total outstanding federal debt was more than 9 trillion the fact that there is more than one measure of federal debt may lead to some confusion this report explains the different measures of the us government debt discusses the historical growth in the debt identifies the current owners of the debt presents comparisons with government bt in other countries and examines the potential economic risks associated with growing federal debt measuring the federal debt the statutory debt limit is ceiling set by congress restricting the total amount of federal debt outstanding gross federal debt with some minor adjustments is the measure that is subject to the limit3 although gross federal debt is the broa dest measure of the debt it may not be the most important one not all of the gr oss debt actually represents past borrowing in credit markets some of the debt is he ld by the socalled tr ust funds primarily thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs2 4 interest paid on the trust fund accounts is also strictly bookkeeping entry and does not constitute an actual outlay of the federal governmentone for social security but also others such as unemployment insurance the highway trust fund and one for federal employee pensi ons relatively small amounts of debt are also held by selected federal agencies the assets held by the trust funds co nsist entirely of nonmarketable federal debt that debt exists only as bookk eeping entry and does not reflect past borrowing in credit markets the trus t fund balances actually represent the cumulative amount that the government di d not have to borrow in credit markets because they were simply cr edited to the trust fund accounts4 the debt measure that is relevant in an economic sense is debt held by the public this is the measure of debt that has actually been sold in credit markets and which has influenced interest rates and private investment decisions at the beginning of calendar 2008 the debt he ld by the public was over 5 trillion the dollar amount of the debt however rge it may seem to be is not good measure of its burden on the economy just as an individual with larger income can afford to take on more debt the importance of the debt can only be measured relative to the overall size of the economy for given amount of debt the larger the potential tax base is the less of burde n on the economy the interest payments on that debt will be the most common way of putting the size of the debt in perspective is to express it as percen tage of total gross domestic product gdp historical behavior of the federal debt prior to world war ii the federal budget was in surplus about as often as it was in deficit some of the largest increases in the debt resulted from wartime spending there were large increases in the debt held by the public related to the civil war and also to world war i since world war ii the federal budget has been in deficit most of the time and the debt has steadily grown since 1940 revenues exceeded outlays in only 12 years figure 1 shows gross federal debt held by the public since 1940 the solid line plots the dollar value of the debt held by the public since 1940 these are nominal amounts ie they have not been adjusted for inflation the dashed line shows the debt held by the public as percentage of gdp the dollar value of the debt rose gra dually until the late 1970s and early 1980s at which time its growth accelerated it peaked in 1997 fell through 2001 but since then has reached new highs measuring the debt relative to gdp tells different story the surge in debt to finance the costs of world war ii is much more pronounced and indicates that recent debt levels are far from unprecedented in terms of the burden to th economy fo llowing that surge and until the late 1970s however debt grew much less rapidly th an did the overall economy and so the ratio fell steadily between 1980 and 1995 the debt grew more rapidly than the economy so the ratio rose between 1995 and 2001 with the decline in debt levels the ratiohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs3 fell between 2002 and 2005 it rose again but then fell in 2006 and 2007 even with significant deficits it is still below the recent peak reached in 1993 source congressional budget office the shortrun effect of federal borrowing in the short run growth in the public debt ie budget deficits affects the composition of economic output federal gove rnment borrowing adds to total credit demand and tends to push up interest rates higher interest rates increase the cost of financing new investment in plant and quipment and thus may tend to reduce the stock of productive capital below what it mig ht otherwise have been thus there may be shift in the composition of out put towards consumption and away from investment consumption that might othe rwise have been deferred ie saving is reduced and current consumption rises the higher interest rates may also have an effect on international capital flows and thus on the trade balance other things being equal they make dollar denominated assets more attractive to foreign investors because of the relatively higher yield foreign investors in order to buy us securities must first buy dollars with which to pay for them the increased demand for dollars in exchange markets tends to push up the price of the do llar in terms of other currencies the increase in the exchange value of the dollar has two mutually reinforcing effects first the price of imported goods falls because it take s fewer dollars to buy figure 1 federal debt held by the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs4 the same quantity of goods and services abroad lower prices for imported goods means other things being equal that us consumers spend more on goods and services produced abroad second the pr ice of us produced goods and services rises for foreigners because the amount of foreign currency required to buy given quantity of us exports rises because u s exports are more expensive they tend to decline both the rise in imports and the drop in exports contribute to larger trade deficit because of the increased domestic borrowing associated with the rising federal debt firms wh ich sell significant share of their production abroad and those which compete directly with foreign firms selling in the united states experience drop in the demand for their goods and rvices the increased capital inflow however may offset to some extent the re duction in investment that might otherwise result from the increase in domestic credit demand in the longer run as the amount of fore ign holdings of us assets increases an increasing share of us income will flow abroad in the form of interest dividend and rent payments while this outflow doe s not necessarily mean decline in us living standards it may mean that future living standards will not be as high as they would have been if more of domestic i nvestments had been financed by borrowing at home instead of abroad who owns the federal debt because treasury securities are seen as re latively safe they are held by wide range of investors next to cash they are the most liquid asset meaning they can easily be converted to cash when necessary on short notice since they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government they are also perceived as very low risk assets because of that invest ors hold them as way of managing the overall risk associated with their portfolios figure 2 shows breakdown of the holders of the outstanding gross federal debt the us government is itself the largest holder of the debt mainly in the trust funds included in the other category ar financial institutions including banks insurance companies and mutual funds as well as private pension funds the federal reserve holds significant share of the debt the federal reserve buys and sells treasury securities in its open market operations in order to influence the growth rate in the money stock foreign investors hold 248 of the debt state and local governments hold treasury securities as well mainly in pension funds for their employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs5 source department of

debt and the overall rate of economic growth is critical to financial stability as long as the debt grows more rapidly than output the ratio of debt to gdp will rise perpetual debt growth in excess of economic growth is an inherently unstable situation whether or not the debttogdp ratio is on such path depends on the budget deficit of course but also on the rate of interest and the rate of growth in gdp5 to illustrate consider the case where the budg et is balanced except for the interest payment on the debt in other words th budget deficit is qual to the interest payment in this case the debt would grow each year by an amount equal to the interest cost of financing the debt thus the growth rate of th debt would equal the interest rate if the interest rate were higher than the growth rate of gdp then the debt would grow faster than gdp and the ratio of debt to gdp would rise if instead the interest rate stays below the economic growth rate then the ratio of debt to gdp would fallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs7 figure 3 compares the average interest rate on the federal debt with the growth rate of nominal gdp this measure of ec onomic growth reflects changes in both real output and inflation the solid line shows the annual growth rate of nominal gdp and the dashed line shows the average inte rest rate on the outst anding federal debt held by the public sources department of commerce bureau of economic analysis congressional budget office for most of the period between 1940 and 1980 the interest ra remained well below the growth rate of the economy fo r much of the past 25 years however the interest rate has been above the gr owth rate which through the mid1990s contributed to the rising debttogdp ratio if the interest rate is less than the growth rate it is possible for the debt ratio to fall even with modest budget deficit consider the case where the budget deficit is larger than the interest payment on the debt when the budget deficit is larger than the interest payment the difference between the two is sometimes referred to as the primary deficit in that case the growth rate of the debt woul d be larger than the interest rate and so even with an interest rate below the gdp growth rate the debttogdp ratio could still rise figure 4 shows the historical relationship betw een the budget deficit and the interest payment on the debt the solid line shows the deficit which in some cases is negative ie surplus and the da shed line shows the interest payment figure 3 economic growth and interest on the federal debthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs8 source congressional budget office although there were clearly exceptions the overall pattern until recently was for the budget deficit and the inte rest payment to rise in ta ndem which is not surprising since the deficits represents additional debt which requires larger interest payment in the late 1990s when the budget was in surplus ie negative deficit the budget deficit was clearly substantially less than the interest payment which contributed to the decline in the debtgdp ratio since fy2003 that situation s reversed and the deficit has been larger than the interest payment what are the risks of rising debt the federal government has little difficulty in marketing securities when revenues fall short of outlays in fact in the late 1990s when it seemed to some as though the government was on path to eliminate the debt there was concern that it was important for there to be at least some federal debt traded in financial markets as long as there is market for federal debt the risks are small what matters most as far as financial stability is concerned is what investors believe to be the longrun tre nd in the debtgdp ratio if large primary deficits are expected to persist or if the interest rate on the debt is expected to exceed the growth rate indefinitely then at some point the federal government may begin to find it more difficult to sell new securities in other words it may become harder for the federal government to find willing lenders to finance its outlays at worst private investors might come to doubt the federal governme nts ability even to meet its interest payments and would be less willing if not unwilling to hold government bonds figure 4 the budget deficit and net interest outlayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs9 6 thomas j sargent the ends of four big inflations in robert hall ed inflation causes and effects national bureau of ec onomic research 1982 pp 4197 7 william bomberger and gail makinen the hungarian hyperinflation and continuedinability to borrow money in credit markets can be fatal to private businesses firms that are losing money and cannot find willing lenders are on the road to bankruptcy the federal government howev er has source of credit not available to individual businesses the federal reserve bank should the federal governme nt be unable to find private sector buyers either domestic or foreign for its securities there are two possible outcomes first the federal government c ould simply find itself unable to meet all of its obligations in that case outlays would have to fall unle ss taxes were increased enough to eliminate the shortfall second rather than allow the government to default the federal reserve might buy the securities that otherwise the government would be unable to sell although subject to congressional oversig ht the federal reserve is independent and under legal obligation to ensure the sa of government securities but should it decide to do so then the threat is longer one of government insolvency but rather of inflation when the federal reserve buys treasury securities it increases the stock of reserves to commercial banks those increas ed reserves in turn increase the banks capacity to lend money and create demand deposits increasing the stock of money in circulation the historical record demonstrates that continued financing of large government budget deficits by printing m oney runs substantial risk of rapidly accelerating inflation current and projected federal debt howev er is far short of the levels thought to be associated with this risk for the moment federal debt relative to gdp is lower than it was in the mid1990s and well belo w the level it reached following world war ii history provides number of examples where large public sector debt led to serious economic consequences in the af termath of world war i four countries experienced episodes of rapid inflation di rectly attributable to the central bank financing of very large budget deficits through money creation germany poland austria and hungary in each of these cas more than onehalf of the total central government expenditures was ficit financed as result the public lost confidence in the governments ability to bring growth in public sector debt under control by either raising taxes or cutting expenditures6 immediately following world war ii hungary experienced the most extreme episode of inflation on record between july 1945 and august 1946 the price level in hungary rose by factor of 3 x 1025 as is characteristic of instances of very rapid inflation tax revenues fell far short of public expenditures during this time for much of the period reve nues covered less than 10 of total expenditures7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs10 7 continued

pp 307346during the mid1980s bolivia experienced an episode of very rapid inflation in 1984 general government re venues represented less than 20 of total government expenditures and the budget deficit surp assed 20 of gdp annual inflation in 1984 was over 1000 and in 1985 the inflation rate topped 110008 these are all examples of extreme cases but they serve to put the us experience in perspective even in instances of much more modest federal government credit demand th ere remains the possibility that the federal reserve might seek to mitigate any upward pressure on interest rates due to the treasurys borrowing needs at the risk of pushing up the inflation rate but as long as the treasury can find buyers for its securities in private credit markets the federal reserve will likely find it easier to pursue an antiinflationary policy government debt in other industrialized countries short of the extreme examples cited in the previous section it is useful to compare the federal government debt in the united states with that of other developed countries the united states is not the only country whose central government has issued significant amount of debt among the countries shown in table 2 are all those participating in the european monetary union emu thes are the countries who now use the euro as their currency the maastricht treaty established conditions for participation in the emu among them was the condition that member countrys public sector financial condition must be s ustainable in particular the standards for assessing the sustainability of public sector finances were that the public sector deficit not exceed 3 of gdp and that the public sector debt not exceed 60 of gdp as the figures in table 2 indicate the united states is far from having the largest government debt of the 17 c ountries shown 10 had higher debttogdp ratio in 2007 than did the united states more than half of the countries reduced their debt ratio between 2000 and 2007 and eight raised it three of the countries had public debt larger than their gdp in 2007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31590crs11 table 2 general government debt as percentage of gdp country 1990 2000 2007

cooperation and development member of the european monetary union euro country conclusion after several years of decline it appears that the federal debt is likely to rise for the near future the budget is projected to be in deficit at least through 2011 while the debt is projected to rise it is projected to rise more slowly than gdp and so the ratio of debt to gdp is expected to fall at current and projected levels the debt poses few if any economic risks ultimately the risk of very large and rapidly growing government debt is extremely high rates of inflation as pre ssure would mount on the federal reserve to monetize the debt but that would require so much more rapid growth in debt than is currently expected that it is virtually out of the realm of possibility that the debt is growing however means that domestic saving that might otherwise be used to finance investment spending will go to finance current expenditures that being the case either domestic investment will be less than it might otherwise have been or firms will have to borrow from abroad to fund some of their investments foreign borrowing will however push up the trade deficit
