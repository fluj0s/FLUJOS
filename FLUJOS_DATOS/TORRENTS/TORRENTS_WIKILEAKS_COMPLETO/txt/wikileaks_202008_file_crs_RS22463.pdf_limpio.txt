updated monthly budget data have follo wed fairly regular pattern year after year outlays vary by relatively small amounts monthl between january 2001 and december 2005 average monthly outlays remained between 150 billion and 200 billion1 over the same period actual monthly outlays ranged from low of 125 billion in july 2001 to 220 billion in march 2005 in the somewhat extended period october 2000 through may 2006 shown in figure 1 new monthly high for outlays occurred in march 2006 at 250 billion double the spending in july 2001 over this extended period spending has trended upward receipts show more volatile pattern refl ecting the intermittent pattern of federal revenue collections receipts tend to be high er in january april june september and december than in other months generally reflecting payment timing requirements for taxpayers fiveyear average monthly receipts varied from low of slightly less than 100 billion in february to high of almo st 260 billion in april from october 2000 through may 2006 receipts ranged from low of 85 billion in february 2004 to high of 332 billion in april 2001 over this period receipts in dollars ve slowly trended higher httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22463crs2 2 other measures of outlays as percentages of gdp or in constant deflated dollars also show growth in outlays over this period receipts on the other hand are currently smaller both as percentage of gdp and in constant dollars than they were at the beginning of the period shownthe monthly variability of receipts drives reflected monthly variability in deficits and surpluses the federal government tends to run surpluses in the same months that receipts tend to be large january april june september and december the average monthly budget balance over the course of year ranged from deficit of 86 billion in february to surplus of 77 billion in ap ril over the five calendar years 2001 through 2005 the actual m onthly budget balances ranged from deficit of 119 billion in february 2006 to surplus of 190 billion in april 2001 figure 1 contains receipts outlays and the deficit or surplus by month from october 2000 the first month of fiscal year 2001 th rough the most recent data from the treasury may 2006 in addition the one fiscal year surplu s and four fiscal year deficits are shown in the figure the variability of all three co mponents of the budget totals is fairly obvious in the figure although outlays vary with in relatively small range they still bounce around quite bit month to month the growth in outlays over time also reveals itself in the figure as one would expect as the ou tlays in the more recent months are obviously larger in current dollars than they we re at the beginning of the period shown2 the higher monthly volatility of receipts makes ey eballing directional trend more difficult but it has been upward see footnote 2 as with receipts the monthly up and down nature of the surplus and deficit makes spotting an overall trend difficult over the period shown the trend has been toward smaller nd less frequent monthly surpluses and larger and more frequent monthly deficits figure 2 shows the fiveyear 2001 through 2005 calendar years averages for receipts outlays and the deficit or surplus by month january is shown at the beginning and end of the graph to more clearly indicate the changes from december to january as an example the chart shows that fo r june fiveyear average receipts were 206 billion outlays averaged 181 billion for the five years and for that month the surplus averaged 25 billion for february the month that averages the smallest receipts the chart reveals that receipts averaged 97 billion outlays averaged 183 billion and the deficit averaged 86 billion this figure displays the monthly patterns of federal receipts and spending and the deficit or surplus that were difficult to discern in figure 1 as mentioned earlier outlays vary by month but by relatively small amount s receipts vary by fairly large amounts month to month in repetitive pattern that occurs from year to year over the five years covered in this report reflecting the timing requirements of federal tax law the monthly variation in surplus or deficit totals genera lly follows the variation in monthly receipts since outlays are relatively steady throughout the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22463 crs3 158 b illion f y2002 378 b illion f y2003413 b illion f y2004318 bi ll i on f y2005126 b illion f y2001 45040035030025020015010050050100150200250300350 oct
