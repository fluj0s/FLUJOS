congressional research service the library of congress welfare reauthorization sidebyside comparison of current law and pending welfare reauthorization proposals summary the 109th congress is considering legislation to reauthorize and amend programs that were created or revised in the 1996 welfare reform law early in 2005 the senate committees on finance and health education labor and pensions help reported their welfare reauthorization legislation respectively s 667 and s 525 these bills have yet to see floor action and remain pending in the senate the house passed welfare reauthorization as part of its spending budget reconciliation bill the housepassed version of s 1932 the senatepassed spending reconciliation bill does not include welfare reauthorization provisions both the senate finance committee bill and the house reconciliation bill would reauthorize through fy2010 and revise the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf they both revise tanf work participation standards aimed to require more families on the welfare rolls to work or participate in job preparation activities the senate committee bill would allow broad range of activities engaged in by recipients to count toward meeting these standards while the house bill would narrow the focus of activities to work or workfare outside of fourmonth period both the senate committee and house reconciliation bills also would establish 200 million per year in grants to promote healthy marriages both the senate committee and house reconciliation bills would extend and increase funding for mandatory child care though the size of the funding increase is major difference between the two proposals 6 billion over five years in the senate committee bill and 05 billion over five years in the house bill both would also reauthorize the child care and development block grant ccdbg increasing its authorization to 31 billion by fy2010 and would revise ccdbg rules including those related to making schoolreadiness program goal and increasing the percentage of funds to improve the quality of child care both the senate committee and house reconciliation bills would revise the child support enforcement program to provide financing options for states to pay more collected child support to families on tanf or who have left the rolls generally federal and state governments keep child support collected for tanf families as reimbursement for their welfare costs the senate committee bill would provide partial federal funding for child support passed through to families up to 400 per month for one child and 600 per month for two or more children the house bill would provide partial federal funding to states that increase the amount of passedthrough child support the house reconciliation bill also would reduce federal funding to the states to operate their child support programs both senate committee and house bills would also establish responsible fatherhood programs to fund activities to increase the participation of noncustodial parents in their childrens lives the senate committee bill would provide 50 million per year in mandatory funding and authorize another 26 million per year the house reconciliation bill would authorize but not provide funding for up to 20 million per year this report will be updated as needed

domestic social policy division welfare reauthorization sidebyside comparison of current law and pending welfare reauthorization proposals introduction the 109th congress is considering legislation to reauthorize and amend programs that were created or revised in the 1996 welfare reform law1 early in the 109th congress the senate finance and health education labor and pensions committees approved and reported their welfare reauthorization legislation respectively s 667 and s 525 neither bill has yet seen action in the full senate in the house welfare reauthorization proposal hr 240 introduced by the house republican leadership has also failed to reach the floor on november 18 2005 the house passed its budget reconciliation bill s 1932 which includes welfare reauthorization legislation similar to that which passed the house in 2002 and 2003 the housepassed version of s 1932 is hr 4241 as amended and approved by the house welfare reauthorization legislation was not included in the senatepassed reconciliation bill this report compares the welfare reauthorization policies proposed in the senate committee bills with those included in the housepassed budget reconciliation bill it is not comparison of welfare provisions in the house and senate reconciliation bills such comparison which displays housepassed welfare provisions with corresponding provision entries for the senatepassed version of reconciliation is available from the congressional research service upon request the original funding authority for the block grant of temporary assistance for needy families tanf the child care and development block grant ccdbg abstinence education and transitional medical assistance tma under medicaid expired on september 30 2002 funding and program authority for tanf mandatory child care abstinence education and tma have been continued by special temporary extension legislation since then with the latest extension set to expire on december 31 2005 ccdbg discretionary funding has been provided absent authorization in annual appropriation bills also included in welfare reauthorization legislation have been initiatives to create responsible fatherhood

of the issues by gene falk et updated regularly crs2 programs and make some changes to supplemental security income as well as create new superwaiver authority summary of similarities and differences in the bills most of the welfare reauthorization provisions approved early in 2005 have counterparts in the house budget reconciliation bill there are notable exceptions s 667 the finance committee bill would extend the abstinence education state grant program and revise and extend tma through fy2010 whereas the house budget reconciliation bill includes none of those provisions further the house reconciliation bill unlike the senate committee bills or the earlier house republican leadership welfare reauthorization bill hr 240 includes some additional provisions that would reduce spending including proposals to reduce federal matching funds for state child support enforcement programs and to revise foster care and adoption assistance eligibility rules to negate court ruling that expanded eligibility for these programs in certain states table 1 summarizes what provisions are included in the senate committee bills and the house reconciliation bill note that when provisions are

source congressional research service crs temporary assistance for needy families block grant the senatecommittee and house welfare reauthorization proposals have many similarities with both extending basic tanf funding at current levels through fy2010 and incorporating president bushs proposal to provide categorical marriage promotion grants2 both bills also raise tanf work participation standards though the two differ in terms of how much more work would be required and what activities count toward the participation standards tanf funding provisions both the senatecommittee and house bills have very similar funding provisions although they do differ in some details the 2 the house budget reconciliation bill is organized by titles reflecting each house committees legislative change tanf changes are found both in title ii from the education and workforce committee and title viii of the bill from the ways and means committee the two committees share jurisdiction over the tanf work requirements in most respects the committees reported identical legislative language amending tanf work requirements the difference in the two committees proposals reflecting new requirement that parents visit schools in the education and workforce provisions is noted in table 2 crs4 major differences between the two proposals are in the contingency fund and bonuses basic funding the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 entitled states to basic tanf block grant equal to peak expenditures in the pre1996 welfare programs during the fy1992 to fy1995 period it also established maintenance of effort moe requirement that states continue to spend at least 75 80 if state failed tanf work participation requirements of what they spent in these programs in fy1994 cash welfare caseloads were at their peak in the mid1990s both the basic tanf grant and the moe are legislatively fixed they did not change when cash welfare caseloads declined in the mid and late1990s nor did they increase when caseloads in some states increased during the recent economic slump neither the basic tanf block grant nor the moe has been adjusted for inflation both the senatecommittee and house proposals would continue both the basic block grant and the moe at their current funding levels without inflation or caseload adjustment through fy2010 supplemental grants during the consideration of legislation that led to the 1996 welfare law fixed funding based on historical expenditures was thought to disadvantage two groups of states 1 those that experience relatively high population growth and 2 those that had historically low grant levels relative to poverty in the state therefore additional funding in the form of supplemental grants was provided to states that met criteria of high population growth andor low historic grants per poor person supplemental grants have been provided to 17 states alabama alaska arizona arkansas colorado florida georgia idaho louisiana mississippi montana new mexico nevada north carolina tennessee texas and utah currently supplemental grants total 319 million per year both the senate and house proposals would continue supplemental grants for the same 17 states at the current funding level through fy2009 unlike other grants which expire in fy2010 contingency funds the fixed basic grant under tanf also led to concerns of inadequate funding during economic downturns tanf includes contingency fund which is designed to provide extra matching grants to states that meet criteria of economic need based on unemployment rates and food stamp caseloads and have state expenditures in excess of their fy1994 level the two bills differ substantially in their proposed revisions to the tanf contingency fund the house budget reconciliation bill would continue the fund under existing rules with some relatively minor modifications allowing some additional state spending to count toward meeting the fy1994 funding level threshold and modifications to increase grants for states that qualify for funds for only part of the year the senate finance committee proposal fully revamps the contingency fund it would eliminate the requirement that states increase expenditures from their own funds above the regular tanf moe level and would eliminate the matching crs5 requirements instead it requires that unspent tanf balances be below certain threshold to qualify for contingency funds the senate committee proposal would base contingency grants on portion of the estimated cost of increased cash assistance caseloads it also would revise the criteria of economic need for state bonus funds current tanf law provides bonus funds to states that rank high on set of outcomes that seek to measure whether they are achieving the block grants goals it has high performance bonus of 200 million per year for states that rank high in achieving employment and certain other outcomes as well as second 100 million per year bonus paid to the five states with the greatest reduction in outofwedlock birth ratios that also have decline in abortions the senate finance committee bill scales back bonuses by eliminating the 100 million per year bonus for reductions in outofwedlock births and reducing and refocusing the high performance bonus on employment outcomes funding reductions are used to pay for grants to promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood initiatives see discussion of these initiatives below the house budget reconciliation bill eliminates both tanf bonuses in part to pay for grants to promote healthy marriage and in part achieving budget reductions uses of grants and program requirements federal tanf grants and moe funds can be used for wide range of benefits services and activities to assist lowincome families with children and to further tanf goals of reducing outofwedlock births and promoting twoparent families tanf grants can also be transferred to other block grant programs up to 30 of the grant can be transferred to the child care and development fund ccdf and to the social services block grant the limit on transfers to ssbg alone is set at 425 though annual appropriations have restored the ssbg transfer limit to its original limit of 10 set in the 1996 welfare law within the overall 30 limit federal tanf funds may also be used as the state match for federal reverse commuter grants if the program benefits welfare families both bills would set the ssbg transfer limit permanently at 10 the house budget reconciliation bill would raise the overall transfer limit to 50 the senate finance committee proposal would retain the current 30 transfer limit both bills include provisions to ease some rules regarding use of tanf funds both house and senate committee bills would allow states to use carryover tanf funds for any tanf benefit and service current law restricts the use of carryover funds for the provision of assistance narrow the definition of assistance to exclude all child care and transportation aid tanf funds spent on assistance trigger certain program requirements such as work requirements time limits assignment of child support payments and data reporting under current regulations child care and transportation aid for nonworking families is counted as assistance and triggers these requirements the bills would eliminate such aid from the definition of crs6 assistance freeing from these requirements nonworking families that receive only child care or transportation aid work requirements both the senate finance committee bill and the house budget reconciliation bill incorporate the bush administrations universal engagement proposal which requires states to develop selfsufficiency plan for all tanf adult recipients to monitor progress toward that plan the house budget reconciliation bill also requires states to end benefits full family sanction for families that fail to comply with work participation rules both the senate finance committee bill and house budget reconciliation bill would substantially revise tanf work participation standards both bills would raise work participation standards that states must meet from the current laws standard of 50 to 70 raise the required hours of working to receive full credit and provide partial credit for participating families that do not meet the full credit standard and revise the list of activities that recipients may participate in for states to receive credit toward tanf standards however the bills differ in how they do these three things participation standards current law requires states to have specified percentage of their families with an adult recipient or minor head of household participating in creditable work activities the current participation standard is 50 states are subject to an additional participation rate standard for twoparent families currently 90 the participation rate standards may be reduced for caseload reductions not attributable to policy changes that occurred since enactment of welfare reform fy1995 this caseload reduction credit has had large effect on participation standards reducing the standard considerably from its statutory rate in fy2003 the standard was reduced to 0 for 20 states both the senate finance committee bill and the house budget reconciliation bill would raise the work participation standard for all families to 70 by fy2010 and eliminate the separate standard for twoparent families both bills would also change the credits that reduce these standards from their statutory rate ie reduce the 70 standard to lower rate but they do so in different ways the house bill would retain but revise the current law caseload reduction credit so that caseload change would be measured from more recent year rather than the prewelfare reform caseload level of 1995 ultimately caseload reduction would be measured based on the most recent four years the house bill also includes provision to give an additional credit to states that achieved caseload reduction of 60 or more from fy1995 to fy2001 the senate finance committee bill retains the current caseload reduction credit for fy2006 and fy2007 but beginning in fy2008 would replace the caseload reduction credit with credit for employed welfare leavers the bill would also cap all credits against the participation standard so that the minimum effective standard would be 10 in fy2006 20 in fy2007 30 in fy2008 40 in fy2009 and 50 in fy2010 there is such minimum effective standard in the house bill hours standards current law requires that family be considered participating only if it participates for minimum number of hours per week in crs7 month under current law 20 hours are required for single parents with preschool child under the age of 6 and 30 hours are required for other families higher hours are set for the purposes of the twoparent work participation rate both the senate finance committee bill and the house budget reconciliation bill raise the hours standards the house bill incorporates 40hour workweek standard for full credit but would also provide partial credit for families with at least 24 hours of participation special lowerhour standard would be provided for single parents with preschoolers the senate finance committee bill also raises the hours standard for full credit but to lesser extent than proposed in the house bill single parents with preschool child would be given full credit for participation at 24 hours per week and other singleparent families would be given full credit at 34 hours per week partial credit for single parent families would be provided at 20 hours per week higher hours requirements would apply to twoparent families creditable activities current law lists 12 activities that may be counted toward tanf work participation standards the bulk of countable participation is in subset of core activities focused on work timelimited job search countable for six weeks in fiscal year 12 weeks if criteria of economic need are met timelimited vocational educational training 12 months in lifetime and community service and work experience in meeting the general 30hourperweek standard hours in educational activities are countable only for families who are also participating in at least 20 hours per week of core activities postsecondary education other than that considered vocational educational training does not count toward current law federal tanf work participation standards the house budget reconciliation bill and the senate finance committee bill differ significantly on the types of activities that are countable as core activities toward the participation standards the house bill narrows the list of core activities by eliminating job search and vocational education instead the bill would give states almost total discretion to define activities that would be countable for three months in 24month period four months to complete training but once those months are exhausted the only activities that would count toward the core work participation standards are work onthejob training community service or work experience moreover since job search and vocational education would be countable as sole or primary activities only during the three or four months that the state would have discretion any weeks of participation in job search reduce the number of weeks that vocational education counts toward the participation standards on the other hand the senate finance committee bill retains the current law list of core activities it too provides states additional discretion by permitting states to count an expanded list of activities for three months in 24month period longer for rehabilitative activities however this additional discretion is provided in addition to rather than instead of six weeks of job search and 12 months of vocational educational training which are retained as core activities both the house budget reconciliation bill and the senate finance committee bill would give states additional discretion in defining activities countable once family crs8 has met the core work requirement generally 24 hours per week in core activities the house bill would allow states to define activities for families with at least 24 hours in core activities the senate finance committee bill would allow states to count an expanded set of activities for singleparent families with at least 24 hours per week in core activities the senate finance committee proposal includes some additional options for counting participation in activities toward tanf work standards it would allow states to have up to 10 of their caseload enrolled in special program of two or fouryear undergraduate education or vocational educational training this program is modeled after the parents as scholars program that has operated in maine using tanf moe funds it also allows for participation in rehabilitative activities for disabled persons including treatment of drug and alcohol abuse if they combine rehabilitation with at least 10 hours of core activities and if the state develops collaborative relationship between agencies and entities providing rehabilitative services and the state tanf agency additionally the senate finance committee bill allows caring for disabled family member to count as work activity under certain circumstances marriage promotion grants and family formation issues current law allows states to use tanf funds for any activity reasonably calculated to achieve tanf purpose one of the statutory purposes of tanf is to end dependency of needy parents on government benefits and one of the stated means to end such dependency is marriage another of the statutory purposes of tanf is to promote the formation and maintenance of twoparent families promoting marriage is currently allowable use of tanf funds both the senate finance committee and house budget reconciliation bills would carve out special marriage promotion grants from existing tanf funding both bills include 100 million in competitively awarded matching funds for states territories and tribes for marriage promotion activities the bills would allow states to use other federal tanf funds or state funds as the match for these new marriage promotion grants both bills also would provide an additional 100 million for research and demonstrations the house budget reconciliation bill would require that these funds be used primarily for marriage promotion the senate finance committee bill would require that 80 of these funds be used for marriage promotion marriage promotion activities listed in both bills are public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and skills needed to increase marital stability and health education in high schools on the value of marriage marriage education and marriage and relationship skills programs for nonmarried parents or expectant parents premarital education on marriage for engaged couples marriage enhancement and marriage skills training for married couples divorce education programs and marriage mentoring programs programs to reduce the disincentives to marriage in needbased programs could be funded from these grants only if offered in conjunction with other marriage activities crs9 both bills have requirements that grantees of marriage promotion grants consider domestic violence issues and that participation in marriage promotion activities be voluntary the senate committee bill also includes prohibition not in the house bill against states sanctioning families receiving tanf assistance for not participating in marriage promotion activities child care while the house budget reconciliation legislation consolidates package of provisions embodying child care reauthorization in single bill3 at this point on the senate side reauthorization provisions remain divided between the two bills s 667 and s 525 the caring for children act of 2005 the finance committee passed bill s 667 contains the proposed mandatory funding appropriation for child care and development block grant ccdbg programs while the help committeepassed bill s 525 includes proposed discretionary funding authorization and all provisions relating to the reauthorization of the ccdbg act therefore in the child care section of table 2 most provisions in the senate column are drawn from s 525 with the notable exception of the mandatory or entitlement funding provision which falls under the finance committees jurisdiction and is therefore included in s 667 summary of provisions included in both the house bill and senate committee legislation follows with more detail found in table 2 discretionary authorization the discretionary portion of child care funding is authorized by the child care and development block grant act as amended in 1996 under current law discretionary ccdbg funding is authorized at 1 billion annually however actual appropriation levels determined during the annual appropriations process have exceeded the authorized level eg fy2005 21 billion both the house budget reconciliation bill and s 525 propose to authorize discretionary funding at 23 billion in fy2006 rising by 200 million each year up to 31 billion in fy2010 mandatory appropriation mandatory funding for the ccdbg was preappropriated in section 418 of the social security act for fy19972002 as part of the welfare law of 1996 pl 104193 series of temporary extensions have continued that funding at the fy2002 rate of 2717 billion since the close of fy2002 the most recent extension runs through december 31 2005 the house budget reconciliation bill proposes to increase mandatory child care funding by 500 million over five years fy2006 fy2010 appropriating 2917 billion for fy2006 2767 billion for fy2007 2817 billion for fy2008 2867 billion for fy2009 and 2917 billion for fy2010 this reflects half of the 1 billion increase that had earlier been proposed in hr 240 the senate committee bill s 667 proposes to increase mandatory funding by 6 billion over five years 3 child care provisions submitted to the house budget committee by the committee on ways and means ie the mandatory child care funding provisions are found in title viii of the budget reconciliation bill whereas provisions recommended by the committee on education and the workforce ie amendments to the ccdbg act are found in title ii crs10 fy2006fy2010 appropriating 3617 billion for fy2006 3717 billion for fy2007 3917 billion for fy2008 4017 billion for fy2009 and 4317 billion for fy2010 puerto rico would receive 75 million of the 6 billion whereas under current law as well as the house bill puerto rico receives mandatory child care funding authority to transfer tanf funds under current law states have the authority to transfer up to 30 of their annual tanf block grant to the ccdbg only 20 if they choose to transfer 10 to the social services block grant s 667 would maintain current law whereas the house bill would allow states to transfer up to 50 of their annual tanf grants to the ccdbg use of funds for direct services current law includes provision requiring given percentage of funds appropriated under the ccdbg act to be spent on direct services s 525 would require that after the reservation of setasides at least 70 of the funds remaining be used to fund direct services as defined by the state the house bill has comparable provision option to use excess funds for increasing payment rates s 525 would allow states that receive funding above their fy2005 levels to use portion of the excess to support payment rate increases for providers and to establish tiered payment rates on related note the bill s 525 would also add to the statute stricter requirements to set payment rates in accordance with biennial market rate surveys quality setaside current law requires that at least 4 of each states total ccdbg expenditures from all sources eg mandatory discretionary matching funds be used for quality activities described as providing comprehensive consumer education to parents and the public activities that increase parental choice and activities designed to improve the quality and availability of child care in the state both the house budget reconciliation bill and the help committees s 525 would raise the percentage of ccdbg funds that must be spent for quality activities to minimum of 6 definition of quality activities both bills provide greater detail than current law in terms of defining what is classified as quality activity in each categories of activities are outlined to include school readiness activities including activities to enhance early literacy training and professional development for staff and initiatives or programs to promote or increase retention of qualified staff the categories reflect new emphasis on school readiness as goal of the ccdbg the senate committee bill s 525 also specifies that quality funds could be spent on evaluating and assessing the quality of programs and their effectiveness in improving overall school preparedness while s 525 clearly states that quality funds must be spent for any of the six listed purposes the house bill provides three broad categories similar in topic to those in s 525 with fourth more general category of other activities as approved by the state eligibility federal law currently requires that children eligible for services under the ccdbg must have family income that does not exceed 85 of the state crs11 median for family of that size however states have the discretion to adopt income eligibility limits below this federal maximum both the house budget reconciliation bill and s 525 propose to eliminate the federal maximum of 85 of state median income smi from the ccdbg law replacing it with provision allowing states to set income eligibility levels with federal ceiling with priorities based on need state plan requirements under current ccdbg law states are required to submit plans every two years certifying that their ccdbg programs include specified elements addressing areas such as parental choice parental access consumer education licensing and health and safety requirements both the house budget reconciliation bill and the help committees s 525 would amend current law to require that additional elements be certified in their state plans areas that would be modified or added relate to providing consumer education information describing or demonstrating state coordination of child care services with other early childhood education programs certifying compliance with the quality setaside percentage requirement and addressing special needs child care unlike the house bill s 525 includes provisions requiring that in their state plans states demonstrate that the process for redetermining eligibility occur more frequently than every six months with limited exceptions and also that the state plan describe any training requirements in effect for child care providers the senate committee bill would also put into statute the requirement that the provider payment rates described in the state plan be set in accordance with statistically valid and reliable biennial survey of market rates without reducing the number of families served state plans would also be required to include the results of those surveys and to contain description of how the state will provide for timely payment to providers results of the survey would also be required to be made available to the public later than 30 days after the surveys completion data collection and reporting requirements current law specifies set of data reporting requirements for states to collect in the administration of their ccdbg programs states collect data on monthly basis and submit to the department of health and human services hhs disaggregated data on quarterly basis an aggregate report is required to be submitted to hhs on an annual basis s 525 would retain the quarterly reporting in current law but would amend the list of data elements that states would be required to collect on monthly basis see table 2 for details it would also eliminate the separate annual report instead requiring that the fourth quarterly report include information on the annual number and type of child care providers and the method of payment they receive s 667 would also extend ccdbg reporting to tanffunded child care the house bill would retain current law containing none of these provisions waivers in response to gulf hurricanes the house budget reconciliation bill would provide the secretary of hhs with the authority to waive or modify certain ccdbg provisions for states affected by hurricanes katrina and rita provisions that could be waived include those relating to the federal income eligibility limits the work requirements states use of quality funds and any crs12 provision that prevents children designated as evacuees from receiving priority services over any children not already receiving ccdbg services similar provisions are included in s 525 other provisions titles ii and iii of s 525 propose provisions that stand apart from ccdbg law or section 418 of the social security act title ii of the bill contains provisions to enhance security at child care centers in federal facilities and title iii would establish small business child care grant program through which competitive grants would be awarded to states for establishment and operation of employeroperated child care programs the house budget reconciliation bill includes similar provisions responsible fatherhood to improve the longterm outlook for children in singleparent families federal state and local governments along with public and private organizations are supporting programs and activities that promote the financial and personal responsibility of noncustodial fathers to their children and increase the participation of fathers in the lives of their children these programs have come to be known as responsible fatherhood programs most fatherhood programs include media campaigns that emphasize the importance of emotional physical psychological and financial connections of fathers to their children most fatherhood programs also include parenting education responsible decisionmaking mediation services for both parents providing an understanding of the cse program conflict resolution coping with stress and problemsolving skills peer support and jobtraining opportunities skills development interviewing skills job search jobretention skills jobadvancement skills etc sources of federal funding for fatherhood programs include tanf block grant funds tanf state maintenanceofeffort moe funding welfaretowork funds child support enforcement cse funds and social services block grant title xx funds even so the federal government does not currently earmark specific amount of funding exclusively for responsible fatherhood programs beginning with the 106th congress both the house and senate have introduced number of bills that contain responsible fatherhood provisions but so far none of the bills have been passed by both houses of congress in the 109th congress both s 667 and the house budget reconciliation bill would include funding for responsible fatherhood grant programs s 667 as approved by the senate finance committee would establish five components for the responsible fatherhood program for fy2006 through fy2010 it would 1 appropriate 20 million for grant program for up to 10 programs 2 appropriate 30 million for grants for eligible entities local government local public agency communitybased or nonprofit organization or private entity including any charitable or faithbased organizations or indian tribe or tribal organization to conduct demonstration programs 3 authorize 5 million for nationally recognized nonprofit fatherhood promotion organization to develop and promote responsible fatherhood media campaign and establish national clearinghouse to help states and communities in their efforts to promote both marriage and responsible fatherhood crs13 4 authorize

in the housepassed budget reconciliation bill crs14 child support enforcement the cse program part d of title iv of the social security act was enacted in january 1975 pl 93647 the cse program is administered by the office of child support enforcement ocse in the department of hhs and funded by general revenues all 50 states the district of columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands operate cse programs and are entitled to federal matching funds the following families automatically qualify for cse services free of charge families receiving tanf benefits title iva foster care payments title ive or medicaid coverage title xix collections on behalf of families receiving tanf benefits are used to reimburse state and federal governments for tanf payments made to the family other families must apply for cse services and states must charge an application fee that cannot exceed 25 child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes to the family usually through the state disbursement unit services the cse program provides seven major services on behalf of children 1 parent location 2 paternity establishment 3 establishment of child support orders 4 review and modification of support orders 5 collection of support payments 6 distribution of support payments and 7 establishment and enforcement of medical support enforcement techniques collection methods used by cse agencies include income withholding intercept of federal and state income tax refunds intercept of unemployment compensation liens against property security bonds and reporting child support obligations to credit bureaus all jurisdictions also have civil or criminal contemptofcourt procedures and criminal nonsupport laws building on legislation pl 102521 enacted in 1992 pl 105187 the deadbeat parents punishment act of 1998 established two new federal criminal offenses subject to twoyear maximum prison term with respect to noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support children who reside with custodial parents in another state or who flee across state lines to avoid supporting them pl 104193 required states to implement expedited procedures that allow them to secure assets to satisfy an arrearage by intercepting or seizing periodic or lump sum payments such as unemployment and workers compensation lottery winnings awards judgements or settlements and assets of the debtor parent held by public or private retirement funds and financial institutions it required states to implement procedures under which the state would have authority to withhold suspend or restrict use of drivers licenses professional and occupational licenses and recreational and sporting licenses of persons who owe pastdue support or who fail to comply with subpoenas or warrants relating to paternity or child support proceedings it also required states to conduct quarterly data matches with financial institutions in the state in order to identify and seize the financial resources of debtor noncustodial parents pl 104193 authorized the secretary of state to deny revoke or restrict passports of debtor parents pl 104193 also required states to enact and implement the uniform interstate family support act uifsa and expand full faith and credit procedures pl 104193 also clarified which court has jurisdiction in cases involving multiple child support orders crs15 financing the federal government currently reimburses each state 66 of the cost of administering its cse program it also refunds states 90 of the laboratory costs of establishing paternity in addition the federal government pays states an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective programs pl 104193 required the hhs secretary in consultation with the state cse directors to develop new costneutral system of incentive payments to states pl 105200 the child support performance and incentive act of 1998 established new costneutral incentive payment system the statutory limit of cse incentive payments for fy2005 is 446 million s 667 and house budget reconciliation bill major provisions related to child support enforcement over the years the cse program has evolved into multifaceted program while costrecovery still remains an important function of the program other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility the cse program has helped strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services child support payments now are generally recognized as very important income source for singleparent families on average child support constitutes 17 of family income for households that receive it 2001 data among poor families who receive it child support constitutes about 30 of family income 2001 data both s 667 and the house budget reconciliation bill would seek to improve the cse program and raise collections so as to increase the economic independence of former welfare families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent although both bills share identical objectives with respect to simplifying cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthening the familyfirst policies started in the1996 welfare reform law the approaches used differ both bills would revise some cse enforcement tools and add others this section of the report does not discuss all of the cse provisions included in s 667 and the house bill for description of all of the cse provisions in s 667 as reported by the senate finance committee and the house budget reconciliation bill see table 2 in the last section of this report the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the senate finance committeereported bill would increase federal outlays in the cse program by 628 million over the period fy2006fy2010 whereas the house budget reconciliation bill would reduce federal outlays in the cse program by 4899 billion over the period fy2006fy2010 the following two cse provisions in the house bill comprise most of the budget reductions ie savings phasedin reduction of the matching rate for administrative expenses from 66 to 50 which saves 38 billion over the fiveyear period and an elimination of the federal match when states spend cse incentive payments ie reinvest cse incentive payments back into the program saving 16 billion over the fiveyear period assignment of child support rights as condition of receiving tanf benefits family must assign their child support rights to the state assignment rules crs16 determine who has legal claim on the child support payments owed by the noncustodial parent the child support assignment covers any child support that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits as well as any child support that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits assigned child support collections are not paid to families but rather this revenue is kept by states and the federal government as partial reimbursement for welfare benefits nonwelfare families who apply for cse services do not assign their child support rights to the state and thereby receive all of the child support collected on their behalf an extremely important feature of the assignment process is the date on which an assignment was entered if the assignment was entered on or before september 30 1997 then preassistance and duringassistance arrearages are permanently assigned to the state if the assignment was entered on or after october 1 1997 then only the arrearages which accumulate while the family receives assistance are permanently assigned the familys preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and the right to those arrearages goes back to the family when it leaves tanf unless the arrearages are collected through the federal income tax refund offset program under s 667 as reported by the senate finance committee the child support assignment would only cover any child support that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits this would mean that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits would not have to be assigned to the state even temporarily and thereby any child support collected on behalf of the formertanf family for preassistance arrearages would go to the family the house bill includes similar provision distribution of child support distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid in accordance with the assignment rules in other words the distribution rules determine which claim is paid first when child support collection occurs the order of payment of the child support collection is of tremendous importance because in many cases pastdue child support ie arrearages are never fully paid tanf families while the family receives tanf benefits the state is permitted to retain any current support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which has been paid to the family the 1996 welfare law pl 104193 repealed the 50 required pass through and gave states the choice to decide how much if any of the state share some all none of child support payments collected on behalf of tanf families to send the family states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family while states have discretion over their share of child support collections pl 104193 required states to pay the federal government the federal governments share of child support collections collected on behalf of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government bears the entire cost of any child support passed through to and disregarded by families as of august 2004 18 states were continuing the 50 or higher in one state passthrough and disregard policy that had been in effect pre1996 crs17 both bills would provide incentives in the form of federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support collected on behalf of tanf families to the families themselves often referred to as familyfirst policy as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal coffers for welfare benefits paid to the families however the approaches of the bills differ with respect to the amount of federal costsharing provided and whether to help states pay for the current cost of their cse passthrough and disregard policies or to encourage states to establish such policies or increase the passthrough and disregard already in place under s 667 as reported by the senate finance committee the federal government would share in the costs of the entire amount of passthrough and disregard policies used by states s 667 would allow states to pay up to 400 per month in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family 600 per month to family with two or more children to the family and would not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of those payments in order for the federal government to share in the cost of the child support passthrough the state would be required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefit unlike s 667 the house bill is intended to provide states with an incentive to increase their passthrough and disregard policies the house budget reconciliation bill would allow states to increase the amount of collected child support they pay to families receiving tanf benefits and would not require the state to pay the federal government the federal share of the increased payments the subsidized child support passthrough payments would be the amount above any payments the state was making on december 31 2001 the house bill would limit the federal governments costsharing of the new passthrough payments to the greater of 100 per month or 50 per month more than the state previously was sharing with the family in order for the federal government to share in the cost of an increase in the child support passthrough the state would be required to disregard ie not count the child support collection paid to the family in determining the familys tanf benefit former tanf families pursuant to the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 beginning on october 1 2000 states must distribute to former tanf families the following child support collections first before the state and the federal government are reimbursed the familyfirst policy 1 all current child support 2 any child support arrearages that accrue after the family leaves tanf these arrearages are called neverassigned arrearages plus 3 any arrearages that accrued before the family began receiving tanf benefits any child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on tanf belong to the state and federal government one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls thus generally speaking under current law child support that accrues before and after family receives tanf goes to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf goes to the state this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf crs18 s 667 as reported by the senate finance committee would give states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both current support and all child support arrearages including arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program s 667 would simplify the cse distribution process and eliminate the special treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program under s 667 the federal government would share with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages to the family first similarly the house bill would give states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf under the house bill the federal government would share with the states the costs of paying child support arrearages accrued while the family received tanf as well as costs associated with passing through to the family child support collected through the federal income tax refund offset program if the state chose the familyfirst option expansion of collectionenforcement tools both bills would include identical or similar provisions with respect to 1 lowering the threshold amount for denial of passport to noncustodial parent who owes pastdue child support 2 easing the collection of child support from veterans benefits 3 allowing states to use the federal income tax refund offset program to collect pastdue child support for persons not on tanf who are longer minors 4 authorizing the hhs secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents who owe pastdue child support with information maintained by insurers concerning insurance payments and to furnish any information resulting from match to cse agencies so they can pursue child support arrearages and 5 allowing an assisting state to establish child support interstate case based on another states request for assistance thereby enabling an assisting state to use the cse statewide automated data processing and information retrieval system for interstate cases additional provisions that would expand andor enhance the ability of states to collect child support payments are contained in s 667 as reported by the senate finance committee they include 1 authorizing the hhs secretary to act on behalf of states to seize financial assets held by multistate financial institution of noncustodial parents who owe child support 2 facilitating the collection of child support from social security benefits 3 requiring that medical support for child be provided by either or both parents and 4 requiring the cse agency to notify health care plan administrators under certain circumstances when child loses health care coverage other provisions both bills include provisions that would 1 require states to review and if appropriate adjust child support orders of tanf families every three years 2 require the hhs secretary to submit report to congress on the procedures states use to locate custodial parents for whom child support has been collected but not yet distributed 3 establish minimum funding level for technical assistance 4 establish minimum funding level for the federal parent locator service and 5 designate indian tribes and tribal organizations as persons authorized to have access to information in the federal parent locator service crs19 s 667 includes provisions that would 1 increase funding for the cse access and visitation program 2 require states to adopt later version of the uniform interstate family support act uifsa so as to facilitate the collection of child support payments in interstate cases and 3 allow the state of texas to continue to operate its cse program for automatic monitoring and enforcement of court orders on behalf of nonwelfare families without applying for federal waiver the house budget reconciliation bill includes provision that would 1 establish 25 annual fee for individuals who have never been on tanf but receive cse services and who received at least 500 in any given year 2 gradually reduce the general cse federal rate of 66 to 50 over the period fy2007fy2010 and 3 eliminate the federal match on cse incentive payments that states in compliance with federal law reinvest back into the cse program other programs in addition to reauthorizing and modifying the programs discussed above the senate welfare reauthorization bill s 667 and the house budget reconciliation bill would modify some other programs transitional medical assistance tma which is program that extends at least six and up to 12 additional months of medicaid coverage for families leaving welfare for work authority for the tma program is scheduled to expire on december 31 2005 at which time absent congressional action four months of medicaid coverage to such families would be provided s 667 would extend 12month tma through the end of fy2010 and provide state options to reduce required beneficiary reporting of income to continue to receive tma after six months and allow for up to 24 months of tma the house reconciliation bill would not extend tma beyond december 31 20054 state abstinence education grants the program providing grants to states for abstinenceonly education is scheduled to expire on december 31 2005 s 667 would extend this program through fy2010 the house budget reconciliation bill would not include an extension of this program child welfare programs both s 667 and the house budget reconciliation bills would extend the authority for states to operate child welfare waiver programs through fy2010 the house bill would add additional instructions to hhs regarding waiver approval policies and availability of waiver reports the senate committee bill would allow indian tribes to receive direct federal funding to operate foster care and adoption assistance programs and would also permit puerto rico to receive limited additional federal foster care funds 4 for discussion of the tma program and issues see crs report rl31698 transitional medical assistance tma under medicaid by april grady crs20 the house budget reconciliation bill includes two provisions intended to reduce federal outlays for foster care and adoption assistance 1 it seeks to nullify court rule known as the rosales case that expands eligibility for foster care in certain states and 2 it limits the period of time partial federal reimbursement of foster care costs can be provided for children who are placed with relatives who are not licensed to provide foster care and it requires states seeking this partial federal matching on behalf of children who are at imminent risk of removal from their homes to redetermine the status of these children as candidates for foster care every six months supplemental security income ssi both s 667 and the house budget reconciliation bill would require that certain percentage of disability determinations by state disability agencies be reviewed by the federal government s 667 would also extend the period of ssi eligibility for refugees and asylees from seven to nine years the house bill attempts to achieve budget reductions by requiring that certain back payments be paid in installments over time rather than in one lump sum detailed comparison of senate committee bills and the house
