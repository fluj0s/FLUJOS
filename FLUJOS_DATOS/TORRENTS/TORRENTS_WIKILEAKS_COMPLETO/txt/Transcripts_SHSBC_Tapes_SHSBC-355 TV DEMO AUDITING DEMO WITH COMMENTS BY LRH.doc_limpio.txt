pc so i i havent quite arrived yet auditor okay all right anything thats holding your attention pc well yes my stomach i wasnt feeling all that well its slightly got my attention mm thats all it feels peculiar auditor all right thank you very much and id like now to go over to this question which i will first start asking of you then i will check on the meter pc mmhm auditor all right good today has anyone missed withhold on you pc um well yes um youve caught on bad day im sorry constantine um not so much bad day as bad week i suppose or bad fortnight well its bit i think everyone misses on um how hopeless i feel at the moment you know and that makes feel terribly griefy i think the one thing that i never communicate to anyone is um how hopeless i feel at the moment i feel bit as if ive been walking around um in the most almighty bypassed charge for such long time ive got used to it i think well what i sort of i sometimes look at myself in the mirror and and i think by christ how ghastly i look you know and i think probably one here realizes how i look when i feel all right and i thought it struck today that probably one realizes how lousy i feel you know if someone walks around looking lousy for month it sort of doesnt strike you as anything different about it when you happen to look at them one day and see them looking lousy you know if you usually look all right for most of the time then you suddenly looked bad people sort of ask you whats happening and i sort of felt ive looked so lousy for such long time that probably one realizes just how lousy i am feeling at the moment i sort of feel i dont know i should i suppose i should sort of communicate it to someone otherwise how can they help i think probably the biggest thing i suppress is ill ill never let anyone know when when things are really going badly with its its as if the worse i feel the more ill the more i never communicate it to people or at least probably to never communicate it to someone if it can help i thought i was i was walking over to practical today and joe then stopped and said how are you doing and i said oh pretty lousy and then i said the one thing that i do is i never blow because iim too far below it i just hang around here in apathy you know and i was thinking about this i walked off i thought i dont know i think this is what everyone misses on the fact that i just sort of im actually below blowing i just sort of feel im stuck here forever and i havent really got and i suppose i never really take it upon myself to tell someone whats happening to i expect them to know and then i suppose they miss it on um perhaps i even make them guilty i suppose i do i just sort of make guilty i expect people to come along and help you know when im like this yeah i think i actually make people guilty for not coming along and helping you know i sort ofill never tell them i expect them to come along and do something for well thats one auditor thank you pc would you mind if i blow my nose auditor okay put the cans down do so pc it seems funny place to sit and cry about all this when you sit in the middle of demonstration im sorry it was just the way i was feeling at

very good all right is it all right with you if we go on with the body of the session pc yeah yeah auditor okay pc were not doing mid ruds as well are we auditor all right the auditing question is going to be today has anyone missed withhold on you pc hm auditor all right do you understand the question pc yes yes i i i it means to today has anyone done anything that restimulated and what have they done sort of thing you know uh rather than what ive done being someone elses action lrh man dont buy that definition of missed withholds auditor all right did you happen to hear that pc i heard someth yes i heard something i didnt hear actually what he said auditor fine okay good all right what is withhold pc withhold is uh something ive done auditor all right pc right uh so missed withhold is something ive done thats been restimulated by someone else auditor i dont get that pc well something auditor oh i pc you know what i mean auditor yeah lrh you keep working on that until we get it straight auditor okay all right pc fin in fin in sort of mystery as to whats going on auditor fair enough okay now would you give what you gave again please pc yeah its some its something that contrasurvival act that has been uh been restimulated by so by another and not disclosed thats the definition auditor all right thats the definition pc hm auditor all right lets lets begin in the beginning again whats withhold pc withhold is something that i have done which is contrasurvival yeah auditor all right pc uh which i havent which i have withheld auditor fair enough pc right auditor all right and missed withhold pc its something like that thats been restimulated by someone else by someone elses action auditor oh i see okay all right your doingness though pc yeah an original doingness of mine which someone else has restimulated again sort of thing see what i mean something that i have done one som at some time or other thats been restimulated today by someone else thats what i understand as what you want auditor all right once again give what missed withhold is pc uh its something thats that i have done that has been restimulated by somebody else auditor i dont get how its been restimulated by someone else pc well say ive uh uh let see i have uh i have blown the course say right at some time which is to say an overt all right and say i was withholding it from someone and then someone said started then that was long time ago say and then somebody says to um suddenly looks at and says what do you feel about how do you feel about blowing courses and i might remember that i have withhold that i blew the course and that would be missed withhold the act the incident of him saying this to would be the missed withhold thats thats my understanding of missed withhold auditor let see if i get it straight pc all right auditor the incident of someone saying this pc yes well the withhold is not the miss uh the withhold is that i blew the course the missed withhold is someone saying to it it that well the incident where its missed is when someone said to uh you what about blowing courses something of this nature auditor fair enough and they missed that you had all right pc hm yeah auditor all right thats fine are you ready to go on pc yeah sure auditor all right then heres the auditing question today has anyone missed withhold on you pc um let think ill have to have look over today and see well i had an auditing session this morning um i dont remember if there was anything missed in the auditing session uh i remember you banging on the table uh i dont think that was missed withhold i cant remember ever having banged on the table yes i last week i banged on the table i think and your banging on the table may have restimulated that um what else now there may have been some missed withholds in the session because i was nattering lot well ive been nattering long time uh and i dont think theres i dont think tha if theres with missed withhold in relationship my to my nattering this morning it wasnt missed today must have been missed quite long time ago um i think dick may have missed withhold he was making remarks about um book that i had lent him and um and he was he had the session next door to and uh he was making lot of remarks about some book and it sort of cut my itsa line bit and uh it couldnt really be missed withhold that its uh maybe i had probablyim have lent himor lent him the book to i mean it was perhaps an overt to lend him the book because it uh it was nothing to do with scientology and would take his attention off his studies um youll probably get good laugh out of this now uh he referred to it was book by ouspensky actually about gurdjieffs work and he referred to uh gurdjieff as little hubbard and i thought well i dont know about that its difficult to evaluate certainly you know one from the other hm that was the session i dont think there was anything else iii didnt feel that my auditor had missed any withholds in the session you know i didnt feel nattery about him or um and then i went on the bus into town and uh well i didnt go into the bus because the bus broken down and uh id therefore id i went in with edgar but in the bus before it before we decided the bus had broken down uh something about blowing something some remark about i made some remark about blowing i wasnt seriously thinking of blowing or anything i just and i said something and i said something about blowing and the and someone said oh ill keep an eye on over the lunch and i said well if i if i was going to blow i wouldnt be saying remarks about blowing and uh and then i thought well perhaps it would be good idea say i wanted to blow then if i said im blowing like that one would believe you see and id get make clean getaway well i know some missed withhold yes i dont think it was missed withhold in the lunch hour particularly perhaps the national insurance people missed it perhaps the post office people i dont think they did uh herbie i think herbie yes herbie must have missed withhold on um herbie was ranting about something in the practical period and he was giving his his random rote procedure lecture you know the one that he often gives uh about it being rando not not random rote procedure uh wound woundup doll uh what was it how does it go now its got to be rote routine rote procedure you know and all that sort of stuff and i was he he i had the feeling that every now and then he looked at because i was i was finding it hard not to laugh at this point you see and every now and then he would seem to be looking my direction that probably my imagination and i had sort of committed an overt against herbie the day before because he see he had given an example of some experiment hed done to prove something you know and i didnt think that um i criticized this and i said well i more than criticized i tried to make nothing of his experiment you see by saying that it didnt prove anything because there were lot of things that were different from one situation to another so i mean it doesnt it didnt it didnt actually i mean i was right in the sense that one of his experiments didnt the other two were reasonably all right and he went on to that but i uh the overt was that i was trying to make nothing of herbieherbies experiment which was useful thing to do you know and uh he looking at sort of made think of that you know and i thought felt that id done the wrong thing another in another way by by saying uh by saying that you know because uh it didnt do any good you know to go around nattering of this you know this was an overt against as well as against him you know because if one feels nattery the best thing to do is to keep ones bloody mouth shut you know and uh so one only knows oneself when ones nattering auditor well all right okay how you doing now pc all right auditor okay thats pc probably got plenty more you know auditor okay thank you very very much all right were going to have to end it off here pc oh all right okay auditor all right okay is it all right if we just end it there pc yeah sure sure yeah i can tell my auditor the rest of it auditor very good thank you very much okay i want to check to see if you made any part of your goals for this session pc hm auditor okay one is to survive it pc yes i survived all right pretty well i felt too auditor good all right to incrim not to incriminate anyone pc i didnt incriminate anyone hm auditor okay to answer the actual question without pulling in anything pc yeah i stuck pretty well to the actual question yes auditor all right tm sorry oh to get on all right with you as an auditor pc oh yes yes yes i did all right with that auditor all right to feel comfortable at the end of session pc yeah i feel all right yeah auditor all right thank you for making these goals pc hm auditor have you made any other gains in this session that youd care to mention pc um well let think well i feel all right about these demonstrations you know i think uh i dont think id like to have long demonstration you know i donti wouldnt like to be demonstration pc on for full session you know particularly but on short one i dont mind i thought i would dislike it you know but i i find i dont mind thats fine its rather long wi long winded to write down but auditor okay i got it though pc yeah auditor and thank you all right now lets have can squeeze pc up auditor all right what is your havingness process pc feel that auditor all right put the cans down please okay all right feel that table top pc mmhm auditor thank you all right feel the arms of the chair pc yeah auditor thank you feel your shoulders pc yeah auditor good feel the cans pc yeah auditor all right and feel the back of the meter thank you take the cans all right and squeeze them very good thats better all right were going to leave it right there pc mmhm auditor okay is it all right with you if i end this session now pc yeah auditor

session im very sorry about that so ill do it now all right squeeze the cans please very good okay the tone arm there is at 20 and there was an eighth of dial pc hm i dont know if i squeezed very hard or not very softly actually auditor very good pc want to do it again auditor okay well ill just check all right thats fine all right squeeze the cans please thank you all right thats half dial now okay all right well now if its all right with you well carry on here pc mmhm auditor all right ill give you the question today has anyone missed withhold on you pc hm um appears as though lots of people have you know you know thats funny liz do you know in in theory in in practical this afternoon i was longing for someone to pull missed withholds on jenny because i had feeling that jenny missed something on this afternoon and its just happened there is something and i just didnt know what it was and i knew i wouldnt be able to find it unless i sat with an auditor and looked for it i know what happened i was in the basement in the you know the office here auditor uhhuh pc and she said something about my voice being very um kind of very sort of hard and harsh with the pc and then i find found myself defending myself oh god let see if i can get this right sort of saying um sort of uh i dont know if i said it i felt like saying that wasnt you know or the pc didnt get it that way or something like that um i just thought sophies just missed withhold on because i was going to say i mean she asked how much ta there was and i was going to say now i told sophie i wouldnt tell her how much ta she got until the end of the intensive but jenny asked and then she thought it was quite good and then she sort of you know wasnt critical of of my speaking that way but there was something and i felt very funny i walked out of there and you know how you sort of feel sometimes youre sort of running away from something where you sort of um whats the feeling the feeling of um wanting to get away hm auditor mmhm okay pc lets see if i can get this damn thing hm theres one thing um jenny was watching the session this morning and um sophie got fright and um afterwards she whispered in my ear ask sophie what happened just before this and sophie got fright and the ta blew down about whole division and then she said well when sophie feels bit better ask her what happened just before that and as far as i know i said i think i said what happened and then then i said to her i didnt wait for an answer and then i said what happened just before you got that fright now that ties up with this afternoon jenny was talking to and she said but you didnt you didnt ask her what happened just before she got the fright so i said yes i did jenny said ask what we what was she ask her what she was thinking about just before that and i said yes i did i did ask her and then i thought i didnt i asked her what happened just before that and i got confused but i knew id asked something like that and there was some confusion there i think jenny missed on that i felt that although my voice may sound very abrupt and sort ofum kind of careless and sort of hard to the pc or it may sound like it to someone listening to the session i feel that my pc feels the affinity flow and i sort of dont bother with how i say it or something i always sort of feel my pc knows and i can i feel i can sort of say um what happened in very sort of abrupt and sort of uncaring way you know and tone of voice but i feel my pc knows that that isnt so and my pc doesnt pcs sort of critical of that or sorry and um worries about that you know that was one thing i dont think and i dont think jenny got this and then i said but look sophie hasnt arc broken about my tone of voice there then she said well the ta went up to 4 0 and got got sticky and um i dont like talking about cases you know auditor carry on tell more what was missed here pc um i dont know now i feel i shouldnt be talking about cases you know about my own pc and about what happens with my own pc auditor mmhm okay all right well now um just when did jenny miss this withhold pc that was this afternoon in the basement auditor very good pc definitely auditor very good what did she do to miss it pc im not quite sure what the withhold is that she missed auditor okay all right pc i think it was the tone of voice i was try ing to get across to her that this tone of voice ma apparently be like that and i may apparently be very abrupt but but to it doesnt seem like that you know and she missed my kind of disagreement and wanting to wanting to assert something and then feeling foolish and feeling um degraded for wanting to assert something you know i feel bad when i have to assert somethingyou know defend myself again like that that was what she missed auditor very good okay all right now did anyone else miss that pc min i told somebody about it i think yeah i told don um oh well ties up into little story i told don about it and he was listening to tape and he told afterwards in tea at tea time that id just said that jenny said that i spoke in very hard way to the pc you know and he said the funny thing was just as he put the tapes back on you know over his ears the earphones he heard ron saying it doesnt matter what tone of voice you use with your pc um hang on sec yeah theres something gets missed with its kind of attitude i feel that i can um hmm its bit like that thing with val she expects people to know how she is you know even though she sort of doesnt say it well i expect people to know lets take lookhmm ii expect people to not be taken in by tone of voice hmm thats what it is auditor very good okay is that all there is on that one lrh dont repeat your question and end off the session pc whats that auditor i got an instruction from ron then pc do you want to answer that question auditor all right um have you got an answer there pc im just bit worried about that instruction auditor okay he said not to repeat my question and to wind up the session pc min all right if its all there is to that missed withhold do you want to know auditor yeah pc hm it isnt actually uh its happened once before yes jenny said the same thing before about this hard tone of voice and i know what i know what she means because i know my voice sounds like that you see and theres kind of agreement but the disagreement is that the pc could care two hoots about it and that it affects the pc auditor hm very good okay well although there may be some more on this if its all right with you id like to end this subject here pc mm auditor all right pc mmhm auditor okay is it all right with you if we end the body of the session now pc mm id just like to check something with you auditor sure pc is my needle flying around auditor pc not auditor not at the moment pc all right all right auditor all right okay well is it all right with you if i end the body of the session now pc mm auditor okay is there anything youd care to ask or say before i do so pc mmmm auditor all right end of the body of the session pc mmhm auditor all right have you made an part of your goals for this session shall i give it to you pc mm auditor all right to feel calm at the end of it pc um as matter of fact i havent made that goal but i made some gains auditor okay im sorry you didnt make that goal pc thats fine auditor all right have you made any gains in this session youd care to mention pc mm mm i found i was able to look didnt expect to be able to you know um yeah and i feel ive pinpointed that missed withhold there there may be some earlier ones similar but that particular one this afternoon today i pinpointed and i feel good about that auditor very good thank you for making that gain pc mm auditor all right well id just like to take can squeeze here pc min my hands are all sticky auditor all right all right well im just going to check how youve got those cans held all right just take hold of them very good okay please squeeze the cans very good all right thats half dial there how are you doing pc fine auditor very good okay well its well leave that there like it is pc all right good auditor all right is there anything youd care to ask or say before i end this session pc um except that you look bit funny with those things around your ears uh like strungup you know those people these typists from dictaphones auditor mmhm pc and thats all auditor very good all right is it all right with you if i end this session now pc min auditor okay end of session has the session ended for you pc mm auditor very good tell im longer auditing you pc im longer auditing you all right here we are with the comments on these sessions and we have sessions one two and three and i would have been happy to have commented on these things as they were done while they were fresh in your memory the only difficulty with that of course is the auditor and pc have not removed themselves back over to the chapel and cant hear the comments being made on their session the essence of this problem here is that you just have to remember whats going on in these sessions these were the sessions of the twenty eighth of november and there are three student sessions here well comment on them rapidly one after the other but first before we get into the gruesome aspects of it thank you very much very brave of you people to be on tv its too much for it frightens to death being on tv i get stage fright you know all right now heres the first session constantine auditing valerie now theres reason for you to go out and blow your brains out or anything like that constantine over this but we need bit of brushup in some departments and lets go into these things now i didnt get the sound the first half of it youre lucky there i cant call anything wrong on the first half of it because i didnt get the soundthe sound was off up here the first half of that too faint when i finallyit was broken ear plug something and when i did tune in however i could not help but notice certain stony silence certain stony silence thatif i were being audited that way i would think i had done something wrong as pc now stony silence is not proper presence theres encouragement there theres auditor action and so forth theres room there for little half acknowledgments and so forth let the pc know hes talking just dont sit there glumly looking at the pc because the pc after while will just start compulsively itsaing and thats in essence what this pc did thats inviting itsa by silence also reproving itsa by silence in this particular case because when the pc said something nothing was ever given back to the pc at all mmhm now you can go mmhm longa lot too many times but nod now and then and some attention to the pc and so on is very much an action very much called for now at the end of the body of the session there was action and then sudden lowering the boom by just ending the body of the session actually the pc was not acknowledged at all at the end of the body of the session in other words theres comm cycle in progress there at all and youve got to study comm cycle constantine youve got to study comm cycle youre going to find out what an auditing cycle is i dont care if weve introduced itsa and so forth youve got to study this and youve got to get this down and you can be grooved in quite bit and now you knew how to do it once now youve gone over the other side of it and you stopped doing it at all now let assure you that there is middle ground of the correct action it doesnt run from total talk by the auditor to talk by the auditor you see theres middle ground theres certain amount of talk here and acknowledgment and so forth the old tr 1 tr 2that sort of thing is whats out there and did acknowledgment of the pc but only ended the session and thats lousy comm cycle get some more warmth and so forth in actual fact ending body of session that way is using the tools of auditing to cut itsa and under that heading using the tools of auditing to cut itsa there are great great great many crimes you can suddenly wave your pencil around in the air and be writing and so forth so that the pc doesnt think youre paying bit of attention to him all right cuts the pcs itsa you can misuse model session to cut the pcs itsa but all this comes under the heading of this large classification using the tools of auditing to cut the pcs itsa and its very very poor doing it that way now theres an actual auditor comm lag going on here constantine theres not picking it up see picking it up picking it up theres an actual auditor comm lag when the pc says something or something is supposed to be done the auditor should not remain silent at that time an auditor should not pick up his comm lag its bad enough to have pcs that comm lag without having auditors that comm lag too you understand pc says thats all and the auditor says oh thank you whats this the pc says see when the pc says thats all see pc says well thatthats all the auditor says all right in other words there shouldnt be comm lags in there before the auditor does what hes supposed to do dont stand around waiting you see the introduction of itsa has encouraged auditors to stand around and wait to do nothing to invite itsa by silence and brought in whole bunch of new crimes that nobody had everdreamed of before and so forth well itsa is gotten within the absence of these crimes and so forth now you need to study your model session your model session wording is way out and that needs to be studied and repassed and you want to get some hope factor and some confidence instilled into the session some warmth and so forth we dont need any sphinxlike attitude on an auditor and just to summarize this why youre to study the model session the auditing comm cycles and actually restudy itsa now this crazy comment what are you going to do when we end the session has never been heard of again it was said by constantine on the twentyeighth of november and then nobody else ever said it from there on for the next two thousand years you hear i dont know where that wild one come from but i can see these things develop oh i can see why you want trick there to get the pc to think about another time but actually is continuation of the session all right other than that constantine you did fine and the pc did fineand dont think im beingbearing hard on you i want good auditor and youre very capable of being good auditor so thank you for giving that session giving an opportunity to look over what youre doing and be able to give you hand on it okay all right and now we get to session number two the placement of chair the auditor didnt notice the pc then changed the chair after the auditor places the chair and the pc moves the chair the auditor should place the chair its simple as that of course it operates as criticism of the pc but thats the point of control of the session is right there with the placement of the chair pc moved the chair was not in control in the session thereafter that start was far too slow didnt have the pcs attention in order to start the session pc was going rah rah and so forth and you just started the session you got to get the pcs attention before you start the session you want to get the pcs eyes right on you to start that session also incidentally having nothing really to do with auditing skill and so forth i noticed that you really need to practice writing faster with all the writing an auditor has to do dont take that length of time to audit learn to write little bit faster and youll have an easier time of it thats almost extraneous to auditing but it would help you out and i noticed that in passing now you did something i told people not to do in the last demonstration that i commented on which is you bled goals after the pc has given goal or two then you asked for another goal never ask for additional goals itsif you want to know what goals hed like to set for this session and thats it you never ask him again are there any more goals and so forth do you know you can spend the whole session getting pcs to list goals never bleed goals off the pc just oncebang and thats you take it and thats it and youre away you noticed the pc in this particular instance was actually flabbergasted he didnt quite know what he was expected to do or why and you put huge comm lag into the session there when you bled goals never bleed goals any of you i thought you would have learned that last week now the auditor in this particular instance also inactive under the guise of not cutting itsa any time an auditor doesnt want to do anything he says well i didnt want to cut the pcs itsa actually we have to get moderate look at this now you didnt ever have to calldont ever call the pcs attention to the auditor if you got to adjust the earphones why just adjust earphones dont say is it all right with you if i adjust earphones and so forth dont keep calling pcs attention to auditor dont ever call the pcs attention to the meter dont ever call the pcs attention to the auditor if you got to do something just do it put in an rfactor if you want to if you think itll startle the pc but in this particular case there was nothing of that thats perfectly all right but in actual fact avoid calling the pcs attention to the auditor always now the definition of missed withhold i think thats very remarkable because you see the pc never did define withhold or missed withhold and therefore this pc couldnt answer the auditing question because he didnt know what it is and actually this pc needs to be audited in that direction needs to be trained in that direction and the pcs case any case advance this pc has is hung up right on that point and you had an opportunity to cut this wide open and actually you fell back from doing so now i would have lowered the boom until the pc really knew what i was talking about because of course missed withhold is thea withhold basicallyis just not talking and the pc never did bring this up see its just not saying i mean the basis of it and missed withhold what did somebody else do that made him think that this had been keyed in this pc had that defined as motivator and that needs to be straightened out because the pcs advance and so forth in processing is actually held up at this point right there bang noplace else and ive just written some direction for the pcs auditor we can straighten that out bingitybang but you had an opportunity to straighten that out and i want to call to your attention if the pc cannot tell you what the part of the session is or what the part of the mind is or what thewhat the auditing definition of something is the pc then cant answer the question in relationship to it because the pc doesnt know what it is all right now that was clearing the auditing question now the pc once gave himself the auditing question and smart auditor is always in there repeating the auditing question the pc says lets see all right lets see whats the question ah lets seein this session has anything been suppressed im always in there and i say today has anything been suppressed or whatever it is since the last time i audited you has anything been suppressed i say the question is you know keep control of it to that degree dont let pcs go giving themselves the question because they at that moment go on to selfaudit and you have to bring them back on to sessionaudit then we already commented on auditor silence then there are quite few model session errors and the auditor here should study model session get the comm cycle in and get command clarification and review missed withholds hcobs and thats what this auditor should do thank you very much stan i hope you dont think im being too cruel actually you are one of the better auditors lets just make sure you stay that way and not go stepping on banana peels and going out into the blue just because an auditing style has changed so thank you stan now we have session number three model session errors model session errors model session errors and so on study model session until it could be done in hurricane in other words hurricane blowing still be able to do model session roof falling in still be able to do model session you understand that model session pooph see i mean forgetting things like the can squeeze test and that sort of thing thathats corny now side comment having nothing to do with the auditorhaving nothing to do with the auditor at all but that pcs havingness is awful low for saint hill student and that has lot to do with this pcs regular auditors what do you mean letting somebody sit around with that low can squeeze i think its phenomenal i think its fantastic how can you possibly have student sit around with that much can squeeze that tiny amount of can squeeze test that just isnt enough to bother with on mark v on mark v normal can squeeze is across the dial and two bounces off the pin youve got it not half dial thats set at 1 thats set at 1 on mark v that just isnt enough can squeeze why hadnt somebody noticed this and run this pc up the line till this pcs havingness was in pretty good condition or find out what there is in the environment thats cutting the pcs havingness down thats pretty low for saint hill student and if any of you others of you have been putting up with that kind of can squeeze and so forth realize that that little halfadial rawraw that is not havingness man put it on the set mark pc squeezes the cans it bounces twicetwice off of that pin hitsgoes down and hits that pin from set to pin pshwwwpangtwice bang bang boom thats the way it ought to look if it doesnt look that way your pcs havingness is too low to be audited how do you like that now all of you are sitting there saying what you know my pcs havingness is only quarter of an inch and ive been auditing the pc yeah you should hold your head in your hands because that isnt enough havingness for pc to be audited on that pc either hasnt eaten or the pc is not sufficiently rested or the pc is this or the pc is that or the pc is bothered by his environment or has ptpsbut basically has withholds my god you understand withholds that sort of thing thats what really cuts down havingness so your pcs havingness is that low get the pcs havingness up by normal havingness processes and see if you cant pull the missed withholds run some ow lets get some auditing done around here if any of you have pcs who have can squeeze tests that are that small you are then looking at critical case so lets do the necessary to make the case auditable bunch of you are goinglike that right now i imagine now this auditor is very indirective of the pcs attention but also the auditor is in w so its not too serious but there isnt really enough direction of the pcs attention going on in that session failure to direct pcs attention is never excused by i dont want to cut the pcs itsa you can direct the pcs attention without cutting the pcs itsa the auditor actually could have delineated the question there at one particular point and gotten the pc to find out what was the missed withhold actually the auditor did not pull missed withhold in that session it required this question from the auditor what did jenny do that made you think she had almost found out something see that applied at the right moment what did jenny do that made you think she had almost found out something hm thats the question to get the missed withhold and it would have peeled off just like that you see pc was floundering was trying to straighten it out and so forth its all right let the pc talk this isnt too serious because you as an auditor are still in w unit but it would be serious in x now there was an msmodel sessionerror on the goals question and the auditors voice tone was bit bored at session end little brighter voice tone and by the way for the last can squeeze test the auditor did herselfmay have done herself out of some can squeeze because the needle was left on the pin over onas you face the meterthe lefthand side i think the needle was lying right down against the pin when the can squeeze test was given which of course you dont want it there you want can squeeze test given from the needle at set and of course if its down against the pin you dont know how far it rose before its visibly moved thats all there is to that now this sounds very very vicious and your auditing actually is pretty good and you have very good reputation amongst the instructors as an auditor now lets not let that down lets get to be better even than that so thank you very much for giving that session all right on auditing in generalon auditing in general why i think our modern fault in auditing isi can sort the thing outsimply falls under these headings you dont know your model session just dont know it see i mean youre not good enoughsharp enough on model session you ought to be able to purr model session off brrrrrrt without any difficulties whatsoever and were going to reassign you to saying model session to the walls the whole lot of you and get your model session straightened up got that instructors all right and the next thing i want to say is there is letting the pc itsa and there is sitting silent and inviting pcs itsa when there is auditing question and i think lot of you may be doing that pc really doesnt have question is just talkingif you just sit silent and look at pc you are inviting itsa and the pc will talk learn that make test of it just sit silent in front of pc and youll see the pc will start talking well thats all very fine but dont do it in session pc hasnt got question so you sit silent and look at the pc now the pcs got to talk but the pc actually doesnt have question and so forth auditing is auditing itsa is itsa theres happy medium between cutting pcs actual itsa and being afraid to cut the pcs itsa so not doing anything and youve just got to find the happy middle ground and stop caroming off both extremes of this thing its either cut the pcs itsa to ribbonsyou say to the question heres really cutting pcs itsa in this session has anything been suppressed the pc says oh well i uh thank you well all right well i didnt get any read on that and so forth all right in this session has anything been invalidated uh well yes you sort of invalidated my cognition well i didnt have any read on the meter lets see now in this session has anything been suggested and so forth well by this time of course youve got roaring arc break see thats cutting pcs itsa now heres another way to mess up pc in this session has anything been suppressed pc says hm dontdont think so auditor well youre going to get an arc break do you realize that youve cleaned clean by sitting and looking fixedly at pc who hasnt got anything to say when you sit silent and look at pc you clean clean pc has got nothing to say you understand you said has anything been suppressed and he said yeah i suppressedi suppressed all the instructors you know whatever and then he sits therehes answered the question you understand and you sit there and you look at him silently you say nothing so forth he after while all of sudden gets the idea maybe he still expects to talk so ill look for another suppress let see what suppress and so forth well i guess not i dont know hm whaowhao whats this guy doing to i dont like this place i dont even wanna answer his question well hes in horrible position because he doesnt really have question and yet the auditor by sitting silent implies that hes got to answer something do you understand and that is not cutting itsa that is cleaning cleans and when you start practicing this sit still and look at the pc and notmake sure the pcs got question the pcs answering the question youre not doing anything for the pcwell what are you doing youre cleaning cleans supposing you said on meter in this session has anything been suggested you didnt get any read that needle was smoooooth as glass and then you said to the pc hey you heard the question had read here well the pcs going to try to answer that only of course he hasnt got anything to answer and then you just sit there and look at the pc well you can watch pc arc break on cleaned clean well you can also also clean clean and make pc arc break just by sitting there and looking at the pc look develop sensitivity develop sensitivity know when the pcs got something to say and know when the pc hasnt got anything to say and act accordingly as an auditor how do you develop that sensitivity thats up to you im just the critic around here okay all right well thats the end of those demonstrations im very happy to have those demonstrations i see what weak points are showing up in the last two demonstrations ive looked over here i see about where weve gone i see about what the score is with regard to this and im very happy to be able to give hand and straighten this out basic auditing is usually the cause of progress basic auditing is cornyno progress yet you look at techniques and that sort of thing to give you progress you look at case analysis to give you progress well actually case analysis and techniques can get nowhere when basic auditing is out if you want to see results in your pc get your basic auditing in flawlessly perfectly right straight down the groove basic auditing able to handle model session able to handle the meter able to handle the comm cycle snap snap snap able to handle these various things and you will see then that you can apply technique but in the absence of basic auditing you cannot apply technique so therefore the technique appears not to work so you ask for new technique for this pc doesnt need new technique needs technique applied with good basic auditing thats why i have these demonstrations and thats why i tie into you the way i have i still love you thank you very much good night
