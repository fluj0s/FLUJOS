rehabilitation act of 19731 prohibits discrimination against an otherwise qualified individual with disability solely by reason of disability in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by an executive agency or the us postal service section 504 was the first federal civil rights law generally prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities2 the concepts of section 504 and its implementing regulations were used in crafting the americans with disabilities act ada3 in 1990 the ada and section 504 are therefore very similar and have some overlapping coverage but also have several important distinctions for example section 504 is limited to programs receiving federal funds or the executive agencies and the postal service while the ada broadly covers the private sector regardless of whether federal funds are involved and does not cover the executive agencies or the postal service the ada amendments act of 2008 pl 110325 amended the definition of disability in the ada and the definition of disability applicable to section 504 4 this report examines section 504 the recent amendments to the definition

although section 504 was the first federal statute that provided broad civil rights protections for individuals with disabilities there was very little discussion of its meaning or importance during its enactment in 1973 the most detailed discussion was during congressional debate when senator humphrey observed 1 29 usc 794 title v of the rehabilitation act contains other sections relating to

quality of life for ll americans with disabilities and their families stated section 504 of the 1973 rehabilitation act is acknowledged as the first national civil rights law to view the exclusion and

deeply gratified at the inclusion of these provisions which carry through the intent of original bills which i introduced jointly with the senator from illinois mr percy earlier this year s 3044 and s 3458 to amend respectively titles vi and vii of the civil rights act of 1964 to guarantee the right of persons with mental or physical handicap to participate in programs receiving federal assistance and to make discrimination in employment because of these handicaps and in the absence of bona fide occupational qualification an unlawful employment practice the time has come to firmly establish the right of these americans to dignity and selfrespect as equal and contributing members of society and to end the virtual isolation of millions of children and adults from society 6 the implementation of section 504 was not performed expeditiously the then department of health education and welfare hew7 published regulations in 1978 only after federal court held that hew was required to promulgate regulations8 and after demonstrations at hew offices9 the year 1978 also saw major amendments to section 50410 these amendments expanded section 504 nondiscrimination requirements to programs or activities conducted by executive agencies and added new section 505 11 which applied the remedies procedures and rights of title vi of the civil rights act of 196412 to section 504 actions

subsection was added by pl 100259 in 1988 in response to the supreme courts narrow interpretation of the phrase program or activity in title ix of the education amendments of 197214 the amendment clarified that discrimination is prohibited throughout the entire institution if any part of the institution receives federal financial assistance15 subsection c of section 504 was also added by pl 100259 in 1988 it contains an exception for small providers so they are not required to make significant structural alternations to their existing facilities to render them accessible if alternative means of providing the services are available this subsection was added to clarify that pl 100259 does not add new requirements for architectural modification16 subsection d of section 504 requires that the standards used to determine whether there has been violation of section 504 regarding employment discrimination complaints are the same as those in the americans with disabilities act this subsection was added by pl 102569 in 1992 pl 102569 also substituted the term disability for the term handicap

to conform with the new definition of disability for the ada18 the senate statement of managers noted the importance of maintaining uniform definitions in the two statutes so covered entities will generally operate under one consistent standard and the civil rights of individuals with disabilities will be protected in all settings19 the ada definition defines the term disability with respect to an individual as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment as described in paragraph 3 20 although this is essentially the same statutory language as was in the original ada pl 110325 contains new rules of construction regarding the definition

welfare hew in january of 1978 soon after this the 1978 amendments to section 504 were passed which applied section 504 nondiscrimination requirements to programs or activities conducted by executive agencies and added language requiring the promulgation of regulations each executive agency and the postal service now has its own section 504 regulations which are tailored to the particular recipients of that agencys programs in addition each executive agency and the postal service have regulations which delineate the coverage of section 504 with regard to that agencys own programs in 1980 president carter issued executive order 12250 which provided that the department of justice shall coordinate the implementation and enforcement of certain nondiscrimination provisions including those of section 504 22 g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g21g158g153g155g142g150g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 the supreme court has examined section 504 in numerous contexts and since the enactment of the ada in 1990 has often referenced section 504 in its analysis of ada cases the first section 504 case to reach the supreme court was southeastern community college v davis23 in southeastern the plaintiff was student with serious hearing disability and who sought to be trained as registered nurse the college argued that she was not otherwise qualified as she could not understand speech except through lip reading and that this limitation made it unsafe for her to participate in the normal clinical progra m the supreme court agreed with the college noting that it was unlikely that she could benefit from any affirmative action that the regulations reasonably could be interpreted as requiring 24 the court concluded that 21 low vision devices are not included in the ordinary eyeglasses and contact lens exception 22 executive order 12250 november 2 1980 reprinted at httpwwwusdojgovcrtcorbyagencyeo12250htm 23 442 us 397 1979 24 id at

was violation of 504 when southeastern concluded that respondent did not qualify for admission to its program nothing in the language or history of 504 reflects an intention to limit the freedom of an educational institution to require reasonable physical qualifications for admission to clinical training program r has there been any showing in this case that any action short of substantial change in southeasterns program would render unreasonable the qualifications it imposed 25 similarly in alexander v choate26 the supreme court found violation of section 504 where medicaid recipients with disabilities claimed that proposed 14day limitation on inpatient coverage had discriminatory effect on individuals with disabilities the court found that the limitation was neutral on its face as it would provide medicaid users with or without disabilities with identical and effective hospital services27 section 504 did not require the state to alter its definition of the medicaid benefit because individuals with disabilities have greater medical needs citing southeastern the court observed that section 504 requires evenhanded treatment and an opportunity for individuals with disabilities to participate and benefit from programs receiving federal funds the act does not however guarantee the handicapped equal results from the provision of state medicaid even assuming some measure of equality of health could be constructed 28 consolidated rail corporation v darrone29 raised the issue of whether an employment discrimination action under section 504 was limited to situations where the primary objective of the federal financial assistance was to provide employment the supreme court held that such actions were not limited since the primary goal of the rehabilitation act is to increase employment of individuals with disabilities the fact that congress chose to ban such employment discrimination only by the federal government and recipients of federal funds did not require that section 504 be further limited in bowen v american hospital association 30 the supreme court addressed the issue of whether section 504 regulations requiring the provision of health care to infants with disabilities were authorized by section 504 this case began when the parents of child with down syndrome requested that lifesaving surgery not be performed31 in response to the death of the child hhs promulgated regulation under section 504 stating that section 504 required that nourishment and medically beneficial treatment should not be withheld from infants with disabilities 32

individual with disability is otherwise qualified for job if the individual has contagious disease gene arline taught elementary school until her employment was terminated after she suffered third relapse of tuberculosis within two years the supreme c ourt held that an individual with contagious disease may be person with disability under section 504 but that person who poses significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others that cannot be alleviated by reasonable accommodation will not be otherwise qualified for job this should be determined by findings of fact based on reasonable medica l judgments about the nature of the risk the duration of the risk the severity of the risk and the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will cause harm 35 in traynor v turnage36 the supreme court examined the application of section 504 to an executive agency more specifically to the veterans administration v the veterans who brought the suit had been denied an extension of the time limit for the use of educational benefits due to disability on the ground that their alleged disability was due to alcoholism unrelated to psychiatric condition v regulations prohibited the granting of time extension because alcoholism unrelated to psychiatric condition was considered willful misconduct37 38 usc 211a bars judicial review of the veterans administrators decision on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the veterans administration providing benefits for veterans the first question the court addressed then was whether 38 usc 211a foreclosed the court from considering whether the v regulation violated section 504 holding that such suits were not precluded the supreme court noted that section 211a insulates from review decision of law and fact under any law administered by the veterans administration that is decisions made in interpreting or applying particular provision of that statute to particular set of facts but the cases now before us involve the issue whether the law sought to be administered is valid in light of subsequent statute whose enforcement is not the exclusive domain of the veterans administration 38 the court then examined the second issue in traynor whether the regulation was inconsistent with the requirements of section 504 finding that the regulation did not violate section 504 the court observed there is nothing in the rehabilitation act that requires that any benefit extended to one category of handicapped persons also be extended to all other categories of handicapped persons 39 the court also noted that congress is entitled to establish priorities for the allocation of the limited resources available for veterans benefits and thereby to conclude that veterans who bear some responsibility for their disabilities have stronger claim to an extended eligibility period than do ablebodied veterans the supreme court in barnes v gorman40 held in unanimous decision that punitive damages may not be awarded under section 20241 of the ada and section 504 of the rehabilitation act 34 480 us 273 1987 35 id at 288 36 485 us 535 1988 37 28 cfr 3301c2 38 485 us 535 543544 1988 39 id

lower torso which necessitates the use of catheter attached to urine bag he was arrested in 1992 after fighting with bouncer at nightclub and during his transport to the police station suffered significant injuries due to the manner in which he was transported he sued the kansas city police and was awarded over 1 million in compensatory damages and 12 million in punitive damages the eighth circuit court of appeals upheld the award of punitive damages but the supreme court reversed although the court was unanimous in the result there were two concurring opinions and the concurring opinion by justice stevens joined by justices ginsburg and breyer disagreed with the reasoning used in justic scalias opinion for the court justice scalia observed that the remedies for vi olations of both section 202 of the ada and section 504 of the rehabilitation act are coexten sive with the remedies available in private cause of action brought under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 42 neither section 504 nor title ii of the ada specifically mention punitive damages rather they reference the remedies of title vi of the civil rights act title vi is based on the congressional power under the spending clause43 to place conditions on grants justice scalia noted that spending clause legislation is much in the nature of contract and in order to be legitimate use of this power the recipient must voluntarily and knowingly accept the terms of the contract if congress intends to impose condition on the grant of federal moneys it must do so unambiguously44 this contract law analogy was also found to be applicable to determining the scope of the damages remedies and since punitive damages are generally not found to be available for breach of contract justice scalia found that they were not available under title vi section 504 or the ada g21g142g140g157g146g152g151g561g347g342g346g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g3g6g3g561 the americans with disabilities act was modeled on the statutory language regulations and case law of section 504 the ada and section 504 are therefore very similar and have some overlapping coverage but also have several important distinctions most significantly section 504 is limited to programs receiving federal funds or the executive agencies and the postal service while the ada broadly covers the private sector regardless of whether federal funds are involved and does not cover the executive agencies or the postal service there are several other distinctions between the ada and section 504 for example the ada contains specific exemptions for religious entities 45 there are corresponding provisions in section 504 therefore if faithbased organization receives federal funds it is prohibited from discriminating against an individual with disability46 title i of the ada prohibits employment discriminati on which is also prohibited with regard to the entities covered by section 504 however the enforcement procedures for the two statutes are somewhat different enforcement of title i of the ada parallels that of title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 and includes the requirement that persons alleging discrimination

disabilities education act idea49 section 504 and the ada address the rights of individuals with disabilities to education50 although there is overlap particularly with section 504 an d the ada each statute plays significant part in the education of individuals with disabilities generally although there are some differences regarding k12 schools the department of education ed has interpreted the section 504 compliance standards for schools to be the same as the basic requirements of idea51 as discussed previously the rehabilitation act is amended by the ada amendments act to reference the definition of disability in the ada section 504s coverage of education was subject of discussion during the passage of the ada amendments act and the senate statement of managers observed we expect that the secretary of education will promulgate new regulations related to the definition of disability to be consistent with those issued by the attorney general under this act we believe that other current regulations issued by the department of education office of civil rights under section 504 of the rehabilitation act are currently harmonious with congressional intent under both the ada and the rehabilitation act 52 the implications of the changes in the definition of disability under section 504 and the ada for the coverage of children in k12 schools is not entirely clear perry zirkel lehigh university education and law professor argues that the adaaa would result in more students in k12 education being given section 504 plans especially students with diabetes asthma food allergies dyslexia and attention deficit disorder add 53 another commentator noted that the addition of reading in the list of major life activities may be problematic since there is easy way to distinguish children who are unable to read because they have disability from those who have simply received poor instruction54 47 42 usc 12117a 42 usc 2000e5 48 29 usc 794a 42 usc 2000d et seq 49 20 usc 1400 et
