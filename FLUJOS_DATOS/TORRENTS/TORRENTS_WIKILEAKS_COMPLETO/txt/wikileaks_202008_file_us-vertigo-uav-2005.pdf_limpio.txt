inflatable structures for deployable aerodynamic decelerators g j brown vertigo inc santa cruz ca abstract deployable aerodynamic decelerators have widely reco gnized potential for aeroassist and planetary landing applications deployable devices are needed whenever t he dimensions of the requir ed aerodynamic surface exceed the limitations imposed by the launch fa iring examples of missions operations that may benefit from deployable aerodynamic decelerators include planetary aerocapture earth return aerocapture planetary atmosphere entry and supersonic deceleration for planetary landing designs t hat rely on mechanical expansion of the aerodynamic surface may be capable of appr oximately twotimes the stowed area infl atable concepts are enabling when large expansion of aerodynamic surface area tentimes or more is required the implications of large area expansion include re duced spacecraft heating increased stability margin and centerofgravity range and dilution of trim and control authority considering an inflated torus as typical structural element the strength stiffness and infl ation pressure requirements are deri ved as functions of peak operating conditions the use of fiber reinforcement to achieve given strength burst pressu re and bending stiffness is discussed the interaction of an open fiber network with the gasbarrier film and implications for minimum mass design are analyzed introduction inflatable cylinders and tori cylinders curved upon themselves into toroidal shapes are the basic building blocks of most of the inflatable aerocapt ure decelerator iad concepts now being studied the basic requirements of inflatable structures used for iads include strength and stiffness sufficient to support and maintain the shape of the decelerator and the ability to operate at temperatures near the useful limit of available materials the basic materials of iads are films and fibers this pape r explores the properties of available films and fibers and analyzes how they may be combined in minimu m mass design that has adequ ate burst str ength at the necessary inflation pressure the examples presented are based on the iad concepts advanced by mcronald8 hall7 and others in which large inflatable decelerator low ballistic coefficient fl ies trajectory through the lowdensity edge of planetary atmosphere such that surface temper atures on the inflatable do not exceed 500c we further assume that the effective duration of exposure to peak temperature is 120 seconds at 500c the specific strength of available fibers is approximately 100 mes that of films this results in substantial advantage in structural massefficiency in favor of fiber reinforcement of inflatab structures film is still necessary in order to contain the inflation gas but this paper will suggest that an efficient design will use the thinnest film practicable and reinforce it with high strengthtoweight fiber distribution authorized to us government agencies only proprietary information this effort was performed under contract number nnm05ab12c with nasa msfc results and discussion fiber reinforcement of films high strength airbeams are an example in which the surfac of the inflatable structur is covered entirely by the reinforcing fiber and both are shown in figure 1 these beams are characterized by hoop stress of greater than 1000 lbin at working pressure which necess itates such highstrength reinforcement figure 1 high strength airbeam and reinforcing fiber aerocapture ballutes however are characterized by hoop stress of less than 50 lbin minimumweight fiber reinforced film may comprise widely spaced reinforcing fibers bonded to the surface of the film as shown in figure 2 figure 2 reinforcing fibers the reason for fiber reinforcement of an inflatable cylinder is evident by consideri ng the hoop circumferential stress in reinforced and unreinforced cylinders of the same diameter inflated to the same pressure the hoop stress in the unreinforced cylinder is related to pressure p film thickness t and section diameter d by the equation tpd hoop2σ section of reinforced cylinder however is characte rized by evenly spaced high modulus fibers with the film bulging outward in the spaces between the fibers the hoop st ress in the film is related to inflation pressure and the radius of curvature of the bulge r by the equation tpr hoopσ because the radius of curvature of the film bulge is much smaller than the radius of the cylinder the stress in the film is much less thus fiber reinforcement can low the use of thinner film and lower total mass the objective of this paper is to quantify such mass savings using specific examples fiber reference properties the most useful tensile property of reinforcing fiber fo r the purposes of mass estimation is specific strength specific strength is conveniently expressed in units of length lwtssbrk by using weight w instead of mass and breaking tension tbrk in the same units va lue in length units is obtained one must remember when converting to mass that earth gravity is included via wmg specific strength can be visualized as the maximum length of particular fiber that can support itself hanging in earth gravity without breaking the weight of tensile element can be calculated from its design strength tdes length l and s pecific strength by ssltwdes data on the physical properties of materials at 500 c is not generally available at such high temperatures strength and elongation vary with time making the estimation of properties even more difficult for the purposes of this study we have estimated allowable specific strength that includes reductions for temperature flex fatigue aging and adhesives and coating adhesives and coatings reduce specific strength by adding weight rather than by reducing strength the properties necessary for estimating the weight of an in flatable structure are the sp ecific strength of the film and the fiber and the elongation of the f

bias orientation β and forming pattern of open diamonds between the fibers as shown in figure 3 figure 3 open pattern of fibers the strain in the film is functi on of both the diamond geometry and the radius of curvature taken by the pressurized film between nodes of the reinforcing fiber diam ond structure this is 3d problem that requires fea to solve any specific problem however we can understand the general problem and calc ulate an upperbound stress by solving the 2d problem of the film bridging the gap c between reinforcing fibers bulge between fibers will have radius r which is related to
