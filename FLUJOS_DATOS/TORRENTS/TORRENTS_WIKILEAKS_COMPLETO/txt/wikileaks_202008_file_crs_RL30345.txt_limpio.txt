control issues updated june 1 2001 amy f woolf specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress us nuclear weapons policy force structure and arms control issues summary during the cold war the united states maintained nuclear weapons to deter and if necessary defeat the soviet union these weapons were designed to deter nuclear attack on the united states and nuclear chemical and conventional attacks on us allies in europe and asia the united states deployed wide variety of nuclear weapons delivery vehicles and was prepared to destroy large numbers of military industrial and leadership targets in the soviet union the united states agreed to restrict the deployment of strategic ballistic missile defenses in the 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty and although the united states and soviet union participated in negotiations to reduce offensive nuclear weapons these efforts did little to reduce the numbers of deployed weapons during the 1970s and 1980s after the demise of the soviet union in 1991 russia remained concern for us national security because it still retained thousands of nuclear weapons but other emerging threats from regional adversaries also prompted concerns the clinton administration argued that nuclear weapons remained important to deter the full range of threats to the united states so even though the united states and russia withdrew most of their deployed nonstrategic nuclear weapons and pledged to reduce their strategic forces under the start i and start ii treaties the united states did little to alter the basic tenets of its nuclear strategy and doctrine in late 1997 the clinton administration issued new presidential decision directive pdd60 that outlined strategy and policy for us nuclear weapons this document stated that the united states would longer seek to win protracted nuclear war with russia but that it would only seek to deter such conflict at the same time the united states would retain range of options for the employment of nuclear weapons and it would not forswear the first use of nuclear weapons if it were attacked with chemical biological or conventional weapons the clinton administration has also sought to continue the start process to reduce strategic forces with russia and it has pledged to seek amendments to the abm treaty so that the united states can deploy limited national ballistic missile defense system to protect against smallscale ballistic missile attacks many analysts have offered alternatives to the clinton administrations approach to nuclear weapons policy some support an explicit threat to retaliate with nuclear weapons after biological weapons attack others argue that the united states should only threaten nuclear retaliation if it is attacked with nuclear weapons some argue that the united states should remain cautious about the arms reduction process with russia while others argue that the two nations should move quickly to reduce sharply the numbers of nuclear weapons in their forces and to reduce the alert rates for those weapons so that they could not be launched quickly some argue that the united states should accelerate the deployment of ballistic missile defenses while others argue that such defenses will do little to protect the united states from emerging threats and could instead undermine reductions with russia the bush administration has undertaken review of nuclear policy and these issues are likely to remain on the congressional agenda for the foreseeable

introduction for more than decade since the 1989 collapse of the berlin wall and the 1991 demise of the soviet union analysts inside and outside government have offered wide range of views on how the united states should adjust its military establishment to accommodate the changing international security environment these analysts sought to address not only the end of hostile ussoviet global rivalry but also the emergence of new threats and regional challenges particularly those related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles the us department of defense conducted several farreaching reviews including the 1993 bottomup review the 1994 nuclear posture review and the 1997 quadrennial defense review that contributed to the clinton administrations response to changes in the international security environment these formal reviews when combined with less prominent internal studies resulted in numerous changes to the structure of us nuclear forces and policy guiding their potential use many other analysts have written and spoken of alternatives for the role that nuclear weapons should play in us security policy the numbers and types of weapons that the united states should retain and the role that arms control and other cooperative efforts might play in reducing emerging threats to the united states some believe the united states should move faster to reduce sharply the number of nuclear weapons in its arsenal and to confine those weapons to modest limited role in us national security policy they also note that negotiated limits and cooperative activities such as changes in operational practices for nuclear weapons could reduce the risks that russias nuclear weapons might threaten the united states through an inadvertent or intentional attack during crisis furthermore some believe that formal arms control regimes and cooperation can help slow the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery others have argued that although the united states and russia should continue to reduce their nuclear weapons from high cold war levels it would not be in the us national security interest to reduce to very low numbers or to depreciate the role of nuclear weapons in maintaining us security they believe that these weapons can help deter emerging threats to the united states even if those threats longer include the possibility of global war with the soviet union furthermore they argue that continued instability and uncertainty in russia argue against drastic unilateral changes in the us nuclear force posture some also question whether there is future for formal arms control arrangements with russia because they believe the crs2 united states can pursue an independent course while economic pressures reduce the size and role of russias nuclear stockpile many also believe that the united states should take unilateral actions such as the deployment of widespread ballistic missile defenses bmd to protect itself from russia china or other nations that might be armed with ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction this report reviews several aspects of us nuclear weapons policy and force posture it begins with an overview of us nuclear posture during the cold war and summary of changes that have been adopted during the past several years it then describes current us plans as of the beginning of 2001 and policies governing the possible use of nuclear weapons the size and structure of the us nuclear arsenal and the way in which arms control agreements might alter that force structure in the near future the report then reviews some proposals offered by outside analysts as alternatives to the clinton administrations approach it does not however address possible changes that the bush administration might pursue in nuclear weapons and strategy because nuclear policy is still under review and the results have not been made public background us nuclear posture during the cold war threat assessment during the cold war the united states developed and maintained its nuclear arsenal so that it could deter and if deterrence failed defeat the soviet union more generally it sought nuclear and conventional capabilities sufficient to convince any potential aggressor that the costs of aggression would exceed any potential gains that he might achieve1 because the soviet union was the only country with nuclear arsenal that could threaten the existence of the united states us policy reflected the view that the most significant threat to us security interests remains the global challenge posed by the soviet union2 other countries such as those in soviet dominated eastern europe were included in us nuclear war plans but their presence reflected their relationship with the soviet union more than any independent threat they might pose to the united states or its allies 1 us department of defense annual report to congress fiscal year 1985 by caspar weinberger secretary of defense february 1 1984 washington 1984 p 27 2 the white house national security strategy of the united states january 1988 washington 1988 p 5 crs3 strategy doctrine and force structure3 strategy and doctrine during the 1950s and 1960s the strategies known as massive retaliation and assured destruction envisioned largescale us nuclear strike against wide variety of targets in the soviet union eastern europe and china if the soviet union or its allies initiated nuclear or largescale conventional attack against the united states or its allies4 the objective was to convince soviet leaders that the soviet union would cease to exist as functioning society if it initiated conflict against the united states or its allies but critics questioned the credibility of these policies postulating that the soviet union would not believe the united states would launch massive response against soviet military and industrial targets regardless of the size and nature of soviet aggression because the soviet union could also retaliate with nuclear weapons against us cities hence in the 1970s the united states adopted strategy of flexible response and subsequently countervailing strategy these policies emphasized retaliatory strikes on soviet military forces and warmaking capabilities as opposed to attacks on civilian and industrial targets they also called for limited focused attacks instead of largescale attacks on greater number of sites they were designed to give the president options and flexibility with respect to the timing scale and the targets of the attack so that he could respond in more selective manner after soviet attack us nuclear weapons were designed to deter not only direct nuclear attack on the united states but also nuclear chemical or conventional attack and coercion aimed at the us allies in europe and asia5 the theory underlying this doctrine of extended deterrence was that if any level of aggression against us allies could escalate into nuclear conflict that might involve attacks on the soviet union then the soviet union might be deterred from all levels of aggression the united states and its allies did not insist that they would respond to any type of attack with nuclear weapons but it sought to maintain the capability to do so and to control escalation if nuclear weapons were used consequently the united states would not forswear the option of using nuclear weapons first in conflict critics of this doctrine however questioned whether the soviet union would believe that the united states would use nuclear weapons to defend europe particularly when such defense of europe might result in soviet nuclear attack against us territory 3 the following discussion summarizes material originally presented in two

security v 14 spring 1990 5 the white house national security strategy of the united states january 1988 washington 1988 p 13 crs4 targeting in 1990 general john chain the commander in chief of the strategic command outlined us targeting strategy for nuclear weapons in testimony before congress he stated that the task is to be able to deter any possessor of nuclear weapons from attacking the united states by having postured retaliatory force significant enough to destroy what the attacker holds most dear against this macro mission target categories are designated within these target categories finite list of targets are designated and against those targets weapons are allocated these target categories reportedly included soviet strategic nuclear forces other military forces military and political leadership and industrial facilities6 the united states sought the capability to destroy thousands of sites in these target categories even if the soviet union destroyed many us weapons in first strike which created requirements for many thousands of nuclear weapons in the us arsenal force structure during the cold war the us nuclear arsenal contained many types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons including shortrange missiles and artillery for use on the battlefield mediumrange missiles and aircraft that could strike targets beyond the theater of battle short and mediumrange systems based on surface ships longrange missiles based on us territory and submarines and heavy bombers that could threaten soviet targets from their bases in the united states the longrange missiles and heavy bombers are known as strategic nuclear weapons the short and mediumrange systems are considered nonstrategic nuclear weapons and have been referred to as battlefield tactical and theater nuclear weapons nonstrategic nuclear weapons at one time in the early 1970s the united states deployed thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons at bases in europe japan and south korea but it had begun to reduce these forces by the late 1970s in part because nato officials believed they could maintain deterrence with fewer but more modern weapons7 modernization programs continued to enhance the capabilities of us nonstrategic nuclear weapons throughout the 1980s particularly through the deployment of groundlaunched cruise missiles and intermediaterange ballistic missiles in europe however by the end of that decade as the warsaw pact dissolved the united states had canceled or scaled back all planned modernization programs and pursued arms control efforts that would sharply reduce the number of weapons deployed at bases in europe and asia strategic nuclear weapons since the early 1960s the united states has maintained triad of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles which consists of land based intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms and longrange heavy bombers as the forces and doctrine developed 6 statement by john t chain jr commander in chief strategic air command and director strategic target planning before the house armed services committee march 6 1990 prepared text p 5 7 the numbers of operational us nonstrategic nuclear warheads declined from more than 7000 in the mid1970s to below 6000 in the 1980s to fewer than 1000 by the middle of the 1990s see toward nuclear peace the future of nuclear weapons in us foreign and defense policy report of the csis nuclear strategy study group washington dc center for strategic and international studies 1993 p 27 crs5 during the 1960s and 1970s many analysts noted that these different basing modes would enhance deterrence and discourage soviet first strike because they complicated soviet attack planning and ensured the survivability of significant portion of the us force in the event of soviet first strike8 the different characteristics of each weapon system might also strengthen the credibility of us targeting strategy for example icbms eventually had the accuracy and prompt responsiveness needed to attack hardened targets such as soviet command posts and icbm silos slbms had the survivability needed to complicate soviet efforts to launch disarming first strike and to retaliate if such an attack were attempted and heavy bombers could be dispersed quickly and launched to enhance their survivability and they could be recalled to their bases if crisis did not escalate into conflict as with nonstrategic nuclear weapons modernization programs continued to enhance the capabilities of us strategic nuclear weapons throughout the cold war era these programs culminated with the deployment of peacekeeper mx icbms and trident submarines and trident ii d5 slbms in the mid1980s and 1990s and with the deployment of the b2 stealth bomber in the 1990s the united states also continued to add to the numbers of its deployed strategic nuclear weapons through the end of the 1980s however by the early 1990s the numbers of warheads deployed on us strategic nuclear forces began to decline ballistic missile defenses the united states has pursued research and development on antiballistic missile abm systems since the early 1950s in the mid1960s it developed the sentinel system which would have used groundbased nucleararmed interceptor missiles to protect number of major us urban centers against soviet attack in 1969 the nixon administration renamed the system safeguard and changed its focus to deployment around icbm fields to ensure that these missiles could survive first strike and retaliate against the soviet union congress almost stopped the program in 1969 when the senate voted 5050 to approve an amendment halting construction safeguard continued however when vice president spiro agnew broke the tie with vote for the program negotiations with the soviet union on the antiballistic missile abm treaty began in november 1969 the two sides eventually agreed that each nation could deploy two abm sites one around its capital and one around an icbm field when it became clear that neither nation would complete second site the two sides agreed in 1974 protocol that each would have only one abm site the united states completed its abm site around icbm fields near grand forks north dakota it operated for short time in 1974 and 1975 then was shut down because it was not considered to be costeffective in other words the costs of operating the system even in peacetime were thought to be high relative to the limited protection it offered the facilities at that location however continue to count under the abm treaty because they have not been completely dismantled according to posttreaty 8 us department of defense annual report to congress fiscal year 1989 by frank carlucci secretary of defense february 18 1988 washington 1988 p 54 crs6 agreement reached with the soviet union russia continues to operate and modernize its abm site around moscow us research and development into abm systems especially for icbm protection continued albeit at lower budget levels through the late 1970s before rising again during the carter administration the reagan administration further increased this funding after president reagan announced an expansive effort known as the strategic defense initiative sdi to develop nonnuclear ballistic missile defenses that would protect the united states against fullscale attack from the soviet union the programs supporters envisioned largescale defensive system with thousands of land sea air and spacebased sensors and interceptors however as cost estimates and technical challenges increased the reagan administration announced that it would begin with more limited deployment of land based and spacebased sensors and interceptors that would seek to disrupt and deter an incoming attack instead of providing complete protection the bush administration further scaled back the goals for sdi stating that the united states would seek to deploy defensive system that could protect against smallscale missile attacks from the soviet union or other us adversaries both the reagan and bush administrations recognized that their ballistic missile defense programs would eventually conflict with the 1972 abm treaty neither administration officially proposed that the united states withdraw from that treaty but both initiated discussions with the soviet union and russia in an effort to modify or replace the abm treaty with an agreement that would permit the more widespread deployment of ballistic missile defenses neither succeeded and at the end of the bush administration the 1972 abm treaty continued to affect planning for the deployment of defenses against longrange strategic ballistic missiles arms control during the cold war us and soviet arms control negotiations were often seen as barometer of ussoviet relations at times they were one of the few venues for regular meetings between the two sides the united states and soviet union signed three strategic nuclear arms control agreements during the 1970s these included the 1972 antiballistic missile abm treaty and interim agreement on offensive forces known as salt i for strategic arms limitation talks and the 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty salt ii which was never ratified many supporters hoped that the abm treaty would help contain the arms race in offensive weapons because without widespread defenses neither side would need to expand its offensive force structure to saturate or overcome the defenses of the other side the complementary interim agreement on offensive arms sought to freeze the number of offensive missile launchers on each side until the parties could complete formal treaty that would achieve this objective the salt ii treaty would have imposed small reductions in the numbers of missile launchers but it never entered into force9 9 after the soviet union invaded afghanistan in 1980 president carter withdrew the treaty from senate consideration however it is likely that the senate would have failed to consent to the treatys ratification anyway because many members had raised concerns about the continued crs7 furthermore because the interim agreement and salt ii treaties only limited the numbers of missile launchers and heavy bombers both sides could increase the number of warheads carried on their offensive forces by deploying missiles with multiple warheads mirved missiles instead of singlewarhead missiles consequently although many analysts believed that arms control could help stabilize the nuclear balance between the united states and soviet union most agreed that it had done little to slow the arms race between the two powers by the end of the 1970s however as the cold war drew to close in the late 1980s the united states and soviet union began to sign arms control agreements that would reduce their force levels10 the 1987 intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty eliminated all us and soviet shorterrange mediumrange and intermediaterange ballistic and cruise missiles the first strategic arms reduction treaty start i which was signed in july 1991 limits each side to 6000 accountable warheads on at most 1600 strategic offensive delivery vehicles icbms slbms and heavy bombers this would reduce the numbers of warheads deployed on us and soviet strategic offensive forces by about onethird from their highest levels during the cold war after the soviet union disbanded ukraine kazakhstan belarus and russia became parties to start i and all except russia agreed to eliminate all of the nuclear weapons on their territories this treaty entered into force in december 1994 and implementation will continue through 2001 finally after the demise of the soviet union the united states and russia signed the start ii treaty in january 1993 this treaty would limit each side to 3500 warheads on strategic offensive forces while the us senate approved ratification of start ii in january 1996 it has not yet entered into force because the russian parliament has not yet acted on the treaty us nuclear posture after the cold war both the first bush and clinton administrations modified somewhat the us nuclear posture in response to the collapse of the warsaw pact demise of the soviet union and changing international security environment these changes recognized not only the reduced risks of global conflict with the soviet union or russia but also the increased risks posed by other nations that might acquire weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles this section summarizes some of the changes that have occurred in the past ten years threat assessment in its 1995 national security strategy report the clinton administration states that the dissolution of the soviet empire has radically transformed the security environment facing the united states and our allies the primary security imperative 9 continued provisions in the treaty and soviet behavior around the world 10 for details on the provisions in these treaties see arms control and nonproliferation activities catalog of recent events amy f woolf coordinator crs report 30033 january 4 1999 crs8 of the past half century containing communist expansion while preventing nuclear war is gone11 the administration did however determine that russia remained concern for us national security not because its intentions are hostile but because it controls the only nuclear arsenal that can physically threaten the survivability of us nuclear forces significant shift in the russian government into the hands of archconservatives could restore the strategic nuclear threat to the united states literally overnight in 1997 the administration noted that russia maintains large and modern arsenal of strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons it further argued that this arsenal would remain formidable even if start ii entered into force and produced reductions to 3500 warheads on each side12 additionally the clinton administration identified other pressing threats to us national security in its national security strategy report for 1998 the administration noted that number of states still have the capabilities and the desire to threaten our vital interests and that in many cases these states are also actively improving their offensive capabilities including efforts to obtain or retain nuclear biological or chemical weapons and in some cases longrange delivery systems the report went on to declare that weapons of mass destruction pose the greatest potential threat to global stability and security proliferation of advanced weapons and technologies threatens to provide rogue states terrorists and international crime organizations the means to inflict terrible damage on the united states its allies and us citizens and troops abroad13 russia also remained focus of concern with this type of threat as potential supplier of materials technologies and knowhow that other nations might use in their efforts to produce their own nuclear chemical and biological weapons and longrange missiles strategy doctrine and force structure strategy and doctrine throughout the 1990s the clinton administration argued that nuclear weapons remained important to deter the range of threats faced by the united states secretary of defense perry outlined this view in his annual report for 1995 noting that recent international upheavals have not changed the calculation that nuclear weapons remain an essential part of american military power concepts of deterrence continue to be central to the us nuclear posture thus the united states will continue to threaten retaliation including nuclear retaliation to deter aggression against the united states us forces and allies14 more recently the clinton administration argued that the united states must continue to maintain robust triad of strategic forces sufficient to deter any hostile foreign leadership with access to nuclear forces and to convince it that seeking nuclear 11 national security strategy of engagement and enlargement the white house february 1995 washington dc p 1 12 us department of defense annual report to

department of defense annual report to the president and congress by secretary of defense william perry washington dc february 1995 p 84 crs9 advantage would be futile this is because nuclear weapons serve as hedge against an uncertain future guarantee of our security commitments to allies and disincentive to those who would contemplate developing or otherwise acquiring their own nuclear weapons15 the clinton administration did however issue new guidelines for us nuclear strategy in late 1997 these guidelines stated that our military planning for the possible employment of nuclear weapons is focused on deterring nuclear war rather than attempting to fight and win protracted nuclear exchange but the united states would continue to emphasize the survivability of the nuclear systems and infrastructure necessary to endure preemptive attack and still respond at overwhelming levels16 details about these changes and reactions from analysts outside government are discussed in more detail below nato has also altered its nuclear strategy to reflect the demise of the soviet union and warsaw pact in 1991 nato declared that it longer maintains nuclear weapons to deter or defeat conventional attack launched by soviet and warsaw pact forces because the threat of simultaneous fullscale attack on all of natos european fronts has effectively been removed17 and according to nato documents nuclear weapons play far smaller role in alliance strategy than they did during the cold war nevertheless the nato allies have reaffirmed the importance of nuclear weapons for deterrence the new strategic concept signed in april 1999 states that to protect peace and to prevent war or any kind of coercion the alliance will maintain for the foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces nuclear weapons make unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the alliance incalculable and unacceptable furthermore nuclear weapons ensure uncertainty in the mind of any aggressor about the nature of the allies response to military aggression they demonstrate that aggression of any kind is not rational option18 targeting strategy in the past decade the department of defense has conducted several studies that reviewed us nuclear targeting strategy and weapons employment policy according to published reports these reviews have revised and greatly reduced the length of the target list but the basic tenets remain the same according to the washington post the united states primary nuclear war plan still targets russia and provides the president an option for counterattack within 30 minutes of confirmed enemy launch19 the clinton administration reportedly 15 national security strategy for new century the white house october 1998 washington dc

thousands of targets out of the continued crs10 compiled the results of the early studies when it altered the official guidance for nuclear targeting strategy and employment policy in presidential decision directive pdd60 clinton administration officials noted that the change in strategy from seeking to win protracted nuclear war to seeking to deter nuclear war would permit the united states to reduce its forces to 20002500 deployed warheads the levels under consideration for start iii treaty but they also noted that this did not indicate any change in the structure of us nuclear war plans or in the variety of options available to the president for us retaliatory strike force structure during the 1990s the united states has reduced both the numbers and types of weapons in its nuclear arsenal some of these changes reflect the imposition of negotiated arms control limits others reflect changes in us objectives and nuclear force posture the latter is particularly true for changes that have occurred in us nonstrategic nuclear forces nonstrategic nuclear forces on september 27 1991 president george bush announced that the united states would withdraw all landbased tactical nuclear weapons those that could travel less than 300 miles from overseas bases and all sea based tactical nuclear weapons from us surface ships submarines and naval aircraft20 these initiatives affected more than 2500 nuclear warheads that had been deployed on shorter range delivery systems21 furthermore in late 1991 nato decided to reduce by about half the number of weapons for nuclearcapable aircraft based in europe which led to the withdrawal of an additional 700 us airdelivered nuclear weapons the united states currently maintains an estimated 1000 warheads for its active stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons22 this number includes around 500 airdelivered weapons that may still be stored at bases in europe the remainder are airdelivered weapons and around 350 nucleararmed sealaunched cruise missiles that are stored at facilities in the united states strategic nuclear forces the united states continues to maintain triad of strategic nuclear forces with warheads deployed on landbased icbms submarine launched slbms and heavy bombers according to the department of defense this 19 continued siop single integrated operational plan helping to reduce it from its cold war peak of more than 40000 to about 10000 by 1991 in addition general butler reviewed each target one byone tossing many out one day he eliminated 1000 targets in newly liberated eastern europe by 1994 general butler had helped to pare the siop to 2500 targets see ottaway david b and steve coll trying to unplug the war machine washington post april 12 1995 p a28 20 these steps were not contingent on reciprocal actions by the soviet union but on october 5 1991 soviet president gorbachev announced similar set of initiatives 21 the united states maintained the capability to return seabased nuclear weapons to aircraft carriers and submarines in 1994 the department of defense nuclear posture review recommended that the united states longer maintain that capability on aircraft carriers although it still could return nucleararmed cruise missiles to attack submarines 22 nrdc nuclear notebook us nuclear weapons stockpile july 1998 bulletin of the atomic scientists v

problems in any single delivery system during the past 10 years the number of warheads deployed on these strategic nuclear forces has declined from cold war high of around 12000 warheads to fewer than 9000 warheads most of this reduction has occurred through the implementation of the first strategic arms reduction treaty start i at the same time though the improving relationship between the united states and soviet union in the late 1980s eased pressures to pursue some strategic force modernization programs while declining defense budgets in the united states in the early 1990s contributed to decisions to scale back nuclear programs the united states is currently reducing its forces to start i levels as the table below demonstrates these reductions will leave the united states with 18

these rules attribute specified number of warheads to each type of delivery vehicle in some cases the warheads attributed by counting rules do not equal the actual number of warheads carried by specified missile or bomber the start rules also count the warheads on delivery vehicles until the delivery vehicles are dismantled according to provisions in the treaty even if the warheads have been removed and the delivery vehicles have been deactivated as result these data may not represent the actual number of operational warheads in the us strategic arsenal 24 the us senate approved ratification of start ii in january 1996 and the russian parliament did so in april 2000 but the treaty has not yet entered into force crs13 reductions in us strategic nuclear forces the navy would like to retire 4 of the trident submarines so that it does not have to bear the costs of refueling their reactors and modifying them to carry the newer trident ii d5 ballistic missiles ballistic missile defenses the clinton administration restructured the bmd programs it inherited from the bush administration to emphasize theater missile defense development and deployment efforts and to focus national missile defense nmd efforts on technology development according to secretary of defense aspin these changes reflected an assessment that the regional ballistic missile threat already existed while ballistic missile threat to the united states other than the long standing threats from russia and china might emerge only in the future in 1996 the clinton administration adopted new policy the 33 strategy to guide nmd development and potential deployment under this strategy the united states would develop an nmd system that would be designed to defend the united states against attacks from small numbers of longrange ballistic missiles launched by hostile nations or perhaps from an accidental or unauthorized launch of russian or chinese missiles the 33 strategy envisioned continued development of nmd technologies during the first 3 years 19972000 followed by deployment decision in 2000 if the system were technologically feasible and warranted by prospective threats if decision to deploy an nmd system were made the plan then was to deploy it within the second three year period 20002003 the administration stated that development and deployment would be conducted within the limits of the abm treaty the administration modified its 33 strategy in january 1999 first it added 66 billion for nmd to the fy 19992005 fydp and brought total nmd funding for the fydp to 105 billion the administration emphasized that an nmd deployment decision still would not be made until june 2000 but that now there was money in the fydp to protect and pursue the deployment option in the event deployment decision was made in addition the administration announced that it had restructured the nmd program for possible deployment date of 2005 rather than 2003 this change was made according to the pentagon to reduce the amount of risk in the program and to maximize its success according to bmdo the new schedule allowed more manageable test program and would defer key decisions until actual nmd tests were completed in addition the administration acknowledged that it would have to approach the russians with proposals for amendments to the abm treaty that would permit the deployment of an effective although limited nmd system however after test failure in july 2000 president clinton announced on september 1 2000 that he would not authorize the deployment of an nmd system and would instead leave the decision to his successor on may 1 2001 president bush underscored his administrations commitment to deploy more robust missile defense system than the one considered by the clinton administration the president stated that the world had changed that the united states faced new threats and that it could longer rely on the cold warera doctrine of nuclear deterrence to safeguard its national security he stated that we need new concepts of deterrence that rely on both offensive and defensive forces he did not outline specific missile defense architecture but he indicated that we can draw on already established technologies that might involve landbased and sea crs14 based capabilities to intercept missiles in midcourse or after they reenter the atmosphere arms control the clinton administration sought to advance the arms control process that it inherited from previous administrations for example it negotiated the protocol that named ukraine belarus kazakhstan and russia as parties to start i and trilateral agreement with russia and ukraine that led to ukraines agreement to return the nuclear warheads on its territory to russia these efforts resulted in the december 1994 ratification of start i the clinton administration has also pressed for the ratification of start ii which was signed in the waning days of the bush administration the us senate gave its advice and consent to start ii ratification in january 1996 the russian parliament approved the treaty on april 14 2000 but it russia will not exchange the instruments of ratification until the united states approves several agreements signed in 1997 these include protocol to start ii signed in september 1997 that would extend the elimination period in the treaty the two sides also established framework for start iii which they would begin negotiations on after start ii entered into force these efforts sought to address some of the concerns expressed in the russian parliament about start ii in the hope that they would ease ratification25 the clinton administration did not however proposed any steps that would reduce us and russian strategic nuclear forces below start ii levels in the absence of formal treaty president bush has stated that he would explore this alternative in his administration therefore it is likely that the bush administration would not pursue the arms control agenda described here the clinton administration also pursued negotiations with russia to modify and clarify the 1972 abm treaty in 1997 these negotiations produced memorandum of understanding on succession which named russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan as successors to the soviet union for the abm treaty and two agreed statements on demarcation to set out dividing line between strategic ballistic missile defense systems which are limited by the abm treaty and theater ballistic missile defense systems which are not limited by the abm treaty 26 the administration has agreed to submit these documents to the senate as amendments to the abm treaty but it will not do so until the russian parliament approves the ratification of start ii the clinton administration has also conducted discussions with the russians about possible amendments to the abm treaty that would be needed for the united states to deploy national missile defense system the bush administration may not pursue these discussions as the president has said that the united states must move beyond the limits in the abm treaty to deploy effective missile defenses 25 for details see us library of congress

republics with assistance in storing transporting and dismantling many of the nuclear weapons and facilities inherited from the soviet union many of these efforts occur under the auspices of the department of defenses nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction ctr program 27 congress created this program in late 1991 in response to concerns about the potential loss of control over weapons as the soviet union disintegrated and it has authorized around 400 million per year for this effort parallel effort run by the department of energy seeks to buy nuclear materials in the former soviet union and to dissuade scientists and engineers who worked in the soviet nuclear complex from selling their knowledge and skills to other nations seeking nuclear weapons although these efforts are not enunciated in formal treaties between the united states and russia many observers consider them to be an integral part of the arms control and threat reduction process alternative futures for us nuclear force posture when discussing and debating the future of us nuclear weapons many government officials and outside analysts offer similar views on the threats that the united states is likely to face in the coming years they do not however agree on the role that nuclear weapons or other measures such as missile defense or arms control should play in responding to that threat threat assessment russia the clinton administration stated that russia longer poses global threat to the united states and us interests but it remained concerned that russia might one day return to such posture for example in testimony before the senate armed services committee assistant secretary of defense edward warner argued that stable transition in russia is by means assured and that the united states must hedge against the possibility that russia which continues to maintain formidable nuclear arsenal consisting of thousands of deliverable strategic and tactical warheads could reemerge at some time in the future as threat to the west28 many analysts agree that the united states should continue to view russias nuclear arsenal as threat to the united states conservative analysts tend to focus on the potential for renewed threat from weapons in conflict with the united states or other nations recent report published by the national defense university ndu argued that the main threat from russia stems from the fact that it still possesses thousands of nuclear weapons furthermore the authors note that russia has increased its reliance on nuclear weapons to compensate for weaknesses

the honorable edward l warner iii assistant secretary of defense for strategy and threat reduction before the senate armed services subcommittee on strategic forces april 14 1999 crs16 conventional forces29 many analysts from both conservative and liberal organizations have also focused on the threat that these weapons might pose if russia were to lose control over them either because of political instability or because of weaknesses in russias nuclear weapons command and control system furthermore most agree that weaknesses in russias early warning system for ballistic missile attack could lead to situation in which russian leaders launched retaliatory strike in response to ambiguous or incomplete information30 many also note that russia poses significant threat as source of technology and materials for other nations seeking their own ballistic missiles or weapons of mass destruction china the clinton administration did not consider china to pose direct threat to the united states as regional or global adversary nevertheless in his testimony before the senate armed services committee assistant secretary warner noted that although china has much smaller nuclear force than russias it is still formidable he also stated that china continues to make steady efforts to modernize those forces and that the united states cannot be sure that it would not need nuclear weapons to deter china in the future many conservative analysts have expressed stronger concerns about the potential threat from china for example the ndu report argues that china has the resources and skills to expand its nuclear capability and to pose greater threat to the us in the future furthermore china may want to deter us intervention in regional crises in asia while the united states may want to deter chinese military action in those crises31 the authors of this report argue that both nations might find nuclear weapons to be useful under these circumstances others however believe that although china may challenge the united states in regional crises in asia nuclear weapons will not play large role in that strategy they argue that chinas nuclear arsenal will remain far smaller than the us arsenal so us nuclear forces could deter chinese nuclear threats furthermore they argue that the united states should seek to include china in arms reduction negotiations if the united states were to reduce its forces to levels close to those deployed by china weapons proliferation the clinton administration stated that weapons of mass destruction pose the greatest potential threat to global stability and security and that the proliferation of these advanced weapons and technologies threatens to provide rogue states terrorists and international crime organizations the means to inflict terrible damage on the united states its allies and us citizens and troops 29 us nuclear policy in the 21st century fresh look at national strategy and requirements center for

such as iran iraq and north korea who may be armed with these weapons they disagree however on the role that us nuclear weapons should play in deterring or responding to this threat strategy doctrine and force structure strategy and doctrine clinton administration officials stated that nuclear weapons would continue to play an important role in us national security strategy even though that role has diminished since the end of the cold war specifically in press accounts that followed the completion of pdd60 in late 1997 robert bell the director for defense policy and arms control at the national security council nsc stated that it would be mistake to think that nuclear weapons longer matter such weapons are still needed to deter aggression and coercion by threatening response that would be certain and overwhelming and devastating33 deterrence and russia as noted above pdd60 scaled back the us objectives for nuclear deterrence with russia instead of maintaining force posture that would allow it to fight and win nuclear war with russia the united states would maintain force posture to deter conflict with russia in practice this change probably meant that the united states would not seek to cause as much damage against as wide range of targets as it had planned on attacking in previous war plans this change reflected new international security environment and helped to reduce the required number of nuclear weapons in the us arsenal administration officials noted that this change was intended in part to accommodate the lower force levels projected for start iii treaty 34 many analysts outside government praised the emphasis on deterrence in us nuclear strategy they noted that the goal of fighting and winning nuclear war had never been credible and that the lesser objectives were more in line with political reality since the demise of the soviet union35 however some liberal analysts had hoped for more fundamental changes arguing that with the end of the cold war the united states could pursue relationship with russia in which nuclear deterrence and mutual assured destruction would longer play central role36 in contrast some conservative analysts did not like the change in focus away from protracted war 32 national security strategy for new century the white house october 1998 washington dc p 6 33 smith r jeffrey clinton directive changes strategy

forces37 deterrence and weapons of mass destruction many press reports about pdd60 highlighted the documents provisions covering the use of us nuclear weapons to deter nations other than russia with weapons of mass destruction most reporters viewed this as an expansion of the role of us nuclear weapons however the united states has always maintained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks with conventional chemical or biological weapons during the cold war this option was generally directed towards the soviet union and warsaw pact nations and reflected natos strategy of flexible response on the other hand the united states has made the political commitment through its negative security assurance issued in conjunction with the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt not to threaten or attack with nuclear weapons nonnuclear weapons states that are parties to the npt nonetheless the united states has explicitly refused to adopt strict nofirst use policy for nuclear weapons and pdd60 apparently continued this policy robert bell reportedly stated that pdd60 reaffirmed the us negative security assurance but he also said that the united states reserved the right to use nuclear weapons first if state is not state in good standing under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt or an equivalent international convention38 and he reportedly stated that pdd60 repeated earlier administration statements that any nation might forfeit its protections under the negative security assurance if it attacked the united states or us forces with weapons of mass destruction wmd39 several clinton administration officials addressed this issue former secretary of defense william perry stated that the united states would not specify how it would respond to wmd use but an aggressor could be certain that the us response would be both overwhelming and devastating assistant secretary of defense edward warner testified that the us capability to deliver an overwhelming rapid and devastating military response with the full range of military capabilities will remain the cornerstone of our strategy for deterring rogue nation ballistic missile and wmd proliferation threats the very existence of us strategic and theater nuclear forces backed by highly capable conventional forces should certainly give pause to any rogue leader contemplating the use of wmd against the united states its overseas deployed forces or its allies40 hence the united states will neither forswear the use 37 landay jonathan s us downsizes its nuclearweapon ambitions christian science

for strategy and threat reduction before the senate armed services subcommittee on strategic continued crs19 of nuclear weapons in response to conventional chemical or biological attack nor will it specify that it would use nuclear weapons under these circumstances this policy of studied ambiguity about the possible first use of nuclear weapons has brought comments and criticisms from many analysts some have offered general support for the policy as long as the united states maintains credible nuclear deterrent so that it could respond to wmd attacks with nuclear weapons if it chose to do so for example the ndu study notes that the current policy attempts to make clear that state can plan on the use of chemical or biological weapons without having to take into account the possibility of nuclear response this would not only deter wmd use during crisis but might also deter the acquisition of chemical or biological weapons because nation would not want to risk us nuclear response if it ever used its stocks the ndu study noted however that in some cases this ambiguity might be viewed as lack of commitment by the united states and may need to be replaced by greater clarity in the deterrent threat41 others have also argued that the united states should explicitly threaten nuclear retaliation for wmd use and particularly biological weapons attacks since these can produce casualties on the same scale as nuclear weapons42 one such analyst david c gompert has stated that the current ambiguity dulls deterrence he believes that the united states should warn explicitly both that it might respond with nuclear weapons to wmd attacks against us interests and that it would not use nuclear weapons except in response to wmd attacks this policy would make it clear to rogue states that biological weapons cannot be used and possessing them could endanger their possessors because they could cause nuclear response43 many other analysts argue the exact opposite position they believe that the united states should restrict nuclear weapons to the core objective of deterring nuclear attack on the united states and explicitly forswear the use of nuclear weapons for any other reason according to this school of thought if the united states threatens to retaliate for conventional chemical or biological attacks with nuclear weapons it is increasing the value of nuclear weapons and demonstrating that they have military utility this would undermine nuclear nonproliferation efforts and encourage other countries to acquire their own nuclear weapons to deter chemical or biological weapons44 some also argue that such policy is not credible because 40 continued forces april 14 1999 41 us nuclear policy in the 21st century fresh look at national

president january 26 1999 see continued crs20 president would authorize the use of us nuclear weapons unless he was faced with nuclear attack on us territory furthermore many analysts have argued that the united states does not need nuclear weapons to deter chemical or biological weapons attacks because its conventional capabilities far exceed those of any other nation and it could promise severe retaliation with those weapons alone45 some analysts who support the use of nuclear weapons to deter chemical and biological weapons have disputed several points raised by those who argue against this policy they note first that us conventional forces might not be sufficient to deter chemical or biological attacks during conflict because these forces might already be fully engaged with the adversary the threat to use chemical or biological weapons would be an effort to blunt the magnitude of us conventional capabilities and it would take the threat of further escalation to nuclear weapons to deter such an attack46 these analysts also dispute the contention that us policy will influence other nations to seek their own nuclear weapons they note that there is little evidence us nuclear weapons or policies regarding their potential use have influenced the decisions of those countries that have pursued weapons of mass destruction instead nations look to their own security environments and regional positions to determine their military and force structure requirements47 targeting strategy and employment policy according to press reports and clinton administration statements pdd60 did not alter the basic structure of us nuclear targeting and employment policy the united states has retained the options in its war plan known as the siop the single integrated operational plan to launch nuclear strikes against range of military targets nuclear forces and civilian leadership sites in russia furthermore according to robert bell pdd60 did not alter the requirement that target planners offer the president various nuclear attack options from limited attacks involving small numbers of weapons to major attacks involving thousands of warheads48 the

statements and press reports also indicate that pdd60 did not alter the us policy of maintaining the capability to launch its nuclear weapons after receiving indications that an attack on the united states was underway but before incoming warheads detonate49 however administration officials have stated that the united states does not rely on this ability to launch promptly as its only option it could also wait until detonations had occurred then launch its retaliatory strike at later time according to robert bell we direct our military forces to continue to posture themselves in such way as to not rely on launch on warning to be able to absorb nuclear strike and still have enough force surviving to constitute credible deterrence our policy is to confirm that we are under nuclear attack with actual detonations before retaliating50 this element of us nuclear weapons employment policy has caused some confusion and misinterpretations some conservative analysts understood robert bells statement to mean that pdd60 had eliminated the option for the president to launch nuclear weapons before an attack had reached us soil and that the united states would only retaliate after significant portion of its forces and possibly its command and control structure had been destroyed or seriously degraded but this interpretation was not correct according to robert bell pdd60 did not change the us policy with respect to launch on warning so some of the options available in us plans included weapons that would be available if the united states launched its forces before any were destroyed and some included only those weapons that would survive if the united states absorbed first strike from an adversary before initiating its response and the decision on whether to launch us weapons promptly or to wait for detonations on us soil would be left to the national command authority at the time of the crisis many other analysts criticized pdd60 precisely because it did not eliminate options for the united states to launch its nuclear weapons on warning of an attack before detonations actually occur some argue that the united states does not need to maintain these options because it has sufficient number of warheads on ballistic missile submarines that could survive and retaliate after an initial attack51 others have argued that the continued high level of nuclear readiness threatens to lead to the use of nuclear weapons by technical failure human error or unauthorized launch52 furthermore some believe that such posture is highly destabilizing because

nuclear weapons on very high states of alert but they argue with growing weaknesses in russias early warning network of satellites and sensors these high states of alert could lead to false warnings of attack and high risks of inadvertent nuclear strikes hence if both nations postured their forces so that they could not be launched promptly on warning of an attack then the risk of nuclear war by accident would diminish sharply force structure as was noted above the united states is currently reducing the number of warheads deployed on its strategic offensive nuclear forces to comply with the 1991 start i treaty it has also identified the numbers and types of delivery vehicles it would deploy under the 1993 start ii treaty however because that treaty has not yet entered into force congress has mandated that the administration retain forces at start i levels in recent dod authorization bills it has precluded the use of dod funds to begin the dismantlement of weapons systems that would bring the united states below start i force levels this means that dod cannot begin to dismantle the 50 peacekeeper icbms or 4 trident submarines that would be removed from the fleet when the united states moves from start i to start ii force levels for several years the clinton administration did not object to this legislation many in congress and the pentagon agreed that by keeping its forces at start i levels the united states could provide the russian parliament with an incentive to approve start ii most experts agree that russia cannot afford to maintain its forces even at start i levels and that it will have fewer than 2000 deployed warheads in the coming years regardless of arms control limits many officials in both the united states and russia have noted that russia can only retain parity with the united states if the united states also reduces its forces hence because us law mandates that the united states cannot reduce its forces until start ii enters into force many believed it would provide the duma with an incentive to approve start ii and move to deeper reductions in prospective start iii treaty the administration did however request that congress eliminate this mandate in the fy2000 defense authorization bill because of budgetary implications in testimony before the senate armed services committee assistant secretary of defense edward warner noted that dod had added 51 million to its budget in fy2000 to continue peacekeeper operations and to protect the option of refueling the extra 4 trident submarines and fitting them with the new trident ii missiles dod would need an additional 100 million per year for the next 3 years and 170 million per year after 2003 to maintain and operate the peacekeeper missiles furthermore dod would need an additional 56 billion between fiscal years 2000 and 2005 to refuel the 4 extra trident submarines to refit them so that they could carry the newer trident ii missiles and to purchase additional missiles for these 4 submarines53 consequently the administration asked congress to eliminate the language requiring the united states to maintain 18 trident submarines because all 14 remaining submarines would carry the new trident ii missiles dod officials argue that the 53 statement of the honorable edward l warner iii assistant secretary of defense for strategy and threat reduction before the senate armed services subcommittee on strategic forces april 14 1999 crs23 smaller fleet would be more modern and capable force furthermore secretary of defense cohen has stated that even with fewer trident submarines the united states could still deploy close to the 6000 warheads permitted under start i54 several members of congress supported the administrations effort to eliminate the congressional mandate on strategic nuclear weapons for example senator carl levin noted that we should not spend the billion plus dollars year that will be needed to maintain start i levels unless there is military need to do so55 senator robert smith the chairman of the subcommittee on strategic forces also noted that there might be more affordable ways to maintain modern and robust strategic triad however he stated that he firmly believes we should not unilaterally implement start ii56 senator robert kerrey sponsored an amendment to the fy2000 defense authorization bill that would have eliminated any language mandating specific nuclear weapons force structure but it failed to pass instead the senate approved language that would permit the united states to reduce its trident fleet from 18 to 14 submarines the house approved more restrictive language but accepted compromise similar to the senate language in the conference report on the fy2000 defense authorization bill the clinton administration sought again to have congress remove the restrictive language from the fy2001 defense authorization bill congress again refused to lift the restrictions the senate in its version of the bill did provide that the next president could reduce us forces below start i levels after conducting new nuclear posture review to determine how many weapons the united states needed in its arsenal the conference committee however removed this provision from the final legislation congress is likely to address this provision again in the fy2001 defense authorization bill because president bush has stated that he would like to reduce us nuclear forces to the lowest levels possible without formal arms control agreements and because the administration is unlikely to press for start ii to enter into force many expect that the house and senate will agree to remove the prohibition some conservative analysts believe that the united states should maintain all 18 trident submarines for the indefinite future because these are the most survivable and flexible element of the us triad57 because the older trident i missiles are nearing 54 us senate committee on armed

this force structure would require additional funding to modify 8 rather than 4 submarines so that all could carry the newer trident ii missile some liberal analysts however believe that congress should not mandate any particular force level and that the united states should reduce its trident fleet to 14 or fewer submarines in the near future they argue that the united states can maintain deterrence with just few submarines on station and that current plans for seabased warheads are excessive in the postcold war era58 forces into the future according to press reports pdd60 concluded that even as the united states reduces its forces to start iii levels of 20002500 warheads it will maintain triad of icbms slbms and heavy bombers the clinton administration believed that such force mix would enhance deterrence by complicating an adversarys attack and defense planning and that such mix can help hedge against system failures in other legs of the triad the clinton administration also pledged to address perceived problems with the personnel and infrastructure needed to maintain and modernize the us nuclear arsenal in late 1998 the defense science board task force on nuclear deterrence reportedly urged the clinton administration to improve us nuclear forces for decades to come in face of russias large arsenal and growing chinese strategic force the panel outlined concerns about the numbers of personnel with nuclear weapons expertise who were leaving government and the military the closure of production facilities reduction in nuclearrelated military exercises and the absence of new weapons production furthermore it noted that the department of defense had longterm planning mechanism or management plan for how it would maintain those forces into the future59 deputy secretary of defense john hamre reportedly responded to this report by setting up the nuclear mission management plan which would outline requirements for the us nuclear weapons stockpile the necessary contractor industrial base and support infrastructure and the critical skills and training needed by personnel responsible for nuclear weapons policy and operations the plan will also outline the programs that the services and the defense agencies will use to sustain and modernize us nuclear forces in testimony before the senate subcommittee on strategic forces admiral richard mies the commander in chief of the strategic command stratcom noted that dod was working to maintain an infrastructure that could support us strategic nuclear forces into the future and to ensure that the services had the personnel with the training support and commitment needed to meet the unique standards of performance required by nuclear weapons60 57 continued 1999 p 22 58 retired admiral eugene

maintain the us nuclear triad noting that the triad can continue to offer hedge against technical problems to offer variety of basing modes to complicate attack and to allow the united states to tailor its deterrent threats to meet the circumstances furthermore they believe that the triad provides the united states with the flexibility needed to respond to changing postures of nuclear adversaries and to variety of threats from regional adversaries however some have been critical of dods efforts to sustain and modernize that force they have noted that there is little seniorlevel involvement in dod in planning for nuclear forces and center of expertise for nuclear policy issues61 they have argued for more funding and planning so that the united states will have the people and resources it needs to maintain its nuclear arsenal for the foreseeable future some analysts however believe that the clinton administrations insistence on maintaining triad of delivery systems demonstrated an attachment to cold war thinking and planning they note that the requirement for such diverse systems derives from the us plans to attack wide range of targets in russia if conflict occurred yet they believe that this method of planning for deterrence is both excessive and unnecessary given current political and economic conditions in russia they note that many of the military and industrial facilities that the united states would attack are already close to collapse and that far smaller nuclear force could undermine the already shaky foundation of russias economy furthermore they contend that if the united states insists on maintaining large and diverse force of nuclear weapons russia will do the same which only adds to the threat that the united states might face in addition many liberal analysts believe that this old style of thinking about nuclear weapons exists because many of the same analysts and experts who planned for the use of nuclear weapons during the cold war remain in positions of authority in dod now they believe that us nuclear policy will not change until dod loses more of this old expertise ballistic missile defenses as noted above the clinton administration outlined its strategy for the development and deployment of national missile defenses nmd in january 1999 but decided in september 2000 to delay decision on deployment until the next administration in january 1999 the administration emphasized that it had restructured the nmd program for possible deployment date of 2005 rather than 2003 this has now slipped until 2006 or 2007 secretary cohen acknowledged that the threat from longrange ballistic missiles in rogue nations appeared to be developing more quickly than the administration had anticipated but he also stated that this would not be the only factor in the administrations decision on whether to deploy an nmd system other factors include the status of the technology that would be used in the nmd system the expected costs of the system and the status of arms 60 continued so that new members of the service look to careers in other areas of the us military see the testimony of admiral richard mies in us

russia to amend the treatys ban on nationwide defenses and to alter the treatys limit of one site located around an icbm field or the nations capital these changes are designed to permit the united states to deploy single abm site in alaska to protect the entire nation from missile launches originating in north korea china or other rogue nations in the second phase the united states would seek russias agreement to deploy additional sites and more than 200 interceptor missiles it would also seek changes to the treatys restrictions on sensors and spacebased abm components along with possible changes in the ban on seabased abm components 62 russia however has been unwilling to discuss any changes to the abm treaty and apparently believed that it could dissuade the clinton administration if it did not agree to amend the treaty many in congress disagreed with the clinton administrations nmd strategy some argued that the threat from uncertainties in russia and missiles in rogue nations exists now some also argued that the united states may have too little warning of new threats to respond with the deployment of missile defense system and some argued that the clinton administration has placed the abm treaty above us national security maintaining it at all costs in spite of the demise of the soviet union consequently many have been particularly critical of the administrations nmd deployment schedule believing system could and should be fielded much sooner than 2005 in june 1999 congress passed legislation hr 4 that states it is the policy of the united states to deploy national missile defenses as soon as the technology is ready the clinton administration and democrats in congress dropped their opposition to this bill after the senate added amendments stating that it is us policy to continue to negotiate with russia on reductions in offensive nuclear weapons and that nmd programs remained subject to annual authorization and appropriations for funding the clinton administration interpreted these amendments to mean that congress supports negotiations with russia on offensive force reductions to the extent that it would not want nmd deployment plans to interfere with these reductions and that the united states has not made final decision on nmd deployment because congress must still approve the funds for this effort on an annual basis many conservative analysts agree with those in congress and those in the new bush administration who believe that the united states should move to nmd deployment quickly even if it means abandoning the abm treaty or upsetting offensive force negotiations with russia they argue that the united states may not be able to rely on nuclear deterrence to dissuade some adversaries from attacking the united states with longrange ballistic missiles and that the united states should place 62 graham bradley us to go slowly on treaty quick abm overhaul rejected by clinton washington post september 8 1999 p a13 crs27 more emphasis on deterrence by denial through defense63 they argue that some nations may see missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction as an asymmetrical threat to the united states and that they might try to employ blackmail or threats to convince the united states to stand aside during regional conflict if it could defend against longrange missile attacks the united states could stand up to these threats others argue that deterrence even with russia is unproven and could fail because nations may not understand that the united states would retaliate with overwhelming force or nuclear weapons if they attacked us territory with ballistic missiles therefore the united states should be prepared to deal with adversaries who do not recognize or do not fear the potential of retaliatory strike from the united states some members of congress and liberal analysts argue that the united states does not need national missile defense to address the threat of missile attack from rogue nations some believe that the united states will not be able to develop and deploy costeffective nmd because of daunting technical challenges and certain high costs that would be associated with such complex system others argue that rogue nations with weapons of mass destruction could attack the united states with lower cost and less obvious means than ballistic missiles or that they could deploy countermeasures or penetration aids to defeat us missile defenses these analysts note that bmd system would do nothing to stop cargo ships or other unconventional or simpler means of delivery furthermore some argue that efforts to amend the abm treaty with russia could further erode support in russia for the start ii treaty and could provide russia with an incentive to build up its offensive nuclear forces those who believe that the united states should not deploy nmd in the near future often choose to address emerging ballistic missile threats with combination of diplomatic arms control and nonproliferation tools they believe that cooperative methods those that combine economic political and military incentives could help persuade nations not to pursue missile technologies or sell them to countries of concern and they argue that strong international nonproliferation regime could bring more pressure to bear on rogue nations than us nmd64 and if cooperative methods are less than successful many note that the united states could still deter missile attacks from rogue nations with its overwhelming military superiority in nuclear and conventional forces they believe that nation even one led by an unpredictable leader with lessthanrational objectives would risk attacking the united states if it believed that its own survival would be threatened in response 63 us nuclear policy in the 21st century fresh look at national strategy and requirements p 24 64 spurgeon keeney of the arms control association has argued that the best defense against future missile threats by rogue states is not crash effort to deploy expensive unproven defenses but rather aggressive pursuit of measures to reduce the possibility that such threats will ever materialize such measures include improved controls on international trade prompt us ratification of the ctbt to secure us leadership in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime etc see keeney spurgeon the new missile threat gap arms control today junejuly 1998 crs28 the bush administration has pursued an extensive review of us missile defense policies and programs as is noted above the president emphasized his commitment to the deployment of missile defenses in speech on may 1 2001 the president has not however outlined specific architecture for missile defense system nor its strategy for modifying or abandoning the abm treaty in addition the administration is consulting with us allies and plans to hold discussions although not necessarily formal negotiations with russia as it develops its missile defense strategy arms control strategic offensive force reductions in march 1997 presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed that after the start ii treaty entered into force the two sides would pursue further reductions in start iii treaty they agreed that this new agreement would reduce each sides strategic offensive forces to 20002500 warheads on deployed delivery vehicles officials in russia have since suggested that the parties explore even deeper reductions to 1500 warheads the presidents also agreed that start iii should contain measures to promote the irreversibility of the weapons elimination process including transparency measures and the destruction of strategic nuclear warheads removed from delivery vehicles they also agreed that they would explore possible measures for longrange nucleararmed sealaunched cruise missiles and other tactical nuclear weapons65 some analysts have grown skeptical about the value of continuing negotiations with russia to reduce strategic offensive nuclear forces they note that russia will reduce its forces for budgetary reasons regardless of arms control limits and therefore that the united states does not have to compromise its own force structure to achieve these reductions they do not see much benefit for the united states in negotiating offensive force reductions particularly if russia links these reductions with continued us compliance with the abm treaty instead they believe that the united states should go its own way on missile defenses and offensive force levels president bush has endorsed this approach to adjusting the us nuclear force posture others have argued that if the united states and russia continue negotiations on force reductions they should change the focus from limits on strategic offensive forces to measures addressing total nuclear posture which would include theater forces and nuclear infrastructure they note that russias strategic forces are aging and are likely to decline with or without negotiated limits but they maintain that russia still has thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons far more than the united 65 russia has long sought restrictions on us sealaunched cruise missiles because it fears that these could threaten targets in russia if the united states returned them to deployment on attack submarines the united states would like further restrictions on russian tactical nuclear weapons because these may pose proliferation risk and because russia possesses greater number of these weapons than does the united states russia would like restrictions on us tactical nuclear weapons to ensure that they are not deployed on the territory of new nato members crs29 states and more robust nuclear weapons production complex and infrastructure66 furthermore they argue that the united states should press for measures that will increase transparency and ensure the irreversibility of nuclear weapons reductions in the long run they believe these types of measures will do more to increase us security than would further negotiated reductions in strategic offensive forces many analysts in the arms control community agree that the united states and russia should negotiate measures that would improve transparency and the irreversibility of the arms reduction process but they argue that these measures should go along with much deeper reductions in us and russian strategic offensive forces they note that all of these measures would signal continuing improvement in us and russian relations and growing realization by both parties that they have little to gain by retaining cold war era nuclear postures many of these object to the administrations approach because they believe it is moving too slowly by waiting for russia to ratify start ii which the duma might never do the united states could lose an opportunity to move with russia to start iii or lower levels of strategic offensive forces although budget pressures might force russia in that direction anyway some worry that russia could muster the resources to retain or replace greater number of nuclear weapons if it felt threatened by the united states in november 1998 senator robert kerrey called for immediate unilateral reductions in us strategic nuclear forces to around 20002500 warheads the level projected under start iii treaty he said that the united states spends 25 billion on strategic nuclear forces each year and that this was diverting money away from real and imminent threats furthermore he argued that the united states was provoking russia to maintain an arsenal larger than it could control which made russias nuclear forces an accident waiting to happen67 coalition of arms control analysts made similar recommendation in report released in february 1999 the members of the committee on nuclear policy acknowledged that arms control treaties have served us national interests in the past but they noted that the pace of the arms control process has not kept up with the expansion of nuclear dangers in russia these include dangers caused by weaknesses in russias early warning and command and control systems and dangers caused by political and economic instability in russia therefore they called on the united states and russia to supplement treaties with parallel reciprocal and verifiable steps to reduce these dangers they argued that both sides should declare their intentions to reduce their strategic offensive forces to 1000 deployed warheads within decade and to offer cradle to grave transparency to monitor the elimination of excess warheads they noted that russia had rejected this level of transparency in the past but they argued that it would be more likely to accept such measures if the united states was willing to reduce its forces to the low levels that russia was heading to anyway 68 66 us nuclear policy in the 21st century fresh look at national strategy and requirements p 231 67 pincus walter kerrey us should cut nuclear arms unilaterally washington post november 17 1998 p 13 68 jumpstart retaking the initiative to reduce postcold war nuclear dangers continued crs30 several other reports and studies completed during the past few years have suggested that the united states and russia move beyond the start process and reduce their forces to around 1000 warheads initially and as few as 200300 warheads eventually69 they argue that these reductions would foster continuing improvements in the usrussian relationship and help reduce the risks of inadvertent use of nuclear weapons inherent in the retention of large stockpiles and large numbers of deployed systems press reports in late 1998 indicated that the clinton administration did consider unilateral reductions in us strategic nuclear forces to advance the arms control process and to encourage russia to reduce its strategic nuclear forces however these reductions would not have been as deep as the preceding studies have suggested and most reports acknowledged that budget pressures were the united states primary rationale for considering them70 one press report indicated that the administration had considered eliminating 4 trident submarines 50 peacekeeper icbms and 20 minuteman icbms71 however in february 1999 when the administration submitted its fy2000 budget to congress it simply requested that congress remove the language in previous authorization bills that required the retention of 18 trident submarines as was noted above congress did alter this language in the fy2000 defense authorization bill many in the clinton administration believed that the united states should not begin to make deep reductions without having start ii in place because russia would have greater incentive to ratify start ii if it recognized this as the only way to bring about significant reductions in us forces admiral richard mies the commanderinchief of stratcom has also argued that the united states should exercise considerable caution when reducing our strategic forces below the negotiated start i force levels until it is evident that russia is fully committed to further arms control reductions because the united states is not developing new warheads and delivery systems we must not be hasty in taking irreversible steps to reduce our capability and flexibility72 68

pentagon vol 15 june 10 1999 p 1 crs31 strategic nuclear force posture in recent years many analysts in the arms control community have argued that the united states and russia should change the focus of arms control efforts from reducing the numbers of strategic nuclear weapons to altering the postures of those weapons to reduce the dangers of an inadvertent nuclear attack support for this change in focus derives in part from the fact that efforts in past years to press for deep cuts in nuclear weapons did not alter administration policy but also from growing concerns about the safety and security of nuclear weapons in russia73 according to one analyst the two sides should make operational safety as opposed to deterrence of deliberate attack the primary consideration for their cooperative threat reduction efforts74 those who support these types of measures argue that it is mistake for both nations to maintain large portions of their forces on high levels of alert situation they refer to as hairtrigger alert they note that these alert postures remain in place in spite of the end of the cold war and the significantly lower likelihood of conflict between the two nations and in an environment where russia may be unable to receive clear unambiguous and accurate information about the presence or absence of an attack on its territory hence this posture not only increases the likelihood of an inadvertent nuclear conflict which could result if russia launched its nuclear forces after misinterpreting data about possible us launch but it also perpetuates the high levels of suspicion and mistrust that characterized the us soviet nuclear standoff during the cold war75 several analysts have offered proposals to remedy this situation admiral stansfield turner has argued that the formal treaty process is too slow to respond to the rapidly changing economic political and security situation in russia and that the united states and russia should reduce their deployed forces significantly and quickly to address concerns about nuclear proliferation therefore he has proposed that the united states remove some number of warheads from its deployed strategic ballistic missiles and place them in storage about 200 miles away from the deployment areas an arrangement he refers to as strategic escrow he argues that this would add significantly to the amount of time it would take for the united states to load and launch its missiles he also suggests that the united states invite russian observers to monitor the storage sites finally he suggests that the united states invite russia to take reciprocal steps with its strategic offensive nuclear forces because both nations would begin their escrow with only portion of their deployed warheads both could remain confident in their deterrent forces and over time as confidence and cooperation improved both could increase the proportion of warheads in escrow and reduce the number of deployed weapons remaining on alert he argues that these steps would not only indicate to the international community that the 73 fisher cathleen s reformation and resistance nongovernmental organizations and the future of nuclear

policy other single measure would more clearly signal the end of mutual suspicion carried over from the cold war than taking these weapons off quick launch status see jumpstart retaking the initiative to reduce post cold war nuclear dangers february 1999 p 12 crs32 united states and russia are downgrading nuclear weapons in their defense policies but that they would also reduce the dangers from russian nuclear forces76 many other analysts have endorsed concept that has become known as alerting for nuclear warheads some have outlined range of specific alternatives from physical obstructions that would block the exit of missiles from their silos to technical changes in computer software that would make it difficult for either nation to launch its weapons promptly to the actual removal of warheads from ballistic missiles that would increase the amount of time needed to launch nuclear weapons after nation had received warning of an attack77 proponents including bruce blair have stated that these types of measures could enhance stability and reduce the risk of miscalculations if they are verifiable so that each side can be confident that the other has maintained its forces on lower levels of alert and if they would take significant amount of time to reverse so that both sides would have time to respond if the other side began to realert its forces furthermore they have sought to devise measures that would not jeopardize the survivability of core force of nuclear weapons that could be reconstituted to deter attacks in the event of crisis proponents also argue that if the united states were to remove its forces from their high levels of alert then russia would longer fear disarming first strike from us forces because such an attack would not be possible without significant warning time as result russia would longer need to maintain its forces on high levels of alert so that it could launch promptly if it did detect evidence of an attack and if russia reduced the alert rates for its forces the risk that it would respond in haste to ambiguous evidence of possible nuclear attack would also decline hence if the united states started the dealerting process it could enhance safety and reduce the likelihood that gaps in russias early warning networks or flaws in its command and control systems and procedures would lead to an inadvertent nuclear launch78 officials in the clinton administration rejected many of these dealerting proposals first they noted that there is guarantee that russia would reciprocate if the united states reduced the alert rates for its forces so the measures might not redress any weaknesses in russias early warning network and command and control system furthermore they argued that these types of step could undermine rather than enhance stability in testimony before the senate armed services committee assistant secretary of defense warner noted that many options for dealerting such as changes in computer software or internal locks in missile silos are not verifiable 76 commentary postcold war demands new ways to deal with warheads on nuclear arms we cant wait for start ii treaty to do some good angeles times

dc 1995 p 15 crs33 which is widely accepted as an essential requirement for increased strategic stability he went on to state that those measures that could be verified such as the removal of warheads from missiles could also be highly destabilizing in crisis because steps that either nation took to realert its forces could very easily set off dangerous chain of events79 admiral mies the commander in chief of stratcom has also noted that reducing the alert status of our forces could diminish the credibility and the survivability of our deterrent forces and therefore jeopardize existing stability against preemptive first strike80 this would be particularly true if the united states were to remove components that ballistic missile submarines would need to launch their missiles it would be very difficult to restore these components to submarines at sea during crisis or conflict without having them return to port but this return would make them vulnerable to attack some analysts have also criticized proposals to reduce the alert rates for strategic nuclear forces81 first they note that us alert rates do not create hairtrigger which evokes an image of weapons that would launch automatically in response to warning of an incoming attack instead the alert rates provide the president with the option of launching promptly along with the option of waiting for more information before making decision in addition some have argued that warheads removed from missiles and stored in central storage areas might actually be so vulnerable and attractive as targets that they would invite attacks by other nations seeking to undermine the us nuclear deterrent others have noted that these proposals could actually raise russian suspicions that the united states was seeking to disarm the russian deterrent by insisting that russia remove its forces from alert and make them more vulnerable to surprise attack82 many analysts and officials in the clinton administration agreed however that weaknesses in russias early warning and command and control networks did increase the risk that russia might launch its weapons in response to ambiguous or inaccurate information about an incoming attack some analysts suggested that the united states deploy ballistic missile defenses to protect itself against such contingency many others have suggested that the united states address the problem directly by sharing ballistic missile early warning data with the russians during their september 1998 summit presidents clinton and yeltsin agreed that the united states and russia should explore the possibility of establishing joint early warning center to share data about ballistic missile launches worldwide the two sides have agreed to establish 79 statement of the honorable edward

completing agreements on the details analysts from across the political spectrum appear to agree that the united states can assist russia with its early warning gaps by sharing data collected by us early warning satellites some worry that this effort could reveal sensitive information about the capabilities of us systems but most acknowledge that the two sides could probably devise system that would provide useful data without compromising us capabilities some analysts have proposed that the united states share more than data with russia they have suggested that the united states could help russia rebuild its early warning network by providing funds to help russia build and launch more satellites or even by sharing satellite technology directly with russia83 some have criticized these proposals because they believe that the united states should not make it easier for russia to manage and operate its nuclear weapons and that russia should invest its own funds in its early warning systems nevertheless there appears to be growing consensus both among officials in the clinton administration and others that the united states and russia can cooperate to reduce the risks created by weaknesses in russias early warning system conclusion the united states has implemented some changes in its nuclear force posture and force structure since the end of the cold war nevertheless it has retained many elements that have been part of us nuclear strategy for nearly 30 years some analysts argue that this continuity is necessary even though the soviet union longer exists because the united states is likely to face new threats from adversaries armed with weapons of mass destruction others however believe that the united states should implement more farreaching changes in its nuclear posture in response to the changing international security environment they contend that the united states should focus more on reducing nuclear dangers in russia than on nuclear deterrence of emerging threats in other nations congress has not addressed nuclear strategy and force posture in comprehensive manner in many years but it reviews many aspects of us nuclear policy when it approves budgets for force structure and modernization programs when it debates the merits of arms control agreements and potential arms control measures and when it addresses the role that ballistic missile defenses may play in protecting the united states against emerging threats from nations armed with weapons of mass destruction these issues are likely to remain on the congressional agenda for many years at the same time analysts from across the political spectrum may continue to press for change or continuity in us nuclear posture consequently although these issues rarely attract widespread attention or 83 the congressional budget office outlined some of these alternatives in its september 1998 letter to senator tom daschle it recently reviewed the pros and cons of another proposal for the united states to provide the funds for russia to launch several early warning satellites see us congressional budget office letter to the honorable tom daschle august 24 1999 crs35 impassioned
