transportation dot appropriations act pl 106346 hrept 106940 on october 23 2000 the agreement provides 57978 billion for dot this is an increase of more than 14 over the enacted fy2000 level the act provides increases for all major dot agencies except the federal railroad administration fra on december 21 2000 president clinton signed the fy2001 consolida ted appropriations act pl 106 554 the act provided for governmentwide rescission of 022 this cut 125 million from the dot budget for fy2001 both houses of congress had passed somewhat different versions of the fy2001 appropriations bill hr 4475 the house of repres entatives version would have provided total budgetary resources of 552 billion the senate version 547 billion the roughly 500 million difference was partly an outgrowth of the lower budget cap that senators had to work with for the overall dot budget the senate bill would have represented 95 increase over the fy2000 budget the house bill nearly 105 increase the fy2001 act reflects the ongoing impact of the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 it raises highway funding by 16 and mass transit funding by almost 85 these spending levels meet or exceed tea21s requirements the administration had proposed increases of 5 for highways and roughly 9 for transit the enacted version of hr 4475 appropriates additional funds not included in either the house or senatepassed versions such as 137 billion for miscellaneous highway projects 600 million for the woodrow wilson memorial bridge roughly 55 million for the appalachian development highway system and

related agencies most recent developments president clinton signed the fy2001 department of transportatio n dot appropriations act pl 106346 into law on october 23 2000 the house and senate had approved the conference agreement hrept 106940 on october 6 2000 the fy2001 act provides 57978 billion for dot this is an increase of more than 14 over enacted fy2000 funding the fy2001 act appears to be in conformance with the requirements of both the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 and the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century fair21 it also includes in modified form senate provision to strengthen state drunk driver blood alcohol standards to 008 in addition the enacted bill permits the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa to collect and analyze public comments and data on its proposed hours of service rules but prohibits fmcsa from taking final action during fy2001 the fy2001 act includes conference agreement provisions not found in either the senate or house bills such as additional appropriations of 137 billion for miscellaneous highway projects 600 million for the woodrow wilson memorial bridge and 55 million for the appalachian development highway system also provided is 720 million for the emergency relief federal aid highway program on december 21 2000 president clinton signed the fy2001 consolidated appropriat ions act pl 106554 which provided for 022 governmentwide rescission the act rescinded roughly 125 million from the dot budget the act also included just over 20 million in additional transportation spending the transportation appropriations framework transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget it is also consi dered part of the discretionary budget funding for the dot budget is derived from number of sources the majority of funding comes from dedicated transportation trust funds the remainder of dot funding is from federal treasury general funds the transportation trust funds include the highway trust fund the transit account of the highway trust fund the airport and airway trust fund and the inland waterways trust fund all of these accounts derive their respective funding from specific excise and other taxes together highway and transit funding constitute the largest component of dot appropr iations and can account for 60 to 70 of total federal transportation spending in any given year most highway and the majority of transit programs arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs2 funded with contract authority derived by the link to the highway trust fund this is very significant from budgeting standpoint contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc authorized funds are automatically made available at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legislation appropriations are required to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appropriations process transportation appropriators are faced with the opposite situation that is the authority to spend for the largest programs under their control already exists and the mechanism to obligate funds for these programs is also in place prior to the fy1999 dot appropriations act changes in spending in the annual transportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriations process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and by placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control outlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements the authority to set limitation on obligations for contract authority programs gave appropriators considerable leeway in allocating funds among the various federal trans portation activities in function 400 which includes agencies such as the coast guard and the federal aviation administration in addition the inclusion of the highway and transit programs and their trustfund generated revenue streams in the discretionary budget provided appropriators with additional flexibility as part of the annual process by which available funds were allocated amongst the 13 standing appropriations subcommittees in the house and the senate changes in transportation appropriations as result of tea21 tea21 changed this budgetary procedure in two ways first it created new budget categorie s and second it set statutory limitations on obligations tea21 amends the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highway and mass transit tea21 further amends the budget process by creating statutory level for the limitation on obligations in each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy2003 in addition tea21 provides mechanism to adjust the amounts in the highway account but not the transit account to correspond with increased or decreased receipts in the highwaygenerated revenues this revenue aligned budget authority raba redistributes to the various states for obligational tea21 highway programs the trust fund revenues that are in excess of projected receipts these additional revenues are allocated to the states using the formulas spelled out in the law howeve r the fy2000 and fy2001 dot requests proposed redirection of raba funds from highway programs to other dot initiatives in the end the fy2000 and fy2001 dot appropriations acts did not adopt the administrations proposed redirection of raba fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs3 the net effect of the creation of these new budget categories is predetermined minimum level of funding for core highway and transit programs referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee the highway and mass transit categories are separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that prevents the funds assigned to these categories to be used for any other purpose these so called firewalls are viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor minimum levels of funding for highway and transit programs additional funds above the firewall level can be made available for highway and transit programs through the annual appropriations process tea21 changes the role of the house and senate appropriations and budget committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs the appropriations committees are precluded from their former role of setting an annual level of obligations in addition it appears that the act precludes at least in part the house and senate appropriations committees from exercising what some members view as their traditional option of changing spendin g levels for specific programs or projects in the fy2000 appropriations act the appropriators took some tentative steps to regain some of their discretion over highway spending the fy2000 act called for the redistribution of some funds among programs and added two significant spending projects in the fy2001 appropriations act the appropriators have continued in this vain by adding 137 billion in miscellaneous highway project funds for large number of earmarked projects further the fy2001 act calls for redirection of limited amount of funding between programs and includes significant additional funding for some tea21 programs as suggested earlier the tea21 firewalls appear to diminish the flexibility of the committees on appropriations to meet the goals of the annual budget process because the committees can only adjust the dot agency or program budgets outsi the firewalls hence any reduction in spending for function 400 must be allocated to agencies or programs other than highwa ys or transit in the era before the budget surplus ie last year this raised special concern for supporters of the coast guard and amtrak which are the largest dot functions without firewall protection the existence of significant government budget surplus has diminished this concern at least for the moment changes in transportation appropriations as result of the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century fair21 or air21 fair21 pl 106181 signed april 5 2000 provides socalled guarantee for faa program spending the guarantee for aviation spending however is significantly different from that provided by tea21 instead of creating new budget categories the fair21 guarantee rests on adoption of two pointoforder rules for the house and the senate the first pointoforder prevents congr ess from considering any legislation that does not spend all of the total budget resources as defined by fair21 for aviation purposes total budget resources for purposes of the act are essentially the revenues and interest accruing to the aviation trust fund the second pointoforder prevents any spending for faa operations and maintenance om or research engineering and development red unless the airporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs4 improvement program aip and the facilities and equipment fe portions of the faa account are funded at their fully authorized levels almost all observers view the fair21 guarantees as being somewhat weaker than those provided by tea21 for highway and transit programs congress can and sometimes does waive pointsoforder during consideration of legislation in addition there is sense that appropriators might still have some latitude to make significant changes to faa om funding which is dependant on both trust fund and general fund contributions for fy2001 however pointoforder waivers were considered supporters of fair21 believe the act requires significant new spending on aviation programs and for at least the fy2001 appropriations cycle this has been the case enactment of fair21 means that transportation appropr iators have total control over spending for only the coast guard the federal railroad administration including amtrak and number of smaller dot agencies all of these agencies were concerned about their funding prospects however the fy2001 act provides increases for all major dot agencies except for the fra budget which is funded at roughly 1 below its fy2000 enacted level supporters of the coast guard are especially concerned about this new transportation appropriations environment the coast guard is not funded by trust fund and hence cannot claim userfee base to support an argument for its own budget firewalls the coast guard has unique status within the transportation budget category because of its wartime role in national defense it is not unusual for the coast guard to receive some funds from military appropriations during the annual appropriations process it is possible that the coast guard will seek additional funding from the military side of the budg et in the years ahead if additional funds from transportation appropriations do not become available for fy2001 however the existence of significant budget surplus has abated these concerns table 1 status of department of transportation

budget debate began in earnest in proposing an overall transportation spending level of nearly 55 billion the administration continued to emphasize its safety research environmental infrastructure and mobility priorities which complement vice president gores proposals concerning the administrationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs5 1this percentage was calculated using house appropriations committee figures which ignore the new user fees proposed in the clinton administrations fy2001 budget proposal livability agenda additional issues arose during congressional consideration of the appropriations legislation the fy2001 dot appropriations debate was less contentious than last years debate it can be argued this is direct result of less constrained budgetary environment the fy2001 dot appropriations bill that president clinton sighed into law pl 106346 on october 23 2000 provided for total funding substantially above both the presidents request and fy2000 funding the 57978 billion provided for dot for fy2001 is 14 abov the fy2000 level and significantly higher than the administrations request for 78 increase1 nearly all agencies got increases but the big gainers were the federal highway administration fhwa and the federal aviation administration faa which got 16 and 25 increase s over fy2000 levels respectively the fy2001 consolidated appropriations act pl 106554 which was signed by president clinton on december 21 2000 included both governmentwide rescission and some additional dot spending the rescission cuts the fy2001 dot budget by roughly 125 million the act also earmarked over 20 million in additional spending the fy2001 enacted totals in table 3 at the end of this report and the fy2001 enacted columns in the charts are rescission adjusted figures because president bushs fy2002 budget submission when released will include the official rescission adjustments for fy2001 the adjusted figures in this report should be considered estimates the early course of the house and senate appropriations bills was strongly influenced by the constraints of the budget caps that appropriators were working under this environment continued through passage of the house and senate versions of hr 4475 once it was clear that legislation would be introduced to raise the spending caps enough to fund agencies not protected by funding guarantees the issues were few and were worked out in conference conference issues the house and senatepassed conference agreement on the fy2001 dot appropriations resolved number of policy issues that were reflected in differences in house and senate versions of hr 4475 the senate version of hr 4475 included language that would penalize states that do not adopt and enforce 008 blood alcohol concentration bac law by reducing their funding under certain federal highway programs by 5 in fy2004 and then 10 in fy2005 the conference agreement includes penalties on states for failure to adopt 008 bac law but phases them in at rate of 2 annually over four year period beginning in fy2004 to maximum of 8 the senate bill also included provision that prohibits dot from spending funds to consider adopt or enforce any proposed rule or proposed amendment to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs6 existing hours of service regulations that govern the driving and work hours of commercial drivers concomitantly the conference agreement permits the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa to collect and analyz public comments and data on its proposed hours of service rules but prohibits fmcsa from taking final action during fy2001 in addition the senate bill included provision that may not have been in conformance with fair21 it would have allowed faa to transfer 120 million of airport improvement program aip funds to the operations and maintenance om budget this could have been interpreted as lowering aip funding below the 32 billion level that under fair21 had to be achieved to trigger doubling of the primary airport aip formula entitlements this could have caused significant shift of funds from the formula program and relative increase in the monies available for discretionary grants the conference agreement however did not include the transfer provision the house version of hr 4475 included language that would restrict dot spending related to changing the corporate average fuel economy café standards the conference report also restricted any dot move toward changing the present standard but allows for new study of the standards by the national academy of sciences conference agreement general provisions title iii added significant additional appropriations not included in either the house or senatepassed bills section 378 of the conference report described in the summary table as for miscellaneous highways provides 137 billion for listing of road projects earmarked with designated dollar amounts to be made available from the highway trust fund section 326 makes available an additional 54936 million from the highway trust fund for the appalachian development highway system section 379 provides an additional 600 million from general fund revenues for replacement of the woodrow wilson memorial bridge finally the agreement provides 720 million from the trust fund for the emergency relief federal aid highway program in addition to earmark ing additional funding in the text of hr 4475 the conference agreement report language directs that specific dollar amounts be made available for many projects in programs that are under the control of the federal highway administration fhwa the federal lands program the bridge discretionary program the transportation and community and system preservation program ferry boats and ferry terminals intelligent transportation systems and the national corridor planning and development program were all earmarked to significant extent in the report language of the conference report the confer ence report directs that specific dollar amounts be provided for discretionary airport grants to airports named in the text of the report as high priority projects although in the past naming certain airports projects as priorities was not unusual specifying the dollar amounts is new transit capital investment grants were as usual earma rked to significant degree the agreement also provides increased budget authority to fund number of projects specified in the language of the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs7 2starting in the early 1990s about 300 million of the funds shown in table 2 were transferred from the dod appropriations budget to dot these monies are used to support coast guard activitiesrevenue aligned budget authority raba distribution was altered as well hr 4475 redirects the raba distribution of funds that would have gone to the allocated programs to the core programs that distribute monies to the states for fy2001 although most of the raba funds distribution was directed to the states some was set aside as follows 156 million for specific projects 185 million for the woodrow wilson memorial bridge 25 million for indian roads and 10 million

804 million the amount recommended by the conference committ ees the rescission reduced this amount to 802 million prominent issue has been the coast guards management of major planned replacement of aging and outmoded high seas vessels and aircraft only planning and analysis funds of about 45 million were requested for this in the fy2001 request actual purchases of nearly 10 billion are anticipated over 20year period beginning in fy2002 during hearings before the coast guards authorizing and appropriatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs10 subcommittees in 1999 the general accounting office gao criticized the coast guards handling of this vital replacement program crs report 98830f coast guard integrated deepwater system background and issues for congres s discusses the issues associated with the program in approving fy2000 funds in pl 10669 congress specified that the coast guard submit comprehensive capital investment plan with its fy2001 budget justification date not met by the coast guard the house fy2001 bill included language requiring capit investment plan covering 20022006 to be submitted with the fy2002 budget and specifies rescission of 100000 per day if the due date is not met the conferees included this bill language except for the rescission provision the senatepassed bill would have withheld fy2001 planning funds until the study was completed another issue involved the coast guards planned use of user fees the fy2001 budget anticipates using roughly 95 million from new user fees for recapitalization of vessels information management and coast guard shore infrastructure not part of the deepwater replacement effort the administration has proposed legislation to authorize user fees for commercial cargo vessels and cruise ships it anticipates collecting 212 million in fy2001 and 636 million annually when the fee system is fully operational past proposals for user fees for traditional coas t guard services such as buoy placement and vessel traffic regulation have been controversial some have argued that these services should be funded from general funds because of their widespread benefits others think that user fees should be assigned in instances where the beneficiaries can be clearly identified in passing fy2000 appropriations in pl 10669 hr 2084 congress included bill language prohibiting the coast guard from using any fy2000 funds to plan finalize or implement any regulation that would promulgate new user fees the fy2001 house and senatepassed fy2001 bills and the conference recommendation continue this prohibition

to formulate recommendations on new or revised safety regulations for fras consideration the most notable reduction is 50 million cut for amtrak amtrak issues are discussed in following section railroad safety and technology the fra is the primary federal agency that promotes and regulates railroad safety in the fy2000 budget the administration requested 955 million for the railroad safety program and other administrative and operating activities related to fra staff and programs most of those funds were used to pay for salaries as well as associated travel and traini ng expenses for field and headquarters staff and for information systems monitoring the safety performance of the industry8 the fy2000 dot appropriations act p l 10669 provides 943 million for those expenses for fy2001 the administration requested 1032 million for those expenses in hr 4475 the house specified 1025 million for fras safety and operations activities the senate in its version of hr 4475 specified 994 million the enacted conference agreement provide s 1017 million for safety and operations the governmentwide rescission reduced this amount to 1015 million the last railroad safety reauthorization statute was enacted in 1994 and funding authority for that program expired at the end of fy1998 fras safety programs contin ue using the authorities specified in existing federal railroad safety law and funds provided by annual appropriations although hearings have been held since then those deliberations have not resulted in consensus to enact law to authorize continued funding for fras regulatory and safety compliance activities or change any of the existing authorities used by that agency to promote railroad safety reauthorization statute changing the scope and nature of fras safety activities would most likely affect budgets after fy2001 the adequacy and effectiveness of fras gradecrossing activities continue to be of interest especially after the march 1999 crash between

to operate without federal financial operating assistance after fy2002 in 1997 congress created an independent national commission the amtrak reform council and assigned it several tasks regarding amtrak and the future of intercity rail passenger service the council submitted its first annual report to congress in january 2000 in that report the council stated that during the decade when the american economy and most of its transportation system have expanded in an unprecedented manner amtraks ridership has remained virtually unchanged the most notable accomplishment of intercity rail passenger service since 1970 is that it has simply managed to survive albeit as declining percentage of the total transportation market the report contains suggestions for amtrak the report also contains issues the council intends to study during 2000 in addition to federal financial operating assistance to amtrak the dot ig estimates that over the next several years amtrak will require 27 billion to 4 billion in federal funds for new equipment and improvements to signaling and track some of these funds would be used to upgrade track between washington dc

funding for new equipment and improvements to signaling and track for the foreseeable future amtrak reform council amtrak reform council hereafter referred to as the council funding is presented within the budget request although the council is an independent federal commission the budget authority for the council was 750000 in fy2000 compared to 450 000 in fy1999 the administration requested 1 million for fy2001 the housepassed bill provided 450000 the senatepassed bill 495000 the conference agreement recommended 750000 for the council in fy2001 and this became the enacted figure the

operate without federal operating assistance after september 30 2002 congress added other duties later if the council concludes that amtrak will require federal operating assistance after september 30 2002 then federal law requires the council to submit to congress an amtrak reorganization plan requires amtrak to submit to congress an amtrak liquidation plan and states that legislative action will be taken by the senate expanded intercity rail passenger service fund the administrations budget proposal requested the establishment of new grant program to aid amtrak and intercity rail passenger service to be funded at 468 million in fy2001 the money was to come from raba funds associated with the highway trust fund the projects funded would have required 100 state match positive financial contribution to amtrak public benefits in excess of public costs and would have to be located on current or potential intercity rail corridor funds were to go toward the acquisition of equipment construction of infrastructure improvements including acquisition of rightofway and planning and design funds were to be used only for capital as defined by genera lly accepted accounting principles gaap thus excluding them from use for maintenance of equipment or track the house and senatepassed bills as well as the conference agreement provided funding for fy2001 in the senate an amendment was offered from the floor to allow states to use their apportionments from the highway trust fund specifically from the national highway system program the surface transportation program and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program to pay for capital improvements for intercity passenger rail service the argument for this amendment was that the individual states were the best judges of their most urgent transportation needs and should be given the flexibility to spend their available transportation funds as they see fit the arguments against this amendment were that since the repair and maintenance needs of the nations highway system are great none of the money for that purpose should be used for anything else and also that expanding the spending criteria to include things other than highways would constitute legislating in an appropriations bill the amendment failed on pointoforder objection that the amendment was legislating in an appropriations bill the objection was upheld by 5246 votehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs15 figure 3 federal highway administrationfederal highway administration fhwa httpwwwfhwadotgov the fy2001 appropriations act provides fhwa with budgetary resources of 33452 billion the governmentwide rescission mandated in the consolidated appropriations act pl 106554 along with some additional appropriations and the carryover of some unobligated exempt obligations created new total of 33425 billion even accounting for these adjustments the final enacted funding is dramatically above the level provided in fy2000 an increase of approximately 46 billion or roughly 16 the fhwa component of the final act is in fact dramatically larger than the amounts provided in either the house or senate versions of the appropriations bill almost all of the additional funding in the act comes from the addition of earmarked highway projects outside the core tea21 programs the largest components of this increase include 137 billion in earmarked miscellaneous highway project funds an additional 720 million for the emergency relief program an additional 55 million for the appalachian development highway system and 600 million for the reconstruction of the woodrow wilson bridge with the exception of funding provided for the wood row wilson bridge all additional spending for fy2001 comes from the highway trust fund the additional spending proposals in the bill tend to distract from the fact that core fhwa spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs16 also receives significant increase as result of the availability of additional raba monies as result the fy2001 limitation on obligations rises to almost 297 billion an increase of almost 2 billion from the fy2000 level the senatepassed version of the fy2001 appropriations bill provided fhwa with total budgetary resources of 307 billion comparable to those found in the housepassed version of the bill also 307 billion both house and senate bills provided funding at levels slightly above the 306 billion level found in the administration proposal programmatically the house and senate bills closely tracked the administration proposals which are in turn governed by the provisions of tea21 the limitation on obligation funding level in both bills was an identical 297 billion the house and senate bills essentially ignored an administration request to redistribute portion of fy2001 revenue aligned budget authority raba funds the fhwa portion of the appropriations bill drew little comment during floor consideration of this legislation in the house the senate or during consideration of the conference report there was little by way of controversy surrounding the fhwa budget the possible exception was some early concern over the level of earmarking for the federal lands highway program and the transportation and community and system preservation pilot program reports accompanying both the senate and house bills detailed specific and in some cases different project earmarks for both of these programs the administration was proposing total fhwa budget of 30358 billion for fy2001 in terms of the total fhwa budget this represented an increase of just over 5 from the fy2000 level the obligational limitation which supports most of the federalaid highway program was set at 29319 billion funding for exempt programs emergency relief and portion of minimum guarantee funding was set at just over 1 billion all of the core fhwa funding programs received considerable increases in the context of the program framework established by tea21 described later in this section the administration was also proposing that only 231 billion of the available raba be assigned to highway programs this meant that 741 million of raba funds would have been transferred within dot agencies for mostly nonhighway activities in addition the administration was proposing that specific programs within fhwas jurisdiction receivefor example funding for indian reservation roads and highway tax fuel evasion projectsreceive designated distributions of raba funds the proposal to change the distribution of raba would have increased these programs to levels beyond those provided by tea21 the proposal to change the distribution of raba funds is controversial one the administration made similar redistribution proposal in fy2000 that was ultimately ignored by congress the administration proposal for fy2001 is of different nature than last years request in that it does not provide major shift of raba funds to transit final issue likely to have arisen as result of the administration proposal was the use of contract authority to fund number of the proposed increases discussed above the net effect of this proposal was to potentia lly exceed the obligational limitation detailed in tea21 in other words the administration spending proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs17 9 under the senate provision the dot secretary would be required beginning in fy 2004 to withhold 5 of certain federal aid highway funds for any state that has not yet adopted and enforced 008 bac law beginning in fy 2005 that amount increases to 10 under the senate bill the withheld funds would be reapportioned to state if it adopts and enforces 008 bac law within three years from the date that the funds were initially withheld appeared to exceed tea21 authorized levels for some programs hence either new authorizing legislation with concomitant increases in contract authority would have been neede d to accommodate the new funding levels an unlikely prospect at the moment or some existing programs would have seen spending reductions to accommodate the increased spending for favored initiatives both of these scenarios were unpopular with highway interest groups and with those members who do not want to see the tea21 framework changed in fy2001 as discussed earlier the fhwa was provided with 33425 billion rescission adjusted in total budgetary resources the fy2001 appropriations act continues the dramatic growth in fhwa fundi ng that resulted from passage of tea21 in 1998 and now from the availabilit of budget surplus by way of comparison fhwa funding for fy2001 is at level of almost 15 billion more than was available in fy1995 the fy2001 act largely followed the provisions of tea21 in terms of overall funding distributi on discussion of the tea21 program structure follows this section with the exception of the additional funding provided outside the core programs the principal change in the fy2000 act was in the distribution of raba funds for programs under the direct control of the fhwa these changes were continued in fy2001 these so called allocated funds go to programs such as the federal lands highway program and the highway beautification program the effect of the fy2000 acts provisions was to transfer significant portion of the raba funds designated for the allocated funds to core highway programs surface transportation program national highway system program etc for distribution to the states on formula basis the other major change in the fy2000 act was significant increase in the number of specific projects and funding levels detailed in the legislation this trend continued in the fy2001 act this earmarking is common feature in other parts of the transportation appropriations act but had been absent from the highway section of the act for several years 008 blood alcohol concentration bac prov ision the senate passed version of hr 4475 included provision that would have reduced the amount of highway trust funds that state received if it did not adopt and enforce 008 blood alcohol concentration 008 bac per law such statute makes it illegal by defin ition to operate motor vehicle at or above 008 bac9 similar provision was included in the house bill those supporting the senate approach often assert that the incentive specified in tea21 see section 163 of chapter 1 of title 23of the us code which provides additional federal aid funds to those states that enact and enforce 008 bac law has not proven sufficient to encourage many additional states to implement the 008 bac limit and that stronger measures are needed those against the approach specified in the senate bill typically maintain that each state should determine its own traffic safety laws without federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs18 pressure or dictates some also contend that the weight of evidence documenting the effectiveness of 008 bac law needs to be strengthened before the federal government imposes financial penalty on states for not enacting and enforcing such measure the fy2001 dot appropriations act modifies the senate provision and provides that states that fail to adopt and enforce the 008 bac standard as detailed in section 163a of title 23 united states code would have 2 of specified portions of their federal aid highway funding withheld beginning in fy2004 4 withheld in fy2005 6 withheld in fy2006 and 8 withheld in fy2007 the act provides that if within four years from the date that states appo rtionment is reduced the secretary determines that the state has adopted and is enforcing 008 bac statute the apportionment of such state shall be increased by an amount equal to the reduction otherwise the funds withheld would lapse the tea21 funding framework tea21 created the largest surface transportation program in us history for the most part however it did not create new programs rather it continued most of the highway and transit programs that originated in its immediate predecessor legislation the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea pl 102240 programmatically tea21 can be viewed as refinement and update of the istea process there are few new funding initiatives in tea21 such as border infrastructure program but the vast majority of funding is reserved for continuing programs there are several groupings of highway programs within the highway firewall most of the funding is reserved for the major federal aid highway programs which can be thought of as the core programs these programs are national highway system nhs interstate maintenance im surface transportation program stp bridge replacement and rehabilitation and congestion mitigation and air quality improvement cmaq all of these programs are subject to apportionment on an annual basis by formula and are not subject to programbyprogram appropriation there is second category of highway funding within the firewalls this so called exempt category consists of two elements an additional annual authorization of minimum guarantee funding 639 million per fiscal year and emergency relief 100 million per fiscal year these funds are not subject to the annual limitation on obligations further set of programs which are also within the firewall are known as the allocated programs these programs are under the direct control of fhwa or other governmental entities these programs include the federal lands highway program high priority projects former demonstration project category appalachian development highway system roads former ly ineligible for trust fund contract authority the national corridor planning and border infrastructure program and several other small programs as discussed earlier tea21 provides link between the highway generated revenues that flow into the highway account and highway spending the act requires that the secretary of transportation make an annual evaluation of revenues into the highway account during the previous fiscal year visavis spending authorized withinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs19 10in addition to the funds authorized in tea21 section 378 of the act provides 50 million for the its infrastructure program the 022 governmentwide rescission under pl 106 554 reduced the 4372 million for rd t by just under 1 millionthe highway firewall for the new fiscal year if revenues go up program spending is increased conversely spending can go down if revenues go down tea21 specifies formula to determine the direction and amount of highway funding adjustment known as raba this mechanism was employed beginning in fy2000 fhwa research development and tech nology rdt programs the fhwa proposed increasing funding for various rdt activities from 4372 million in fy2000 to 6588 million in fy 2001 rdt funds are used primarily to advance and deploy technologies intended to improve highway pavements structures roadway safety highway policies and intelligent transportation systems its the largest requested increases in dollar amounts were in fhwa s surface transportation rd and the intelligent transportation systems its programs more specifically fhwa requested increased funding for its surface transportation rd program from 98 million in fy2000 to 138 million in fy2001 the administration also requested 238 million for its deployment which is 120 million above the amount of contract authority specified in tea21 the its deployment program provides funds for states and local governments to use advanced communication and information systems to improve the management and safety of their surface transportation systems the source of the proposed additional funding was to be new contract authority that would be added to the contract authority already authorized under tea21 because legislative change to title v of tea21 would have been required to add this additional contract authority it was uncertain whether the additional funding requested by fhwa for rdt would be provided the house and senate passed bills and the conference agreement specified 4372 million including 98 million for surface transportation research program and 118 million for its deployment10 an issue associated with the its deployment program is the earmarking of funds during the last few years the appropriators have designated substantial portion of the incentive funds used to accelerate its deployment for example fy2000 and fy2001 dot appropriations acts congress earmarked the deployment accou nt by specifying which cities or states would receive those funds and the amounts to be obligated tea21 also specifies several projects which are to receive some of the its deployme nt funds some members and proponents of its would prefer to have the deployment funds competitively awarded federal transit administration fta httpwwwftadotgov the house and senatepassed fy2001 appropriations bills hr 4475 as well as the enacted conference agreement hrept 106940

difference being the administrations proposed use of 75 million from raba mostly for the job access and reverse commute program congress has rejected the administrations proposed use of some raba funding for transit the transit appropriations shown in figure 4 illustrate the significant increase in funding for fy1999 to fy2001 that occurred following the enactment of tea21 in 1998 as figure 4 shows transit funding under tea21 reached its highest funding level to date in fy200111 the 63 billion an 84 increase over fy2000 provided for in the fy2001 act continues the impact of tea21 on

three major components new transit starts fixed guide way modernization and bus and bus facilities for fy2001 the clinton adm inistration proposed funding of this program at 265 billion this is slightly higher than the fy2000 level of 25 billion these funds are allocated on discretionary basis by fta or earmarked by congress the senate passed bill also provided for 265 the house bill as well as hr 4475 enacted provided 27 billion for the program for fy2001 these bills transferred 50 million of formula funds monies to the capital investment programs the governmentwide 022 rescission reduced the capital investment program by 58 million to 2695 billion the administration fy2001 budget proposes that 12 new rail transit starts be considered for full funding grant agreements rail transit project selection is always controversial exercise because there are more potential projects listed in tea21 than can be funded within the transit guaranteed funding level the senate report srept 106309 language expresses the opinion that dot should reassess its request for the 12 new projects given the number of projects deemed eligible for funding under tea21 the house senate and enacted versions of hr 4475 all provided 1058 billion for new starts the urbanized area formula program section 5307formerly known as section 9 provides for the urbanized area capital and in some

contract authority to be made available for air traffic services to maintain aviation safety the enacted version of hr 4475 provides 32 billion for aip if the senate proposal to transfer aip contract

and relative increase in the monies available for discretionary grants the conference agreement hrept 106940 dropped the transfer provision and it is not an issue in the enacted bill the fy2001 consolidated appropriations act pl 106554 included 022 governmentwide rescission which again brought aip funding under the 32 billion trigger level section 1125 of the act however removed the 32

senate report srept 106309 earmark specific amounts of aip discretionary funding to individual airports both bills placename large number of airports and direct the faa to consider project grant applications at these airports as priority projects traditionally appropriations bills have not added specific dollar earmarks to place named airports the conference report language for fy2001 however breaks with this tradition and lists both airport names and dollar amounts and directs dot to provide not less than the funding levels mentioned in the report the house and senatepassed fy200 1 appropriations bills as well and the enacted conference agreement include rescission of 579 million in fy2000 contract authority made available in fair21 this rescission will have programmatic impact on the aip funding available for fy2001 impact of fair21 on the faa fy2001 budget the recently enacted faa reauthorization act the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century fair21 pl 106181 has had significant impact on the dot budget and appropriations debate for fy2001 this is because the socalled funding guarantees and pointoforder enforcement provisions in the act made it more difficult than in previous years for appropriators to fund the faa below the authorized level funding at the fully authorized level of 127 billion would exceed the administrations request by 15 billion 13 higher and would be 27 billion over 25 higher above the fy2000 enacted level the funding guarantee enforcement provisions require that all annual aviation trust fund revenues be spent on aviation and that the aip and fe accounts must be fully funded at the authorized level before any legislation to fund the om or red accounts can be considered this arrangement provides the capital portions of the faa budget aip and fe with procedural protection from reductions during the appropriations process however by implication it leaves the om and red budgets more at risk from reductions which might otherwise have been made agency wide the assumption by supporters of fair21 is that because the om account is mostly for salaries for air traffic controllers and other safetyrelated personnel it is difficult target for budget hawks to cuthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30508crs26 15the administr ations budget includes number of offsets to adjust for proposed but unauthorized user fees that would require authorizing legislation outside the jurisdiction of the appropriations committees the house appropriations committee figures on the administrations budget request factor out the impact of these nonexistent user fees because of this difference the figures in the textual discussion of the presidents fy2001 request will differ from the figures in the tables and charts of this report that rely on the house appropriations committee budget tables the appropriations committee tables put the continuedfair21 authorizes the om budget at 6592 billion the same as the administrations request aip is authorized at 32 billion fe at 2657 billion and red at 237 million the levels for these three accounts are all significantly higher than the amounts requested by the administration aviation trust fund revenues alone will not sustain the level of funding called for by fair21 for fy 2001 trust fund revenues are projected to be 106 billion aip and fe must be fully funded first at 59 billion this leaves 47 billion of the years trust fund revenues to fund faas om and red accounts this balance is roughly 21 billion below both the administration request and the fair21 level of approximately 68 billion for those accounts the 21 billion difference could be dealt with by providing funding from the general fund cutting from the unprotected budget accounts om and red drawing down unexpended trust fund balances or combination of the three for 2001 the enacted version of hr 4475 provides 21 billion in general fund revenues for om the faas fy2000 budget relied solely on aviation trust fund revenues fair21 clearly assumes that general fund revenues will be appropriated for fy2001 the administration had again proposed funding faa entirely from the aviation trust fund with the aid of proposed new user fee some members of the house and senate would also prefer to make the faas budget selfsustaining research and special programs administration rspa for fy2001 rspa requested 851 million in budget authority compared to an appropriation of 677 million in fy2000 most of rspas budget is allocated to activities seeking to promote transportation

with the bags themselves reduce the likelihood of child automobile trunk entrapment enhance infant and child safety in vehicle crashes and explore transportation options and safety programs for an aging population in their respective appropriations committee reports the house and senate have suggested that they also share concern for these nhtsa initiatives the enacted conference agreement pl 106346 provided total nhtsa funding of 404 million for fy2001 although this is nearly 10 increase over the fy2000 funding it is significantly lowe r than the administration request of 499 million the 404 million is 9 million greater than the amount proposed in the house and senatepassed versions of hr 4475 the additional funding is allocated to the office of safety defects within the operations
