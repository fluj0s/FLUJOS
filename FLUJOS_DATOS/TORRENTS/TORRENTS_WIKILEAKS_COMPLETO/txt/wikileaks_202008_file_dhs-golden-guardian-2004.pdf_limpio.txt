multimedia facilitated exercise players responded to the following three distinct modules module 1 credible threat module 2 notification and response module 3 recovery and restoration each module began with situation briefing or update players were then organized into func tional groups to discuss key issues for this exercise these groups consisted of the following functional tables intelligence evacuation emergency management health services radiological health services public health mass care and sheltering following each situation update players had an opportunity to review the module and questions and discuss response issues pl ayers were encouraged to feel free to periodically migrate between groups to foster communication spokesperson from each group was designated to

golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 28 analysis of critical task performance i criminal prevention and deterrence task not yet specified in hseep volume ii appendix b issue flow of intelligence information summary participants were concerned that there is currently lack of intelligence sharing between the california highway patr ol chp and the department of justice doj more specifically the california anti terrorism information center catic if terrorist events were to occur today there is established intelligence link that would coordinate said information between the agencies without total input from all intelligence agencies validating credible threat may be difficult participants also discussed how and when if any intelligence would be disseminated to first responders andor the public consequence lack of communication and inte lligence sharing between the chp and doj could very well pose problems intelligence gathered by one agency although seemingly insignificant could be of tremendous importance to the other furthermore the active intelligence gathering of one agency may adversely affect the efforts of the other if not coordinated in order to activate resources in timely fashion credible intelligence is essential and the information needed may not be obtained without cooperative effort intelligence that is withheld from first responders that would impact how they respond to an incident or what precautionary measures they use could have dire consequences likewise some intelligence sharing must be considered with regard to the public for personal safety issues analysis the state of california is currently working on the california state warning center cswc which when completed will hopefully address the aforementioned issues the cswc will be staffed by representatives from multiple intelligence gathering organizations to include both ch p and doj the importance of doj is not only the intelligence they obtain through ca tic but the fact that they are the legal authority who represents all state agencies once operational all intelligence issues are to be routed through the cswc which will hopefully provide for much more efficient and effective operation intellige nce obtained at the cswc that is life saving in nature or that could significan tly affect the well being of the community could easily be declassified andor provided to those with need to know recommendation the development of the cswc will be tremendous step forward in the states ability to gather and dissemina intelligence to ensure the cswc has all intelligence bases covered it should also consider including member of or even housing component of the joint terrorism task force jttf every federal bureau of investigation division has an existing jttf that has been fully operational since 2001 those jttfs are comprised of local state and federal investigators therefore by including the jttf the cswc could have access to not only state derived intelligence but also federally derived intelligence they would also have direct contact with the national joint terrorism task force njttf which is comprised of golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 29 all federal agencies with an intelligence gathering role the njttf is housed at fbi headquarters washington dc and is within the strategic information operations center sioc should terrorist event occur within california the center would have direct link to the njttf who could activa one of the breakout rooms of the sioc task not yet specified in hseep volume ii appendix b issue intelligence communications capabilities summary notifications and the ability to re spond to an event would be greatly hampered by the overwhelming volume of ca lls that follow any type of catastrophe there was concern that they would be unable to either report intelligence or receive intelligence in timely manner also of co ncern was the issue of the terrorist still at large and how best to locate him at what point and by who is intelligence disseminated during an event consequence any delays in either reporting or receiving intelligence could result in exasperating the event the loss of life loss of evidence and thwart law enforcements ability to locate the terrori sts clear and concise communications are paramount to the intelligence community failure to provide the public with information pertaining to the terrorist still at large could greatly delay his capture analysis there did not seem to be an effective and secure method of communications in place that would still function following major event the use of satellite telephones is available but limited because of the cost and accessibility of the few phones in service there is concern the information pertaining to events evidence and terrorists gathered at the scene by first responders victims and witnesses would not make it to those responsible for gather ing intelligence at the center likewise who will determine the proper channels for the intelligence and when it should be declassified recommendation the use of the jttfs would help to eliminate great deal of the intelligence sharing problems every event location will have representative jttf from the local fbi field division each jttf will have the ability to communicate securely via stuiii or similar device fbi field divisions also have access to portable stuiii phones that can be used at the incident site if needed because the jttf is comprised of multiple law enforcement jurisd ictions the flow of intelligence is greatly enhanced its important to educate first responders with regard to the function of the jttf so intelligence can be passed quickl since the jttf is structured through the fbi who will have ultimate investigativ authority over terrorist event the fbi would be able to make those decisions rega rding classified materials furthermore federal law mandates that intelligence in formation must be provided to local authorities in the event of personalpublic sa fety issues lastly the jttf would be the most effective tool in covertly appreh ending the remaining terrorist because of their multijurisdictional assets golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 210 task not yet specified in hseep volume ii appendix b issue sharing of intelligence information summary participants did not believe that they would receive any of the preevent intelligence from law enforcement agencies there was consensus that this information is rarely passed down to public health agencies even with the likelihood that they would highly impacted by an incident public health officials have community network where they receive information but there is little formal notification of law enforcement sensitive in formation some highlighted that security clearances can be an obstacle to receiving some of this information consequence the lack of intelligence sharing can cause delays in response if an actual incident were to occur resources that need to be brought in will be delayed and can result in death and further destruction analysis the state terrorism threat assessment center sttac would assess the threat and bring in health experts if wa rranted and would notify the governors office of emergency services oes radiation programs if aware of the threat the us department of homeland security usdhs would be reaching out to the catic the chp the california national guard civi l support teams cst the international atomic energy agency iaea and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for information recommendation public health needs representation in the jttfs so they can be better prepared for responding to wmd event public health officials should identify representation and obtain security cleara nce so passing information to them will be without incident building relationships wi th law enforcement officials will also help public health be more involved in the circle of information as well as helping others understand the importance public health plays in wmd incidents agencies mentioned above should consult with california ohs for further recommendations golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 211 iii emergency management task iii1 alert and mobilize eoc staff issue iii11 notification rosters summary participants agreed that upon notification of credible threat from the catic the state operation center soc director would contact appropriate agenciesmembers placing them on alert it was unclear however what additional state agency notifications should be made and who was to make that determination and notification consequence delay in calling in key personnel could seriously hamper the socs ability to manage the emergency response analysis procedures seem to be vague on who to contact at each homeland security advisory system hsas level although some departments take additional security precautions they are not always clear on wh at other agencies are doing there are known procedures for what actions need to be taken other than being on guard recommendation an effective efficient and timely notification system should be established implemented and tested ensuring the dissemination of important information in the event of credible thre at formal notification process based on the hsas should be developed denoting actions to be taken and notifications to be made at each alert level task iii12 direct and control public information activities issue iii121 activation of joint information center jic summary public information officers pio would be put into service immediately in response to this incident however as the incident progressed participants were unsure how to activate jic and where it would be located this event covered large regional area and the challenging gistics of meeting as one entity were discussed consequence coordination of public information is crucial in an event such as this if fully operational jic cannot be formed in timely manner and local and national press agencies report without proper information panic can spread into the community analysis all participants stressed the importance of releasing accurate and timely information in coordinated effort through the jic this realization suggests that participants know what work has to be done and consider public information coordination crucial step in emergency response activities recommendation each agency should develop andor review procedures to ensure timely establishment of jic to allow stat federal and local agencies to speak in golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 212 unified voice during wmd incident review national incident management system nims policies protocols and procedures on the establishment of joint information system one suggestion was jic at the state level as well as the local level which could cause serious misinformation if these entities are allowed to operate independently task iii13 activate and operate the joint information center issue iii131 coordination of emergency public information summary there was concern over the lack of knowledge on how the state would integrate the establishment of jic site an d coordinate involvement of state and local pios to ensure timely flow of in formation to the media and the public consequence lack of coordination in assembly and dissemination of accurate upto date information can cause unnecessary panic in the public analysis the ability to keep the public informed of unfolding events and to provide them with instructions during disaster is critical to maintaining their confidence and trust in an event of this magnitude public information becomes not only local issue but state issue as well there is great deal of information that needs to be shared in order to provide the public with as much information as possible for this there is need for well organized jic recommendation the state should review procedures to ensure the establishment of jic to ensure that cities counties and state are speaking in unified voice during an incident preplanned press releases containing key mass casualty and weapons of mass destructions wmd information can be prepared in advance of any incident and then disseminated in time releases to the public coordination among agencies needs to be strengthened to ensure the single spokespersonmessage concept is adhered to task iii14 provide emergency public info rmation to media and public issue iii141 public information hazard information and actions summary participants felt strongly that the demands on public resources could be significantly minimized through strong public outreach plan including media support participants felt the media could be used to disseminate hazard information however there were lack of understanding how to organize such response with the media consequence without adequate messaging getting to the public the confidence in the states ability to respond to the incident might be compromised this could result in additional life and property losses golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 213 analysis the goal of pio is to make certain that the public receives accurate and timely information about the incident to effectively accomplish this pios will need to have firm understanding of the systems that are used to manage emergencies and develop public information plan that in cludes protocols for collecting verifying and disseminating public information recommendation develop and implement policies for 1 information dissemination to the public regarding potential hazard an d riskreduction methods 2 the use of the emergency alert system and 3 utilizat ion of media outlets to keep the public informed exercise emergency procedures regularly golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 214 v protection task v1 develop and implement protective action decisions pad issue v11 evacuation orders summary as exercise events were unfolding participants discussed the need to develop an incident action plan however an incident plan addressing evacuation was not completed consequence lack of standardized information regarding evacuation orders can cause panic and confusion within the public analysis the ability to keep the public informed of unfolding events and to provide them with evacuation instructions during disaster is critical to maintaining their confidence and trust providing information would require coordination to assist in protecting civilians from the hazard and to foster confidence in the states ability to safely manage the crisis procedures that are generally in place for this type of incident do not always get initiated quick enough to avoid the mass evacuations and panic timely decisionmaking and informatio n dissemination is the key to preventing such problems recommendation review the activation of protective procedures and formulation of incident action plans state and local he alth departments should coordinate efforts now to standardize preassembled media releases ie to handle basic information on the properties effects treatment durati on and decontamination of likely threat agents this information should be provided with the public affairs reference materials released by the eoc and ji c in the event of wmd incident task v1 develop and implement protective action decisions pad issue v11 preevent evacuation planning summary participants believed that there were few actions specific to evacuation that could be taken prior to an event such as the one exercised however the need for preplanning was discussed and participants did realize the importance of having evacuation plans in place preevent consequence by not having evacuation plans for specific high risk targets within the state and region additional lives may be lost additionally the emergency response may be hampered by mass evacuations and people fleeing the area in an unorganized manner analysis there are many actions that can be taken prior to an event of this magnitude even before intelligence reaches response agencies that there is an imminent threat many of these actions in volve planning for unforeseen events such as having evacuation plans for high risk targets sporting events and large community golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 215 gatherings this should be done preev ent to adequately address issues and coordination between response agencies recommendation agencies involved in evacuation response such as the california department of transportation caltrans public works and law enforcement should develop evacuation plans for the most at high risk areas in the state and region it is further recommended that participation in additional exercises continue to ensure understanding of roles and responsibili ties prior during and post event task v10 direct shelter operations issue v101 volunteer agency involvement summary it is imperative that the volunteer ag ency representatives be included in all state level mass care and shelter exercises this exercise could have benefited from the expertise volunteer agencies can bring participants recognized the need for volunteer agency participation consequence response operations may be hamp ered if volunteer agencies are unfamiliar with the states emergency procedur this could cause additional distress within the community and possible life loss analysis response operations involve the state and the american red cross as equal partners in providing for the specific needs of the population during disaster it is important for both state and the american red cross to participate in exercises of this type steps to ensure that this happens should occur early in the planning process recommendation included volunteer agencies such as the american red cross in all state level exercises that would rely on th eir assistance review plans and procedures that focus on calling upon volunteer agencies golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 216 vi victim care task vi5 screen individuals for agent contamination issue vi51 screen and decont aminate evacuees summary participants were unaware of workable plan for the decontamination of large amount of people prior to being placed in shelter consequence medical health screening and decontam ination of arriving evacuees is critical contaminated evacuees could negatively impact the health and safety of the shelter and the community at large analysis there was some confusion as to the roles and responsibilities when it came to sheltering and decontaminating individuals monitoring and decontamination of large numbers of victims would challenge resources recommendation develop mass decontamination plan including responsibility for mass decontamination the potential locations of evacuee screening sites roles needed to support this operation access control measures and development of decontamination areas for patients showing signs and symptoms and holding areas for those that are not set up alternate care facilities to shelter evacuees and monitor their health exercise the plan to ensure it is feasible and review as needed task vi18 provide immediate mental health care issue vi181 coordination of mental health resources summary even though the state of california has mental health plan participants were concerned if adequate resources would be coordinated for an incident of this magnitude consequence insufficient numbers of trained certified disaster mental health workers can prolong suffering and anxiety and lead to future problems mental health issues in terrorism incident can be overwhelming worried well can take hospital resources needed for the seriously ill emer gency workers can be severely impacted if steps are not taken early on to address incident stress issues analysis mental health intervention if started early can minimize the longterm effects on disaster survivors it is importan t to provide mental health assistance to the public and responders to ensure healthy community and prevent the increase in substance abuse suicide and other social dise ases as result of the incident mental health impacts on survivors are minimized through access to appropriate and immediate mental health care the local emergency services communities have support for first responders through critical incident stress management cism recommendation develop andor review plans to care for the mental needs of community during and after weapon of mass destruction wmd event provide areas golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 217 to screen and triage survivors and once they are medically stable direct them to appropriate mental health care provide survivors with information and resources for obtaining additional potentially longterm support golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 218 vii criminal investigation and apprehension task vii3 conduct criminal investigation issue vii31 continued flow of intelligence evidentiary and custodial issues summary even though the event has essentially concluded there will still be great deal of intelligence to be gathered there was concern that the flow of information may wane as first responders became complacent and fatigued also of concern was the issue of who identifies and collects evidence from the scene of the event and elsewhere consequence without continued flow of intelligence information vital information pertaining to the event terrorists terrorist cells could be lost prosecution can be hampered if evidence is lost analysis the fbi still has the obligation to gath er evidence and prosecute those persons responsible the fbi does have specialized uni ts for the collection of evidence local law enforcement is used to locate and identify items of evidence while the fbi actually collects the items thus maintaining chainofcustody deceased victims are considered evidence each death separate act of murder recommendation continued intelligence gathering and evidence collection efforts to be coordinated through the jttf golden guardian 2004 for official use only tabletop exercise after action report 219

selected participant comments tabletop exercise organize using sems functional area this will make the tabletop more realistic more information and understanding about the effects of radiation reduce time for introductions and increase time fo r discussion participants seemed to gain focus and got more out of the exercise as it went on need radiological training explain the context of players in the state respon there was so much info to absorb to then focus on the issues particularly when th info is spread throughout the room place the modules on cd so it can be easily shared with other staff members outside of this tabletop exercise mimic an actual eoc setting using sems in this exercise transportation emergency management shouldve been its own table have separate rooms for each functional area i was unable to hear much of the discussion at the emergency management table allow more time to realistically respond to numerous questions continue advanced training and tabletop exercises participation at the executive level needed many of the questions were addressed to local re sponders consider questions addressed to state agencies correct people need to be notified to participate more people with actual decision making rolesresponsibilities i like the idea of an annual training exercise more crosstalk needed betw een the functional areas i found the module binder helpful it would be better to get it prior to the exercise progress of the group should be documented on whiteboard need copies of state plans available at the exercise players briefing before the

2 1530 exercise debriefing conducted golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 316 analysis of mission outcomes this section of the report provides an analys is of how well the participating jurisdictions as whole eg across disciplines and across jurisdictions achieved the expected mission outcomes in responding to the simulated terrorist event the focus is on outcomes rather than processes the mission outcomes are those things that the public expects from its pubic officials and agencies when faced with terrorist threat or attack results for the mission outcome are summarized below by outcome area detailed analysis of the activities and processes that contributed to results related to the mission outcomes is found in part 5 emergency assessment the information flow from numerous incident sites was received at the california state warning center was handled in an exceptional manner by staffing the california state warning center with personnel from both th california highway patrol chp and the governors office of emergency services oes there was prompt and accurate flow of information this allowed law enforcement agencies and emergency managers to analyze data assess the seriousness of the incident make an initial estimate of impact and mobilize the appropriate responses operationally all communications were logged evaluated and promptly disseminated to the oes state operations center soc the california state warning center also maintained an element of connectivity between the soc and the southern region emergency operations center reoc the personnel staffing the california state warning center were obviously well trained and capable of handling high levels of communications traffic from numerous entities and formats although relatively new aspect of the soc the california state warning center has shown it is both efficient and effective in contrast intelligence flow between the state terrorism threat assessment center sttac and the joint intelligence operations center jioc had major disconnects the sttac was inputting their intelligence into united states government system the federal protective services fps data base while the jioc was utilizing the joint regional information exchange system jries operated by the california department of justice doj through the california anti terro rism information center catic because the two systems didnt have the ability to connect the sttac was unaware of the events that had occurred prior to the termination of the exercise the sttac was able to gain access to jries through catic member who had been assigned to them however the intelligence flow was circuitous as they still did not have full function capabilities and had to receive data through emails and facsimiles the important thing was that they had found solution to their intelligence flow pr oblems through the course of the exercise emergency management overall communication in the soc was limited particularly with respect to the lack of status board for participants to view in cident progress and unfolding events for example the homeland security advisory system relies on effective communication of the golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 317 current threat condition to all responders pecially those within the soc throughout the course of the twoday exercise the us d p r t m n t f h m l n d s c u r i t h s s remained at orange for california and was only raised to red in eastern states adding to the confusion california declared it s internal threat condition at red these threat conditions were not made clear to participants as result participants were not clear on the proper protective measures communication between the soc and the reoc was difficult due to limited participants with extensive experience of the response information management system rims some participants were not using the rims automation to its fullest potential and deployment of the system seemed to be problematic in terms of access times user interface and user log out times additionally staff not normally assigned to th eoc new oes staff and partners who respond to state eocs were unfamiliar with the standardized emergency management system sems protocols even with these difficulties partic ipants felt they used the rims system well and appreciated the hands on experience they w r g i v n s p c i l l m n g f i r s t t i m users finally while several participants acknowle dged the overall successes of the advance planning teams all recognized needs for improvements overall the advance planning teams were organized earlier than anticipated however some units did not commit to the participation of the teams early enough to an ticipate consequences associated with the lack of good clear and organized public in formation campaign additionally lack of internal communication and coordination between the soc and the joint information center jic became an issue with developing and disseminating protective action plans to the media and public golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 318 analysis of critical task performance ii emergency assessment task ii2 notification and intelligence flow from incident sites issue ii21 intelligence communications network summary there was an inadequate flow of in telligence information and coordination between the newly created state terrorism threat assessment center sttac which operates within the office of emergency servic state operations center soc the joint intelligence information center jioc which was in operations at the incident site in the port of angeles pola and the california anti terrorism information center catic which operates from the california department of justice consequence lack of communication and intelligence sharing between the intelligence agencies would be detrimental to the stat and only creates deconfliction issues intelligence gathered by one agency although seemingly insignificant could be of tremendous importance to the others furthe rmore the active intelligence gathering of one agency may adversely affect the efforts of the others and therefore needs to be coordinated it is of paramount importance that credible intelligence be disseminated in timely fashion therefore cooperative ffort is needed to validate new intelligence as it will impact how first responders resp ond to an incident without validation precautionary measures may be missed and or terrorist subject information not acted upon likewise some intelligence sharing must be considered with regard to the public for personal safety issues wi thout total input from all intelligence agencies validating credible threat may be difficult analysis during the exercise it was determin ed that the sttac had been receiving minimal intelligence from the jioc several reasons were identified being new unit with little notoriety they were not assigned space on the soc floor the sttac was still in the process of establishing themselves as viable working entity within oes headquarters and had not yet become fully operational further the sttac was inputting their intelligence ie data into united states government system the federal protective services fps data base while the jioc was utilizing the joint regional information exchange system jries operated by the california department of justice doj through the catic because th two systems didnt have the ability to connect the sttac was unaware of the even ts that had occurred prior to the termination of the exercise the sttac was able to gain access to jries through catic member who had been assigned to them ho wever the intelligence flow was circuitous as they still did not have full function capabi lities and had to receive data through emails and facsimiles recommendation it would appear the state of cali fornia has two intelligence gathering entities performing similar if not the same tasks to eliminate deconfliction issues and to maximize intelligence gathering capabilities and effectiveness comprehensive review of the two units sttac and catic should be performed following the review california ohs should be consulted to determine how to best resolve this issue golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 319 task ii4 collect input for hazard asse ssmenteoc advanced planning issue ii41 advanced planning coordinati on and information gathering summary public information was delayed due to the advanced planning team participation consequence advance planning is key to the success of emergency management support activities failure to coordinate internally and to proactively illicit external resources limits response coordination effectiveness and efficiency analysis while several participants acknowledged the overall successes of the advance planning teams all recognized needs for improvements overall the advance planning teams were organized earlier than anticipated however some units did not commit to the participation of the teams early enough to an ticipate consequences associated with the lack of good clear and organized public information campaign internal communications and coordination also affected the advanced pl anning teams effectiveness mainly due to the infrequent briefings and situation reports but it was also recognized that chain of command reportingcommunications within the soc limited the information gathering techniques additionally several participants were also unclear of the procedures and structure of advanced planning finally partic ipants were unclear on how recovery fits in with the structure of the advance planning teams recommendation improve eoc ics and sems traini ng competencies the information cited does not indicate critical flaws in the response effort but rather highlight the need for further discussion training and exercising it is suggested that all agencies continue to participate in tabletop and functional exerci ses that focus on these issues additionally all agencies are encouraged to update respec tive terrorism response plans and procedures if applicable task ii4 collect input for hazard asse ssmenteoc advanced planning issue ii42 advanced planning reporting summary advanced planning members expressed some confusion on the format of advanced planning reportsdocuments consequence advance planning is key to the success of emergency management support activities failure to coordinate internally and to proactively illicit external resources limits response coordination effectiveness and efficiency analysis advanced planning members expressed so confusion on the

task ii5 make healthhazard assessments and predictionseoc advanced planning issues were observed task ii6 coordinate monitoring and sampling operations issues were observed golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 321 iii emergency management task iii1 alert and mobilize emergency operations center staff issue iii11 eoc staffing summary lack of participation by key agencies and lack of communications between respective counterparts at the soc and reoc limited coordination efforts consequence failure to adequately staff eoc limited response capabilities analysis the soc and reoc achieved their full oper ational status quickly and maintained this level of effort for the duration of the exercise however the lack of participation on part of several key response agencies eg california department of food and agriculture department of mental health us department of energy us environmental protection agency and us coast guard limited response coordination and effectiveness additionally it was observed that multiple soc participants did not have respective counterpart available for their coordination efforts at the reoc for example american red cross and pio representatives were not operational at the southern reoc this may have been due to the limited size andor technologies of the reoc recommendation establish direct communications link between soc and reoc with respective operational counterpart ensure ll participants are properly trained and have adequate workspace and technologies to ffectively manage their responsibilities state oes staff should provide reoc and soc refresher course to assist oes staff not normally assigned to the eoc new oes staff and partners who respond to state eocs prior to golden guardian 2005 the refresher course should include sems training to ensure knowledge of information flow vertical and horizontal between field city eoc oa eoc reoc and soc sems positions and responsibilities rims user interface training and review of applicable rims forms provide all soc and reoc responders refere nce guide or cheat sheet at their soc and reoc workstation the reference guide should include sems communication flow chart to ensure knowledge of information flow verti cal and horizontal between with field city eoc oa eoc reoc and soc listing of all sems positions and responsibilities rims user interface guide and guide for filling out applicable rims forms task iii1 alert and mobilize emergency operations center staff issue iii12 homeland security advisory system summary participants expressed confusion over identification of the current threat condition per the homeland security advisory system hsas consequence failure to clearly defined current threat conditions limits responders capabilities to provide proper protective measures golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 322 analysis the nation requires hsas to provide comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to federal state and local authorities and to the american people the hsas provides warnings in the form of set of graduated threat conditions that increase as the risk of the threat increases at each threat condition federal departments and agencies would implement corresponding set of protective measures to further reduce vulnerability or increase response capability during period of heightened alert similarly california has adopted system of protective measures that correspond to each th reat condition the system is intended to create common vocabulary context and st ructure for ongoing discussions about the nature of the threats that confront the ho meland and the appropriate measures that should be taken in response the system relies on effective communication of the current threat condition to all responders especially those within the soc throughout the course of the twoday x r c i s t h u s d p r t m n t f h m l n d s c u r i t h s s r m i n d t r n g f r california and was only raised to red in eastern states adding to the confusion california declared its internal threat condition at red these threat conditions were not made clear to participants as result participants were not clear on the proper protective measures recommendation provide continuous display of current threat conditions per the hsas and state threat levels within the soc and reoc it is acceptable for the nation and the state to have identified two different threat conditions however procedures should be in place for proper notification of current threat conditions and response per identified protective measures listed on the californi state agency guidance homeland security advisory system dated march 12 2003 task iii2 activate expand and operate emergency operations centers issue ii21 southern reoc summary the physical size and limited andor defective technologies of the southern reoc was not sufficient to support an effective eoc team consequence lack of adequate space and functioning technologies affects the reoc staffs ability to manage its response creating delay in eoc effectiveness and efficiency this leads to the potential dela of mutual aid resources and potentially substandard emergency management response analysis participants were inherently aware of the multitude of resources that would be needed within the reoc to support an incide nt of this nature however the minimal capacity and defective technologies of the reoc limited much of the staff to respond efficiently and effectively computers were outdated and processed data too slow television monitors did not wo rk and the lack of speaker system for briefings hampered reoc internal response and coordination additionally the lack of workingwalking space in fully functional reoc limited responders capabilities and efficiency golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 323 recommendation explore alternative sites for new or alternate reoc or explore options to expand the current eoc location consider the maximum size that would be needed to run an incident of this size assure the center is equipped with needed equipment to support the new reoc task iii2 activate expand and operate emergency operations centers issue ii22 situation reports summary need to be more efficient at obtainin g and distributing information situation reports were not distributed andor updated in timely fashion consequence failure to manage information limits response coordination effectiveness and efficiency analysis participants stressed concern with the current procedures for developing disseminating situation reports multiple issues were identified with current procedures for developing disseminating situation reports including units need to be more efficient at obtaining information units need to be more efficient at distributingcommunication information units must be staffed with addition personnel to manage situation reports acquiring and synthesizing information and putting it into situation report format unit leaders were left to verify and input information for situation reports instead of just proof reading recommendation procedures for complying and dissemi nating situation reports need to be

sensitivity consequence lack of communications between law forcement agencies prevents data from being analyzed as to the seriousness of the incident in timely manner analysis the new cswc was put into operation to gather intelligence information from various sources eg chp and sttac and disseminate to proper jurisdictions andor disciplines eg soc and reoc procedures are in place at the cswc for receiving and golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 325 disseminating intelligence information howeve r players were unsure at times who was to receive the intelligence information and at what level of sensitivity this was the first exercise for the california state warning center recommendation california ohs should be consulted for recommendations task iii3 direction and control response operations issue iii32 information flow through the california state warning center ops link summary the information flow from numerous incident sites was received at the cswc by way of either the california highway patrol chp or the governors office of emergency services oes the receipt and dissemination of information through the cswc was handled in an exceptional manner by staffing the cswc with members of both the chp and oes there was prompt and accurate flow of information this also allowed law enforcement agencies and emergency managers to analyze data assess the seriousness of the incident make an initial estimate of impact and mobilize the appropriate responses consequence lack of communications between law enforcement agencies prevents data from being analyzed as to the seriousness of the incident in timely manner analysis the flow of information through the cswc was logged evaluated and promptly disseminated to the oes soc and southern re c v i t h p s l i n k t h c s w c l s maintained constant element of connectivity between the soc and the southern reoc the personnel staffing the cswc were obviously well trained and capable of handling high levels of communications traffic from numer ous entities and formats the exercise allowed cswc an opportunity to refine stre ngthen and enhance the coordination with all areas in law enforcement on consequence management recommendation the operation of the cswc was very efficient and capable of handling broad range of communications functions because it is relatively new aspect of the soc it is important that its existence be made known throughout the state of california the use of the ops link needs to be defined for operations it is also imperative that the cswc maintains its high level of competency through continued use and training task iii3 direction and control response operations issue ii34 interagency communications plans unit summary communication from the soc to the reoc did not follow procedure therefore causing disruptions to the flow of information consequence procedures are in place for the southern reoc to report information to the soc the result of the soc contacting all sect ions of the southern reoc inherently delays golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 326 the proper reporting procedures from the southern reoc to the soc and potentially allows for unsubstantiated information to be reported to the soc analysis it became counterproductive for the soc plans unit to phone all sections of the southern reoc for information unspecified this procedure delayed the southern reoc plans section ability to analyze information and provide it in timely manner to the soc procedures are in place for reporting information from the southern reoc to the soc these procedures allow the southern reoc to analyze verify and report information in timely manner recommendation state oes soc and southern reoc representatives should work together to ensure current reporting procedur are effective and efficient in order to manage an incident of this nature stakeholders should ensure are sems compliance state oes staff should provide reoc and soc refresher course to assist oes staff not normally assigned to the eoc new oes staff and partners who respond to state eocs prior to golden

summary the capabilities of the rims system was not used to its fullest potential within the soc and southern reoc many soc and southern reoc participants were unfamiliar with the internet based rims system and had difficulty accessing rims even with those difficulties most participants felt the experience using rims was still positive experience consequence failure to manage information limits response coordination effectiveness and efficiency analysis not all participants were using the rims automation to its fullest potential and deployment of the system seemed to be problematic in terms of access times user interface and user log out times specific ri ms issues identified and observed include the following list eliminate redundancy of documentation eg rims status rims duty log and

were observed task iii10 request statefederal assistance issue iii101 mission tasking california nation guard civil support team cst summary not all participants were clear of the multiple procedures for requesting support and activating the cst for terrorism incident consequence timely notification of all state resources affects an appropriate response to the incident and the subsequent return to normalcy analysis often during largescale exercises response disciplines experience problems in agency notification mobilization information management and communication systems significant organizational deficiencies such as failing to understand redundant andor alternative means for requesting resources to crisis are frequently not discovered until the onset of major operation involvin

infrastructure mitigation issues were observed task iii12 direct and control public information activities issue iii121 delayed establishment of the joint information center jic team leader summary team leader was not established early on causing the delegation of responsibilities to be confusing in the initial stages of the jic operation the jic identified the need and appointed team leader making the delegation of roles more defined consequence without the establishment of team ader early on in the incident the delegation of responsibilities in the initial stages of the incident can become confusing increasing the likelihood those pios will not be able to get appropriate information to the public this may result in increased levels of apprehension among members of the general public and the dissemination of inaccu rate or inconsistent information analysis the goal of pio is to make certain that the public receives accurate and timely information about the incident to effectivel accomplish this the establishment of team leader early on in the incident is critical to ensure the objectives of the jic are met recommendation improve jic activation and operation training competencies public information disaster task force should be signated or tasked to develop plan that includes policies and procedures for activa ting and operating the jic the plan should include 1 how to activate the jic 2 procedures and phone lists for informing the eoc and other appropriate authorities that the jic is operational and that the direction and control of public affairsinformation has been shifted from the eoc to the jic 3 protocols for ensuring uninterrupted coverage with adequate staff 4 procedures for providing coordinated media briefings and 5 procedures for tracking and clarifying rumors jic activation and operation procedures exercises should be conducted regularly personnel should coordinate with the soc to incorporate jic activation and operations into scheduled exercises task iii13 activate and operate jo int information center issue iii131 communications between multiple jics golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 330 summary poor communications existed between the southern jic and northern jic the southern jic was located near the incident site in an area with poor cell phone coverage and email or fax capabilities consequence the jic provides continual flow of information to its respective eocs emergency responders and to the public wi thout appropriate communication operations between the southern jic and northern jic there is less capability to providing timely and accurate information to emergency responders and the public analysis accurate and expedited dissemination of information is critical component of the jic preservation of life and property may hinge on instructions and directions given by authorized officials as result of the communication failures the northern jic had to rely on spotty cell phone communication medium to get vital reliable information recommendation develop statewide crisis communication and public affairs system andor communications plan flow chart for th activation of remote jics identify potential preincident jic locations in coordination with emergency responder pre incident site planning of potential targets and events that occur within their purview this familiarity whether by way of target assessm ent or training will enable pios to more effectively and efficiently handle the activation of jic as well as ensure multiple communication mediums exists additionally emergency responders should be given the opportunity to train at the identified locations consider developing memorandum of underst anding mou at fedexkinkos locations as viable option for jic operations in absence of the above mentioned recommendations encourage pio representatives to bring laptop s portable printers and multiple cells phones task iii13 activate and operate jo int information center issue iii132 coordination between multiple jics summary jics were established appropriately by individual jurisdictions however the lack of common communications system and the lack of pio representative in the southern reoc and jioc andor unified command uc hampered the coordination efforts of multiple jics consequence not establishing jic causes lack of coordination of messages and results in confusion for not only the media but also th public an act of terrorism is likely to cause widespread panic and ongoing communication of accurate and uptodate information will help calm fears and limit collateral effects of the attack analysis all affected jurisdictions saw the need and benefit of having jic in place early in this incident however lack of coordination between the multiple active jics and local governmentagency pio representatives resulted in conflicting information dissemination to media and public golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 331 recommendation develop statewide crisis communication and public affairs system andor organization chart for the activation of remote jics co nforming to ics include ics command vests to better identify roles of participants all jurisdictions should consider cross training some personnel in various disciplines in the pio function and prepare procedures for establishing jic during emergencies additionally training to soc and reoc staff should be provided in order to ensure familiarity with public information concepts media contact lists should be maintained jurisdictions should conduct annual training with local media representatives and share the details of the plan with them determine alternate forms of communication and incorporate them in the communication plan task iii13 activate and operate jo int information center issue iii133 situation reports sitreps were not provided to jics summary situation reports or sitreps were not provided to northern jic located within the soc consequence lack of coordination of messages results in confusion for not only the media but also the public an act of terrorism is likely to cause widespread panic and ongoing communication of accurate and uptodate information will help calm fears and limit collateral effects of the attack analysis situation update or sitreps were not provided to northern jic located within the soc recommendation develop statewide crisis communication and public affairs system andor communications plan flow chart for co mmunication and coordination between all established jics and their respective eoc wi thin the soc ensure sitreps are disseminated to the jic to ensure coordination task iii14 provide emergency public information to media and public issue iii141 validating of information summary most agreed that subject matter expert should be the spokesperson depending on the information that was to be imparted to the media or the public however confusion existed in regards to the definition of official information and when and by whom is this official information validated consequence the likelihood existed that the public would receive conflicting and confusing messages when multiple messages were broadcast from multiple sources golden guardian 2004 for official use only fullscale exercise after action report 332 analysis the current system to validate informatio n proved to be difficult and lacked the immediacy needed given the circumstances as official information on the average took 15 minutes to validate recommendation clear and concise validation process for time sensitive information must be understood by all pio representatives the media has significant impact of the response of the public reaction to terrorism incident task iii15 establish and maintain rumor control operations issue iii151 rumor control operations summary unconfirmed reports about the event were being conveyed to the media from different sources consequence without plan for rumor control there is potential for rumors or misinformation from either media accounts or the public to be released rumors or misinformation can cause unnecessary dist ress among the public provoke counter productive public actions and impede respon and recovery efforts public information personnel must focus on addressing these rumors by providing accurate and timely information which is coordinated with other affected response agencies analysis as part of their role pios must deliver public information in coordinated manner as part of consistent unified resp onse reports should include description of the incident the countys response protective action decisions and any other emergency information as provided by health and medical partners use of the jic provides for coordinated gathering verifying and dissemi nating information to the public however without coordination between multiple jics the potential for misinformation exists recommendation develop statewide plan for rumor control where multiple jics are operational keep activity log to be able to re fer to at any time as it relates to controlling rumors have an acronym list to assist is trade terms for those who are not familiar with the terms that are not commonly us ed in daytoday communication rumor control plan should be created that outlines 1 when and

soc in dealing with staff in the reoc we should definitely have more exercises for the practice because we all need the training the script was bit too jumpy better flow would be helpful the county eoc was understa ffed and rims training for all most staff persons did not know their roles we learned as we went i would have liked controller simulation numbe r to utilize to clarify inject messages more injects and in timely manner stronger emphasis needed on accessing basic information from rimssems we needed more reoc activity to better simula real world experience andor activities more news injects both video and xt overall the exercise went well need to time phase all entities playing provide more opportunities for response at the state level we were waiting for localregional levels and this hampered the ability to use the soc as it was staffed lots of expertise here but not everyone was engaged information that was critical to decision making in our area was missing so we were not able to make good decisions ie fbi stopped health info on danger in the area from getting out this resulted in unnecessary self evacuations that im pacted hospitals in the area caused panic and chaos exercise could benefit from more active direction by the coordinatorscon trollers to keep play moving the dept of mental health should have been present and the american red cross was not present at
