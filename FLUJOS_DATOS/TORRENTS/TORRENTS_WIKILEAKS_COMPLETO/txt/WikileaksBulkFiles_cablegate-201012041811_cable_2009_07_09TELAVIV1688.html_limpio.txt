stress the importance of the usisraeli politicalmilitary relationship and to discuss among other issues israels qualitative military edge qme goi interlocutors continued to press for the opportunity to review the qme report prior to its submission to congress and presented an official response to us nonpaper on potential arms transfers to arab countries in that respect the mod proposed technical discussions in washington on august 3 to further discuss goi concerns over the potential f15sa transfer to saudi arabia goi officials continued to express reservations regarding us arms transfers to lebanon and requested the opportunity to further discuss us strategy and intentions with respect to the lebanese armed forces goi interlocutors raised continued concerns over the iranian nuclear weapons program noting that any policy of engagement be done in conjunction with tougher sanctions and for finite period of time before turning to other options on the table other issues raised by goi officials included the peace process israels export control system and potential israeli exports to china both sides agreed in principle to the next session of the joint political military group jpmg in october or early november in israel end summary 2 sbu on july 22 as shapiro met with mod director general pinchas buchris mod politicalmilitary director amos gilad defense export control directorate chief eli pincu and participated in roundtable discussion led by j5 strategic division chief brigadier general yossi heymann at the mfa on july 23 as shapiro met with director general yossi gal and participated in roundtable discussion led by deputy director general for strategic affairs alon bar and export control director roey gilad as shapiro also participated in strategic tour of israel and visited israeli defense company plasansasa usisraeli relationship 3 sbu as shapiro stressed the importance of the usisraeli politicalmilitary relationship noting the significance of visiting israel on his first overseas trip in his capacity as assistant secretary for the politicalmilitary affairs bureau goi interlocutors appreciated the opportunity to resume dialogue on this important aspect of the usisraeli relationship mod dg buchris noted the two still relatively new administrations in the united states and israel and the importance of limiting the number of misunderstandings in the future qualitative military edge 4 s goi officials reiterated the importance of maintaining israels qualitative military edge qme they said that israel understands us policy intentions to arm moderate arab states in the region to counter the iranian threat and prefers such sales originate from the united states instead of other countries like russia or china however israel continues to stress the importance of identifying potential risks that may become future threats or adversaries and for this reason maintains several objections as indicated in the official goi response to the qme nonpaper on potential us arms sales to the region ref email to pmrsat separately 5 s goi officials also expressed continued interest in reviewing the qme report prior to its submission to congress as shapiro reiterated that the report was based on an assessment from the intelligence community and therefore not releasable to the goi he referenced previous points made to the israeli embassy in washington regarding the report and welcomed any comments the goi might have although such comments should be delivered as soon as possible as the report is already overdue israeli interlocutors appreciated the classified nature of the report but also made clear it was difficult to comment on the reports results without reviewing its content or intelligence assessment in that respect buchris and other goi officials requested that the qme process be reviewed in light of future qme reports 6 s goi interlocutors attempted to make the argument that moderate arab countries could in the future become adversaries and that this should be taken into account in the qme process during roundtable discussion led by the mfas deputy director general for strategic affairs alon bar the mfas center for policy research gave intelligence briefs on saudi arabia egypt and lebanon to further support the argument that these countries could become future foes policy research center interlocutors reviewed succession concerns in both saudi arabia and egypt bar argued that perceived closure in the capability gap between israel and arab states coupled with nucleararmed iran could compel moderate arab states to reassess the notion that israel was fixture in the region 7 s typically frank mod politicalmilitary chief amos gilad was not certain how much longer egyptian president mubarak would live and questioned whether his gamal was ready to assume command gilad said the egyptian military led by defense minister tantawi continues to train and exercise as if israel was its only enemy he added that there were disturbing signs on the egyptian streets as women are dressed more conservatively and that peace with israel is too thin too superficial on saudi arabia gilad said that king abdullah does not hate israel but his chief priority is the survival of the regime 8 s the goi official response to the arms transfer nonpaper includes several objections such as the potential transfer of systems for the f15sa to saudi arabia including the enhanced paveway ii joint helmet mounted cueing system and aesa radar buchris said the goi is ready to establish working group to discuss the f15sa transfer and proposed an israeli technical team accompany bg heymann to washington in town for missile defense meeting on august 3 to discuss the issue further buchris said the sale of the f15sa was not the problem but rather the weapons systems included on the planes and the location of the planes in saudi arabia lebanon 9 s the goi remains concerned about us arms transfers to the lebanese armed forces laf and has requested the opportunity to discuss further us intentions regarding the laf as shapiro said the results of the lebanese elections represented turning point and rejection of hizballah and its iranian sponsors the need to build up lebanese institutions including the army was now more important than ever he argued as shapiro said the laf has thus far demonstrated solid record of accounting for us systems transferred to lebanon 10 s buchris acknowledged that the elections in lebanon were positive but countered that hizballahs influence remains strong he argued that items such as the cessna caravan and the raven unmanned aerial vehicle uav lack sufficient mitigation measures which creates the potential for an incident along the israellebanese border amos gilad said the goi does not believe the laf will attack israel however given the ties between hizballah and the laf he was certain the idf would eventually face the laf in any conflict with hizballah 11 s analysts from the mfas center for policy research argued there has been dramatic change in the political arena despite the march 14 coalitions significant victory in the elections they said the fragile political situation in lebanon is currently stable but hizballah still possesses an unofficial veto over policy long term prospects will be tested by the hariri tribunal and hizballahs desire for reprisal to the 2008 mughniyeh assassination mfa policy research analysts further argued that the laf faces tremendous pressure following the recent explosion of hizballah arms cache near the lebaneseisraeli border mfa dg yossi gal noted that unifil had been prevented from investigating the explosion and raised the recent crossing by lebanese citizens into israeli territory to plant lebanese and hizballah flags he said french and italian delegations had praised the gois restraint in these cases 12 s as shapiro asked if the election results might be the result in part of backlash in the christian community against hizballah the policy research analysts countered that the results were indicative of several factors including the influx of saudi money and an unstable opposition camp they agreed that hizballah leader nasrallah might be bit chastened following the elections as suggested by as shapiro but that hizballah continues to try and undermine the march 14 coalition 13 s during the mod roundtable discussion bg heymann also acknowledged the positive results of the elections however he feared the outcome did not represent the real power of the shiites in lebanon he agreed that moderates and the laf must be strengthened but expressed deep concerns about ongoing cooperation between hizballah and the laf he also said that such aid to lebanon be paired with efforts to halt smuggling and directly weaken hizballah 14 s bg heymann also cited concerns regarding mitigation measures for the caravan and raven in order to prevent an accidental engagement by the iaf overall he was skeptical that these systems would benefit the laf and said the goi would appreciate more indepth conversation regarding us intentions and overarching strategy with respect to the laf heymann suggested further talks to coincide with the august 3rd f15 technical discussion in washington mfa ddg bar echoed this request as shapiro offered to take that back to washington for review if it proved too difficult on short notice to bring together interagency experts to discuss us intentions with the laf as shapiro suggested it be included in the joint political military group talks later in the fall iran 15 s irans pursuit of nuclear weapons remains the gois primary focus buchris stated bluntly that it was not clear to him where us policy was heading with regard to iran in separate meetings buchris and amos gilad said that israels preeminent priority is to prevent irans nuclear weapons program which if realized would cause nuclear arms race across the middle east as saudi arabia turkey and egypt pursue similar programs in response gilad was skeptical that engagement would work noting iranian desires to establish new empire and pointing to iranian support for hizballah and hamastan buchris added that the united states desire to engage with iran should be accompanied by tough sanctions and only pursued for finite period of time mfa dg gal concurred alluding to potential military strike buchris said all options must remain on the table and acknowledged that part of his job was insuring israel was ready to employ such an option matter how undesirable it may be 16 s as shapiro made clear that nuclear armed iran was unacceptable to the united states he referenced secretary clintons july 15 foreign policy address at the council on foreign relations noting the offer of engagement with iran but reinforcing that such an offer is not indefinite as shapiro argued that an iranian rejection of our offer to engage will only help bolster international support for increased sanctions he also pointed to the uncertain situation following the iranian elections it was unclear at this point how the regime in tehran will react to our offer of engagement that said he repeated that the engagement offer was not unlimited noting that the united states will reassess its engagement strategy with iran later this fall 17 s as shapiro cited commonality of interests with the gulf states which also view iran as the preeminent threat we should take advantage of this commonality he said during the j5 roundtable discussion idf interlocutors expressed skepticism that proposed military assistance to the gulf would help against iran as some of the systems slated for delivery are not designed to counter the threats nuclear and asymmetrical posed by iran as shapiro agreed that assistance to gulf states should not diminish israels qme but argued that it sends signal to those countries as well as iran that they have strong allies in the west it also helps convince these regimes that their best interests lie with the moderate camp rather than with iran 18 s buchris said the lack of an appointed us special envoy focusing on iran suggested the united states did not believe iran was priority as shapiro reassured buchris that iran was top priority as president obama and secretary clinton are intensely focused on iran the fact that tehran has not responded to our offer of engagement makes special envoy responsible for negotiations not as important as shapiro said in any case much of the discussion will be behind the scenes 19 s buchris referenced press report from secretary clintons trip to jakarta in which she said the united states would consider providing defense umbrella for moderate arab countries in the middle east should iran acquire nuclear weapon buchris argued that such statement already conceded the idea of nucleararmed iran mfa deputy director general for strategic affairs alon bar also raised the secretarys jakarta statement as shapiro stated that the secretarys comments did not indicate new policy approach but were meant as deterrent factor toward irans nuclear weapons ambitions not as concession and that journalists covering the trip attempted to make more out of the statement than was intended 20 s amos gilad referenced russias potential sale of the s300 missile system to iran noting that russian interlocutors initially denied the s300 contract with iran and then later admitted it had been signed but added that the system would not be delivered for political reasons however gilad said the russians would reassess this political calculation should the united states continue to pursue missile defense plans in poland and the czech republic he speculated that the iranians would continue to put pressure on russia to sell the system rather than pursue alternative chinese systems he said the russians appear committed to preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons but he personally had doubts about their intelligence capabilities following their lack of knowledge regarding the syrian nuclear project peace process 21 s buchris acknowledged that the palestinian authority was doing good job in the west bank noting respect for palestinian security forces pasf as they take more control of security giving them the chance to succeed was important buchris said he also commended the work of united states security coordinator gen dayton in training the pasf that said buchris argued the way ahead would be difficult given the divide between hamas and fatah reconciliation talks between the two have stalled amos gilad said both sides are more interested in swallowing one another than negotiating behind the scenes discussions with hamas by european countries and even us visitors have not helped the situation buchris said as shapiro deferred to special envoy sen george mitchells efforts but noted secretary clintons point that stronger pa will offer an alternative to hamas he also stressed secretary clintons remarks during her july 15 speech that the united states will not engage with hamas unless it has accepted the quartet principles export control 22 c mod defense export control directorate decd chief eli pincu reviewed the export control system emphasizing an improved process but also acknowledging the potential for improvement he gave brief presentation regarding israeli export controls including enhanced legislation crossministry coordination enhanced enforcement and increased industry outreach and training he noted 780 registered exporters in israel for 2009 31373 marketing licenses had thus far been issued with 1198 denials and 219 returned without action mfa export control director roey gilad stressed the partnership between the mod and mfa on export licenses and explained the systems dispute resolution mechanism in the event the mfa and mod disagree on particular case 23 c both pincu and roey gilad noted that the goi continues to seek assistance in closing export control loopholes including brokering pincu noted that brokering had been included in the defense export control act but that accompanying implementation legislation had not yet entered in to force pincu said the goi had consulted with germany the united kingdom france and japan on its brokering laws and planned to raise it during the annual defense export control working group to be held in washington in october roey gilad and other decd officials also hope to travel to washington in the near future to further discuss brokering issues china 24 c mfa export control director roey gilad reiterated that the goi in way desires to compromise us national interests with respect to exports to china he noted however that the us department of commerce created in 2007 list of exemptions for certain items if sent to validated end users in china gilad questioned whether the same exemptions might be possible for israel as it currently stands the goi must pursue any export to china through the bilateral statement of understanding with the united states while the statement calls for expeditious resolution of any requests to export to china it often takes up to 80 days to obtain approval by that time gilad said china has often found the item through another supplier moreover the israeli export control system requires 20working day turnaround on all export license requests which is not possible given the length of time required to obtain an answer from the united states as shapiro offered to raise the issue in washington jpmg 25 sbu as shapiro suggested the next session of the joint political military group jpmg convene shortly after the jewish holidays most likely in october or early november goi officials agreed in principle and will look at the calendar and propose dates 26 u as shapiro has cleared this cable visit embassy tel avivs classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpneatelaviv cunningham
