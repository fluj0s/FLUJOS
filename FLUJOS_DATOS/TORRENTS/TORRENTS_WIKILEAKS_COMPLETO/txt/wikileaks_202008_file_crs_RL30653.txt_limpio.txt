the employment of individuals with disabilities in 1938 the congress passed the fair labor standards act flsa which among other provisions established reduced wage for the employment of individuals whose earning capacity was impaired by age or physical or mental deficiency or injury section 14 the americans with disabilities act ada of 1990 banned discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere on the basis of disability and the civil rights act cra of 1991 allowed people bringing employment discrimination suits to seek compensatory and punitive damages under the ada and the rehabilitation act

conditions or impairments to increase their work effort without loss of governmentprovided health care coverage learning whether public policy is on the right track is especially important today because of the direct relationship between age and disability as the incidence of disabling health conditions rises with age and as the large babyboom generation has been entering middleage disability is likely to become increasingly common and potentially costly to society changing economic conditions and the varying definitions of disability in programs and surveys make it difficult to gauge the success of the legislation in enhancing the employment prospects of people with disabilities so too does the lack of accurate consistent statistics over time on the labor force status of individuals with disabilities despite the charge of the presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities 19982002 to develop valid reliable measure of the employment rate of workingage adults with disabilities progress toward that end has been very slow to mitigate the data shortcomings with regard to conducting trend analysis researchers have utilized multiple databases to determine if they are telling the same story in general they are despite the strong state of the economy through 2000 full implementation of the adas employment provisions in the mid1990s and the employment rate of all workingage persons with disabilities failed to improve in recent decades analysts have examined variety of explanations for the lagging employment opportunities of people with disabilities including the seemingly increased share of adults with disabilities so severe that they report being unable to work expansion of the social security disability and supplemental security income programs and enactment and implementation of the ada the results of this research have prompted some to suggest that enhancing the employment prospects of all members of the population with disabilities might involve subsidizing the cost of employer accommodations and helping those already employed retain their jobs among other things this report will be updated as warranted contents

congress enacted major legislation concerning the employment of people with disabilities as early as the 1930s through the establishment of wage rates for such individuals below the federal minimum wage this and subsequent laws share focus on individuals with disabilities as current or potential workers learning whether public policy is on the right track is particularly important at the current time because of the positive relationship between age and disability as the incidence of disabling health conditions rises with age eg hearing impairments arthritis and limitations on activities due to heart disease and as the large babyboom generation has been entering the midtolate working years disability is likely to become increasingly common and potentially increasingly costly to society eg increased utilization of medical and rehabilitative services as well as decreased receipt of income and payroll taxes from forgone individual earnings2 moreover new advances in medicine have allowed people to live with previously lifethreatening impairments and among students who typically are expected to go from school into the workplace those served by the individuals with disabilities education act idea part b have increased over time3 this report begins with summary of federal actions taken during the 20th century related to the employment of people with disabilities it then describes in detail the existing data sources of government agencies that cover disability and employment status as well as reviews the activities of the presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities aimed at remedying statistical shortcomings 1 this report was originally prepared by linda levine specialist in labor economics in the domestic social policy division of crs and has been updated by the current author on the date shown 2 the committee on assessing rehabilitation science and engineering of the institute of medicine estimated that lost wages from disability in 1994 ranged from 931 billion to 1111 billion depending on the definition of disability in addition medical costs associated with disability may have totaled 1631 billion in 1994 dollars edward n brandt jr and andrew m pope ed enabling america assessing the role of rehabilitation science and engineering washington dc national academy press 1997 3 presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities recharting the course november 1998 crs2 the report closes with an examination of the limited trend statistics on the employment situation of workingage adults with disabilities to determine how they fared in recent decades and mentions policies that have been suggested actions by the congress and administration the national industrial recovery act nira of 19331935 addressed the employment disadvantages of disabled individuals4 by establishing productivity based subminimum wage arranged through system of certificates5 with time these individuals came to be identified in one of three classifications employees of sheltered workshops where the wage floor was set by charitable institution employees in the private forprofit sector where the wage floor could not be less than 75 percent of the minimum wage in the industry and employees who by virtue of disability were employed in industrial homework the nira was declared unconstitutional in may 1935 and the above requirements were longer operative in 1938 the congress passed the fair labor standards act flsa section 14 of the act established reduced wage for the employment of individuals under special certificates issued by the us department of labors wage and hour administrator whose earning capacity was impaired by age or physical or mental deficiency or injury statutory floor was established but the wage floor for disabled workers at private forprofit firms was administratively set at not less than 75 of the standard federal minimum wage workers in sheltered workshops run by charitable organization were to be paid on the basis of their earning capacity under the 1966 flsa amendments the wage rate for persons with disabilities was statutorily set at not less than 50 of the basic flsa minimum for both competitive industry and sheltered workshops with an exception for work activity centers pl 89601 in 1986 section 14c was again amended removing the distinction between workshops and work activity centers and eliminating the statutory minimum wage for the disabled pl 99486 instead the wage rate was to be commensurate with those paid to nonhandicapped workers employed in the vicinity for essentially the same type quality and quantity of work and that was related to the individuals productivity the americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada pl 101336 bans discrimination in the workplace and elsewhere eg in public accommodations and 4 persons whose earning capacity was limited because of age physical or mental handicap or other infirmity 5 for more information see crs report rl30674 treatment of workers with disabilities under section 14c of the fair labor standards act by william g whittaker crs3 services operated by private entities transportation and in telecommunications on the basis of disability6 title i primarily is intended to equalize access to employment opportunities for otherwise qualified workers with disabilities by requiring employers of 15 or more employees to make reasonable accommodations that would not cause undue hardship to their operations the provisions banning employment discrimination by employers with at least 25 employees went into effect in july 1992 the bans extension to firms with 15 to 25 employees became effective in july 1994 in addition the civil rights act of 1991 cra pl 102166 allows people bringing employment discrimination suits to seek compensatory and punitive damages under the ada and the rehabilitation act of 1973 pl 93112 the flsa makes disabled individuals more attractive to hire by creating lower wage rate for them the ada and cra regard private and public employers who fail to hire retain and promote members of the population with disabilities at rates comparable to other equally qualified workers as contributors to the groups poor employment and earnings outcomes some believe that the success of the laws employment provisions is best determined by whether the employment rate of workingage adults with disabilities increases because lack of job opportunities appears to be an even bigger problem than wage discrimination for this protected class7 yet it is easy matter to separate the impact of legislation from host of other factors that are operating simultaneously eg changes in economic conditions in private sector provision of health benefits and in job requirements away from manual labor and toward higher levels of educational attainment as well as toward teamoriented workplaces toward the close of the decade the congress turned its attention to the supply side of the labor market in the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 among other things pl 106170 is intended to encourage persons with severely limiting health conditions or impairments to increase their work effort by alleviating dilemma of social security disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi beneficiaries namely choosing between job which may not have employerprovided health benefits and continuation of governmentprovided health care coverage through medicare or medicaid8 these provisions became effective in october 2000 the legislation also creates voucher program to be phased in over threeyear period beginning in 2001 that allows ssdi and ssi beneficiaries to obtain employment rehabilitation and other services 6 the ada applies to private employers as well as to state and local governments the federal government federal contractors and other entities that receive federal funds previously were banned from discriminating against qualified persons with disabilities under the rehabilitation act of 1973 for more information see crs report 98921 the americans with disabilities act ada statutory language and recent issues by nancy l jones 7 see for example marjorie baldwin and william g johnson labor market discrimination against men with disabilities in the year of the ada southern economic journal vol 66 3 jan 2000 8 if ssdi or ssi beneficiaries earn above the substantial gainful activity level they lose health care coverage through medicare or medicaid crs4 from providers of their own choice to assist them to get jobs or increase their earnings9 recent administrations also have undertaken various initiatives that focus on the poor labor market outcomes of individuals with disabilities executive order 13078 issued by president clinton on march 13 1998 created the presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities it was charged with seeking ways to increase the share of the adult population with disabilities that has job among other things that same year the us department of educations national institute on disability and rehabilitation research nidrr announced funding under the rehabilitation act of 1973 for six new rehabilitation research and training centers to develop information that addresses the employmentrelated issues of persons with disabilities10 in 2000 the us department of labor dol requested applications for work incentive grants to assist states creating their onestop delivery systems under the workforce investment act of 1998 pl 105220 to provide comprehensive employment and training services to people with disabilities and the following year the office on disability policy was established within the dol the relatively recent implementation of these policies and programs makes it difficult to gauge how successful they have been at enhancing the employment prospects of persons with disabilities the varying definitions of disability contained in programs and surveys compound the problem11 perhaps most importantly so too does the lack of accurate statistics on individuals with disabilities derived from surveys that have asked consistent questions over time the national council on disability noted in 1996 that despite considerable discussion in the last decade about the limitations of databases and the need for database specifically designed to answer policyrelevant questions about people with disabilities little improvement has been evident12 9 for more information see crs report rl31157 ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 implementation status updated by karen tritz 10 the nidrr was established in 1978 as the national institute of handicapped research through amendment of the rehabilitation act of 1973 it is part of the education departments office of special education and rehabilitative services nidrr leads the interagency committee on disability research 11 under the ada for example an individual meets the definition of disability if heshe has physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities has record of such impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment precisely who fits this definition is unclear however as indicated by recent court decisions for more information see crs report rl33304 the americans with disabilities act the definition of disability by nancy lee jones disability is much more narrowly defined in the ssdi and ssi programs where the emphasis is on ones capacity to work to qualify as having disability under the programs person must be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or has lastedis expected to last for continuous period of at least 12 months 12 national council on disability achieving independence the challenge for the 21st continued crs5 in 2004 the council effectively concluded that the situation had not much changed13 the data dilemma one of the charges of eo 13078 recognized the data shortcomings related to the labor force status of persons with disabilities it required the presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities to design and implement statistically reliable and accurate method to measure the employment rate of adults with disabilities as soon as possible but later than the date of termination of the task force 30 days after submitting its final report on july 26 2002 the 10th anniversary of initial implementation of the adas employment provisions data derived from this methodology shall be published on as frequent basis as possible the bureau of labor statistics and census bureau in cooperation with the departments of education and health and human services the national council on disability and the presidents committee on employment of people with disabilities have been among the numerous organizations working toward this end the accomplishment of this charge has been complicated by the fact that 1 universally agreedupon definition of disability does not exist and 2 data source is lacking that incorporates both labor force and disability questions which have undergone testing to determine whether people understand what is being asked ie validity and to which people respond in consistent manner over time ie reliability at the present time the us bureau of the census collects selfreported information from individuals on the disability and labor force status of household members through the decennial census american community survey current population survey survey of income and program participation and national health interview survey14 disability typically is not the primary focus of these surveys 12 continued century washington dcus government printing office 1996 pp 2627 note the national council on disability was created in 1978 by pl 95602 as an advisory board in the department of education it became an independent agency with passage of the rehabilitation act amendments of 1984 pl 98221 the council is charged with promoting policies programs and practices that afford equal opportunity to those with disabilities and that enable them to attain selfsufficiency as well as to become integrated in all aspects of society 13 national council on disability improving federal disability data jan 8 2004 14 unless otherwise indicated information in this section was drawn from conversations with staff at the us bureau of labor statistics the us bureau of the census and the national center for health statistics as well as from the following websites httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwdisabilityhtml and httpwwwcdcgovnchs crs6 federal databases on disability and labor force status census of population and the american community survey acs disability questions are included on the longform of the decennial census of population the number and nature of disability questions have differed over time the 1970 form asked about work disability the 1980 form about work disability and the ability to use public transportation and the 1990 form about work disability the ability to go outside the home alone to shop or visit doctors office and about self care eg bathing or dressing without assistance the work disability questions were fairly consistent from 1970 through 1990 ie having physical mental or other health condition that prevents an individual from working or that limits the amountkind of work an individual can do the disability questions were substantially revised on the 2000 longform based on the judgment of panel of experts and followup testing households that received the revised questionnaire were asked whether physical mental or an emotional condition of at least six months duration creates difficulty in working at job or business going outside the home alone to shop or visit doctors office dressing bathing or getting around inside the home or learning remembering or concentrating in addition question was included on whether respondents have longlasting sensory impairments eg blindness or substantial limitations on physical activities eg reaching or climbing stairs the census bureau intends that the longform of the decennial census be replaced by the more frequently administered comparatively new acs the disability questions in the 19992002 acs were changed from their original 1996 1998 version to agree with those on the 2000 longform the acs questionnaire was changed in 2003 to address the seeming overreporting of disability in the 2000 census and in earlier surveys by moving the questions location and altering instructions to reduce misinterpretation it appears that these changes have reduced the presumed overreporting15 in addition the census bureau will be conducting national content test in 2006 which among many other things will determine whether new disability questions will be introduced in the 2008 acs thus at present neither the decennial census nor the acs can provide data suitable for analyzing changes over time in the employment status of persons with disabilities current population survey cps the purpose of the cps is to enable the us bureau of labor statistics bls to provide timely information on the labor force status ie employed unemployed or not in the labor force and characteristics eg demographic and occupational of the population rather than replying yes or to the question about whether they had worked in the preceding week respondents to the monthly basic cps sometimes say they are disabled if based on additional questions it is determined that an individual who said they are disabled meets the 15 sharon stern and matthew brault disability data from the american community survey brief examination of the effects of question redesign in 2003 us census bureau housing and household economics statistics branch jan 28 2005 crs7 criteria for being employed or unemployed the response disabled is deleted from the record because of this researchers have information on the disability status of employed and unemployed persons from the basic cps16 in march the cps includes supplementary questions about income respondents have been asked annually since march 1980 whether health problem or disability prevents them from working or limits the kind or amount of work they can do it is much like the work disability question that appeared on the 19701990 census longform those who say they have work disability are then asked whether they receive income based on the disability eg workers compensation the ssdi and ssi programs and the black lung program some researchers cross tabulate the work limitation response from the march supplement with the labor force status question in the basic cps to develop employment rates for persons with disabilities because the basic and march supplement questions were not designed for this purpose testing to determine whether they provide valid and reliable estimate of the number of people with work disabilities has never been undertaken the bls therefore considers use of the current version of the cps for this purpose to be inappropriate while acknowledging that work limitationbased questions are not the ideal way to identify the size of the workingage population with disabilities some analysts nonetheless argue that nationally representative employmentfocused data sets like the cps can be used to monitor trends in the employment outcomes of the workingage population with disabilities17 emphasis added survey of income and program participation sipp the survey gathers demographic and economic data by asking core set of questions that is periodically supplemented with questions on different subjects eg the health and disability topical module the two principal ways that have been used to define disability in surveys are in terms of 1 limitations on sensory physical or mental functioning and 2 limitations on activities eg paid employment due to chronic health conditions or impairments18 by and large the sipp relies on the former approach and the national health interview survey described below on the latter some observers believe that definition based on functional limitations is superior to one based on activity limitations both approaches generally rely on the medical model of disability that focuses on individuals rather than on environmental factors which not only can affect peoples actual performance but also how those with equally disabling conditions reply to survey questions 16 thomas w hale the lack of disability measure in todays current population survey monthly labor review june 2001 p 38 17 richard v burkhauser mary c daly andrew j houtenville and nigar nargis self reported worklimitation data what they can and cannot tell us demography vol 39 3 aug 2002 p 553 18 third approach less often taken to define disability is receipt of ssdi and ssi benefits the number of beneficiaries will be less than the number of persons who report they have functional or activity limitations because the government programs require that disability be proved medically and because some eligible individuals may not apply for the programs crs8 respondents to the sipp are considered to have disability if they indicate that they experience difficulty performing certain sensory or physical functions eg seeing words in newspapers or lifting an object weighing 10 pounds activities of daily living adls eg eating or getting around inside the home or instrumental activities of daily living iadls eg going outside the home or keeping track of bills people who indicate that they have physical mental or other health condition that prevents them from or restricts the kindamount of work they can perform around the house or at job also are deemed to have disability in addition respondents who state that they use assistive devices eg wheelchairs or canes have specific conditions eg developmental disorders or alzheimers disease or are under age 65 and covered by certain benefit programs eg ssi are considered to have disability over the years there has been some cognitive pretesting of the sipp disability questions to ascertain their validity it has long been argued however that asking people whether they are limited in the kindamount of work they can do lacks face validity because their responses would depend upon environmental conditions eg the presence of workplace accommodations19 for this reason question was added to allow respondents to indicate whether they have condition which makes finding job or remaining employed difficult without stating that they are limited regardless of environmental considerations the sipps disability module and core questionnaire have been fairly consistent since 1990 but as just discussed questions were added to try to better capture the meaning of disability20 the presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities found that the sipp produced sizeable fluctuations in the disability status of individuals within just years time21 which suggests that at least some of its disability estimates lack reliability22 as individuals in the sipp are interviewed at fourmonth intervals over two or more years the longitudinal survey is subject to attrition and to timein sample bias23 both of which can adversely affect the quality of estimates derived from one period to the next moreover change in administration of the work disability question to the 1996 panel as opposed to earlier panels of respondents has yielded noncomparable estimates over time these observations led census bureau analyst to conclude in 2000 that there is currently satisfactory vehicle for producing measure over time of the employment status of individuals with 19 john m mcneil employment earnings and disability paper prepared for the 75th annual conference of the western economic association international june 29july 3 2000 hereafter cited as mcneil employment earnings and disability 20 other added questions concern having difficulty using handsfingers and having mental problems that seriously interfere with everyday activities 21 presidential task force on employment of adults with disabilities the second report nov 1999 22 mcneil employment earnings and disability 23 attrition has to do with an increase in the nonresponse rate among sample units over the life of survey timeinsample bias has to do with the propensity of individuals to offer different replies to the same questions depending on the number of times they have been asked those questions crs9 disabilities24 other analysts dispute this contention they have shown that certain questions from select comparable interviews can be used in trend analyses25 that is to say the problem may reside less with the questions themselves than with the way analysts have utilized the sipp national health interview survey nhis the purpose of the national center for health statistics annual survey is to provide information on chronic health conditions health status health care utilization and disability in addition several federal agencies and private foundation funded twopart disability supplement that was conducted along with the 1994 and 1995 nhis as the most comprehensive survey on disability since 197826 it contains plethora of information that allows construction of variety of definitions for disability the supplements questionnaire was widely reviewed by interested parties in the disability community voluntarily tested by persons with disabilities in the national centers cognitive questionnaire lab and pretested by some 250 households the annual nhis is ongoing it asked consistent disability and labor force questions between 1982 and 1996 although the survey underwent major revision in 1997 some of the earlier disability questions were carried forward results from the annual nhis like those from the disability supplement typically are made available for tabulation and analysis by members of the research community rather than regularly being released in center publications in the annual nhis prior to 1997 individuals were considered to have disabilities if they reported chronic condition or an impairment that prevented them from or limited their ability to perform agedependent major life activities eg attending school in the case of children age 517 or taking care of oneself in the case of someone at least 70 years old or limited their ability in any way to perform any other activities eg social or family pursuits respondents aged 1869 who reported that an impairment or health problem completely prevented them from working or restricted the kindamount of work they could perform were deemed to have work limitations the nhis also asked people if they needed assistance in performing adls or iadls as in the sipp respondents with limitations who needed assistance did not necessarily indicate that they had conditions or impairments that restricted their ability to work in those instances where individuals identified an activity limitation they were asked about the specific health condition that led to the limitation and how long it lasted beginning with the redesigned 1997 nhis questionnaire some changes were made to the abovedescribed items for example the questions which determine 24 mcneil employment earnings and disability pp 1718 25 elaine m maag and david c wittenburg real trends or measurement problems disability and employment trends from the survey of income and program participation washington dc the urban institute may 2003 p 26 hereafter cited as maag and wittenburg real trends or measurement problems 26 intermittently between the early 1960s and 1978 the social security administration conducted the survey of disability and work to study the prevalence of disability in the workingage population and the experience of ssdi beneficiaries and their families crs10 work limitation were reworded to ascertain if physical mental or emotional problem prevents or restricts the kindamount of work person can perform to eliminate an upper age limit and to allow acute in addition to chronic conditions as causes of work disability questions similar to those in the sipp were added to ascertain the presence of functional limitations in context that is not activity specific eg the degree of difficulty walking or lifting the questions are asked only for one randomly chosen adult per family included in the survey other differences between the federal data sources the timeliness of results differ the population census is conducted once every 10 years and statistics derived from it are released with considerable lag shortcoming that the acs was developed in part to overcome information from the annual nhis and the sipp are available with fairly lengthy lag as well in contrast results from the march cps supplement are released about six months after it is conducted and selected labor force data from the monthly cps are published the month after it is conducted the composition of the samples also differs the labor force questions in the redesigned nhis are administered only to those respondents age 18 or older in the decennial census acs and sipp to those age 15 or older and in the cps to persons age 16 or older moreover unlike the nhis and cps both of which cover the civilian noninstitutional population the sipp includes members of the civilian and military resident population excluding armed forces personnel living in military barracks these three surveys exclude the institutionalized population which is covered by the decennial census and is expected to be covered by the acs the questions in the surveys also have reference periods of varying length which can affect an individuals labor force status sipp respondents are asked about their activities over fourmonth reference period during which lengthy interval person could very well have been employed and unemployed before the 1997 revision nhis respondents were asked about their labor force activity during the twoweek period preceding the interview the reference period subsequently was changed to the week before the interview is held in the cps an individual is counted as employed if heshe worked for pay or profit for one hour or in the case of family business for 15 hours on an unpaid basis during the oneweek reference period that precedes the survey week or as unemployed if heshe was available for work and actively sought job during the four weeks preceding the survey week as neither the sipp nor the nhis has the same precision as the cps in determining labor force activity an individual who is deemed out of the labor force in the cps could be counted as an unemployed worker in the two other surveys27 27 for example while in all three surveys person without job must look for work to be classified as unemployed the cps specifies the actions the individual must undertake to fulfill its definition of actively seeking employment if the person does not take one of these actions heshe will be counted in the cps as nonparticipant in the labor force in the nhis and sipp as an unemployed member of the labor force crs11 although these various factors can impact the quality of survey estimates perhaps the most important factor that affects efforts to collect quantitative information on persons with disabilities is one of definition some observers have concluded that work disability is multidimensional complex concept that investigators do not know how to define well disability or limitations in participation are result of complex interaction among an individual and his or her attributes the physical and social environment and the accommodations and barriers to participation the measurement of disability is further confounded by the fact that all characteristics whether intrinsic individual characteristics or characteristics of the environment change with time28 how much progress has been made in the development of timely accurate and reliable employment statistics on persons with disabilities the presidential task force established the employment rate measurement methodology work group ermm which is composed of some 15 federal agencies the ermm has been working on implementing eo 13078s charge concerning the development of timely accurate and reliable labor force data for persons with disabilities the ermms longterm goal has been incorporation of questions in the cps that would enable the release of labor force estimates for people with disabilities as is done for other population groups eg women and racialethnic minorities toward that end after they had undergone extensive testing numerous questions on disability and labor force status were asked as part of the national comorbidity survey ncs in 2001 and 200229 the hope was that small subset would perform as well as the full battery of questions in order to minimize the burden that would be placed on respondents were disability questions integrated in the basic cps analysis of the questions was conducted by outside experts and the best seven questions were selected30 this set of questions underwent further testing before bls presented it and the related research to the ermm the ermm raised some concerns that were addressed through further testing all testing outside the context of the cps was completed in 2004 the final test is inclusion of the question set in the february 2006 supplement to the cps after the supplement receives clearance from the office of management and budget and if it subsequently is determined that the questions perform well without too adversely affecting the response rate to the 28 nancy mathiowetz and gooloo s wunderlich ed survey measurement of work disability summary of workshop washington dc national academy press 2000 p 55 29 the national comorbidity survey is conducted by ron kessler at harvard medical schools department of health care policy primary funding for the survey comes from the national institute of mental health 30 terence m mcmenamin tom hale haejin kim and douglas kruse designing questions to identify people with disabilities in labor force surveys history of the work of bls to measure the employment level of adults with disabilities draft crs12 survey they could be added to the monthly cps this might occur in 2007 at the earliest the employment status of persons with disabilities in recent decades as just discussed all of the available federal surveys that collect data both on persons with disabilities and on labor force status suffer from various shortcomings in an effort to mitigate the data limitations researchers sometimes have taken the approach of utilizing multiple surveys to determine whether they are telling the same story generally speaking they are the impact of changing economic conditions 19811992 as shown in table 1 the proportion of the population with disabilities that was in the labor force ie employed or unemployed dropped by 45 during the recession of the early 1980s at the same time the labor force participation rate of the population without disabilities declined by lesser degree 10 similarly during the recession of the early 1990s the labor force participation rate of the workingage population with disabilities fell to greater degree relative to the rate among people without disabilities 41 and 08 respectively conversely over the 19831990 period when the economy was expanding the labor force activity of individuals with disabilities rose much more than activity among individuals without disabilities 140 and 88 respectively table 1 percent change in the labor force participation rate of 18 to 64yearolds by disability status 19811992 percent change in the share of the civilian period noninstitutional population that is in the labor force with disabilities without disabilities 19811983 45 10 19831990 140 88 19901992 41 08 source analysis of nhis data as shown in edward h yelin and patricia p katz labor force trends of persons with and without disabilities monthly labor review oct 1994 one might conclude based upon these data that the labor force status of persons with disabilities is more sensitive to the business cycle than that of persons without disabilities in other words persons with disabilities appear to be harmed more by downswings in the economy and helped more by economic upswings as discussed in the following section however this relationship seemingly did not hold up during the strong and lengthy economic expansion that followed the 19901991 recession crs13 what happened during the 1990s economic expansion the 1990s could have been among the best of times for the workingage population with disabilities because of in particular order enactment of the previously mentioned legislation advances in assistive technologies and the existence of an extremely tight labor market31 not only would robust economic conditions be expected to encourage people who might have given up looking for jobs to reenter the labor force but also dwindling supply of workers would be expected to make firms more willing to hire and if necessary train persons whom they previously might not have considered or might have avoided the timing of employers clamoring for workers could have been particularly fortuitous for the large minority of adult beneficiaries with disabilities in the temporary assistance to needy families tanf program who face timelimited cash assistance under the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 10419332 as shown in table 2 this does not appear to have been the case the employed share of 1864 year olds with disabilities broadly defined did not change significantly through 1996 according to data from the nhis see column 3 cps data on work disability reveal the same lack of improvement from the mid1990s through the remainder of the decade as the labor market tightened further33 additionally based upon variety of definitions of disability available in the sipp the employment status of 2561 year olds with disabilities was found to have deteriorated over the 19901996 period34 in contrast the proportion of the working age population without disabilities who had jobs rose substantially according to data from all three surveys defying expectations then the employment situation of persons with disabilities visavis persons without disabilities seemingly worsened during the economic expansion of the 1990s 31 michelle conlin the new workforce tight labor market gives the disabled the

tanf benefits also reported that they had disabilities as unmarried women with children under the age of 18 appear more likely to receive tanf benefits if the mothers have disability disability may

opportunities for people with disabilities disability statistics report 17 washington dc us department of education national institute on disability and rehabilitation research may 2003 this definition of persons with disabilities includes survey respondents who said that they had health condition or impairment that limited their performance of major life activities eg paid work or housework or other life activities eg family community or social pursuits as well as persons who said that they had health condition or impairment that prevented them from working ie severe work disabilities b this definition of persons with disabilities includes survey respondents who said that they had health condition or impairment that limited the kindamount of work they could do but did not prevent them from working much different picture of the decade emerges based upon unemployment data both nhis and cps data suggest that the decrease in unemployment among labor force participants was significant and steeper for persons with than without disabilities35 the explanation for this seeming paradox is that the employment rate is populationbased measure and some individuals in the population are uninterested in working eg retirees or consider themselves unable to work eg due to poor health in contrast the unemployment rate is based upon more narrowly defined group of people those who already have or are actively seeking jobs that is to say those who want to and who consider themselves able to work an alternative employment rate of people with disabilities who report they are willing and able to work shows statistically significant increases during the 1990s expansion see column 4 in table 2 using this alternative measure as the standard the 35 kaye improved employment opportunities for people with disabilities crs15 employment gap between persons with and without disabilities shrank substantially during the 1990s expansion one explanation that has been posited for the poor labor market performance of the aggregate population with disabilities during the last decade is change over time in its composition specifically shift toward people who report they are unable to work the increase in inability to work seems evident among both men and women and across the age spectrum except for youth age 1829 these selfreports appear to be supported by less subjective measures that show an increased prevalence of poor health status more severe functional limitations and greater need for personal assistance with adls and iadls among persons with disabilities the increased selfreporting of inability to work among the population with disabilities may thus be legitimate and accurate reflection of real worsening in the degree of work limitation36 assuming that the share of persons with severe work disabilities remains elevated it could prove difficult to narrow the wide gap between the employment rates of people with and without disabilities this finding also raises fundamental question about whether all adults with disabilities including those with very work limiting impairments are likely to be able to participate in the labor force and to succeed at finding and keeping jobs the 106th congress responded affirmatively to this question when it passed the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of 1999 as its intent is increasing work activity among portion of the adult population with severe disabilities namely ssdi and ssi beneficiaries who have medically demonstrated physical or mental impairments of long duration that impede their participation in the labor force policy analysts have examined other explanations for the comparatively poor labor market performance of the population with disabilities during the 1990s they include expansion of the ssdi and ssi programs unintended consequences associated with enactment and implementation of the ada increased health care costs and changes in the makeup of the population eg educational attainment the results of this research have prompted some to suggest that improvement in the employment outcomes of persons with disabilities might be attained by on the demand side subsidizing the cost of employer accommodations and by on the supply side assisting already employed persons with disabilities retain their current jobs among other things37 36
