6307c09 shspec281 the free being the shsbc is the place that you have been coming to for the last trillion trillion years it is lrhs job to make auditors who can clear up the track if we hadnt waited so long it would have been easier but two things prevented its being done sooner 1 the state of civilization 2 the previous failure to realize that the cycle was the cycle of loss of the ot being now had come to the point of believing that the only safe place to be was in meatbody civilization the fight the quality of life had been lost peculiarly enough freedom as an ot has come down almost into pi say to 500 years ago for some but they were lost too there is way to obtain and maintain stability as an ot as things stand what is peculiar about this war on ots was that it was lost by the most powerful all battles are won by combination of force and intelligence given enough force you dont need much intelligence viz nuclear bombs but then all you get is shortterm win longterm win is achieved only by balance between force and intelligence intelligence alone is never enough for instance in the communist takeover of tibet the wise men of tibet were powerless to prevent it there is an imbalance in any defeat any coordinated civilization combining technology with force and keeping force and intelligence balanced can make monkey out of an ot literally there is an implant four galaxies over that taught you that you came from apes the whole darwinian theory is implanted there in about day in fact thetans had different tastes relative to bodies for instance some liked caveman cultures and some didnt this is not evolution it is just different mockups for thetans the civilizations of treetop premen and of cavemen were just two different styles with evolution between them the deterioration of matter is not nearly as rapid as scientists think it is and the earth has been here much longer than they think carbon14 dating methods the measurement of time elapsed by deterioration of atoms doesnt work because this deterioration doesnt occur as fast as scientists think suns in this area have been burning for at least 200 trillion years dark stars suns that look as though they have gone out were never lit they dont go out so society is full of misapprehensions and stupidities that themselves act as traps these stupidities are intelligently conceived as means of cohesing society ignorance is used by the intelligent as means of entrapment if everyone remains ignorant of the society nobody can get out of it so they have choice but to cooperate and keep society going so these meatbody societies operate on combination of mediocre intelligence and mediocre force they make the airplane and the space ship and progress further then they disintegrate societies repeat patterns over and over again thetans get on different kicks and make these societies but beware of societies with as much progress as there is on this planet various unusual forces are at work here this planet is evolving unusually fast because for one thing it is being used as dumping ground it is on the periphery of the galaxy sun 12 is handy to other galaxies and to the center of this galaxy it is still being used as dumping ground for that reason this planet has very heterogenous society and lots of trouble because one is guiding it most planets have some guiding thetan these dont change they are rather like little play town there is master hand guiding this planet if there were there would be far less trouble than there is when you take thetans that have been indoctrinated to have certain types of societies in bodies that have been mocked up and then they get scooped up and dumped as unwanted in one place you have lots of different impulses at work one with the other this produces lots of friction that is what our society is this society belongs nominally to the espinol united stars or the espinol united moons planets and asteroids this quarter of the universe is ours this is sun 12 there has been command post occupied for this system now since 1150 ad at the time when group on mars was finally abolished and vanished you notice that at that time there was sudden resurgence in science and learning it became an uncontrolled civilization and one has been paying any attention to the dumping that has been going on since nobody took any interest in this system and it has been running wild ever since that time probably the most basic impulse on the planet is simply the basic impulse of thetans who have been reduced to more or less meat body level which is total cooperation with one another as you see in communism we are all equal there must be personalities of any kind and the cult of personalities must be banished this is the least common denominator of implants and indoctrination the notion that they must have teammates why did you arrive on this planet in the condition you are in good reason particularly certainly not just because of the overtmotivator sequence though you will try to find the overts you did that pulled it in you are still trying to be reasonable and intelligent about it you think that there had to be reason it is true that you have overts but the only reason you were ever punished was for being you for being powerful and for not being quite intelligent enough the exact crimes were to be there and to communicate once upon time some ot came along and for fun put together civilization complete with curbstones and hairdos some other thetan came along and interfered in some way so to get even the first thetan would indoctrinate his pet society on how to trap big thetan so this became the most accomplished skill that meat body society had how to trap spirit ot was ever so out of his mind as to depend upon any of his men or troops to untrap him he never taught them to do that because at the time he was doing this it never occurred to him that he would be caught singularly unintelligent it isnt this universe that did it you were just knuckleheaded not enough intelligence was used proportional to the force tributes to god are tributes to the workings of an ot creating the entire universe seems like very intelligent action but it was knuckleheaded because one worked out how to reverse it to unbuild it to cause things to asis this lack of intelligence was recently dramatized by frankie the limpers funding the atom bomb without building defense against it ots in the past have employed too much force and too little intelligence an ot could build anything atoms molecules suns traps but he didnt bother to figure out how to turn it off when he got tired of it the problem came from an insistence on matter that was to endure forever this was not smart eventually that is what theta poles were made of thats the pole youve been on confounded things last forever its possible to be trapped for over 135 trillion trillion years the tech for trapping thetans is vast but there is nothing on how do you get him off of it here is problem how can you free thetans when there are ots left all an ot has to do is to pull the trapped thetan off and toss him out in space to cool off seems simple but it requires an ot and what if there isnt any einstein was dead wrong he only contributed to the ignorance by which you get trapped space wagons used to travel trillions of light years per day teleportation is pipe dream you just unmock body here and mock it up there its not the same atoms the skill of making matter disappear has been grievously neglected like the tech of how to free thetan the failure to teach meat body society equally to free or to trap was just unintelligent this situation is like the phenomenon of stuck or single flows in processing where if you run motivators long enough the pc will give you an overt you can always get trouble when you run only one side of flow that is important to you because it says where you sit as being at this exact moment and why you are interested in the technology before you and why it is appearing at this time everyone will tell you that this technology is impossible it isnt it is only neglected they think it is impossible because they have outflowed the reverse technology the technology isnt neglected because the lack of it didnt cause societies trouble it did the galactic confederation is in trouble right now because of this lack the confederation operates on limited ot basis its hierarchy of command is that of limited level of ot and it goes down from ots at the top to the doll body as the ship captain and the post captain and down to meat bodies it is one of the few civilizations that has endured long time just because it has used these different levels they have tried to maintain nochange condition which is dangerous and impossible if you dont improve you decline the problem of the galactic confederation is that they have run out of the ots that are needed to command units that is the limiting factor on how big they could be since not once in 80 trillion years has anyone ever suggested repairing ots they have static and therefore declining society ots get peculiar they get fitful they get moody they can get keyed in and all they could do about it was to subdue the errant thetan turn sleeplight on him tell him to get more solid and take him down to the hospital i know i was there i was the guy they did it to if the technology of untrapping is so vital why hasnt someone worked on it because they are afraid of the technology governments would fear ots if they knew about them the galactic federation of course does they would worry about how you could maintain the social strata and the fixed organization if every janitor could be an ot it would be fine if you could restrict the technology to ots but it would spread to doll body and meat body beings they would fear the social and political upset that would occur if you freed thetans youd have to give them political solution which was as great as the political threat you cannot give them tech without taking responsibility for it or nobodyd listen to you people on earth dont think that scientology doesnt work but theyve been trained against the vector of it theyve been trained to destroy to entrap to set up fixed status of something and then work out destructive means of entrapment with it so people cannot leave certain social and economic strata of the society you are not up against pavlov freud etc you pose tremendous threat to the social structure of our current civilization you can tear it to pieces by rehabilitation of thetans tremendous power and force which can only be safe if there is also tremendous intelligence connected with it so that the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics will be produced for instance an ot can pull the air cover mammoths have been found in the polar regions with freshfrozen vegetables in their stomachs to explain this phenomenon it would be necessary to explain the fact that they must have been quickfrozen in sixty seconds in tropical region what natural cataclysm could have taken place in sixty seconds somebody pulled the air cover and gave the planet reverse spin because they got mad an ot who could do such thing in fit of pique would be terribly dangerous an overt act doesnt just damage it damages the greater number of dynamics one can commit an overt act unintentionally by lacking data or not using sufficient intelligence to see what really is for the greatest good but really heavy overt act is one where one deliberately sets out to damage the greater number of dynamics keep this in mind during secchecking you should be looking for actions that are really harmful to greater number of dynamics not just some irresponsible actions an overt act is often realized after the fact you could have done it smarter way that wouldnt have been an overt so you get regret and hungup overts you seldom find anything in this lifetime that is real deliberate overt it has been awhile since the guy had power enough to do real overt some thetans will take on their shoulders more responsibility than is rightfully theirs however running dubbedin overts wont get them anywhere but under all that there is real overt of magnitude phase of this universe has taken place and ended the phase of the free being the free being has lost to solid unintelligent meanlevel societies another cycle opens up now this new cycle involves different kind of being one that is as strong as the old but experienced not as stupid because now you know what the score is now you have good reality on meatbody society and can see their political frailties and the impossibility of obliterating them because they start again elsewhere they can be managed handled helped or thrown on reverse vector the use of intelligence with force can maintain freedom of action without racking up new bank and new overts new war against the thetan there has never been lasting or intelligent society of free beings for asisness has dropped out as an ability and needs to be put back in but such society is needed since everyone on his own puts everyone downscale in the long run if freedom means total irresponsibility up and down the line you are not talking about freedom you are talking about catastrophe we dont need war we need balanced technology with the ability to meld force and intelligence we need knowhow and force not knowhow in the use of force we need balanced intelligence that can reverse what one does unmocking matter as well as making it freeing as well as entrapping if you know how to enslave people you should know how to free people if you are going to make up matter dont insist that it be indestructible in dealing with meat body societies dont just stir up the ant hill it will just disperse and continue to grow the era of total irresponsibility is over long cycle is over in this universe the cycle of the free being vs the meat body society is over the battle was lost and the free being doesnt exist anymore we shift gears by just putting some intelligence in with the force freedom with barriers is insupportable there is nothing in this case to be free from or to push against freedom must be worked for if you think that you will stay clear or ot just by never destroying anything again you are nuts criminals should be permitted to free themselves through compensating victims not to do things for the greatest good of the greater number of dynamics is an overt of omission one cant maintain freedom in the face of failure of such magnitude you cannot be or make an irresponsible ot we have to continue to take responsibility for our fellows not to take responsibility for others is to lose our own freedom in the end
