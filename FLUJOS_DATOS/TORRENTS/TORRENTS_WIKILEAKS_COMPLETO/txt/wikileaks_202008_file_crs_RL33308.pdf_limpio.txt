hiring grants moreover the gao estimated that cops fundi ng contributed to 13 decline in the overall crime rate and 25 decline in the violent crime rate for the years 1993 to 200021 doj oig report 2003 doj office of the inspector gene ral oig audit of the cops program noted that there is structural overlap between office of justice programs ojp and cops and there is duplication in some of ojps and cops grant program22 according to the oig cops entered into series of reimbursable agreements each year with ojp to have ojp provide services to help co ps carry out its mission the oig also found that an increasing pe rcentage of cops funding was being administered by ojp23 nij report in 2000 the national institute of justice nij published the findings of an evaluation of the cops program it sponsored through grant to the urban institute24 the evaluation focused on cops grants abling law enforcement agencies 1 to hire police officers to engage in community policing activities and 2 to redeploy existing officers to community policing by increasing officer productivity through the acquisition of technology or by freeing up officers for community policing by filling some officerheld positions w ith civilians some of the findings that nij reported included httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33308crs9 25 the researchers noted that 39600 of th 105000 funded officers reported by the cops office were funded through more grants th researchers also noted that local law enforcement agencies sometimes overestimated the number of officer ftes that they would be able to redeploy as result of purchasin g new technology or hiring civilians for some positions also in the case of hiring grants the researchers noted that local law enforcement agencies had to hire and train fficers after they received their hiring grant hence an officer was not imme diately put on the beat after th hiring grant was awarded to the agency of the 105000 officer and officer equivalents funded by the cops program by may 1999 the urban in stitute estimated that between 84700 and 89400 of the funded police officers would have been deployed by 200325 cops funding helped promote the adoption of community policing by local law enforcement agencies but in most cases cops funding furthered community policing efforts that had already started also local law enforcement agencies dopted programs that fit their definition of community policing building partnerships between cops grantees and the community was commonplace but all too often the partnerships were in name only or were simply tempor ary working relationships one percent of cops grantees with the largest 1997 murder counts received 31 of all cops funds awarded through 1997 and 10 of cops grantees with the largest 1997 murder counts received 50 of all cops funds awarded through 1997 the cops program facilitated the efforts of agency chief executives who were inclined towards innova tion and represented perhaps the largest effort to bolster developm ent of law enforcement technology since the 1967 presidents commission on law enforcement and administration of justice conclusion in 2006 the cops program was reauthor ized through fy2009 the level of funding appropriated to the overall cops program decreased from fy2002 to fy2006 but it increased in each of fy 2007 and fy2008 in r ecent years cops appropriations have increasin gly gone to funding technology programs as the cops program continues to evolve several questions may concern lawmakers including will cops become program that solely funds technology efforts for state and local law enforcement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33308crs10 if congress chooses to provide f unding for cops hiring program it might want to consider whether providing funding to state and local law enforcement agencies for hiring community policing officers is an costeffective way to fight crime to prevent overlap in the structure of the programs administered by the cops office and ojp should cops be responsible for managing all of the funding appropriated to it rather than transferring some of its activitie s to ojp should congress move funding for programs that have
