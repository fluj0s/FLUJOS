follow the steps outlined below the kg84 tek and the satellite orderwire tsk which is us ed for timing purposes will be loaded the example shown here will be with common fill device cfd such as kyk13 or kyx15 the procedure for loading with data transfer device dtd the anc yz10 or koi18 cfd is very similar with the exception that the fill is initiated from the fill device rather than the radio note the fill device should be attached to the radio after the function switch has been put into the ld position and the radio displays the fill menu the fill device should be removed from the radio before the function switch is taken out of the ld position as well note the satellite tsk is required regardless of the radio mode pt or ct 1 rotate the function switch to the pt or ct position 2 allow radio

anprc117f radio should be connected to the pc using the hpw cable harris pn 105130710a006 the connection between the radio and pc is pointtopoint ppp connection that uses dialup networking you can verify that t he dialup networking connection is setup properly by doing the following windows 98 open up my computer from the pcs desktop and doubleclick on the dialup networking icon right click on the harris radio c onnection and select properties verify that the connection speed is 115200 the format is 8 data bits parity 1 stop bit and flow control usually under the advanced options to verify the proper networking paramet ers open the control panel and doubleclick on the network icon choose the dialup adapter and select properties under the advanced tab make sure that ip packet size is set to large and not automatic this can have an effect on attachments if not set properly the internet protocol tcpip properties s hould be setup to specify the ip address as 10002 the advanced tcpip settings should not have ip header compression selected for the ppp link windows 2000 open the control panel and doubleclick on the network and dialup connections icon right click on the harris radio c onnection and select properties under the general tab click the confi gure button and verify that the connection speed is 115200 all hardware features should not be selected under the networking tab click the settings button and verify all the ppp settings are not selected and click ok select the internet protocol tcpip from the components list and click the properties button verify that the ip address is set to 100 02 and then click on the advanced button verify that the use ip header compression is not selected once the settings have been verified double clicki ng on the harris radio connection can test the connection to the radio if successful the c onnection status should change to connected if the connection fails verify that the c able is connected to the proper com port on the pc and to the j3 port of the radio verify you are usi ng the correct cable the radio should be turned on into pt ct or td mode the current net does not have to be conf igured for hpw nor does comesc need to be loaded for this test to be conducted but will need to be configured when using the rf6710 wmt software for hpw operations frequently asked questions q why does the harris protocol status window r eport that the protocol state is not in hpw mode the active net on the radio is not an hpw net q why does the harris protocol status wi ndow report that the protocol state is unoperational the cable may not be connected properly the dialup networking connection properties may be wrong see the connecti ng the radio to the pc section of this application note and verify the correct parameters are set q why does the message i just finished receiv ing not show up in the inbox and the event log reports failure to decrypt message the kg84 tek is not the same at the transmitting radio as your radio q why does the harris protocol status window report that received probes are from erroneous and changing hpw addresses the hpw time of da in your radio is offset by more than 30 seconds from the transmitting radio q why arent i seeing probes from transmi tting station or acknowledges back from receiving station if voice check on nonhpw net is successful the satellite tsk is most likely not the same between your radio and the user with whom you are trying to communicate
