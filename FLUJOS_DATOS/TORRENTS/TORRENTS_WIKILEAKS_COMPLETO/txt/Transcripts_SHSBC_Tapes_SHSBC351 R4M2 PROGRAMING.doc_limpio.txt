r4m2 programing lecture given on 31 october 1963 well you have day here hallows eve allhallows eve isnt that the date audience yes well well talk about ghosts are you ghost children plague with this they get lot of scientology around and it gets in conflicts with their childrens textbooks andand get quite confused with definitions of what is ghost you see and that sort of thing we frankly we need undoubtedly small textbook on this subject you see scientology one junior thetan is not necessarily ghost you see but everybody is thetan bodythetan minus body equal ghost october 31that the date audience yes all right ad 13 saint hill special briefing course another lecture on r4 your morale i can see sinking steadily steadily steadily small tiny pennon showing just the tip of it as the ship sinks beneath the waves you see sort of feeling of good god how can we possibly climb this hill you see i mean its all too complicated and too much is being demanded of it and i cant possibly do it i cant possibly audit you know this kind of feelings that sweep across one or feelings like good heavens what will i be doing to pc is itis it really safe oh god you know well do i dare say anything to the pc at all everything i say is wrong and so forth and its all too complicated and so forth well youre right except for one thing its not all too complicated you are see youre too complicated for instance there are certain little things that happen in auditing such as when the needle is moving nicely in blowdowns and the ta is going down the auditor who opens his yap is fool see i meanyou dont even have to put it elegantly and when the ta isnt doing anything and the needle isnt doing anything and youre not getting any tone arm action the auditor who doesnt do something is fool you got the idea now the auditor who only acts when the ta is moving and who never acts when the ta is motionless well he of course is making more trouble for himself than you can shake stick at the basic rule very simple very simple when youve got ta motion in progress shut up be quiet dont do anything dont even lift your pencil just sit there and watch it move take some delight in the smooth sweep of down moving ta you see and keep on taking delight in it until ifs longer happening and youll be ahead every time and when the ta isnt moving and when the needle isnt moving do something actually thats auditing against the ta its simply coordination youve already got the rules in bulletin undoubtedly thats one of the most important rules there is right now there probably is more really important rule than that in handling pcs and meters just that see well you say well we move into r4 of course all that is swept aside oh everything you know how to do at lower levels you do at r4 but at r4 of course you are expected to be in there pitching quicker when you got motionless ta and motionless needle and youre expected to be in there rapidly youre not supposed to sit there for the next half an hour to find out if its going to move dont you see because this isthis is quick stuff this is auditing by quick step and when that ta starts to move and thatyou get an occasional blowdown on that meter and that ta is moving down and so forth well you shouldnt be doing thing you shouldnt be trying to find new goal and you shouldnt be trying to make the pc list and you say well all right the pc should be talking well thats mistake somebodys been making around the w unit the pc must talk in order to have the itsa line in what is an itsa line its the pc talking thats not the pc talking that is the pc itsaing see that itsaing pc who is itsaing is simply looking at and identifying something and you get totally motionless pc who is sitting there with his eyeballs swiveled around 180 degrees looking into his skull and youll be getting beautiful blowdowns on the needle and so forth well the auditor who gets busy and ambitious at that time ought to have his shins kicked see he can stop all of his ta motion just by getting active at that moment well we dont care if the pc sits there for twenty minutes without anything being done by the auditor at all and nothing being said by the pc perfectly all right you got ta motion during those twenty minutesyou got ta motion during those twenty minutes the pc must be itsaing must be because the tone arm is moving and youll see tone arm sometime go down and pcs looking is this my goal is this my goal lets see if this is my goal and so on and so on and so on and then so so on and so on and if i dont so on so on and i havewell when i was four or five i used to worry little bit about this and so forth yes and so on and when i was ten i did and so on of course hes not saying anything hes just sitting there thats whats really going on you see but hes to the auditor hes just sort of going now the auditor who cheerily cheerily at that moment realizes hes got to be interesting and wake the pc up and that sort of thing just isnt paying attention to his meter youll see that tone arm go down and halt and stop for moment and climb and then go down again and youll see blowdowns large surges and that sort of thing going on now and then on the meter and so forth well thats what youre supposed to have happening in session see see you see its just emphasis on whats supposed to happen in session well if you think session is something in which an auditor does something or session is something in which pc talks or session is something in which an auditor and pc have arc breaks or if you have any odd definition of session which throws this out of course you wont grasp this very readily at all and you actually will miss the boat and there goes your ta bang then you get to the end of the session and dont record any ta why every time the pc started to get his attention on something and get the itsa maker running on the thing you know and looking at it and the thing started to blow the auditor said yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap and the pcthe pc says whatwhat oh weoh yes yes and of course did suppress and that stopped the blowdown and of course you got ta thats it see you finished it right there well whats supposed to happen in session is youre supposed to have ta moving youre supposed to have things happening to the needle and the ta and if you dont have to do anything to make things happen to the needle and the ta well that hasnt anything to do with it either all youre supposed to do is have something happening to the needle and the ta and when nothing is happening to the needle and the ta you of course have to audit like mad but when something is happening you better not do anything see its as simple as that and if you can get it its as simple mechanism as when the car is running forward you leave the clutch out when the car is motionless you put the clutch in do you see i mean its that kind of datum see well thats how you drive session it is more complicated than that dont you see the only mistake you make is once in while youll fumble it just to this degree the pc has got ahold of something isnt quite seeing it and for moment or two nothing happens on the meter it doesnt start to blowdown yet dont you see and the auditor says well its motionless meter so therefore id better ask question you see and he says did and just at that moment it starts down see and hes goofed you see well hes got to be clever enough auditor to adjust the clutch accordingly you see right now adjust that clutch see why did i open my mouth its as simple as this this is driving an emeter and theres really nothing much to it and you get more complicated about it why youre in grad bad trouble now as long as meter is moving then as long as youre getting down ta divisions and so forth great skill is required of the auditor he just goes through routine activities for instance in r4 well he finds the item and he calls it back to the pc and it fell and then he waits until the tone arm motion is gone out of the thing and then asks the pc the courtesy questions about it you see is it your item you know and other things like this as long as he isnt getting any motion he goes on with his job as soon as he gets motion he stops going on with his job well thats all very routine you dont run into any trouble really with that you could memorize and performif youif you know this thing about driving an emeter you could then memorize and perform the other steps necessary to the execution of r4 well perhaps in couple of hours its pretty hard to sometimes coordinate all thewrite and watch the meter at the same time and so forth but thats just coordination see just coordination when do you shift gears without stripping out all of theall of the teeth see its that kind of lesson you know youre supposed to say soandso and soandso and youre supposed to write down soandso and soandso and youre supposed to see meter reaction when you see that meter reaction youre supposed to say thank you and call it back to the pc and then it normally falls and that was the item thats all there is to it dont you see i mean these are very simple actionselementary if you just look at the set of actual actions which you perform based on this driving the meter plus these little other elementary actions which you take dont salt it down with eight thousand seven hundred and sixtysix billion rules see you just be there in the session and do those little simple actions which comprise r4 and actually as long as the case is running perfectly youve got it made see you got thatthat little spook phrase in there as long as the case is running perfectly youve got it made and actually almost any idiot could learn how to do this see anybody could learn how to do this now if those simple acif youre going to make those simple actions complicated then you better uncomplicate in an awful hurry because those actions are terribly simple drive the meter do something when the meter is motionless and dont do anything when the meter is moving get that coordinated you know what to list how to head list what to write how to watch the meter when to stop the pc when to read the item back to him how to do goals list until youve got an absolute smooth flowing needle you see and then null the whole goals list back rapidly to the pc and get the one thats in and put couple of mid ruds in on it and make it fire like mad see those actions see theyre very simple actions you should know those actions perfectly and so forth and actually theres not enough complication in them to actually study very hard you know theyre just things you do fine now get that line of simple actions now understand that just as little parade of very simple actions there arethey havent got any big rules and so forth in connection with them and theyre just there and there they are and so forth see give you such things as you underlist you normally underlistthe big faults are is underlisting goals list and overlisting an item list then you just know your item lists have got to be pretty darn short and your goals lists have got to be pretty darn long and you get thisthis is awful easy terribly easy to assimilate very theres nothing to it you can learn how to do that if youre putting your big concentration in on learning how to do that thats something on the order of learningityou get into the swing of this you get into the swing of this it took metook quite few hours actually in actually auditing the stuff to come up with total confidence on the thing for instance for some months i wasnt doing any listing on meter i wasnt doing any of that particular type of aof research work or anything that required to list against meter dont you see well i wasnt doing anything like that and i got little bit rusty and it took very short period ofi got so that i didnt quite know whether or not i would see the motions of the needle dont you see the next time i did list the next time i did list i said well now im going to list this thing and i wonder if ive got this coordination in for few minutes there i was sort of queasy you know was i seeing the motions of the needle while i was writing and then all of sudden it just went back into gear and that was it and i havent worried about it since see meter cant pip without my seeing the thing i dont care what i got my eyes on see and these are the kind of things thattheyre little coordinative facts you see this is something like the pride with which you rapidly can shift gears in sports car or something like that how smoothly can you shift the gears you know never miss that kind of thing its justtheyre little mechanical coordinative actions and so forth you learn these with practice and so forth and as long as nothing has gone wrong that is all there is to r4 see thats all there is you neednt be skilled beyond just these mechanical actions now now the still meter dat meter what just rises up it gets up there to 55 it gets up there to 575 man it isnt blowing down you cant get anything to read your pc is developing lumbosis in hurry politis is normally what they get in running this its the pole they use in implant gpms that goes up the back of the pcpolitis actually the source of lumbosis is actually politis typical medical remark you take mythological disease which doesnt exist you see and give it mythologicalnot mythological but give it an explanation and source you see quandam neurosis is caused by kleptomania inverted with arsonism see now if you memorize that youll be psychiatrist and all that kind of thing whole bunch of double talk bunch of nonsense but theres that meter and its not moving and theres that pc and that pcs got creaks and that list that you did that didnt come out to the perfect item and that meter didnt blow down and youve now got motion going in any direction now that requires an auditor now theres substitute for an auditor in the chair at that point now you got trouble first trouble of this kind which i ran into in running goals and so forth my back hair stood up and vibrated sparks were flying out of my fingers my nerves were going zzzzzzzzz see i was getting some lumbosis myself trying to sit and look calm in the chair cup of coffee after the session or something like that it chatters against the cup like widow maker tearing up pavement you know woooohhh what the hells going on here worry man thats athats an occupationalthats an occupational illness on this subject worry did i get enough ta didnt i get enough ta somebody in actual fact has lost whole nights sleep worrying because the pc did not get ta in the session just run you know what was wrong well add that up to the fact that it wasnt just not ta the pcs ta is stuck at 575 the meter is so dirty the needle is so dirty that you cant even analyze anything you can put your fingers on nothing and the pc is ill you can get nothing to rr or rs you can get nothing to read list is traceable back where are you what have you run into and the cup as you try to drink cup of coffee chatters against the saucer man it sounds like machine gun whatever little worries you run into in i ii and iii are multiplied enormously at level iv when i first ran into this sort of thing causing big blunder of this kind or that kind rr shutting off and so forth i didnt know what the score was to large degree i was doing research lines and so on and i was interested in wrapping pc around telegraph pole in the last week but good and arriving at all the conditions just described and my emotional reaction to this was bit of concerned sympathy for the pc for feeling that bad but my emotional reaction or my puzzlement as to what it was all about and so forth pah worry concern the fact that the rr and falls had shut off on the meter simply indicated to we must be running arunning items when we didnt have goal so that just said the goal was wrong so it was just matterwe got to find the right goal for this and find out why we cant find the right goal for this just untangle this skein of yarn it untangled fairly rapidly pc feeling quite disabled for couple of days but so what see brought it all off at the other end everything going smoothly get the idea so your nervousness at r4 stems from lack of knowing all the answers are now there to knowbe known you see and you just dont know them you dont really need any of themany of those answers till you run into trouble now in view of the fact that the little runoff techniques of well you do the list you do the goals list and you get goal and it fires and you check the goal out and you do an analysis on that and you run it over here and you do items for that and you run down the items and so on all of those little actionssmart briskyou should be able to do all of those things but you should be able to do all of those things actually without knowing what youre doing and those little actions even if perfectly done will inevitably run pc into brick wall sooner or later someplace because youre not dealingyou may be dealingyou may be perfectly auditing but youre not dealing with perfect bank you see that it was dark and stormy night and the pc was standing out in the rain and they were big black oily clouds rolling by and all this happened in 1936 and it keyed in gpm to never be saddened and this gpm oddly enough has been pulled fully and completely out of its position and yanked up to 1936 and youre busy doing all of your little actions and these would be perfectly okay if the bank were perfect but the bank isnt perfect because there was 1936 you see dont you go blaming scientology and auditing all the time for whats happened to your pc because life has done thousand things to him for every tiny little thing that auditing has done to him see you see auditingits easiest to find the auditing goofs because theyve already been disclosed to some degree but the livingness goofs they havent been disclosed so livingness itself can disarrange this bank all right well thats bad enough but lets look at another one trillions three years ago see somewhere around trillion trillion trillion years ago you dont have too much to do with these dates now in r4 but at that length of time while the pcyouve gone down the bank now from present time gpm and youre going along pocketapocketapocketa pocketapocketa just everything fine everything fine everything fine and trillions three years ago the pc got implanted crossimplanted and upside implanted with bunch of goals that were reversed to the goal of the gpm the pc was on at that particular time everything has been running gorgeously but this put the track in group so you list for the next gpm and youre listing into bunch of wrong goals and implant goals and the pc doesnt know theyre there and you dont know theyre there and so everything starts to fire and nothing fires and eventually you come up with an something that reads to be an actual gpm but it isnt the actual gpm its merely goal but is quite like an actual gpm and is so undifferentiated that the subitsa you see cant reach its too burdened this is too chewed up at this particular point sobut you do get goal and it does check out and you run the items for that goal and you run halfway down the bank and you all of sudden realize that this pc is riding at 55 and is getting less and less blowdowns and theres less and less reads and you say whoa weve got wrong goal well judgment comes and when do you hit the silk so you check it all over now and its been unburdened enough to find out yeah it sure is that wasthat was wrongly worded goal you see something like that so you go back to your original goals list and you do your original goals list again and pocketapocketapocketapocketa youre doing your original goals list and youre extending it you see youre extending it and youre extending it and you finally get one oh it fires and everything is fine and checks out and its an actual gpm oh ho pfffaaaooouuu see so youre going to find the items for it now you go pocketapocketapocketa find an item find an item wodadadadadada uukk the rr restored but all of sudden you havent got anyit isnt even falling now and your needles getting very still and it doesnt matter what you list and the pc is now coming down with good case of politis and you say wellif you know your businessyou say well weve run into something here that didnt register right so you analyze the goal youre now working on and you find out that it was an implant gpm you were busy running without the pattern so you haul off then and you come back and you start all over again and you extend this goals list and this goals list wont move and nothing will move and youve nulled the thing all three times and you get in your mid ruds and everything else and then you finally come back to the beginning of them and find out it was the first goal on the list and it suddenly fires like mad and you go up to the top of the list and thisnow you found what you have found two separate oppterms for wrong goalstwo separate top opptermsso this particular position of the bank is some getting somewhat like times square you see just getting little jammy so you try to list into that and get something to read there well you finally take refuge in the fact of finding out how far you can go on the list without arc breaking the pc you find out how far you can go down the list until the pc arc breaks you cant make anything read you see you got the right goal now but everything is so jammed up that you cant do anything so the only thing youve got left is assessment by arc break you know if you go across the item on nulling that in the next few items the pc will arc break so you carefully watch the pcs arc break and then backtrack and ask the pc well which one of these items is your item and the pc picks up the item and all of sudden it fires and youre away and of course now the top terminal that isalso looks like grand central station or something like this and you cant get anything to read on that you follow out the same system then suddenly you get big blowdowns and lots of charge is blowing off and all of sudden you get one of the things to read and youve got the action going and you just proceed as before if you didnt know your business at the time you reached this trillions three point on the track pc would be finished tisnt case of they got slight cold and recovered you just finished pcfinished him unless you can untangle that youve finished being horrible isnt it but lets look at the elements it required to untangle that it required knowledge of what the bank was all about of the things that could go wrong you realize that you walk into too thoroughly an overburdened area that the more overburdened or charged the area is from whatever cause the less accurate your analysis by ouija board and this emeter is going to be is this an actual gpm yeah that flicks and that flashes and so forth and for the moment is correct but the area is so thoroughly charged that those errors creep in and so you take those things and the more charged the area and the more guthgoofed up the whole situation is at that particular point of the track why the harder off youre going to get the worse off its going to be the more unreliable your analysis is and the more mistakes youre going to make you realize you learn eventually that the way you handle mistake is to remove all possible charge before analyzing thats the way to cut minimize such mistakes get any charge off that you can get off before you do an analysis in other words dont do an analysis and then remove charge if theres any opportunity of removing charge before you do the analysis for heavens sakes do so one of the ways of doing that is to get the pc to itsa what youve just found before you turn to the meter well does thisdoes this add any effect on your life do you suppose youve just found something you see that read does it have any effect on your life what do youwhat do you think it might be oh yes its soandso and soandso all right is therehas this ever come up before oh yeah and the pc will spot this and spot that and spot the other thing and get him to itsa little bit see give you another one youve found an implant gpm you know darn well its an implant gpm thats of similar wording to the gpm youre trying to do or opposite wording to the gpm youre trying to run you see and you cant be sure and youve gotten into track j am of some kind or another and you know it hasnt run well youvepcs been wrapped around telegraph pole and here you are and so forth well look youre not sure of the actual gpm but youre sure sure of the implant gpm because the pc actually has visio on the parking meters you see well you got line plot in your kit and run it take the charge off see take the charge off the implant gpm before you check out the actual gpm get the idea in other words the rule is if theres any opportunity of taking off charge before you do an analysis at sticky spot on the trackbecause im talking about now tough overburdened areaif theres any opportunity whatsoever of taking off some charge take that before you establish what it is you have found on the list got it then youll get your reads more accurately and youll make fewer mistakes take the charge off first and then analyze what it is well of course that can only go just so far if youre trying to take charge off but arent getting any tone arm action then of course youve got to find out what it is see its only whether or not you can get tone arm action on this ill give you an idea youve gotten into jam and the pc has goal to spit and you can get an implant gpm there to be spat at there sits the implant gpm you analyze it very carefully and its quite recognizable as helatrobus implant well you got the pattern right alongside of you and youve got the goal and its firing very nicely and actually every time the pc says anything about it you get rocket reads but you speak of the actual gpm you cant get much and youre not sure what the actual gpm is well naturally youre more sure of the implant than you are of the actual and its lighter charge well lets just take the old helatrobus implant gpm and pocketapocketapocketapocketa actually you should be able to get rid of it in couple of hours take the whole thing off if youre really can audit bong bong bong you take the items two at time make the pc call one against the other item and bleed down the rocket reads on the thing bang bang bang bang and you got lot of charge off the thing you got your tone arm moving the pc feels lot easier and so forth all right lets move back to this actualquote actual gpm to spit lets move back to this actual gpm to spit you know sometimes you wont even find it exists youre saved from fate worse than death you had an actual goal which was lock on the implant that you were busy testing you see something like that what you can get your hands on for sure in other words that will get charge off well you get charge off with it rules of this particular kind never try to find withoutan unrun furtherfrompresenttime gpm by listing these are the things you learn the hard way weve got present time goal to spit and our next gpm is to not spit or something like that well listing from the present time actual gpm to the second gpm is impossible listing from counting from present time gpm four to find gpm five when gpm four has not been run you understand this im talking about unrun youre trying to get chain of goals together see youre not running them youre just trying to get this chain of goals well you got the goal for four now trying to find the goal at fivei dont know why youd want it anywaybut trying to find the goal at five is impossible i dontnot difficult you heard now its impossible it requires luck of nature you never heard of you just wont find it thats all the only way you can goal oppose is toward present time you can take two full gpmslets say five and fourand youve got number five and its full unrun gpm you see you cant run items if you haventtheres only one way to run items on this just make up your mind to that thats from the present time gpm back but youve got number five and you want to know what number four is well you do goal oppose see what goal would oppose the name of gpm five do that list and youll always come up with gpm four in other words you can do goal oppose toward present time but you cant do goal oppose back from present time it just wont work it just is impossible i wont even go into the ramifications of why you always wind up with mistake except once in blue moon you will be very very lucky and find goal below youll find goal below but you cannot guarantee that you havent skipped four or five goals and you can put reliance on it and eventualeventual analysis of the case as it eventually turns out yeah you skipped about three gpms see it doesnt list back but itll list forward now thatsjust let put this in you have to list back from fully run gpm youve run all the items out of gpm now you got to list to the earlier gpm back from present time thats an ordinary action im talking about you cant run down the track without running any rrsany ris dont you see and you get to gpm four and youve completely run gpm four gpm four is all beautifully run and polished up and you got all the ris in it now you list goal oppose to find gpm number five from present time and you will come up with goal every time very beautifully thats because gpm four has had all of its ris run out of it well you say thats not even very important datum well its important to this degree that if you take offthis is modified to this degreethat if you take off four or five ris from the bottom of gpmyou know its got four or five ris left in it at the bottom and for some weird reason you might decide to do this at some time or anotheryou never find the next goal and it can look like you must be listing against wrong goal or something because you cant find the next goal actually all you find is the next ri youll find the next oppterm or youll find something stupid on the thing but you wont find the next gpms name because youre listing away from present time and youre listing over the top of several unrun gprs interesting isnt it all right i see that that confuses you to some degree well if it confuses you you just havent got thei gave it to you partially for this reasonyou just havent got the mental facility oh gpm thats it bop pow and thats an engram and thats an implant and so forth and of course its this and that and naturally they lie in this kind of situation and they go plus and minus down this way and bang bang and theres nothing to it and ris sit in the middle of the package and so on and all visual and we know what it is how the hhow the devil are you going to fix radio set if you never heard of valve condenser knob dial an offon switch or anything else see so you getyou get my point if you had any difficulty following my explanation of what you shouldnt do about listing dont you see then its because you dont have visual acuity on the bank otherwise youd say oh yes of course nothing to that you see you still must be fumbling around little bit with nomenclature and so forth im not trying to lay an egg on you because i could make you understand it you cant because what ive told you is perfectly factual it isnt very important data that im giving you because why the devil would anybody ever want to list fromhes trying to find the present time gpm to go back down the run without finding any ris you see but why would he ever list away from present time see well he wouldnt you also can get hooked occasionally though by leaving four or five ris in place at the bottom of bank and say well well at least find the next gpm before we knock off this intensive so the pc will know about that and you try to find it over the top of these ris and you cant do it ive tried it several times you can always find the one closer to present time and you can run that out very easily facility nomenclature whats the orientation of this stuff well actually if you regard it in the situation that youre just dealing with bunch of childs building blocks and its actually more important than that theres reason to feel any great awe of these things because the only thing awful about them is the fact they remained completely unknown for so long there must be large vested interest in having everybody weighted down dont you see somebodys been enthusiastic im sure the ford foundation an organization of great ethical standards would have engaged with some success in this direction if it really had intended to do so you know they folded up all their mental research they said wed done it did you know that they actually put out bulletin to that effect official bulletin of the ford foundation ford foundation longer engages in mental research because its all been done by the scientologists they sent fellowyears ago they sent fellow down to phoenix to go through the organization to report on ita report and they got full report where we sat with mental research and they decided it was in good hands and they knocked it out because they had to have money for other purposes of course so this but look at the interestingly easy surrender they never even tried they never even tried but possibly one of the reasons why all of this escaped view is because it is as idiotic as kids set of building blocks were very shortly going to youre going to be drilling with this stuff this is gpm make you model one hang it together name goals youll get to position i know where you will eventually walk over to the board with your pc and have the pc arranthe gpms to show you what his bankwhat he thinks is wrong with his bank dont you see youve gotits that easy see i mean because everybody thoughteverybody was stuck ateverybody was stuck down at think or mystery probably at mystery on this subject see and at mystery there are masses so the mind of course was very mysterious and you mustnt go into the mind so nobody looked to find bunch of little kids building blocks that had nothing much to do with anything except this now thats the magic which youve got to put time in on thats the magic which youve got to put time in on and you very rapidly will learn this sort of thing i had my brains creaking last night on one of these problems because these are problems these are you might say auditing tactical problems what arewhatwhat is the misarrangement here that we have run into which makes it impossible for us to get this next goal we know of course at once that the area is overcharged thats an idiot statement whats got it overcharged why why is everything grouped in here why do we keep overcharging it by finding new wrong goals dont you see and i found that the pc had had goal run to be happy in the helatrobus implant series only there is goal to be happy in the helatrobus implant series there is goal there to be unhappy and the pc had an actual gpm to be happy which of course made this implant goal very easy to mistake made it easy to make mistake on this dont you see and of course you get nix absolutably unhappy and it sounds like happy after youve pulled all the reverses out of it so of course it tends to read very easily as lock now let your brains creak over this one an implant gpm to be unhappy had been run as to be happy which was the pcs own actual gpm got that so the implant gpm to be unhappy very easily collapsed on positivenegative basis on the pcs actual gpm so that the moment we started into that area wed already you seeit wasnt the auditing that had made the mistake it was the fact that because this condition already existed in the bank that mistakes could now be made you see you wouldnt get nice clean reads and that sort of thing everything is kind of muddy easy to make mistakes now look at this the goal to be happy appeared on the goal oppose list from the bank just before but wouldnt fire because the pc kept saying it was an implant gpm pc knew this that it was an implant gpm so therefore every time itd come up it might tick little bit but then go splat so of course then it just wouldnt read two wrong goals in addition to the to be unhappy wrongly run goal were then stacked up at this point on the track after that one error plus these two other errors in other words three wrong gpms one right after the other came out of that mixup it looks like one of these pileups on the highway see somebody wrecks small car and then couple of other ears run into it and then greyhound bus hits the lot do you see block on the road in other words because this condition existed of overcharge on the bank anyway then mistakes could be made in that area dont you see now the auditor eventually had to be smart enough to sit there calmly and undo and guess at the lot and figure it all out as to what was and all of sudden the pc comes up with broad cognitions because enough attention has been directed into the area and enough charge has been brought out of it to straighten it out got the idea but heresthe genius in the auditing is that goal even then wouldnt read the goalthe actual gpm to be happy never had been runwouldnt read on the list wouldnt read until the pc finally started cogniting and then cognited more and more and then cognited more and more and more and then cognited more andoh youre getting blowdowns on this you see and he started to get blowdowns and blowdowns and blowdowns and blowdowns and blowdowns and only thenwas never found by nulling then it was found by pc recognition of what it must be after the thing was all disentangled by the auditor get the idea well that was very smart auditing but what kind of auditing is this this is simply the auditing that when you hold up poker the name of it is poker and you hold up shovel the name of it is shovel and so forth you arent wondering if the shovel is poker dont you see theres confusion there how manyhow many things could be wrong well thats real brain creak man thats misrun wrongly worded implant gpm run as the pcs actual gpm on the implant you let your brains creak over this thing thats wild jam see on the track you run into these things you see you run into these things and its rough getting through those points so as i told you yesterday in yesterdays lecture there are two zones and areas of r4 one is the key in the side and wind up the auditor and as long as the ta moves the auditor has solenoids connected you see so that they forbid him from saying anything and the moment the ta stops moving then the auditor goes on with the remaining action like you run washing machines you know its just as just as stupid and automatic and crisp and precise as that and then theres this other field of knowing what youre doing and thats great big broad field and that requires knowing all the parts and knowing how they belong and knowing how they can be scrambled there arent many of these parts and they arent very complicated but theres substitute for knowing these parts now by knowing both of those zones and areas youll get through r4 like breeze given the basic ability to sit there and audit see youll get through r4 just like breeze pc will catch hell every once in while after your first two or three mad collisions and pileups on the roadway youll suddenly realizeyoull have seen it with your own eyes that when you run wrong goal why the rr shuts off eventually shuts off tone arm goes high doesnt require an ouija board of saying is this an incorrectly worded goal and tick and that doesnt requirewell how much sign board do you need see you were finding items for which you had goal and thats the only thing that shut off an rr and the only thing that would shut off an rr so it must be wrong goal we dont care what the pc is saying about it we dont care about anything else that means that then we had an incomplete goals list and wed found wrong goal on it so we got to extend the goals list and find the right goal on the list see elementary youll find it one way or t other hunt punch and sweat and the quicker you get the situation in hand the easier it is to remedy the longer you let one of these situations go wrong the harder it is to remedy in the long run so its these two zones in which youre operating and theres substitute for expertness you should be able to sit there and big key in the side and wind yourself up and pocketapocketapocketa see who or what would solve psychiatrist you see saasa sasa thank you see shot gun shot gun all right that reads is that your item silence from the auditor blow blow blow blow pretty soon why more action left in the thing looks quiet two or three minutes later its very quiet the meter and everything the pcs talking little bit and itsas little bit very good thank you now would psychiatristwould shot gun solve psychiatrist all right thank you that bled you another rocket read and dial wide its fine you see all right how does the item shot gun relate to to be crazy fall thank you now youll notice that your ta is now up youre not going to get any more motion out of this you bled it you say all right here is your next question who or what would shot gun solve dadada dadada thank you read you back justhahahahaha you see little man little wound up thing and nothing to it see its all just zazazazaza all perfectly patterned actions and so forth it all goes along this way and youre doing thisyoure doing this list and you say who or what would solve psychiatrist ahblablablablabla and ahblablablablabla and ahblabla blablabla thank you shot gun shot gun shot gun gun all right could you give few more items please who or what would solve psychiatrist dadadadada and dadadadada and dadadadada and dadadada da and dadadadada and dadadadada arsenic all right arsenic thank you thank you all right ill read you this item arsenic arsenic arsenic arsenic all right im sorry that didnt read shot gun shot gun all right im going to null this whole list now dadadadada dadadadada shot gun dadadadada dadadadada arsenic all right well have to continue this list very good who or what would solve psychiatrist dadadadada dadadadada dadadadadada ah brickbats okay thank you thank you ill read you the item brickbats brickbats brickbats brickbats arsenic arsenic all right ill read you these these interim things shot gun dadadadada and dadada x x x x x something is wrong now at this moment at this moment rules will not save you you could be given now brandnew pattern with key on the other side and it wouldnt do you bit of good because youre running into variation how many things can be wrong here maybe lot of things can be wrong here you might behave all of sudden run out ofmaybe youre running an incorrect goal maybe youre running an implant gpm maybe youre running with an actual gpms type of pattern dont you see horror of horrors maybe your analysis in the first place is right maybe its so simple the first thing you would choose is the fact that psychiatrist is wrong item so you continue that list and adjust it from that point because your list is unduly long that came from it so your first assumption is that psychiatrist list must be wrong and the first assumption on that list is the psychiatrist is late on the list and there is an item earlier on the list that should have read in the first place so you go back and pound that list to pieces trying to find out some earlier item on that list than psychiatrists and if you cant get anything on that list to read now you got to start assuming other things that something is wrong with the gpm that youre running implant gpms somethingawwsomsomsomaww what has happened here ahhhh i should have gotten up this morning dont you see you generally find its something simple but of great moment to the pc small matter like youre running the opposite wording to the actual gpm or youre running an actual goal that has gpm neither an implant nor an otherwise or youve gotten little bit of charge off the thing now and it reads up more truly what it is dont you see and you go back and analyze this thing and your hair stands on end now fortunately its only wrong goals or mixups between implants and actuals and things like that which cause the pc to get ill if your pc is getting ill it isnt because you missed an item or something like that its because you really put both feet straight into it see youre running something real goofy see youre running gpm where there is none youve skipped couple of gpms youve done something but good all right now the only thing you can do at point like this is shift gears and go over to the other zone of the thing and know your business know your business what are these parts what is an implant gpm what is an actual gpm how thecan these things get crossed what do these things look like how do they rearrange themselves in the bank how many mistakes could we possibly make here cover all those available mistakes youll get to be an auditor on this stuff the day you throw away your littleyour little pat sheet of case analysis you can think in terms of these items and entities you can think in terms of those throw away your sheet and youll be all set because theres probably probably hundred different combinations of errors arising out of only these eight or nine elements see there can be hundred different complications of errors dont you see you can be running an actual gpm with the wording only of the implant gpm dont you see and goofy things like this you can be running lock ri you can have found lock ri or misworded something or other or something or other or something or other you can skip some items you can oh its on and on and on but this is just the elements its just these few basic elements in different arrangement dont you see constitute the error all you have to do is know what these few basic elements are and you got to be able to crank your wits up to the point of juggling these things pangety pang and well this might be against that and that might be against that and oh i see here and you look back on the thing and you all of sudden see here that this is some kind of figurefigure oppose i gave you good figure let see if i can dream up good figurefigure oppose to have good time opposes to be old goals always go by oppose dont you see to have good time is of the sense of to have bad time when it opposes dont you see but you see the pc figures it out this way to have good time opposes to be old because if you are old then you cant have good time see and actually gpms never figure out that way and this suddenly dawns on you that this looks mighty corny see youve gotyouve got to be rich versus to be tolerant because if youre tolerant then of course you cant make enough money so of course you wouldnt be rich these are not goal oppose thats all see thats figurefigure oppose pcs and their anxiety to get the next goal and their hatred of listing will figure themselves around two or three corners dont you see to say how its all true to be old opposes to be young you see i mean its bang bang and if the auditor cant understand it why it usually is not comprehensible pcs trying to make something out of the thing pcs sometimes all of sudden alert and say well an elephant does not oppose cheese crackers you know you might have noticedyou might have not noticed it you dont ever call attention to significance unless the pc gets in trouble and then you start to examine these types of elements and you say well thats certainly funny looking goal to be opposing that its either wrong goal or weve skipped two or three gpms obviously because it doesnt fit see you know that it doesnt fit because you know that goalsto be black opposes to be white dont you see see to be black opposes to be white and that doesnt oppose to be human to be black does not oppose to be human matter how much somebody might figure this out it doesnt do it youll get some oddities like this you see youll get things like to be pleasant opposing to be hateful see it goes that far afield but thats very comprehensibly an opposite but you get to be pleasant versus to be an opera singer because theyre so unpleasant you dont even have to know much about significance to know that that is in error the thing adds up to what it adds up you dont even have to add in your significance but you get smart enough after while that you even notice these things that by the way is the last thing you notice is the significance of the situation is the thing an implant gpm have you gone into lock ri was it only an actwas it only goal didnt have any gpm connected with it have you got an implant gpm mixed up with the other one is it really an ri is it lock on an ri is it these various things what are these things well how can these elements be scrambled up do you know how toif you know what they all are and how to put them all together of course why at that stage of the case youre not found wanting so the one division here is the auditing youre basically good auditor you dont chop the pcs itsa and you dont this and you dont that and you dont other thing you can give commands to the pc and control the pc and you can run model session and you can run an emeter and so forth these are the variousjust the basic fundamental elements of auditing all right take this guy now he goes out in two different directions he learns the woundup doll mechanisms of simply running the technique you see running the r4m2 pocketapocketapocketa and hes got to have this whole other field over here of instant analysis and it isnt good enough to have supervisor on the third floor in case you get into trouble because youre going to get into trouble faster than the supervisor can come down those stairs that isnt good enough see if you dont know these elements youre going to let yourself run into some interesting errors your meter is sitting in front of you and there is something wrong with that meter this thing is sinking out of sight its now at 125 youre not getting much tone arm action ever since you began on this goal things have been going wusser and wusser well its you thats got to notice it and the faster you notice something going wildly wrong and the faster you bail out the happier your pcs going to be now some of you have got case analysis wrapped around telegraph pole already case analysis is an arc break assessment it is not case analysis is letting the pc itsa for quite while about his case it isnt case analysis is pocketapocketapocketa bang what it is had any goals found on you yeah i had goal to grow old all right now when was that found all right thank you very much is that an actual gpm is that an implant gpm is that merely an actual goal is that an ri is that lock on an ri is that an ri in an implant is thatgood is it lock on an ri in an implant all right that reads that reads as lock on an implant anything else you care to evask about that thats not goal well what do you know soandso i winti wonder what impissasasahso andso soandso soandsotone arm action tone arm actionwha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha wha whatone arm action tone arm action then tone arm rising tone arm rising tone arm rising tone arm oh you gotyou bled that out or youve got another mistake on it what do you think that is now the goal all right all right implant implant ri all right actual gpm implant gpm implant ri lock on an implant ri lock on an implant ri thats right see you got the tone arm action off check it again see you got that much charge off the area and you get more reliable read you see all right tone arm didnt even budge well that is now dead issue that has been parked that has been straightened out and there is more tone arm action to be had in it why are you standing around the corner of the drugstore there isnt another girl going to walk by all day sir the thing for you to do the thing for you to do at that particular point is what other goal has been found on you what other goal youve speculated with did you ever have goals list in which you found goal that you were very interested in what item has been found on you in 212 oh all right what was the first one what was the one that stuck out in your mind mostly oh all right that was the one that stuck out in your mind mostly oh oh good good good to caterwaul all right that was an item in 212 sounds like goal it was an item it was goal all right well lets find out is it an item is it goal you know that thing is goal ooh tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action blowdown blowdown blowdown blowdown blowdown yeahbluuuoouuuuuuuuooooo i never noticed that before and it was very peculiar and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on so on so on so on so on tone arm rising tone arm rising tone arm rising tone arm rising gorising doesnt go down again all right very good well what about this thing that an actual gpm is that one of your actual gpms that doesnt read all right one of yourit was an implant gpm oh an implant gpm well that reads its an implant gpm all right well lets see where its from helatrobus bear gorilla wheres it from how far back on the track how many years how many years ago do you suppose this was trillions trillions of trillions trillions of trillions of trillions trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions its trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions its long back to hell with it its long time ago implant gpm thats it oh is that so dadaaddaaaddaa tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action tone arm action tone arm actionstuck all right fine now what other 212212 item have you had found on you get the idea now somebody who hasnt obligingly had some auditor digging up things for you to work with you got little bit harder job dont get the idea its because hes been audited and found these items that this is all very bad this is straighten up dont you see and the auditors already done part of the job by finding them youve got the additional job of trying to find something to dig up have you ever been unhappy in this lifetime oh is that so yeah what period was that huh well what were you unhappy about particularly oh well i was most unhappy about being married good let see yes all right very good part of goal all right good is it an actual ri see what im talking about theres lock on an implant reliable item see or is it just something you were worried about well unfortunately this has foundation in fact in your case whatsoever its merely something you were worried about at the timeimplant implant tone arm tone arm tone arm bang bang gone gone ever so is that so what do you know about that and i was all worried about it i thought it was something fundamentally wrong with it isnt anything fundamentally wrong with you its just an idea you had all right so finally theres more tone arm action on this thing you see you ever goofed up about anything else i dont care whether you speak elegantly or not yeah well i used to worry all the timei hate to tell you this but i used to worry about all the time when i was little boyi used to worry about not going to the bathroom oh freudian analysis ever been ananalyzed you ever had any freudian analysis ever had any freudian analysis oh you have hahaha isnt that interesting all right what was found in this freudian analysis oh keeping girls petticoats in your bureau drawer all right all right good keeping girls petticoats in your bureau drawer all right now is that part of an actual goal part of an implant goal part of this is it an actual ri is it see you get the idea oh im sorry weve just found out that was part of your analysts imagination now look at what youre actually doing here you know the parts of the mind youve educated your pc or your pc knows the parts of the mind dont you see and youre not in the dark as to what youre talking about and you can straighten these things out and put his bank into some kind of condition whats absolutely fantastic is the bank goes back into condition again it doesnt go back with total totality until it is completely run but i mean there will be trace of the stuff the rithe gpm that has been pulled out of place very often leaves some frayed edges where it has been pulled out of dont you see and so forth but you straighten this kind of thing up this guys starting to feel pretty doggone classy see everything is starting to feel pretty good starting to look pretty good lot of fundamental errors and maybe some chronic illness hes had in this lifetime and other things of that particular character come up you start doing case analysis the pcs liable toyou are also liable to hook into this one youre saying is that an implant and so on and so on was that so and so on this came up in your case and so on and so on and youre going through all this and all of sudden the pc looks kind of roundeyed and says you know ive goti got something sitting in front of here that says riding you know its been there for an awful long time thatsthats thethe pain that i get across the bridge of my nose right up here riding riding it is its riding its right here across the bri and you know thats what ive been trying to get audited for i never realized it but its right across the middle of my nose all right riding just analyze it see what is it where is it what is it doing whats it part of get the idea just as sloppy and as crudely as you can do it but rapidly and so forth now because thats newly found item not found by listing youre in of course little bit of trouble and your case analysis is suspended but the test is do you get tone arm action oh youre going to get tone arm action like crazy see this is the kind of item that might have been found in 212 and relieved all kinds of symptoms dont you see but youre now going to get tone arm action and youre just dumb if you do anything while that tone arm action is flying unless youve got deadline on your session or something because your tone arm will keep moving and your pc keep itsaing this thing and look at it and so forth and finally say well there are probably two of these things see one is galloping you see andand ii think thats i think thats i think im against galloping but riding im for riding but against galloping its all very confusing all right well where does galloping belong adadadadada does it belong in an implant gpm does it belong in dada and so on is it an ri is it lock on an ri and so forth and where does it belong on the track and about how old is it you dont even have to date it you know but get some kind of an idea oh thats way back on the track oh yeah thats right up here in present time thats part of the present time gpm what do you know about that very interesting all right thereone of it in the pcs gosayinghes saying and i so and so on and so on and so on and ii so on and well if thats an opposition terminal then wonder its locked up and it must be part of two different gpms we ought to really find the goal that this thing belongs with ahahahahahahahahahah you is being vacuum cleaner sucked in where angels shouldnt be treading youve already found something that didnt exist on his case before you were doing case analysis now dont be dumb fool and find something else too one little error like this is permitted he ran into it headon he cognited on the thing he recognized the thing he gave you wild tone arm action he feels much better for having collided with the thing fine let dog lie see let that dog roll over on his back in front of the fire now and snore because the right way to get that dog is to do the proper programing thats to go up to the top of the bank and roll on back and youll eventually run into riding and galloping and another two or three thousand equally fascinating items dont you see this is trying to short cut the auditing so theres point where analysis stops in that but analysis is not did you have an arc break with an auditor because your so and so on now arc breaks quite commonly will attend stuff that is out of position see youre liable to find pc arc broken but that tells you the elements are in error some misarrangement of the elements have taken place an arc break is symptomis merely symptom of misarranged elements somebody who doesnt want auditing now and doesnt really want to audit now and all of that sort of thing somehe justhes just got his gpms wrapped up thats all see somethinghe got gpm fivedidnot even in an auditing session dont you seehe got gpm five moved up to position where the two should be and two shoved out and moved back to where ten should be dont you see and the bank scrambled up and hes got stuff pulled out of line and that sort of thing thats why he doesnt want to audit and he doesnt want to be audited and he doesntthen he feels sick and thats also why he had lumbosis when he was two you see scientology is so intimate to this material that its of course easiest to blame it the thing that gets blamed right before scientology is something thats more intimate to the session than scientology and thats the auditor you notice its always the auditor that gets blamed well after the auditor gets blamed why then they blame the subject you see well its all in the same grade the guy has got some misarrangement that is causing bypassed charge thats causing an arc break and thats all there is to that you let somebody drift off in that kind of condition youre quite culpable as an auditor and if you know your zonesthis big zone of how you put bank back together again it just wont happen see now i could give you l4 and you can assess l4 and you can tick it off and you found misarranged ri and so forth and its all very cute and all very mechanical but my contempt manyou should know where those things are what are you what are youwhat are you doing with l4 well thatsjust can call few things to your mind thats the best it can do dont you see because there are lot of other things that can be wrong you cant put everything well do you realize that thing would have to be two or three hundred lines long to get every possible combination ill give you an idea youre just nowyoure doing items and you seem to be in an arc break on account of items well why are you worrying about anything else but items for little while see you havent been doing goals or goals lists everythings been going along smoothly and you all of sudden have ahave some kind of messup occurring on the subject of items well theres only few things that could have happened you could have found wrong item or you could have skipped an item or two or you see you could have skipped into another bank and found an item from another bank and you could have missed in two or three fashions all of which you would understand if you knew the arrangements and mechanics of the mind you see so you just say well what could happen to items well its one two three four you see of items one two three four and we had item one and we opposed it with item four and therefore left items two and three unfound and the bypassed charge must be there dont you see and it doesnt require seven foot thick textbook or lists or something to put this home its just certain few things can be wrong you see or we found item one two three and we never found item four but we found an item over here in another gpm to oppose three and therefore this guys feeling terrible because weve got two gpms were pulling together see thats visual visual recognition see theyre all visuals they got spatial relationships and designations of this particular character and theres sense in not knowing them because theyre elementary theyre only few of them there are lot of errors that can accumulate from these few little elements you see so what you doing with longscreed arc break assessment dont you see theres substitute for being able to say well so and so on well you flunk it yourself well go ahead and get long list and see if you run into something accidentally what things can happen in session well you should be able to call session arc break stuff out right this minute bang just like that without looking at sheet just looking at your meter saying did i cut your communication reject some affinity reject some reality whats happened here do you think ive falsified something whatever whatever could have happened you see did you think you knew something that i wouldnt take or you could run down any element there is the benefit of this is you know what just happened just now in the session you know what happened in the session well i dont know why blind yourself to knowing what just happened in the session you see theresthis might have struck the pc only in two or three different ways and therefore you settle the arc break just bang bang bang you see ask three questions and so on and so on its obviously that thats it and bang if it doesnt settle like that you say it must be something more fundamentalmust be something more fundamental but its germane to what youre doing did you kick in another gpm did he take look at another bank is there an engram mixed up with all this hes run into something of this character now theres some excuse for running longer list some excuse because the thing is out of your hand but nine times out of ten you just know right now on an arc break its quite obvious to you what it is so you ask questionsyou dont tell the pc what it is you ask questions related to what it is and see what reads on the meter thing reads on the meter bang well that must be the subject of the arc break let him tell you all about it and thats the end of the arc break see fruitiest source of arc breaks on lists of course is incomplete lists or bypassing the characters item on the list andwhile nulling if youre nulling and the pc arc breaks you know you must have passed his item its as elementary as that and if youre listing and the pc arc breaks and youre still getting action here of one kind or another its obvious that the list is incomplete or the source youre listing from is wrong its one of the two things so thats the only two things you verify when pc arc breaks under those conditions you learn these things quite rapidly there are only few things that can go wrong thats all im trying to teach you theres really theres so few that theres really not much excuse not to know what these elements are and what they combine as see now as far as running cases are concerned we havent gotten into this very long im just trying to still give you viewpoint with regard to r4 i want to read you very rapidly here as an addendum to this lecture and not actually as part of this lecture this and im going to read this very rapidly to you just to give you good grip on the situation this is program this is program for case this is standard program for case in one do complete slow case analysis using all arc break lists and general questions and clean them all up one by one and anything the pc brings up in the way of items and so forth and be very thorough get that all cleaned up got the idea the case analysis ive been talking to you about you do on the case extensively see before you do anything else number two put in the big mid ruds by fast check on listing items routine 3 goals on your pc thats fast check bmrs on listing items routine 3 and goals put bmrs in on listing on items on routine 3 and on goals third step fast check big mid ruds on any goal the pc has had that he was given or thought was his now youve already done some case analysis on these goals dont you see youve already got them padded back into place everything is fine but there still is some residue left there now that pays particular attention to favorite goals orfirst priority is wrong goals has this person had wrong goal run on them see well it was all right to put it back in place in case analysis but if this persons ever had wrong goal run on them that you found in cin that analysis form see you make note of these things on your auditors report particularly wrong goal thats the root see number three you uncork the fast check big mid ruds on that wrong goal now you can go with all the eighteen buttons of prepcheck all by fast check on that wrong goal you understand you can go the whole lot and if youpcs getting lots of tone arm action out of it youd be very foolishand you notice now the big mid ruds are the early part of the prepchecks and thats soone of theone of the values of this is so you dont have to memorize two listsbut thats so that if youre going redhot on your early part of those prepcheck buttons why you can continue on through the eighteen buttons but if youre going slow freight not much ta you can unload in other words you can just stop this prepcheck because its not getting any tone arm action so it cant possibly be doing anybody any good see all right thats to get rid of these big goofs number three number four and this is where you really start thatthese others are just preparatory stepsyou list the question what is your present time gpm is the auditing question and you complete it to smooooth needle with faintest ticks or flicks or falls seen on listing test question sure its clean get in big mid ruds on list fast check and then null the list and youll probably find the pcs goal sitting on that list or youll see the goal next to the pt goal sitting on that list you probably will see the pcs present time gpm sitting on that list you hope if it isnt there extend that list if youve nulled it and cant find it extend the list pc arc breaks youve bypassed it openshut case got that number five check out the goal found is it an actual gpm implant and so on in other words do good solid analysis on this thing be awful sure of this thing and do some big mid ruds on it get it to read but beautifully see and then start in at the top its usually truncated you find the terminal the first terminal on all other banks you find the oppterm but on the first bank you find the terminal on the truncated bank because its easier to do and you just do these little tiny short lists and the first thing that you can get to read back to the pc you see the first thing that falls you can reread back to the pc you read back to the pc and you give him yourthose items and you just run them on down pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa and you get to the bottom of that thing do goal oppose list by the usual rules of listing get your next goal and do the same and the next goal and do the same and whenever you run into trouble do full case analysis to find out wrong items wrong goals arrarararara thats the way you ought to be tackling this cat right at the present moment thats what you ought to be doing in order to get you somewhere and that for my money is the very best method of doing so to cut in late and do goal opposes up the channel just because the pc couldnt do this list actually is secondary action some pc has had big goal of some kind or another that has been run that wasnt his actual gpm and you do have your hands on that goal you possibly could do goal oppose up there but the best method by far is simply list for the present time gpm thats the best method by far got it the other is fraught with many horrors and terrors i know ive been over the road myself its wild trying to list gpms to gpms that are all full of ris wild man wild but oddly enough your pc very often will give you the present time gpm just like that and it checks out via the actual goal and all is well what if you checked it out and found an implant gpm if you can run implants well run it as an implant anything to get charge off the case and theres programingtheres programing the way she is did there is good fast rapid review of r4m2 the way it sits in its most optimum condition right at this moment and that is as workable man as can be man that really runs its the easiest auditing you ever did in your life until you go over niagara falls and put your foot in it and youve struck an overcharged area and you find the pcs actual gpm only its misworded implant gpm which comes from this until you really analyze it little closer and then you find out that it was an actual gpm after all what misworded and then you get the miswording of that and turns out toit really was an implant gpm youre in for picnic at that particular point so between now and the time when you go to run this learn all the elements there are in one of these cases learn what they look like learn how to handle them learn how to juggle them and youll never reallyreally youve got it made you got it made now your morale was very very bad i hope your morale is better i say your morale is bad ityour morale is actuallythats jokeyour morale isholds up pretty well i sympathize with you on many quarters and so forth youre going into the unknown at high flight and its pretty tough sometimes and it looks very nerve racking you dont quite know whats ahead you dont quite know what it all consists of basically you dont know what youre doing wrong and so forth actually youre being far more complicated than it warrants it breaks down to rather elementary proposition all the way down the line but then you have to find that out see and what youre moving toward is not so much bunch of data which is handed to you on silver platter but your own reality on the actual simplicities that have been discovered and found workable and when you arrive at those one after the other there will be nobody cockier than you and when you pick up your coffee cup why the rock of gibraltar will look nervous compared to it thank you
