scientology and tradition lecture given on 15 september 1964 thank you all right this is what date audience fifteenth september 15th this is the 15th what planet audience earth all right very good fifteenth of september ad 14 planet earth well actually i dont really have anything to talk to you about ive been doing nothing much there are several things which one could cover one could talk some more about definitions and wonder why definitions are so somethingorother but probably be very good idea since melbourne got itself into trouble with nothing but definitions its been sitting down there at an inquiry giving incomprehensible words in long stream arc breaking everybody in sight peculiar genius my orders have been not followed in that area even vaguely they were told to give mild little pe course and that would be the extent of it and theyof course every time anybody asked them question why they answered it why thats silly they werent being audited they were being inquired and the other thing was the earlier instruction to peter was to go down and open up sydney and make the main org headquarters in sydney and he didnt do that so between these two actions of course theyve gotten themselves into lots of trouble well any pe can get itself in similar trouble and so forth theyre apparently for ourlearning from the melbourne mess the similarities could happen along almost any line and those two areas of trouble would simply be not following policy and giving words and data far over the heads of the recipients and between those two things why they have made mess and i think that anybody could make mess anywhere with those two things you have to understand something about policy policy is not something that i have dreamed up off the cuff it might have been originally and once in awhile i get real bright and solve something of the sort but policy is the general mean action that is to say the action which has been worked out and which has been working and which has held true over long period of time policies are very often worked out and then reworked and then pushed into new form and batted back and forth and eventually why theyll settle down to becoming fairly routine standard policy on the thing in fact i dont think new policy has been invented in scientology for several years and anyone here who reallywhos doing any supervision on staff if they knew all the policies of the central organization that had been worked out over many many years frankly would never have to solve single problem they would just quote policy its quite interestingits quite interesting the fact that if i think it over very hard on any problem that is offered in an organization if i think over what this thing is and look at it real hard and look over what policies that existed in this area that i could uniformly and routinely give the answer by policy i would state what the policy was that covered that particular field its quite interesting for an organization as young as this and now im talking about more broad time spans than standard oil company and earth time but organizations that are in this universe very seldom are as young as this planet if you get the idea i mean there is bigger time span involved and they nearly all of them go in this particular direction of well theyve gottheyve worked out answers by experience over long period of time and everybody knows these things and it makes communication possible between one point and another point which is the main thing that it does by the way policy is not the activity of forcing somebody to obey some archaic and moldy order its not forcing people to obey orders that isnt the reason for policy policy is there to facilitate communication between two points in the absence of policy you dont have communication between two points because theyre not agreed on anything try to get communication between two points which are not in agreement and of course you at once have trouble and i point out the technology of r and c in support of that fact so if there is policy with regard with to how people are registered and if this is known and understood it is 1 based on considerable amount of experience on the part of registrars and 2 the letter registrar the body registrar who does the actual signups the d of t the d of p the association secretary and the hco secretary are all in agreement dont you see so they stay in communication on this subject of registration but the second you inject brandnew oddball policy into the thing on which there has been agreement previously and so forth they tend to go out of agreement if this violates some policy in which they were in agreement and ifthat is theres broader sweep to what i am talking about by the way than simply handling an organization were talking about in actual fact civilization and civilization has certain agreed upon customs and mores in other words guides and standards of conduct certain things which they have agreed are normal and it doesnt much matter whether they are normal or abnormal or good or bad justthis is all that mattersdo they assist the general survival its the only real test of one of these things it doesnt matter whether you have policy or morals or customs or any of these broadly agreedupon things does it assist the general survival of the individual and of the majority of the group and is it agreed upon and does it facilitate communication having been agreed upon there are actually three points involved there so we get into condition here where we have certain number of policies or customsi dont care what you call them or procedures or how do you go about it you see theres not much difference between how do you sign up student and how do you get married i mean if you put them both on the basis of this is the expected routine when you go into new area or new civilization the reason you feel strange out of sorts with everybody sort of halfarc broke and feel like you dont belong is because you simply dont know the customs or procedures on which they operate how do you walk into cafe and when you walk into cafe does theare you supposed to stand there and wait till the manager or the maitre or waiter or somebody comes up and leads you to seat or are you supposed to blunder on in and sit down at the seat because if you violate it you will then be strange dont you see so its because you dont know these customs which are these sequential doingnesses what do you do after youve done that see if you dont know these cycles why then several things occur one you fall out of agreement with the people who are following these cycles youre longer in agreement with these people or you dont assume an agreement you feel strange and so on and you might even have better solution to how things are going along but the truth of the matter is if it is too wildly out or too wildly different from what the other people are doing why then they wind up clobbering you you see how this would happen and you wind up having them executed or something of this sort goes along like this when space opera society moves in aon some kind of wild gumboot downinthebarn milkingthecow sort of society or something even wilder than that something like australia you get an almost immediateoh i can promise you my revenge against australia is to give it reputation thats the only revenge im going to take im just going to give it reputation for being the most backward area on earth i could assure you itll go ramming down the ages that way too someday youll have clich√© oh well it was sort of an australian society you know theyre real clowns down there thoughtheyre real clowns what they consider jurisprudence the head of an inquiry the judge you see announces the findings that he has determined upon before he has heard the witnesses for the defense and two months before the end of the inquiryhe announces his findings two months before the end of the inquiry and before hes heard any of the witnesses for the defense if he were to do that in england why he would be up therehe would be up there on the bread lines right this minute you know somebody would say to him well sir reginald bard we longer have you in our midst you have been withdrawn from circulation in fact you are impeached you know it just isnt done but this is apparently quite the order of thing in australia you see all right well theres nothing wrong with that he probably had his mind made up before it began but im sure they wouldnt find anything wrong with that either so anyhow yeah thats my only revenge against australia im going to make their name byword anyway the situationof course what we say and do is liable to much far better to become byword than anything they say or do we have time on our side so when you get into policy and you get into custom you get into that type of thing youre basically facilitating agreement thats basically what youre doing now if society is sonow ill use musical term dissonantits all clashed up in other words they got lots of crime and they got corruption and they got politics and they got andersons and other crud and theyve gone totally australian you get the idea when they get this wild they are longer in actual fact civilization because it istheyre not living under cohesive custom system they havent any agreedupon anythings anymore dont you see theyre way out so that you actually have bill is not in agreement with joe and it doesnt much matter where they are there isnt anything for them to agree upon see like how do you get married you see well i dont know theres all kinds of methods of getting married today but all kinds of methods of getting married and not getting married and getting unmarried and so on theyre terrifically variable theres standard policy with regard to this thing in actual fact and you find its violated all over the place right now so it obviously must not have been workable policy with regard to it dont you see there were lot of things wrong with marriage as an institution or you wouldnt have this many divorces you see obviously that something is in error here someplace but then who marries well does the church marry or does the state marry orand if the church marries should it then be able to divorce oryou get all kinds of wild things you cant answer any policies up with regard to this you see you have little textbook anyplace that says marriage policies regarding seethat everybody could agree upon as being survival activity see instead of that you have bunch of mishmashes in the first place the reason you have mishmashes is nobody understands what everybody else is all about anyhow and theres bunch of false technology around about the behavior of people and that theyre all animals somehow and if you ring bells why they should slaver pavlovian experiments applied to dogs have now been applied mostly to people dont you see through the various agencies and this idea of how theyre supposed to react and so forth has invalidated the fact that theyre entitled to have any policies at all in other words this whole parade that you see of animalistic psychologyits arisen since 1879has invalidated the right of the individual to have custom see he isnt supposed to have any customs hes supposed to be stimulusresponse animal and you push enough buttons hes supposed to react in some particular way dont you see so its all sort of pushbutton society you get the idea youre supposed to be able to put an ad on television that tells everybody to feel angry when theywhen they think of the other side getting in or eat wheaties or buy certain kinds of cars and theyre supposed to be mad at brand x and you see theres certain things that are supposed to happen here by stimulus response in other words you havent got policy youve got manipulation and human beings and societies grossly object to manipulation particularly hidden manipulation whereby theres supposed to be elements present which are pushing their buttons around which theyre really not supposed to be aware of and theres some vast technology involved here by which if you push peoples buttons in the right way then they will behave in certain way and they got it all figured out like dog training or something like this you see well now that itself violates the right to have the right way to do things see thats violation right there because theyre saying this individual is just stimulusresponsepattern animal and these patterns are somehow or another ingrained from some quarter that we dont know anything about in other words theyre sort of pressed on him like suit or theyre you knowtheyrehes put in certain kind of mold and you pull lever and something like that and it goes scrunch and hes supposed to walk out of there and after that why he walks poppopgimpho poppopgimpho see this is all supposed to bewell weve denied the individual the right to any sense at all his policy his custom is longer based on whether or not it forwards the survival of himself or his group but just is based on the whim of some bird who wants to make quick profit or sell wheaties or something like this its all up to him you see so when you speak of the dignity of man actually his right to decide for himself and amongst men as to what procedures and policies hell eventually evolve you see and you give him some kind of hierarchy of buttonpushing you say you longer have policy you just have stimulusresponse see well policy and custom and things like this are things of sense they make sense and youll find in the final analysis of any civilization even its most strange looking customs as you see them thousand years afterwards would have made sense had you been living at that time because they had certain problems at that time they were having to walk around and having trouble with and if you were aware of all of the problems they had then their society and customs would make sense take just small matter ofwell the way thatwhere we got the ten commandmentsthe jewish ten commandments and so forth well in their framework the various things which they were fighting they had immediate and direct solution to it except customs and they put together customs in order to follow these very definite problems now of course policy gets to be very funny looking after the problem is gone and the custom continues to be followed then you get very funny lookingfunny looking hangover see you longer have the problem but you still have the policy see and for instance theres been tremendous number of termites in washington dc let us say you know the government employees got out of work and they started eating up the floor as termites and so that these termites just ran over everything you see plenty of termites all over the place you know and so people started developing policies as to how you handle this sort of situation one policy had to do with the fact thatyou see im just dreaming up ridiculous one herethere are lots of termites all over the place eating up all the woodwork dont you see left and right like they have in australia all the time you get this continuousyou never know they leave the shell see and youre liable to lean against pillar or step on floor and it just goes poof and it goes into dust its very funny living in country thats got lot of termites in it because the wood is solid today and tomorrow its not see so you get the custom that when you enter the front door you put your foot forward tap lightly once before walking in well somebody comes alongsomebody comes along and kills all the termites in australia and something like this happens and you find everybody still opening front doors and giving one tap with the right foot on the floor you see and after while nobody can quite explain why theyre doing this so they say well its impolite not to and of course weve dismissed the whole thing now and weve thrown it all away as good reason when weve said it was polite or impolite so we now have new method which is carrying on which had sense once longer has any sense but we now have sort of bow and scrape as people go in front doors see longer has any basis behind it when you get too much of this sort of thing you get civilization which starts to look pretty silly all of the problems which have long since gone away are still being solved by customsand you get very silly looking one i remember there was one of these things people do tend you see to carry over into the future after the problem is licked you can understand somebody getting out of an aircraft as i saw one time which was just in from the south pacific and plane passed overhead flying rather low and the birdthats not just the bird but all twelve of these guys who had just climbed out of this aircraftthrew themselves wildly and flatly down on the concrete apron there you see to get low because it was obviously jap plane coming over and the only trouble is they were in san diego and there were nono jap planes well now they had developed an immediate policy that policy is when you see lowlying aircrafta lowflying aircraft and so forth duck until its identified and thats good safe survival policy i remember one dutch skipper right after the war hed gotten out of the south pacific and hed brought dutch corvette up through the panama canal and for some reason or other best known to the admirals every time ship left and entered port during world war ii why all the local flyers that needed practice on bombing runs were sent out to get lowflying runs on its bridge and it was really very annoying because these things would bat you around on the bridge and so forth and youre trying to negotiate the entrance to the harbor dont you see and these wild screaming aircraft would come down and practically run their wheels on the top of your dodgers these birds were really close you know and this dutch skipper hadnt run into any aircraft since hed left the south pacific and hed left shooting war so nobody inquired what ship this was that was entering one of these harbors i think it was miami harbor nobody bothered to enquire what ship this was and they simply sent the usual squadron of aircraft out to practice bombing runs and this dutch skipper just cut loose and he just filled the air full of lead and washington screamed and everybody howled and beat their chests at how horrible this was and nobody ever did thing to him nevernobody did anything to that dutch skipper he didnt shoot down any aircraft but it wasnt because he didnt try now his custom and policy was based upon the emergency of combat and you just dont let aircraft get that close to your ship thats all i dont care what they got painted on their noses and japanese can use stars and bars just like anybody else can with paintbrush you know theyre awful good with paintbrushes and somebody starts diving your bridge you see you cut loose well that was his policy and of course the policy of miami oh well theres sort of war going on someplace and theres some suckers have gone to attend it but were the wise guys and weve got good berth ashore you know i say that with not any bitterness just truth the policies are completely out policy of lowflying aircraft policy of shipsdivebomb the ships policy in the south pacific for aircraft was never under gods green earth go anywhere near fighting vessel just fly wide brother dont give him any opportunity because see hes liable to mistake who you are do you see policy miami they hadnt found out the war was there somebody down there is going to find out there was war someday and what was going to happen what was going to happen well the best thing to do is take lowflying bombing runs on any ship that you see coming in and out of the harbor because the pilots need practice we dont know practice for what but they need practice dont you see so the policy there was practice and the policy in the south pacific was fight well look at the amount of traffic thats developed look at the amount of arc which went up in smoke at this point boy i remember the lines burning on this actually just for days there wasnt anybody who had gold lace from his cuff to his shoulder that wasnt asking wild questions about what had happened down there you see it went around the world the dutch were asked if theyd declared war on the united states you know all kinds of wild things well what was the result of this you just had two customs clash so to avoid this clash and to maintainim just bringing this point closer home hereto maintain communication and so forth why its good thing to have customs now we in scientology appear to be out of step and very often it may occur to you that we are out of step well youre never quite asked with what and youre only out of step with new johnnycomelately idea that man is an animal that should have his buttons pressed and anybody teaching anything regarding freedom or freedom of speech or anything like that ought to be shot down in flames and this is government ambition and those organizations which tend to conduct themselves as governments such as thewell as i say fascistictype governments such as the american medical association the british medical association the american psychiatric association american psychological association united states government and i dont think the government of victoria is government so we wont include them you have to have some semblance of government before you can call it one anyway they have to have some customs these other blokes arethey got new technologythey got new technology of control its brandnew technology of control now you maybe think it isnt new technology but i was taught at princeton in their school of government and taught very well on lot of these points and there was lot of good joes there they knew their business and one of these things was law proceeds from the customs of the people and law which proceeds only from central directive source and is evolved only by central directive source if it interrupts the custom of the people or seeks to change and alter those will bring about revolution in other words it cant be doneit cant be done and here and there you might have somebody who was very smartsmart enough to see what problems the people are having and then give them some solutions to these problems that the people are having and that would be perfectly all right you see because there wasnt any custom there but how about new one that violates the existing custom thats going to bring about dissonance isnt it its going to bust apart these people as communication points well if they longer have customs in which they are in agreement so that they can act in coordination with each other they go into disagreement amongst themselves and with the government it was custom in the united states to drink so they passed law called prohibitionthe volstead act i dont know how many hundred thousands of murders and how many billion dollars of lost revenues and destroyed property later they found out they couldnt do it and they quit and repealed it well thats one of our most modern examples of the people have certain customs and somebody legislates against these customs and tries to alter them and that will bring about every time very nice great big smoking bunch of civil commotion its the finest way in the world to get civil commotion that when you try to pass law which is contrary to the customs of the people youve got trouble and when they were teaching future military governors this they laid that point in with an ax now youre going to go into this area and youre going to say that bunch of new ideas are just fine but youre there to keep the peace and this is how you keep the peace you keep in effect the customs of the people thats how you keep the peace now if you want to not keep the peace try to change or violate those customs and youre not going to keep the peace and youre just going to have riots and commotion and upset all over and youre not going to be able to hold this civil body in any kind of control and they had good military reason for it because civil bodies which are out of control back of the front lines are embarrassing to the military so their real point of military government was not how nice we should be to civil populaces at all but is how do we keep the roads open how do we keep our supply lines open how do we keep down the incidence of guerrilla warfare how do we do these various things and the military government went in to do that they were taught very hard how to keep the peace and that was the biggest lesson that was laid inis dont change the customs of the people if you wish to keep the peace now we look little bit further having little bit more knowledge of the subject in scientology and we find out the reason why it lies in the area of agreement and disagreement when you have an areaa community which is in agreement with one another they are in agreement on the matter of customs what is the expected cycle of behavior which is looked upon as the survival pattern for that area that expected cycle of behavior what is it you violate that youve told everybody youve said die youve said dont survive anymore youve told everybody what you are in communication with one another about is false the way you communicate from point to point b is longer the way youre going communicate so of course youve cut their comm lines and what are you going to get do you understand why thats comm line because when does action 1 2 and 3 and b does action xyz those two actions dont mesh so of course theres communication the communication is shattered between those two points if xif does 1 2 3 and b over here now also does 1 2 3 youll find out theyre in good communication with each other thats all custom is for and those that promote their survival or are looked upon in the broad sense to promote the survival of the individual in the group and that means that even dueling could become custom because of course this makes tougher rougher better men who are more able tothis is the way its looked onto protect the community at large and is natural selection system see theyve got it all worked out see so even thats survivalnot for the bad duelist but the community right away doesnt want any bad duelists so they dont want them to survive you see so whats thewhats the score here is custom is simply method of bringing about communication and policy is just method of bringing about agreement and communicationalong certain matters which lead to higher level of survival and they lead to higher level of survival if theyre good policies and they lead to lower level of survival if theyre poor policies and they lead to complete disaster if theyre bad policies and youre studying right now the ebb and flow of civilization why is the persian civilization longer amongst us why do we longer have an egyptian civilization and we dont have why do we longer have roman civilization the way it was once course the roman would argue with this he thinks he still is the center of the world but he hasnt looked up lately but whats the whole picture here we get the ebb and flow of civilizations on this basis and their customs could have become antiquated or could have become neglected but its much more often in fact practically always the case that the customs are neglected or smashed from some central source or from some exterior influence and when the customs of the people are smashed by their own government or by an exterior force such as barbarians or war with another nation with different customs when those customs are smashed that civilization is smashed you dont even have to defeat its armies if you can knock its customs in the head the communist unthinkingly and incapable of expressing those thoughts nevertheless is engaged upon that on the planet today and he is using the media of psychology in order to accomplish this but his psychology is the psychology of 1879 it is not the psychology of 1850 or 1800 its different breed of psychology now we are not in conflict with the customs and philosophy of the planet or the universe quite the contrary its not case of everybody is out of step but jim its case of others want people badly out of step and theyre getting them pretty badly out of step but if you can talk to and communicate with anybody on the subject of scientology he agrees with what youd say he agrees very rapidly with what you say unless he misses word if he misses word then he wont agree with what youve said but you are actually talking to him about things which have been with him as customs far far far longer than any johnnycomelately psychology or mental science that has been foisted off on him in recent times you are talking to him about really traditional mental science youre talking to him straight out of the school of aesculapius of greece youre talking to him out of the persian technology really if persian priest were to come along at this moment and start talking to you about this that and the other thing and the human spirit youd be in very good communication with him youd actually be in rather poor communication with vicar over here on the subject of the human spirit but youd still get somewhere but then hes selling pitch hes selling pie in the sky see hes got curve on the ball and therefore he has violated the custom of philosophy which is seek after truth regardless of what you fall across and regardless of what you find still seek after truth only truth will set you free and that is one of the oldest principles of psychology and one of the oldest principles of philosophy and has been consistently violated more and more frequently its getting more and more frequently violated as it moves on up through the ages of western civilization here that is really getting mauled until were even toldwere even told the other day by washington that government has right to lie why i think thats very interesting now all of sudden government virtue is telling lies truth i mean you can look up the references if you want to they made big point out of it and younobody contested this couple of columnists sort of said sneer but there wasnt any row about this well that just goes back to more basic human trait which you usually find in good survival civilization which is tell the truth that violates this custom of tell the truth now all of sudden this government has righta right for gods sakesto lie well theres none of its people have the right to lie see the courts all enforce dont lie everybody tells you not to lie youre taught not to lie george washington and the cherry treedont lie and yet the government can stand above everybody because ityou see iti could say several things that marines say about its loftiness and pompousness it now all of sudden mysteriously develops the right to lie well there you have this philosophic idea seek after truth know the truth speak the truth as close as you can as the traditional philosophic attitude and that on the part of the people is mirrored simply on the fainter hue as it usually is tell the truth theres something valuable about truth see truth has value and these people should tell the truth now that is customary attitude on the part of people and yet to give you the idea of how wild it gets we have government which has more guns and bombs than any other government on earth right now all of sudden standing up and saying it has right to lie well now this is not traditional this is very very very wide from any moral code or standards or behavior patterns or anything of that character you see now someplace some places in africa there are some isolated tribes which hold as great virtues lying and stealing they are very decadent tribes they havent gotten very far they also had as their greatest ambition slaughter all your neighbors and so forth they were verytheyd never gotten very far it doesnt seem to like it was very good idea it doesntisnt representative of what highlevel civilization finally becomes you see so they either were at one time or another fairly highlevel civilization that degenerated or they had policy or custom in this direction which was sufficiently debased that it ever kept them from becoming anything now wed have to look then into the depths of africa in another time in another century to find anything as decadent as government has right to lie now what are they talking about when they talk about we dont follow standard procedures with regard to modern psychology well thats laugh because there are none there just are none thats it subject which starts out and says we cannot define psyche we dont know what it is and we cannot define the word which we call ourselves i wouldnt say was going to go very far and it hasnt gone very far its not up to ninety years yet and thats just breaththats just breath in the breathing of eternity and its very faint pant in the breathing of eternity nothing this is very interesting though when they talk about traditional philosophy or when they talk about traditional ideas about man they would either have to talk with the tongue in their cheek or they would have to say they dont know and they do both they do both and they are nottheyre the ruddy wildeyed revolutionary were not and thats why you so easily go into communication with the man in the street as long as you dont use words which sound strange to him youd find that he is in full agreement with what you are carrying forward that man has certain rights and that you should be able to think your own thoughts and you should be able to give voice to your own thoughts and philosophies and that you should have right to ideas and sort of people should be left alone on this particular subject and so forth well thats woof and warp of scientology isnt it you teach him the fact that man has right to seek freedom he has right to be free see these arethese are very old ideas now on top of tremendous philosophic structure very very large philosophic structure which we have inherited as the traditional philosophic structurewe have then added up tremendous number of new answers which all of them however are directly in the tradition of athe traditional search of philosophy our target is not to make an insane person more quiet it would be to make an insane person sane and that has been the target of mental healingthat has been the target of mental healing since the stone ages that hasnt been the target of mental healing in the last half century you speak to modern psychiatrist and you voice this thought and he looks at you with his jaw dropped where did you ever pick up such an outlandish thought oh you think im joking well you go around and ask one of these jerksjokesfellows one of these days go around and ask this bird what are you trying to do with patient and you will stand there in vain waiting for the answer to make him sane youre sort of flattening process or something youre notyou wont get that answer see to make him quiet to make him more amenable to find out what made him insane youll get all kinds of wild answers that will have nothing to do with the traditional goal of psychotherapy thats why you see you are looked upon as very very dangerous people because youre contrary to the new thought and the new thought is man must be slave you must be able to push his buttons if you can learn anything about him whatsoever you must use it to his disadvantage of course we go on tradition if you learn anything about man that will help him you help him with it well that tradition is now being violated if you learn anything about man that you can manipulate him with you manipulate him well thats not tradition that was ever in vogue thats brandnew brassy new youre going to manipulate men youve got to change their definitions and change their goals and enslave them and do this and do that these fellows would argue with the idea that its good thing for people to be free well oddly enough that has never been an arguable point in the field of philosophy or really seriously over long period of time in enlightened times of government but yes they recognize very well that people would try to be free or people want to be free or theyd recognize these various points see well now theyve developed brandnew philosophy that people want to be slavesthats switcheroo isnt it and theyre selling everybody on the idea that people really really down deep are just mass and what the person wants to do is cohese with this mass and be protected by the mass and that is the new thought the broader philosophic term for that is communism and it was practiced by fellow by the name of i think it was lycurgus back in spartaand didnt work then either you never saw such an intellectual broken leg in your life as sparta if any clever fellow ever got into the borders of sparta the complete lack of originality thought thinking and so forth was sufficiently great to actually drive him back into the hands of the executioners waiting at the border it would drive him mad after while this total sameness staryeyed hypnotic nowhere of the spartan quite interesting sparta had some other philosophies but they were not the philosophies given to them by the gentleman i just mentioned the russians being very close to sparta geographically and so forth got infected with this and its been running over the whole country and nobodys ever been able to invent sufficiently strong penicillin to get lycurgus out of the russian bloodstream they found out the spartan was very good at fighting battles and when youre only interested in fighting battles and youre not interested in your people of course you will adopt only spartan philosophy study up your greek philosophy little bit youll find out the spartanthe spartan and the communist theyre practically indistinguishable but there is one thing that distinguishes them one thing that distinguishes them theres much much bolder and much more degraded philosophy that has attended communism and thats got total switcheroo and big curve on it thatthe spartan didnt even have that now not to get involved on this situationwhat has this got to do with you well it has to do with you to the degreenot because i say we should assume traditional viewpointthat if you carefully look over greek philosophers if you carefully look over the basic customs and belief of man over long period of timeim now talking in terms of tens of thousands of years as far back as you can reachyoull find out that you are echoing in scientology his hopes and his aspirations youre echoing the things for which he has foughtthe things which he has tried to attain in life and if you very carefully studynot just superficial glanceif you very carefully studied the utterances of the socalled man of science in the field of the mind today youll find very degraded 180 percent180 degree vector to those old philosophies man is just an animal if you find any buttons push them man is the property of the state oh my god i thought we got rid of slavery in the dark ages but we didnt here it is again all of these various thingsall of these various things like bad old apples that man has fought against for long time have now rolled forward into present time and become virtues but whatever they are called they are not traditional philosophy and theyre not traditional mental science and there we can smile like cheshire cats because weve got it and they havent got it they are in violent conflict and disagreement with the basic philosophy of philosophy theyre sort of like chemist who hates his test tubes theyre in wild disagreement of what are the purposes and uses of philosophy they say to enslave man and you say to make man free well theyve always been to make man free wheres this new one come from so what we have developed is not new tradition of philosophy we are in that same tradition but what we have developed is the technology that can attain it and we have been very successful in doing this and that is what is new in scientology but the basic idea and the goals of scientology are not new their expression their organization these things could be looked upon as quite new but only the expressiononly the organization but the basic thought that is not new in other words your success is very solidly based and your advance is very solidly based upon the idea that you are not in the least divergent from what the mean average of all great civilizations at all times have deified as the ideal and have sought to achieve your ideas are not one hair off what these fellows were trying to achieve back through the countless eons youre right there see youre right on that broad highway and its the other fellow who is calling you names thats walking in the bramble bushes hes the fellow who is walking around in the briers hes the fellow who has lost his road why is the psychologist studying psychology ah well if he could answer that question if you could getpersuade an answer out of him if hes very young student he might answer you glibly right from the tradition and custom of the race from the people in the street but if hes been trained at any period of time hell longer give you the first answer which might be well to help people hed give you that but after hes been at it for while your seasoned practitioner your welltrained person who is answering now with the answers of indoctrination will never give you that answer he just wont give you that answer thats all because it wouldnt occur to him its not there now what are thesewhat are these fellows headed for theyre headed for oblivion and id base that very solidly because every time any large group or organization in this universe has adopted policies which are antisurvival for the individual of the group as well as the group itself that group has gone to dust it has not survived because its customs are good lets call the doctor the psychiatrist the psychologist call them collectively civilization just to compare them in this particular way and we find out that they have antisurvival policies and customs theyre very antisurvival why the maddest news story i think i ever read in my life is how this drug was killing off everybody in the institution and those it didnt kill off it turned purple and they were all having spasms but the doctor was saying but weve got to have it its the only thing that calms them down but weve got to have this drug and its very catastrophic that its killing them all off because weve got to have it and got to administer whoa they should have had him in cage even in an unenlightened period of philosophy such as elizabethan times they probably would have paraded such bloke up and down the marketin cage these pills are killing everybody but weve got to give them to them and its too bad theyre killing everybody because weve got to have these tran why you probably dont believe very often you think im extreme and that i dont tell you the truth about such peopleand all too often you go and collide with it on your own and you find out there it sits well now how does this compare with the tradition of the witch doctor or even the egyptian doctor or the old greek physician or the aesculapians orhow would you reconcile that well it cant be reconciled weve got to treat the patient well why are we treating this patient obviously the answer is missing if weve got to keep treating the patient this way although it kills him then why we are treating the patient must then be out of agreement with what people normally assume you are treating patients for right the world at large assumes that we are treating patients for certain reason well this guy couldnt possibly have any of that reason for why hes treating patients so therefore his tradition is out and he is out of tradition and i would say that their days aretheir days are not numbered because i am saying their days are numbered but im just analyzing general situation and i wouldnt buy any bonds in that company i dont think it has sound management i think its philosophy of doing business is wrong people who want to kill people will hire them but i dont think this has much future i think we have group there which have antisurvival tendencies and customs and policies and theyre not only antisurvival to those with whom they do business but they are antisurvival to themselves and so their days are numbered just like the days of any civilization or activity or organization which has antisurvival policies their days are numbered so you will live toyou will live yourself to see all that fade away as far as theyre concerned youll see another dawn oddly enough whether you do anything about it or not you dont have to do anything about it at all they would fade away you see they dont have to be fought theyre going to blow themselves upinevitable the germ of their own destruction is carried daily to their offices daily through their conferences daily through their chain of patients and daily homeward and daily to bed so there isnt any reason to get hot about that because they arent even threat to you you are on much sounder tradition youre taking the tradition of man has the desire to be free and when you heal people why you make them better and when things arewhen somebody is sad you make him more cheerful again and i mean these are theeven the accepted thing you see thats it thats custom what do you do with sick man what do you do with despondent person what do you do with these people well you right away immediately will agree why make him well cheer him up something like that well thats in agreement with the populace as whole you dont get complicated answer like well what you do is put him in the hospital for few days so you can charge his relatives and send them bill you dont get institutionalize him for the good of the society you dont get as rockefeller who didnt go rocketing to president ahyou dont form up concentration camps for young people who might go wrong you say oh he had that idea they have those camps in new york nobody ever heard about them theyre concentration camps for youths who might go wrong they havent done anything they havent been charged with anything but they come from family and environmental area which some psychologist has worked out produces majority of criminals and they do this by statistics so if some fellows father has brown eyes and the wife has green eyes and the rh factor of the two of them is winterpoof spaf and the family income does not exceed five thousand dollars month why the young man will become criminal so he must be put in concentration camp oooh you think im joking look im prettyim pretty good im pretty witty i can make up all kinds of jokes but you know im not good enough to make up the jokes those guys pull all the time so you dont think like that so youre not able to understand what theyre all about and they dont think like the populace at large it isnt that they dont think like scientologist its that they dont think like the public at large theyre trying to change the customs you see so therefore they arent understood either and they dont understand the public at large they havent any common ground with them at all now these are all things that its interesting for you to know but actually theyre quite important because you should recognize where we have made the breakthrough and where we have made progress we have made progress in how to accomplish goals which man has had as long as he has been man and what he has considered good and what he has considered desirable in the field of philosophy we have accomplished technicallyand that is the breakthrough which we have made we arent even too far out right now on the old witch doctor because weve got the technology of communication because weve got the technology of putting together session because weve got an auditors code becauseyou see thats all technical materials because weve gotten more technical materials we can now take the old witch doctors red rocks or whatever he was using oh theyre wild you should read some of their treatments some time theygirls having hard time delivering baby and so forth the witch doctor conies in with awith big swollen abdomen goes through writhings and howls and screams and produces great red stone out from underneath his smock and puts it down and says there and feels much better and right away the girl has her baby without any difficulty see he did it without communication but he did do it with duplication theyve got all kinds of symbolical magic they did all kinds of things like this on the amur river the witch doctor of thethe shaman along the amur river still to this day uses these techniques theyve been used far longer by man than any other healing techniques and you find them today suddenly rearing their heads again in clay table work only why are we more effective well its traditional approach so therefore it seems traditional to the person whos doing it buried back along the line hes had plenty of witch doctors leaping and howling and producing stones from underneath the robe dont you see and taking out broken stick and then binding it all up and then showing suddenly magically as he does the unbindings the whole stick is whole again oh you know anybody youre operating on has had plenty of this kind of treatment far earlier on the track than sawbones and setting bones and so forth its higher level of healing because its level by symbology its symbolical healing and its by mass symbols and the assignment of them well we can explain why it works and because we can run session and he couldnt we can make it work far more often than he could make it work dont you see well whats our improvement our improvement is not on the idea that witch doctor called upon to heal leg should have the idea that he should heal the leg you see weve not improved on that idea and thats fairly marvelous idea now the witch doctor should do his job and that the better witch doctor in the tribe got more patients than the worser ones these are all standardline ideas see that the proper thing for witch doctor to do was to work for or with the patient and so forth this was pretty good of course when i speak to somebody who speaks of the jujutype witch doctor of africa i dont make much communication because those boys have long gone the same route that the tribes went down there that say its good to lie and steal see now thats sort of reverse black magic idea and theyre pretty johnnycomelately and theyre prettytheyre pretty rare theyve gone into witch doctoring which is squirrel witch doctoring like psychology so theresbut your tradition is there theres the guy guys got broken leg what do you do well witch doctor comes in whats the witch doctors idea heal the guys broken leg elementary now youve not varied that but the other healing professions which are in existence today have so theyre in violation of mans customs as they reach past the eons and id say their chances of survival were lousy as long as they had that idea and they didnt abandon that idea until very recently very short time ago they started changing everybodys customs on it not all parts of the world have these customs or ideas but they are general and they do go back much longer than other forms since then so whats your approach you just have got better technology see your technology is better wise man sits on mountaintop and he utters wise things and somebody comes up to him and asks him for advice because theyre having bad time in life and he sits up there on his mountaintop and he says well now go ye forth and the first virgin you see walk around her three times and do not spit once and you will have good luck for three days and three nights well now what tradition is going on there regardless of the technology this fellow or wise man on the mountaintop is using what tradition the guy came to him for advice so he helped him thats the tradition the tradition includes that there should be wise men the tradition includes that if there are wise men you go to them for advice you see these are traditional soundssounds sort of elementary doesnt it it sounds so elementary that youd say well of course everybody knows that well everybody knew that but it is now to large degree being violated by the usurping johnnycomelately technology see lord knows what theyd do and faced with the idea that there might be wise man someplace they go mad they say shoot him kill him thats the right thing to do to somebody who was being wise man if somebody wants to go to somebody for advice why the thing to do is tell them theyre all quacks and frauds why that doesnt seem traditional the traditionalif theres somebody who can give you advice why you go to them for advice you dont make commotion about it and then not give them any advice yourself or give them some advice thatll get you bigger fee or something like this this is not in the tradition dont you see and theres never been any tradition that there is orthodox advice on the subject in certain fields and theres unorthodox advice on the subject if there was advice there was advice you see what i mean we have today orthodox science what the hell are we talking about the dark ages in religion orthodox science you mean an experimental research field has an orthodox science you mean theres certain immutable unchangeable nevertobevaried principles in this field oh bull how could there be an orthodox science why in order to have an orthodox science which was totally orthodox and against which all sciences were evaluated legally as to whether or not they were orthodox or not you would have had to have produced some kind of an effect with this orthodox science you know youd have to actually have gotten the whole universe wound up or done something like this dont you see without any proof at all right now we find the fools over there in washington in the food and drug administration we find these nuts talking all the time about not agreeing with orthodox science craziest thing anybody ever heard of they say principle will work or wont work if it agrees or disagrees with orthodox science well this would be all right if theyd laid out textbook and said orthodox science is written by fellow named black and his textbook is available from the library of congress see and thats what we consider orthodox science but they never define orthodox science so whats the trick here is that anything they want to do something to they merely say its unorthodox because there is orthodoxy remember the gag i used to talk to you about this fellow says you are doing wrong but you cant find out whats right you know you can always be hung with the idea that you were doing wrong well youve neverthey have hidden idea of whats right well the art critic is always at this here is field that isnt wrapped up at all the arts wow i mean the arts well whats art well wow whats art i mean thereyouve asked the wildest question that you could ever ever project out into the firmament whats art you cant answer it you can makeyou can make efforts to answer it but supposing supposing we made it law this is art and that isnt art and then gave prison penalty for somebody for not doing art and then had standard art of any kind for him to do like id say people would get confused about that time and theyve done just exactly that today in science they havent got standard science they went and knocked out laws of conservation of energy in the field of elementary physics they must have because they all say they have well if those basic principles of finite physics have been knocked out how could they even have an orthodox science if they dont have the basic physics well then what is basic physics well i dont know i dont think anybody else does today theyve proven several of its principles to be false but theres nothing in its place so right away the art critic comes along and youve just painted painting and the art critic says well actually its quite poor compared to what you see its totally invalid criticism he could say well that line isnt straight well great the line isnt straight thats all right but he would have hard time trying totrying to really lay it down and say this is this and that is that dont you see hed have to tell you whats art hed have to tell you what you should do like and they usually get around itsay that isnt like rubens youre supposed to be doing rubenesque painting and it isnt like rubens well thats perfectly valid statement if youre supposed to be doing rubenesque work and you dont paint like rubens obviously but supposing we make this remark to somebody without any comparison for rubens we dont have any rubens you see you say youre not like boojum and you say what the hell is boojum hmph you dont know well it looks to like somebodys invented way to punish those they wish to punish when they wish to punish them without any reason for punishment it looks to like control mechanism about nine miles wide that is not based on any fact and that is in violation of the basic tradition of law science adjudication everything else find an excuse to punish people with which they cantand they cant comply so therefore you can punish anybody you want to punish anytime you want to punish them because theres way they can say they have complied because what theyre complying with doesnt exist do you see and when ive given you that setup i have of course given you the standard setup in any society which has customs there is right conduct so therefore everybody can be berated because he is not conducting himself rightly so it becomes society of total criticism it is longer society in which anyone can comply because theres nothing you can comply with if there is right conduct then how in the name of god can you do any right conduct if theres bridge to walk across how can you walk across bridge supposing theres bridge to walk across and everybody who doesnt walk across the bridge is shot youd say thats unreasonable its not unreasonable its insane and thats how far society can go on the subject of customs it can go all the way out the bottom in other words they pretend there is custom there when there isnt any they pretend that there is reason when there is none they pretend that there is onetwothreefour procedure and then will never tell you what it is and yet punish you because you dont comply with it and that is the society which is gone it may be still around its spires may be brilliant against the afternoon sky but the sun is setting and it is setting at high velocity its interesting that the brassiness of the material wealth of the society is test of its endurance how long the society is to endure demonstrates that they very often have ceased to be vital societies at the time they were building their biggest statues that was true of the age of pericles greece had already gone by the boards when she had her greatest period of art quite interesting isnt it shed lost her grip she was more and yet most of the things weve inherited have come from that period right after she was gone nation thats allthats all very germane to the point so as long as you stay with the tradition of when you say something youre supposed to be sensible when somebodys sick you help them when they are despondent you try to cheer them up if youre practitioner you try to help people if you have technology you use it for the survival of the group if you have knowledge and so forth you should use it to assist others these are the traditions which have built the great civilizations of this planet and the great civilizations of this universe are all operated on those traditions those are customs they are proven to be survival characteristics theresdoesnt mean that there cant be other ideas that there cant be other customs but it does mean that those are customs and then you follow this thought through little bit further and youll see then that part of custom has to do with its communication because custom permits communication then the communication of customs is itself quite technology you follow so it is where the custom has broken down in its communication that it is abandoned the custom is not communicated anymore and even though it is still useful it is therefore not followed now the breakdown of the custom itself will cause fall out of communication you see longer get joe saying how are you bill and its customary of course for bill to say oh im okay how are you joe see thats very customary so one two three one two three see thats customary we longer teach somebody who is moving up into this civilization that when people ask him how he is why he should tell them and ask them how they are see we longer communicate the mechanism of communication see we forget to communicate this mechanism of communication we dont teach people this anymore we dont make these customs available any more they arent there theyre gone then we get breakdown on the part of civilization see its customs are longer taught to it somebody else is trying to teach him different customs or holding the survival value of these customs in question or invalidating customs or the nation or civilization is under raid or something from some dissident source some other organization or group is trying to cave it in and so its trying to knock these things around or fix it so they wont be communicated anymore or new developments of one kind or another come along and sweep aside old customs for some reason or other but thats the lesser reason oddly enough although its announced by the sociologist as the primary reason it isnt its thereally that the customs longer communicated and civilization breaks down on this basis that the means of communication are not any longer taught in that society so its customs its policies this sort of thing theyre not taught so therefore the people inside that society cant work together you get very littleto use the old chinese wordyou get very little gungho there cooperation see well wheres the cooperation well the people dont know the customs on which theyre operating net result of that is decay decline and vanishment of the group so therefore we come to the second part of what i told you about at the beginning of the lecture which is teaching people scientology how could you be remiss well teach them with words and terms which they do not understand louse up the communication so it doesnt communicate in other words use terms which are not defined use various things which are undiscoverable do poor job of teaching them customs in other words and theyll go to pieces everything will go to pieces on that effort in fact your effort may be completely unsuccessful but it may be just partially successful and they havent learned their lessons well at all at all at all and they blow up in your face and this is why any practitioner setting himself up newly in districtif he got bad reputation or so forththis is the real reason why he would get bad reputation it isnt based on fact at all i can demonstrate to you very definitely that it does nothas nothing to do really with behavior behavior conduct of practice have almost nothing to do with it its rather frightening because customarily we believe that if we conduct good and effective practice and do good job and so forth why other things will of course immediately follow in sequence and that doesnt happen to bethat doesnt happen to be it if you are successful and if you mean to stay there long time these give you longterm survival being effective in how you handle case is not primary in having good reputation or repute in your immediate area thats interesting isnt it theres something came ahead of that its being comprehensible when you teach somebody something when you do something for somebody why put it in such way and handle it in such way and handle your little courses and teachings in such way as they are comprehensible because if youre truly comprehensible theyll forgive you almost anything your primary course of human existence then is guided by whether or not they can comprehend this must be the basic fundamental on which it is built so they understand you why this opens the door for your effectiveness to become apparent but if they dont understand you the door will close on all of your effectiveness do you see that so by all means by all means for heavens sakes be effective because you can be comprehensible for quite period of time but in the final analysis youve also got to deliver you see youve also got to deliver but delivery is not allit isnt of the same magnitude of comprehensibility doing the job is not of the same magnitude at all just hole camouflagedwell just hole can exist in society into which certain class of activity will occur i mean its only that theyve got to havetheyve got to have some doctors theyve got to have some doctors you see and the societys got to have some doctors and just the fact that theres this terrific need will cause somebody to supply that demand and you get the modern medico he isnt going tohe isnt going to do much for anybody you understand hes going to make motions and so forth but its the fact theres this terrific need for healing in the society which then brings about the fact that somebody steps into the breach its the need that creates the demand so if that exists and he still goes on and does this and hes ineffective at it as long as theres the need why therell be something filling that hole see so competence is not at the top rank there so we get it something on the order of comprehensibility necessitythat is to say the demand theres got to be demand you got to be comprehensible and then if you want to keep at it any length of time at all and not have somebody shoot you down like were going to shoot them downjust by existing we will do that not that we ever have to commit an overt on itnow youve got to be effective now youve got to be very effective and of course if you put effectiveness into these other two things you arethe demand exists you are terrifically comprehensible as to exactly what you are doing and you dont let anybody get by with not comprehending you and so forth and then you do your job well and effectively well hell general sherman tank is grasshopper compared to the way you would forge forward do you see but theyre in something of that order of importance you cant get along forever without being effective but you can get along certain distance even without being effective now if you did those things and so forth why the woof and the warp of future civilizations actually would depend upon you its that important because these things can exist the philosophic tradition must be kept alive these things must go forward and youll find out that you would succeed to the degree that you followed along this line and the degree that you understood what you were doing and people understood what you were doing and understood you and then this demand would be there and then you of course are competent in operating why how could you miss thank you
