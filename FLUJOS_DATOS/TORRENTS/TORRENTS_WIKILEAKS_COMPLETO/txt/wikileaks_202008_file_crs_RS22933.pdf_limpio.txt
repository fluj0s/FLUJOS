its annual report for 2007 the plan reported administrative costs of 786 million and assets of 2316 billion thus the administrative expenses of the thrift sa vings plan were about 34 cents for each

government agency the federal retirement thrift investment board6 the thrift board is charged in statute with operating the thrift plan prudently and solely in the interest of the participants and their beneficiaries7 the thrift board is responsible fo r developing the i nvestment policies of the thrift savings plan and overseeing the management of the pl an which is under the daytoday direction of an executive director appointed by the board three of the five members of the board including the chairman are appointed by the president the president chooses fourth member of the bo ard

659 of pl 104208 these two funds we re the small capitaliza tion stock index s fund and the internationa l stock index i fund participants may allocate their contributions among any or all of the five investment funds and they may reallocate their account balances among the five funds one fund invests exclusively in us government secur ities the other four funds invest in private sector stocks and bonds the four funds that invest in privatesect or securities are all index funds index funds purchase secur ities in the same pr oportion as they are represented in an index of stocks or bonds rather than through the decisions of an investment manager as result index funds have lower administrative costs than activelymanaged funds moreover because they purchase securities in the same proportion as they are represented in an i ndex there is little or opportunity for the purchase of securities by the fund to be influe nced by third parties who might benefit from having the fund invest in particular companies or sectors of the economy the five investment funds in the thrift savings plan are as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22933crs5 9 because the l funds are invested in the five authorized tsp invest ment funds they did not require congressional authorization the l f unds are methods of allocating assets not new funds1 the government securities investment fund the g fund invests only in us treasury securities and other securities backed by the full faith and credit of the united states as of december 31 2007 the g fund held assets of 839 billion 2 the fixed income

foreign corporations represented in the morgan stanley capital investment eafe europe australiaasia far east index as of december 31 2007 the i fund held assets of 296 billion in 2005 the tsp added five new l lifecy cle funds wh ich invest in the five authorized tsp funds in allocations that are based on the employees expected date of retirement9 the l funds include an income fund and four funds that allocate investments based on expected retir ement dates of 2010 2020 2030 and 2040 by allocating assets among the five authoriz ed tsp investment f unds based on workers expected dates of retirement assets are gradually moved from higherreturning but more volatile investments when they are young to lowerreturning but more stable investments as they approach retirement age in july 2008 for example the l2040 fund holds 18 of its assets in bonds and 82 in stocks the l2010 funds holds 68 of its assets in bonds and 32 of its assets in stocks legislative history of tsp investment options the legislative history of the federal employees retirement system indicates that congress designed the tsp to permit employees to diversify their investments among assets with significantly different risk and return characteristics at low cost to the participants the opportunity fo r participants to diversify their investments was provided by including government bond fund corporate bond fund and common stock fund low costs to the participants were achieve d by requiring the corporate bond fund and the common stock fund to be index funds ra ther than actively managed funds

senate re port 99166 october 30 1985 p 18 13 analysis of additional thrift savings plan investment funds federal retirement thrift investment board washington dc may 19 1993index funds provide participants with low cost investment options and also minimize the opportunity for political influences to aff ect the management of the investment funds as the house committee report on the fers legislation stated most importantly the three funds authorized in the legislation are passively managed funds not subject to political manipulation great deal of concern was raised about the possibility of political manipulation of large pools of thrift plan money this legislation was designed to preclude that possibility10 an index fund allocates its investments to the stocks in the index in the same or similar ratio that the value of given stock has to the total value of all of the stocks in the index thus the actual decision to buy or sell given stock is determined by the market place ie the ratio of values of stock within the index as the relative values change the investments from the fund change hence individual or group of individuals are capable of manipulating investments11 likewise the senate committee report stated another concern the committee wrestled with was the potential for market manipulation through political pressure the committee specifically designed the plan to avoid this problem the legislati on provides for three investment funds that are essentially selfmanaged12 from 1993 to 1995 the thrift board evalua ted options for adding new investment funds to the tsp in 1995 the board recommended that congress authorize two additional investment options sma ll capitalization stock index fund and an international stock i ndex fund the board concluded th at these two funds would offer opportunities for participants to diversify their assets into broad classes of equities not represented in the c fund which represents 500 large american corporations in the absence of empirical evidence that activelymanaged f unds outperform index funds over the long term the board recommended that the two new funds s hould be i ndex f unds because indexing allows investors to hold broadly diversified portfolio at lower cost than active management13 the boards analysis noted that indexing is less expensive than active management because of minimal re search costs reduced transaction costs from lower turnover and lower management fees section 659 of pl 104208 the omnibus consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year 1997 authorized the addition of small capitalization stock index fund and an international stock index fund to the thri ft savings plan the s fund and the i fund were added to the tsp in 2001 cong ress has not authorized any other tsp investment funds since the s and i funds were added to the tsp in 2001
