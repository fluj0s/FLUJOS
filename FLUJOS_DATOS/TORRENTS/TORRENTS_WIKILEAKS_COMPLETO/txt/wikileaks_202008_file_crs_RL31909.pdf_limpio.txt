techniques for obt aining documents from the executive branch including simple requests committ ee investigations subpoenas and holding executive officials in contempt one procedure used only in the house of representatives is the resolution of inquiry which is simple resolution making direct request or demand of the presiden t or the head of an executive department to furnish the house of representatives with specific factual information in the possession of the executive branch2 it has been the practice to use the verbs request in asking for information from the president and direct when addressing department heads3 resolutions of inquiry are often much mo re effective in obtaining information from the executive branch than one would expect from viewing committee and floor action administrations have often released substantial amount of information leading the committee of jurisdiction to conclude that the dispute is moot and it is therefore appropriate to report the resolu tion adversely and table it on the floor as examples in this report demonstrate the sponsor of resolution will often support an adverse report and tabling action because the administration has substantially complied with the resolution there is counterpart in current sena parliamentary pr actice for resolutions of inquiry although there are precedents dating to the end of the 19th century and an effort in 19264 nothing prevents the senate from passing such resolutions but apparently the senate is satisfied with the leverage it has through other

immediate consideration6 origins of practice from its very first years congress s requested information from the executive branch to further legislative inquiries initially these requests did not depend on house rule they were made pursuant to the implied authority of congress to investigate the executive branch for exam ple in 1790 the house investigated the receipts and expenditures of public m oneys during robert morriss term as superintendent of finance dur ing the continental congress7 congress sought documents from the executive branch in 1790 to judge the size of an annuity to be given baron frederick von steuben8 as part of its 1792 investigation into the military losses suffered by the troops of major general art hur st clair the house received substantial number of documents from the war department9 these early investigations differed in scope and procedure from the house resolution of inquiry which depends not on congress operating as the grand inquest but by special rule that grants privileged status to lawmakers motion to obtain documents from the executive bran ch early house rules contained procedure for requesting information fro m the president or cabinet officials10 throughout its first two decades however th house made repeated requests to the president and departmental heads for in formation sometimes to be returned to congress and sometimes to the states for example on january 5 1797 the house took up this resolution involving th concurrence of both chambers resolved by the senate and house of re presentatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that the president of the united states be requested to give information to the several states who were by the commissioners appointed to settle accounts between the

lacked privileged status under house rules s imilarly in 1811 the house considered resolution requesting the president to lay before the house list of the whole number of persons impressed seized and otherwise unl awfully taken from on board vessels sailing under the united states flag on the high seas or rivers in ports and harbors12 in 1820 the house clarified its rules for requesting information from the executive branch there was concern that the house had not been acting with sufficient consideration before making such requests in offering an amendment to house rules on december 12 1820 representative charles rich noted that six clerks had been constantly employed from th close of the last session to the present time in collecting the materials to enable one of the departments to answer call at the last session13 rich offered this change to the rules propositi on requesting information from the president of the united states or directing it to be furnished by the secretary of either of the executive departments or the postmaster general shall lie upon the table one day for consideration unless otherwise ordered with the unanimous consent of the house14 on the following day the house agreed to richs proposition15 two years later the house made another change to its rules governing resolutions of inquiry requiring not merely days delay but also committee consideration and shall be taken up for consideration on th next day in the order in which they were presented immediately after reports are called for from select committees and when adopted the clerk shall cause the same to be delivered16 the house rule now read proposition requesting information from the president of the united states or directing it to be furnished by the head of either of the executive departments or by the postmaster general shall lie on the table one day for consideration unless otherwise ordered by the unanimous consent of the house and all such propositions shall be taken up for consideration in the order they were presented immediately after reports are called for from select committees and when adopted the clerk shall cause the same to be

21 ibid 22 ibid 23 ibidthis language survived until 1879 wh the house rules committee reported language to eliminate the need for lawmakers to seek unanimous consent from the chamber in order to seek executive documents speaker samuel j randall explained that it was very seldom that it is in order for member to offer resolution calling for information that is the difficulty any one member at any time may prevent call for information18 granting this advantage representative roger q mills objected to the procedure for committee referral what is the necessity for having resolution calling for information from one of the executive departments referred to committee what is the use of my offering resolution of that kind and having it referred to committee and there buried19 representative james garfield explained that the purpose of committee referral was to avoid the constant danger of gentlemen upon this floor duplicating ca lls for information some one may want some information and offer resolution calling for it and it passes by unanimous consent and the same thing may have b een asked already by somebody else and nobody has paid any attention to the fact th at the same thing has already been called for garfield thought it better that legisl ative requests for information be referred to the committees in order that they may not be duplicated so as to put the departments to the necessity of employing large number of clerks for useless purpose20 the house committee on rules recommended language that gave committees of jurisdiction full discretion over resolutions referred to them under this call resolutions for information from the executive departments of the government may be offered for reference to the appropriate committees such committees to have the right to report at any time21 the language under this call referred to procedure that required resolutions calling for executive information to be offered only during the morning hour of every monday22 representative mills objected to this procedure pointing out that resolution calling for information might be of partis an character because member of the minority wanted information in the possession of an executive officer of the majority party in the house did anyone believe he asked that such resolution would get out of any committee against the vote of majority of its members when the design of the resolution was perhaps to expose the malfeasance of some officer belonging to the party of the majority23 representative william h calkins found garfieldshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31909crs5 24 ibid 25 ibid 26 ibid 27 ibid 28 ibid p 1019argument about duplication unpe rsuasive if lawmaker asked for information that an executive department had already made available to another lawmaker it would be full answer to the resolution for such department to reply that the information had already been given and the departme nt would not be required to go over it again24 as to millss argument that committee could use its majority party power to block any action on resolution speaker ra ndall noted that members of the majority party could block floor action on the reso lution because single member of that majority could object to it mills conceded that point but said there would be record25 representative john h baker thought th at too much power had been centered in the committees of jurisdiction u pon receiving resolution requesting information it should be imperative for th committee to report either for or against the resolution so as to allow the question to come before the house for its determination speaker ra ndall considered that very good suggestion that did not occur to the rules committee26 representative harry white sharpened bakers proposal by requiring the committ ee to report within one week27 bakers amendment as modified was agreed to resulting in this language and such committees shall report thereon within one week thereafter28 committee and floor procedures under house rule xiii clause 7 member may address resolution of i nquiry to the head of an executive department the resolution is privileged and may be considered at any time after it is properly reported or discharged from committee if the resolution is not reported to the house within 14 legislative days after its introduction motion to discharge the co mmittee from its further consideration is privileged should the committee or committees of referral report or be discharged under time limit placed by the speaker within the 14 day period only designee of the committee can move to proceed to th consideration of the resolution on the floor typically the house debates resolution of inquiry for not more than one hour before voting on it when committee reports resolution the time for consideration is generally given to the committee chairman who may decide to grant half the time to the ranking member of the committee or subcommittee the deadline for committee to

resolution of inquiry is usually refe rred to the committee that has jurisdiction over the subject matter but on number of occasions two or more committees have been involved in responding to resolution of inquiry after resolution of inquiry is introduced and referred to committee the committee sends the resolution to the administration for action requesting time ly response to allow the committee to act within the deadline for committee report while waiting for information from the executive branch the committee may decide to act on the resolution in the form in which it was referred or consider amendments to it the committee then votes to report the resolution favorably or adversely it may also decide not to report at all forcing the member who introduced the resolution to make motion to discharge the committee in most cases the committee reports either positively or negatively if the committee concludes that the administrations response is in substa ntial compliance with the resolution it may offer motion on the house floor to table the resolution on the ground that the congressional interest has been satisfied when resolution of inquiry is repor ted from committee the chairman of the committee calls up the resolution and becomes floor manager either to pass the resolution or table it if the committee d ecides not to report the sponsor of the resolution can call up the resolution as privileged business the privileged status of the resolution applies only to requests for facts within the administrations control and not for opinions or investigations31 in 1905 member of the house asked unanimous cons ent for resolution that requested the secretary of the interior to furnish to congress report on the progress of the investigation of the black sands of the pacific slope and for his opinion as to whether or not this inves tigation should be continued32 another member pointed out that the geological survey in lette r to the senate had already reported on the result of the investigation33 because of possible dupli cation of printing objection was heard to the resolution of inquiry th sponsor of the resolution asked is not this privileged resolution speaker joseph g cannon replied the chair thinks the first part of the resolution privileged the latter part is not privileged and that destroys the privilege of the whole resolution34

1891 member offered resolution of inquiry to the regents of the smithsonian institution for information regarding expenditures of the national zoological park the following dialogue occurred between representative benjamin enloe and speaker charles f crisp the speaker the rule applies only to resolutions of inquiry addressed to the heads of executive departments mr enloe on that poi nt mr speaker i desire to say that the reason why the resolution was framed as it is and also the reason why i consider this as presenting question of privilege is because it is addressed to the regents of the smithsonian institution who are made truste for the disbursement of this fund and for the organization of this park and are not under the control of any department of the government the speaker head of executive departments is the language of the rule mr enloe i understand but the regents of the smithsonian are not under the jurisdiction of any partment of the government m ember and consequently do not come under the rule mr enloe they are virtually the head of department and i should think they come within the meaning of the rule the speaker they are not heads of any executive department mr enlow well mr speaker i believe it is privileged but instead of arguing that proposition i will ask unanimous consent that the resolution be now considered by the house35 objection was heard36 following enlows resolution member announced that he had resolution reported back from the committee on commerce asking for certain information from the intersta commerce commission again speaker crisp ruled the chair thinks it is not privileged the interstate commerce commission is not the head of department37 there are cases when the ch air rules against resolution of inquiry because it is not directed to an executive departme nt but the member prevails through unanimous consent motion in 1904 memb er called up resolution of inquiry to obtain information from the civil servi ce commission after the chair ruled that the resolution was not privileged matter because it did not call upon the head of department but upon the civil service commission the member asked unanimous consent for its immediate consideration there was objection and the resolution was accordingly considered and adopted38httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31909crs8 39 annals of congress vol 23 november 26 1811

the situation in the indiana territory which may not be improper to be communicated40 early in 1812 resolution requested the president to furnish the house with copies of instructions given to the us minister at london regarding the impressment of american seamen into the naval service of great britain excepting so much as it may be improper to disclose on account of any pending negotiation41 in

of government estab lished by law was in compliance with the act of congress of th 16th day of july 1790 this resolution was not taken up as resolution of inquiry instead the rules were suspended by the necessary twothirds majority and the resolution adopted42 president grant could have withheld information on the ground stated in the resolution that disclosure was not compatib with the public in terest he chose to set forth constitutional reasons for declining th information first he said he could find nothing in the constitution to justify congressional interest as to where the president discharged official acts and duties what the house could require in terms of information from the executive branch was limited to what is necessary for the proper discharge of its powers of legisla

information as part of impeachment proceedings the information would be supplied in denying the house the papers it requested on the jay treaty president george washington stated that the only ground on which the house might have legitimately requested the documents was impeachment which the resolution has not expressed45 president james polk recognized that the power of impeachment gives the house the right to investig ate the conduct of all public officers under the government this is cheerfully admitted in such case the safety of the republic would be the supreme law and the power of the house in the pursuit of this object would penetrate into the most secret recesses of the executive department it could command the attendance of any nd every agent of the government and compel them to produce all papers public or private official or unofficial and to testify on oath to all fact s within their knowledge46 third grant pointed out that previous pr esidents found it necessary

substantially complied with hres 745 and that the issue was theref ore moot and he would make motion to table the resolution62 representative robert mcclory member of the judiciary committee disagreed

example typifying this executivelegislative exchange comes from 1979 when 81 members supported hres 291 reso lution that directed president carter to provide the house with information on the energy crisis shortages of crude oil and refined petroleum products thods used in allocating oil supplies possible actions within the private industry to withhold or reduce oil supplies and any reduction in the supply of crude oil from any foreign country65 within week 21 additional members joined as sponsors of the resolution the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce reported the resolution unfavorably and recommended that it not pass66 however the committee had been seeking the information in number of hearings and had asked the department of energy to pr ovide the information requested in the resolution the committee stated that much of the info rmation could be f ound in departmental publications and that some of the inform ation had been obtained in the course of committee investigations yet it also faulte d the administration it cannot be said that all information necessary to fu ll understanding of the supply problem is collected by the doe nor that the information which is collected is timely to the contrary the committee has found the doe lacking vital information on such matters as secondary stocks and actual sales of products the information supplied by the department was rarely timely as result of long lag times in sending out forms and retrieving them and the partment was heavily reliant on unverified industry data despite the clear directives from the congress in variety of statutes such as the energy supply and envir onmental coordination act of 1974 and the department of energy organization act67 the committee offered several reasons for reporting the resolution adversely 1 the department had pr ovided all of the request ed documents which were available at the time resolution was considered and has promised to provide the committee

that the congress and the public have been fully informed concerning these matters nor does the committee wish to indicate that the c ongress does not have right to such information to the contrary the congress clearly has such right rather the use of resolution of inquiry is not th appropriate mechanism for obtaining this readily available data it simply will not result in any new data69 when

total is stack of papers nearly foot high yet he also conceded that all of the committee members believe that the departments gathering system is inadequate and that data concerning the energy supplies demands and prices is not timely provided70 representative dingell said he was not critical of those who filed th resolution of inquiry i do believe that continued inquiry by the congress is highly desirable i believe that the information must be made plain71 instead of the mass of material sitting on the desk several members wanted summary of what the documents contai ned representative dingell said the department had prepared summary but it was not yet available from the printer after several members objected to voting on the resolution without summary representative dingell agreed to withdraw his initial motion for the immediate consideration of the resolution72 debate continued the next day w ith number of members expressing dissatisfaction with the qua lity of departmental

protection than the average citizen91 by vote of 404 to 4 the house decided to table the resolution of inquiry92 in other situations congress may choos to investigate scandal even if jeopardizes successful prosecutions in terms of public policy it may be more important to investigate matter promptly rather than wait for the justice department or an independent counsel to investigate prosecute and pursue appeals such was the case with irancontra where both houses of congress concluded that the value of timely legislative investigation outweighed the needs of prosecutors lawrence walsh the independent counsel for irancont ra recognized that if congress decides to grant immunity there is way that it can be avoided they have the last word and that is proper distribution of power the

committee voted to table the resolution on the ground that it was not restricted to factual answers but instead required investigation on the part of the president to answer several of the questions133 representative rosenthal having announced his intenti on to call up hres 552 for house action b ecause the committee had not reported on his resolution agreed to withhold that motion in exchange for committee hearings representative morgan advised representative rosenthal that the committee should get the facts regarding the proposed sale and i will be glad to cooperate w ith him in making that happen134 the hearings were important because congress was in the process of deciding whether to block the sale by passing resolution of disappr oval under section 36b of the foreign

the sale in the past two months and there would ve been none were it not for the questions posed in house resolution 552 the resolution of inquiry when the administration acknowledged the sale it

this very important arms sale and policy decision135 formal notice of the sale reached c ongress on july 10 under section 36b congress had 20 calendar days to pass concurrent resolu tion of

from the executive branch in the past even when committees report the resolutions adversely or succeed in tabling them on the house floor substantial amount of information has usually releas ed to congress in fact arguments that the administration has complied with resolution are frequently the reason for reporting resolution adversely nd tabling it on occasion resolution of inquiry is reported adversely because it competes with other investigations either in congress or in the executive branch th at are considered the more appropriate avenue for inquiry in some situations re solutions of inquiry have been instrumental in triggering other congressi onal methods of obtaining information such as through supplemental hearings or alternative legi slation recent congresses have shown an increase in the use of these privileged resolutions members turn to resolutions of inquiry for different reasons member may introduce such resolution if he or she has been unable to do so through other channels eg committee investigations and hearings the committee of jurisdiction might have advised the lawmaker that it had intention of investigating the matter also resolution of inquiry is often useful way for member to bring attention to an issue receive basic info rmation from the administration and perhaps trigger more extensive legislative investigations
