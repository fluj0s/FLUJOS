finally to the 038 cut in fashioning the 038 spending cut congress included several important features 1 reductions made pursuant to the provision were to take the form of rescissions of fy2000 budget authority 2 the required spending cuts were to be applied only to the total discretionary budget authority made available to each department and agency not to any mandatory resources 3 reductions were to be applied uniformly to each account for the department of defense and the defense activities of the department of energy except that reductions were to be made in military personnel accounts 4 with regard to nondefense activities there was stated requirement that reductions be applied uniformly to each departments or agencys accounts but there was requirement that program project or activity within an account be reduced by more than 15 percent and 5 the omb director was instructed to include in the presidents budget for fy2001 report specifying the reductions made to each account

46the 038 percent acrosstheboard cut in fy2000 appropriations background as the federal budget process for fy2000 unfolded in 1999 during the first session of the 106th congress policy emerged of keeping the level of discretionary spending ie spending controlled through the annual appropriations process within the statutory limits while at the same time not using the social security surplus ie incurring an onbudget deficit1 one of the purposes in adhering to the discretionary spending limits was to avoid sequester at the end of the session2 sequester involves automatic largely across theboard reductions in discretionary spending in order to eliminate any breach of the limits separate sequestration process entails automatic reductions in mandatory spending if the enactment of revenue or mandatory spending measures causes violation of payasyougo requirement under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended the director of the office and management and budget omb is charged with determining within 15 days after the close of congressional session whether sequester of either kind is required for the fiscal year in order to enhance its efforts in trying to stay within the discretionary spending limits congress and the president used various budgetary devices and techniques including emergency spending designations advance appropriations rescissions offsets in mandatory programs obligation and payment delays and directed scoring3 these devices either resulted in upward adjustments in the limits as was the case with the emergency spending designations or were counted as savings for the fiscal year according to omb the adjustments and savings from these devices amounted to tens of billions of dollars and averted the need for sequester in the aggregatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl304434 omb final sequestration report ibid table 6 pages 1314 5 us congressional budget office final sequestration report for fiscal year

also issues sequestration estimates but they are advisory only only the determinations made by the omb director can trigger sequester for fy2000 cbo indicated that discretionary spending exceeded the limits by 67 billion in budget authority and 152 billion in outlays which would have necessitated an acrosstheboard cut of about four percent5 one of the devices used to prevent the violation of the discretionary spending limits that garnered public attention was the inclusion of 038 cut acrosstheboard cut in the omnibus appropriations act used to wrap up consider ation of the regular appropriations acts for fy2000 according to estimates made by omb following the measures enactment the 038 cut was expected to yield savings of 2351 billion in budget authority and 1356 billion in outlays for the fiscal year the final omb estimate of the savings in budget authority was increased to 2357 billion without the enactment of the 038 cut and absent any comparabl offsets the limit for discretionary budget authority would have been exceeded by about 08 billion and sequester would have occurred legislative action on acrosstheboard cut proposals house and senate interest in an acrosstheboard spending cut surfaced relatively late in the session after much of the annual appropriati ons process had been completed legislative action on acrosstheboard cut proposals encompassed several different annual appropriations measures beginning with s 1650 and including hr 3064 and hr 3194 the formulation of the proposal evolved through the different stages of legislative action from senseofthesenate statement to 097 cut and finally to 038 cut s 1650 on september 29 1999 the senate began consideration of s 1650 its initial version of the laborhhseducation appropriations act for fy2000 on october 1 senator don nickles the assistant majority leader offered an amendment numbered 1851 to the bill stating the sense of the senate that an acrosstheboard cut in appropriations should be adopted if necessary to avoid incurring an onbudget deficit on october 6 he offered further amendment numbered 1889 to his underlying amendment amendment numbered 1889 was similar to the underlying amendment and focused on protecting social security surpluses stating the sense of the senate that congress should ensure that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an onbudget deficit excluding the surpluses generated by the socialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl304436 the text of amendments number 1851 and 1889 and the accompanying remarks of senator nickles are found in the

funds by adopting an acrosstheboard reduction in all discretionary appropriations sufficient to eliminate such deficit if necessary6 in describing his amendments senator nickles indicated that an acrosstheboard cut of 1 of discretionary appropriations might be needed to eliminate an estimated overage of about 5 billion other senators provided estimates that the overage might be much larger and that cut of 55 might be needed on october 6 the senate adopted amendment numbered 1889 by vote of 5446 after tabling another amendment dealing with the issue offered by senator frank lautenberg senator nickles withdrew his underlying amendment the senate passed the bill the next day without an acrosstheboard cut provision hr 3064 following veto by president clinton on september 28 of the first district of columbia appropriations act for fy2000 the house and senate developed second version hr 3064 which also included the laborhhs education appropriations for fy2000 the conferees on the measure inserted an acrosstheboard cut provision in section 1001 of division c of the act see box 1 the house agreed to the conference report on the measure on october 28 by vote of 218211 the senate agreed to it on november 2 by vote of 4948 unlike the language that the senate had considered earlier section 1001 set in place the requirement for specific cut in discretionary appropriations097 of the total provided for each account the section also provided that the pay of members of congress permanent rather than an annual appropriation would be subject to the cut under the sequestration process the pay of members of congress is not subject to reduction senator ted stevens chairman of the senate appropriations committee described the provision as placeholderin the face of certain vetountil the final necessary reductions could be negotiated with the clinton administration we have included against my best wishes an acrosstheboard cut that is primarily because only the administration can identify some of the areas we can reduce safely without harming the programs and i am confident when we come to what we call the final period to devise bill we will work out with the administrat ion some offsets that will take care of the bill i am hopeful we will have acrosstheboard cut but if it comes it will not be as large as the one in this bill right

think next year we ought to do the same thing over and over again because that is what the american people expect us to do the acrosstheboard spending cut in this bill will force the agencies of

appropriations measures involved about 45 billion in gimmicks he observed another issue at the center of negotiations was whether to include small acrosstheboard cut this cut was not necessary to reach the offset targets to make sure the bill was paid for more than enough money was available from other sources it is simply an attempt by the majority to create symbol that could be used to pretend that in the midst of this orgy of gimmickry in spending that they are continuing to be fiscally responsible congressional record november 18 1999 164 page h12742 there was hardly any discussion of the provision during senate consideration of the conference report senator john mccain suggested that it represented an abdication of budgetary responsibility it resorts to an

president clinton did not make any reference to the acrosstheboard cut13 design and implementation of the 038 percent cut in fashioning the 038 spending cut congress included several important features first reductions made pursuant to the provision were to take the form of rescissions of fy2000 budget authority ie appropriations and offsetting collections rescissions permanently cancel budget authority second the required spending cuts were to be applied only to the total discretionary budget authority made available to each department and agency any mandatory resources made available to department or agency eg permanent appropriations to fund an entitlement program would not be affected by the requirement third reductions were to be applied uniformly to each account for the department of defense and the defense activities of the department of energy except that reductions were to be made in military personnel accounts with regard to nondefense activities there was stated requirement that reductions be applied uniformly to each departments or agencys accounts however there was requirement that program project or activity ppa within an account be reduced by more than 15 percent14 finally the omb director was instructed to include in the presidents budget for fy2001 report specifying the reductions made to each account under the requirement unlike the earlier provision in hr 3064 providing for 097 cut pay for members of congress was not made subject to the reductions on november 24 1999 omb issued bulletin 0001 rescission of fy2000 discretionary budget authority providing guidance to agencies in how to comply with the requirement for the 038 cut omb advised agencies to observe the following guidelines beyond those specified in the act reductions
