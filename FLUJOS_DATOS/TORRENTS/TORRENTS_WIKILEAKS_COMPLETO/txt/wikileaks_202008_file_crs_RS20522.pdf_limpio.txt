half this report will be updated background1 the rah66 comanche is next generation rmed reconnaissance helicopter it is the first helicopter designed and developed specifically for this mission the comanche is being designed to stealthily penetrate enemy airspace and conduct reconnaissance it is to incorporate advanced computers and communications to play leading role in the digital network centric battlespace w ith enough weaponry to engage wide range of targets some call the comanche the worlds most sophisticated combat helicopter with more lines of software code than even the fa22 raptor2the comanches primary roles would be to seek out enemy forces and designate targets for the ah64 apache attack helicopter at night in adverse weather and in battlefields obscured by smoke and dust originally the army envisioned devel oping and procuring 5023 comanches to replace the armys 1960sera observation u tility transport and attack helicopters oh6 oh58 uh1 ah1 budget constraints and force structure modifications caused significant modifications to the comanche program first the utility transport version of the platform was canceled and the procu rement objective reduced to 1292

prototype going from three to two fourth in 1995 th army restructured the program to add 6 experimental operational capability helic opters within the reduced budget limits in part by producing them without the armaments suite in april 2000 the comanche program successfully completed series of tests and was cleared to begin its twoyear 31 billion engineering and manufacturing development phase3 boeingsikorsyhas built and flown two comanche prototypes the first preproduction model and the third comanche is being built and is expected to be flown first in march 20054the last plan was for five preproduction aircraft to be built in this phase and eight production aircraft were due for delivery by 2004 for initial operational testing and evaluation total of 14 initial operational capability rah66s was planned for delivery at the end of 20065and 1213 comanches were to have been produced through 2024 on october 21 2002 it was nnounced that former dod acquisition chief pete aldridge had signe d an acquisition decision memorandum adm giving final approval for the latest restruc turing of the rah66 program under this new plan the total purchase of comanches w ould be reduced from 1213 to 650 aircraft seventy three aircraft will be produced dur ing low rate initial production lrip in different blocks nine emd aircraft which will most likely be used as trainers will be built and delivered by 2006 the comanches initial operating capability ioc will be achieved in september 2009 three years later than originally planned and nine months after the most recent plan the remaining 577 aircraft will be produced under full rate production schedule of 60 aircraft per year starting in 2011 the army had wanted to boost the production rate to 96 aircraft per year as part of an effort to cut costs6 this restructuring reduces the coman ches production phase from 393 billion to an estimated 269 billion dod has agreed to add 37 billion to the helicopters 32 billion fullscale development program rmy officials estimate that the cost of each comanche adjusted for inflation will increase by 33 percent to 323 million7 much of the programs problems have been due to the amount of systems that have been developed concurrently for exampl the radar armor and navigation and communication systems were all being developed at the same time8the latest restructuring will reduce this

that about 644 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2009 will be spent on the comanches uav instead of the platform itself10the army has experimented with teaming uavs and both apache and comanche for several years including work with the rq5a hunter 11it is currently unclear whether the comanches compan ion will be an operational uav one currently in development or one devel oped specifically for the job if there are further changes comanch prime contractors boeing and sikorsky would build helicopters through 201912however the final word on comanche numbers has not been spoken some note that wh ile dod originally planned to procure approximately 1100 h60 he licopters over 2500 have b een procured to date13army officials claim that 650 aircraft are too fe w and that they require 819

improving the program however the ig cautioned that continued emphasis is required to ensure that integration problems d not emerge in the future that could result in increased cost and schedule15 the debate over mission and capabilities the rah66 comanche is designed to replace the aging ah1 and oh58d helicopters and to augment the ah64 apache attack helicopter critics of the comanche program argue that there is need for high ly sophisticated very low observable armed reconnaissance helicopt er in todays threat environment they contend that comancheshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20522crs4 16the

alternatives analysis show rah66 contributions inside the army january 24 2000 18claims of improved maintenance requirements are based on projections of advanced processes and technologies which wont be proven until the aircraft is fielded in general more technologically sophisticated weapon systems are more difficult to maintain than less sophisticated weapon systems 19crs report 96525 army aviation rah66 comanche p 3 4 20winograd opcit initial results of alternatives analysis show rah66 contributionscapabilities and mission requirements were d eveloped in response to cold war threat environment that longer exists critics also argue that the comanches role and capabilities are too similar to the apaches to justify the costs of the helicopters development and production they would cancel the rah66 and use the savings to upgrade the oh58 aircraft and the ah64d apaches longbow16target acquisition capabilities others say that comanches reduced radar signature will do little to make it more survivable than current helicopters th ey note that in iraq army and marine corps helicopters were shot down or damaged byirgui ded missiles rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire none of which use radars for targeting proponents of the rah66 agree that the cold war threat has disappeared but counter that todays lowintensity regiona l conflicts such as kosovo and somalia place even greater burdens on army aviation us fo rces must be more deployable less reliant on forward bases and more versatile than they were during the cold war supporters argue that comanche satisfies all three cr iteria furthermore proponents argue that comanche makes the whole force more effec tive and will reduce the armys maintenance burden this perspective proponents argue is supported by initial results from an army analysis of alternatives this study compared attack and air cavalry squadrons equipped with ah64d longbows and oh58d kiowa warriors to units composed of apaches and comanches the force equipped w ith comanches repor tedly demonstrated better situational awareness survivability and lethality than the other force the comanche provided better sensing lethality range agility survivability and versatility than the kiowa units comanche also improved the effectiveness of the longbow when the two aircraft were mixed in attack units the rah66s stealth improved apache longbows survivabilitywhen cooperative tac tics techniques and procedures were used17 claims of reduced maintena nce burdens for the comanche however are more controversial than are claims of its effectiveness18 projected ratios of maintenance man hours to flight hours have varied over time the army hopes to achieve ratio of 26 hours of maintenance to every one hour of flig ht however both the general accounting office and congressional budget office assert that projected reductions in maintenance are always optimistic19additionally some studies conclude that the comanche is more expensive to fly than the kiowa warrior 2042hour vs 1598hour but less expensive than the ah64d which can cost as much as 3622hour to fly20 the comanches role visavis the apach is continued point of debate the most recent reduction in the comanche program has increased the prominence of the ah64httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20522crs5 21burger opcit ausa army eyes apache to fill comanche gap 22winograd opcit army

apache such as lifeextension program or upgrades another option may be to procure more longbow models21some suggest that the dab decision reaffirms the apaches place as the armys attack aircraft and stion whether comanche should pursue features such as the external fuel armame nts and munitions system or an airtoair missile capability22 another issue is whether the army will upgrade comanche for heavy attack requirements in november 2001 army offi cials said they were planning on heavy variant of the rah66 as replacement for the ah64d as part of army transformation plan army officials said that the comanche could perform the attack as well as the armed reconnaissance mission in the future23it is unclear whether the rah66 could maintain its stealthyprofile while carrying external w eapons however and some questions whether comanche which currently suffers from weight problems has the power and fuel capacity to take on even more weight24the marine corps is expected to seek replacement for its ah1z super cobra helicopters around 2020 and it has been suggested that joint program with the army is worth investigating25 congressional action congress strongly supported the comanche program by consistently meeting or exceeding dods budget requests for funding in its report on dods fy1996 budget request the house armed services committee reproached both the army and the

the following lines of inquiry comanche is the armys onlymajor avia tion development program the comanche operational requirements document des cribes the rah66s contribution to future army warfighting missions it states that aviation capabilities add increased deployability versatility lethality flexibility mobility extended coverage and sustainment to maneuver fire support ai r defenseand other mission areas if the comanche buy is reduced what effect will this have on longterm capabilities how much does comanche contribute to com bat power visavis the light armored vehicles that the also army wants 68 billion has been spent on the comanche through fy0327will purchase of 650 helicopters be sufficient ret urn on this rd investment some say that in recent conflicts fixed wing aircraft have played more prominent role than army attack helicopters migh t improved versions of the ac130 and 10 or the stovl variant of the joint strik fighter be more effective providers of close air support to army ground forces than the rah66 the need for comanche has been challenged on the basis that its capabilities do not differentiate it sufficiently from apache to merit its development however turning this argument around some would assert th at the comanche is wellsuited to be the apaches replacement as the armys premier attack helicopter and the armys best platform for future growth and developmen t in this area subsequently one could anticipate helicopter force structure composed solely of heavy lift ch47 battlefield utility uh60 and scoutattack rah66 aircraft what are the merits of this force structure consideration of export issues is part and parcel of any military program how much might comanche exports contribute to taining the aviation industrial base and balancing us trade as new platform and one less overtly designed for attack than the apache might the comanche be offered for export to larger number of countries than the ah64 conversely due to its low observable features might comanche exports need to be limited to our closest allies
