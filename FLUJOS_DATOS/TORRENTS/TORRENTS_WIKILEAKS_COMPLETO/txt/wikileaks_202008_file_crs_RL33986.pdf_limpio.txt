the food and drug administration fda to offer financial and regulatory incentives to test their products for use in children through the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 fdaaa pl 11085 congress extended both the best pharmaceuticals for children act bpca and the pediatric research equity act prea for five years about 75 of drugs have not had pediatric studies the laws address concerns that clinicians must often prescribe drugs for children that fda has approved only for adult use clinicians often take that step believing that the safety and effectiveness demonstrated with adults would hold for younger patients but studies show that drugs vary in bioavailability in children which depends on the maturation and development of organs and other factors therefore this offlabel prescribing results in some childrens receiving ineffective drugs or too much or too little of potentially useful drug it may also result in side effects unique to children or children of specific ages including effects on growth and development the market has not been able to overcome the economic ethical legal and mechanical obstacles that make manufacturers reluctant to conduct these tests the reauthorized bpca and prea represent ongoing involvement of congress nd fda to address this need fda had tried unsuccessfully to spur pediatric drug research through administrative action before 1997 with the fda modernization act of 1997 fdama pl 105115 congress provided an incentive in exchange for manufacturers completion of pediatric studies according to an fda written request fda would extend its market exclusivit for that product for six months bpca pl 107109 gave this program fiveyear reauthorization in 2002 to get pediatric use information on the drugs that manufacturers were not studying in 1998 fda published the pediatric rule requiring that manufacturers submit pediatric testing data at the time of all new drug applications in 2002 federal court declared the rule invalid holding that fda lacked the statutory authority to promulgate it congress gave fda that au thority with prea pl 108155 prea covers drugs and biological products and includes provisions for deferrals waivers and the required pediatric assessment of an approved marketed product some of the issues the 110 th congress considered remain of concern why offer financial incentive to encourage pediatric studies when fda has the authority to require them how does the cost of marketing exclusivityincluding the higher prices paid by governmentcompare with the cost of the needed

drug administration fda has approved for adult use many drugs never tested in children yet clinicians often prescribe them for children believing that the safety and effectiveness demonstrated with adults probably reasonably transfers to younger patients the data show that this is not always true to encourage industry to develop drugs and medical devices for pediatric use congress has established three programs the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007 fdaaa pl 110851 reauthorized and strengthened two laws addressing drugsthe best pharmaceuticals for children act bpca of 2002 and the pediatric research equity act prea of 2003 and enacted new law addressing devicesthe pediatric medical device safety and improvement act pmdsia of 2007 the historical approach of this report allows an understanding of how and why congress took these steps specifically it describes why research on drugs pharmacokinetics safety and effectiveness in children is necessary presents why the marketplace has not provided sufficient incentive to manufacturers of drugs approved for adult use analyzes how bpca and prea evolve d from fdas administrative earlier efforts describes how fdaaa amended bpca and prea analyzes the impact bpca and prea have had on pediatric drug research and discusses issues some of which congre ss considered leading up to fdaaa that may form the basis of oversight and evaluative activities other crs reports address how fda handles simila r issues relating to pediatric use of medical devices2

food drug and cosmetic act ffdca allows manufacturer to promote or adve rtise drug only for uses listed in the fda approved labelingand the labeling may list only those claims for which fda has reviewed and accepted safety and effectiveness evidence however the ffdca does not give fda authority to regulate the practice of medicine that responsibility rests with the states and medical professional associations once fda approves drug therefore licensed physician mayexcept in highly regulated circumstancesprescribe it without restriction when clinician prescribes it to an individual whose demographic or medical characteristics differ from those indicated in drugs fdaapproved labeling that is called off label use which is considered accepted medical practice most of the prescriptions that physicians write for children fall into the category of offlabel use fda has evaluated the drugs safety and effectiveness when used to treat adults but has not seen data relating to their use in childrenand thus the labeling does not address indications dosage or warnings related to use in children faced with an ill child clinician must deduceinferguess whether the drug might help the doctor must also decide what dose and how often all to best balance the drugs intended effect with its anticipated and unanticipated side effects such clinicians face an obstacle children are not miniature adults 4 at different ages body may handle given amount of an administered drug differently resulting in varying bioavailability this occurs in part because the rate at which the body eliminates drug after which the drug is longer available varies among other things on changes in the maturation and development of organs clearance can be quicker or slower in children depending on the age of child the organs involved and body surface area 5 without complete information on which to make these decisions clinicians sometimes err such errors as outlined by the director of fdas office of pediatric therapeutics include unnecessary exposure to ineffective drugs ineffective dosing of an effective drug overdosing of an effective drug undefined unique pediatric adverse events and

individual drugs pediatric indications is generally small providing an economic disincentive for manufacturers to commit resources to pediatric testing because young children cannot swallow tablets the manufacturer might have mechanical hurdle in developing different formulation such as liquid the ethical and legal difficulties encountered in recruiting adult participants in clinical trials are even greater when seeking children many parents do not want their children in experiments also liability concerns include not only injury but difficulttocalculate lifetime compensation congress has offered incentives to manufacturers for pediatric research for two main reasons first it is clear that in treating sick children doctors will continue prescribing drugs despite insufficient pediatricuse studies second congress has generally believed that despite the difficulty in conducting such studies children could be better served once the research was done

if for example clinicians would use the drug to treat differen t condition in children than its fdaapproved use in adults fda would require trials in children however if the drug would be used in children for the same condition for which fda had approved its use in adults the labeling statement regarding effectiveness could be based on adult trials alone in such instances fda might also require pediatric studybased data on pharmacokinetics or relevant safety measures the 1994 rule continued the 1979 requirement that manufacturers include statements regarding uses for which there was

proposed regulation that came to be called the pediatric rule10 the pediatric rule mandated that manufacturers submit pediatric testing data at the time of all new drug applications to fda note this concept is the basis of the pediatric research equity act discussed in the next section of this report the rule went into effect in 1999 prompting lawsuit again fda by the competitive enterprise institut and the association of american physicians and surgeons the plaintiffs claimed that the agency was acting outside its authority in considering offlabel uses of approved drugs in october 2002 federal court declared the pediatric rule invalid noting that its finding related not to the rules policy value but to fdas statutory authority in promulgating it the pediatric rule may well be better policy t ool than the one enacted by congress which encourages testing for pediatric use but does not require it it might reflect the most thoughtful reasoned balanced solution to vexing public health problem the issue here is not the rules wisdom the issue is the rules statutory authority and it is this that the court finds wanting 11

new indication new dosage form new dosing regimen or new route of administration congress mandated that the submission be adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and that it support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective if the disease course and drug effects were sufficiently similar for adults and children the hhs secretary could allow extrapolation from adult study data as evidence of pediatric effectiveness usually supplemented with other data from children such as pharmacokinetic studies the law specified situations in which the secretary might defer or waive the pediatric assessment requirement such as when the secretary believes doctors already know that drug should never be used by children in those cases it directed that the products labeling include any waiver based on evidence that pediatric use would be unsafe or ineffective g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g156g561g152g151g561g157g145g142g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g561 when not having pediatric use information on the label could pose significant risks the secretary could now require the manufacturer 13 of an approved drug or licensed biologic to submit pediatric assessment such situations could arise when the secretary found that marketed product was used by pediatric patients for indications labeled for adults or that the product might provide children meaningful therapeutic benefit over the available alternatives before requiring the assessment the secretary had to issue written request under ffdca section 505a bpca pediatric exclusivity or phsa section 409i nih funding mechanisms further the manufacturer must not have agreed to conduct the assessment and the secretary had to have stated that the nih funding programs either di d or did not have enough funds to conduct that study if the manufacturer did not comply with the secretarys request the secretary could consider the product misbranded because congress wanted to protect adult access to product under these circumstances the law set limits on fdas enforcement options

during the period when congress was considering reauthorizing the fdama exclusivity provisions in proposed bpca one legal analyst wrote in 2003 if congress had codified the fdas power to require testing in all new and already marketed drugs the notion of an incentive or reward for testing would appear ludicrous22 in fact congress did exactly that provided an incentive for something that is already requirement during the debate on prea in 2003 members of the senate clearly had questions about this contradiction23 while senator gregg as committee chair wrote the pediatric rule was intended to work as safety net to or as backstop to pediatric exclusivity senator clinton and others wrote in the re ports additional views section neither the intent conveyed by fda nor fdas implementation of the pediatric rule supports the reports contention that the rule was intended to work as backstop to pediatric exclusivity or to be employed only to fill the gaps in coverage left by the exclusivity three years later in its draft guidance on how to comply with the pediatric research equity act fda wrote that the pediatric rule was designed to work in conjunction with the 22 lauren

the bpca and prea reauthorizations in 2007 did not change their relationship the contradiction remained continued by fdaaa 2007 and is now law at some point congress may want to resolve this apparent paradox g5g152g156g157g561 in assessing the value of bpca and prea it may be useful to identify the intended and unintended effectsboth positive and negativeof their implementation let us say fda grants manufacturer sixmonth exclusivity who benefits the manufacturer the manufacturer holding pediatric exclusivity incurs the research and development expenses related to the fdarequested pediatric studies it then enjoys six months of sales without competitor product and potentially lucrative head start on future sales other manufacturers the manufacturers that do not hold the exclusivity must wait six months during which they cannot launch competing products after that however they may be able to market generic versions of drug that has been assessed for pediatric use and has had six months experience in the publics awareness government nonfinancial benefits to government include its progress in protecting childrens health costs to the government include administrative and regulatory expenses because the government also pays for drugs both directly and indirectly it must pay the higher price that exclusivity allows for six months the better pediatric information however may yield future financial savings by avoiding ineffective and unsafe uses private insurers private payers also face similar financial costs and benefits as public payers without the regulatory costs of administering the program children and their families some children may incur risks as study subjects they and others might benefit from more appropriate use of drugs including accurate dosing although assigning quantitative values to those effects is generally beyond the scope of this report some researchers have examined the financial costs and benefits faced by manufacturers that receive pediatric exclusivity one study appeared in february 2007 written by team led by jennifer li of duke universitys department of pediatrics with coauthors from its department of economics and the duke clinical research institute as well as from the office of the commissioner at fda 24 it calculated the net economic benefit costs minus benefits after much estimating and adjusting for other factors to manufacturer that in 20022004 responded to an fda request for pediatric studies and received pediatric exclusivity the median net economic benefit of sixmonth exclusivity was 1343 million the study found large range from net loss to net benefit of over half billion dollars 24 jennifer s li eric l eisenstein henry g grabowski et economic return of clinical trials performed under the pediatric

sixmonth exclusivity the senate bill would have limited the period of exclusivity for drug to three months if its manufacturersponsor had more than 1 billion in annual gross us sales for all its products with the same active ingredient in future years congress might reexamine whether such limits may be in the public interest g14g138g139g142g149g146g151g144g561 pediatric studies can produce valuable information about safety effectiveness dosing or side effects when child takes medication such information benefits children only when it reaches clinicians and others who care for children including parents bpca 2002 prea 2003 and their 2007 reauthorizations therefore included labeling provisions to make the information available as result fda now requires by law or regulation pediatric usage labeling in the following circumstances manufacturer has successfully applied via an original new drug application nda or supplement for approval to list pediatric indication manufacturer has received pediatric exclusivity after conducting appropriate studies or manufacturer has submitted the safety and effectiveness findings from pediatric assessments required under prea in the first case the labeling includes pediatric use information only if fda approved the pediatric indication if fda turned down or the manufacturer withdrew request for pediatric indication pediatric use information appears nowhere in the products labeling in addition the fact that the manufacturer had made an unsuccessful attemptand the research findings that blocked approvalwould be neither noted in the label nor made public in other ways when it comes to exclusivity the labeling rules are different if the studies required for exclusivity support pediatric use or specific limits to pediatric use different dosing or subgroups that information would go in the labeling the labeling would also make clear if the studies did not find the drug to be effective in children or if fda waived the requirement to study because children should not or would not be given the drug the rules have created measurable change still not all drugs used by children have labeling that addresses pediatric use as previously noted fda approved more than 500 new drug and biologics license applications from the beginning of 2003 through september 2008 25 yet the prea statistics on labeling note 88 labeling changes over that period the prea and bpca reauthorizations in 2007 added the third circumstance of required pediatric labeling upon determining that pediatric assessment or study does or does not demonstrate that the subject drug is safe and effective in pediatric populations or subpopulations the secretary must order the label to include information about those results and statement of the secretarys determination that is true even if the study results were inconclusive 25 for more information see httpwwwfdagovcderrdmtndaapps9306htm

while an improvement over mention at all statement such as effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established still deprives clinician of information that is available the statement does not distinguish among studies in children found the drug to be ineffective studies in children found the drug to be unsafe studies in children were not conclusive regarding safety or effectiveness or studies had been conducted concerning pediatric use if studies suggest that safety effectiveness or dosage reactions vary by age condition to be treated or patient circumstances then detailed information could be included in the labeling bpca 2007 also strengthened the effect of labeling requirements by mandating the dissemination of certain safety and effectiveness information to health care providers and the public although not included in the pediatric secti ons another provision in fdaaa 2007 may yield benefits for pediatric labeling regarding television and radio directtoconsumer dtc drug advertisements the law required that major statements relating to side effects and contraindications be presented in clear conspicuous and neutral manner it further required that the secretary establish standards for determining whether major statement meets those criteria the fruits of such inquiry could be applied throughout agency communication finally bpca 2003 had required hhs to promulga rule within one year of enactment regarding the placement on all drug labels of tollfree telephone number with which to report adverse events fda issued proposed rule in 2004 but has not yet finalized it bpca 2007 required that the 2004 proposed rule take effect on january 1 2008 unless the commissioner issued the final rule before then it limited the rules application to exclude certain drugs whose packaging already includes tollfree number for consumers to report complaints to their manufacturers or distributors 26 g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561 fdas postmarket authority regarding pediatric drug use labeling has been limited congress had given fda the authority to use its sledgehammerdeeming product to be misbranded and thereby gaining the authority to pull it from the marketbut has not given the agency authority to require less drastic actions such as labeling changes to pull from the market drug on which many consumers rely would be according to some healthcare analysts akin to throwing out the baby with the bathwater in its report accompanying its prea 2003 bill the senate committee noted its intent that the misbranding authority regarding pediatric use labeling not be the basis for crimin proceedings or withdrawal of approval and 26 fda issued the final rule on october 28 2008 its effective date is november 28 2008

2007 reauthorization continues this approach again outside its pediatricspecific sections fdaaa created new enforcement authority for fda civil monetary penalties framed in the context of giving fda tools to create meaningful incentives for manufacturer compliance with range of postmarket safety activities the provision listed labeling within its scope in senate and house committee discussions of what maximum penalties to allow proposed onetime penalties were as low as 15000 and proposed upper levels ranged to 50 million the final provision says that an applicant violating certain requirements regarding postmarket safety studies or clinical trials or labeling is subject to civil monetary penalty of not more than 250000 per violation and not to exceed 1 million for all such violations adjudicated in single proceeding if violation continues after the secretary provides notice of such violation to the applicant the secretary may impose civil penalty of 250000 for the first 30 days doubling for every subsequent 30day period up to 1 million for one 30day period and up to 10 million for all such violations adjudicated in single proceeding the secretary must in determining the amount of civil penalty consider whether the sponsor is making efforts toward correcting the violation what options should fda have if manufacturer that has already received the sixmonth pediatric exclusivity then refuses or delays making an appropriate labeling change for studies that result in labeling changes when should fda make study results available to the public in considering whether to strengthen fda s enforcement authority within the context of pediatric research and labeling congress can address manufacturers actions at many points in the regulatory process if and when for example fda notes manufacturers reluctance to accept the agencys requested study scope design and timetable that studys completion is clearly lagging or overdue that manufacturer does not co mplete such study or does not release its results to fda peerreviewed publications or the public or that procedures to incorporate pediatric study results into drugs labeling have not proceeded appropriately there are actions as well for the secretary bcpa 2007 expanded the secretarys authority and in some cases requires action the secretary must publish within 30 days of the secretarys determination regarding market exclusivity and must include copy of the written request that specified what studies were necessary the secretary must also publicly identify any drug with developed pediatric formulation that studies have demonstrated to be safe and effective for children if its sponsor has not introduced the pediatric formulation onto the market within one year g21g158g151g156g142g157g561

manufacturers has not engendered congressional debate during prea consideration in 2003 however some members had objected unsuccessfully to linking preas safety and effectiveness assessment and resulting pediatric labeling to the bpca sunset by the committee markups of prea in 2007 some members advocated making the mandatory pediatric assessments permanent if congress intended the prea sunset to trigger regular evaluation of the laws usefulness there may be other legislative approaches that would more directly achieve that if however the intent was to test the idea of requiring pediatric assessments the past five years had provided satisfactory evidence 29 the housepassed bill would have eliminated preas link to the bpca sunset provision the senatepassed bill continued it the enacted bill included the linkage written in the 2003 legislation at some point congress may wish to evaluate the usefulness and effect of that link

carrots of financial incentive and sticks of required action it has also required that drug labeling reflect the findings of pediatric research whether positive negative or inconclusive and most recently it has given fda broader authority to follow up and enforce these requirements with each step of legislative and regulatory action over the years congress and fda have tried to balance goals that often conflict drug development to address needs unique to children tools to encourage drug manufacturers to do this despite the expense opportunity costs and liability risk public access to uptodate and unbiased information on drug safety and effectiveness pharmaceutical industry needs and adequate funding concerns remain though about many of the issues discussed during last years reauthorizationsand in the last section of this paper against the backdrop of this falls financial crisis and the uncertainty about how that will affect the priorities of new president and congress it is hard to predict whether the 111 th congress will wish to address them they may surface only when reauthorizations are due in 2012 but the likely legislative debate over health care reform offers congress opportunities to further ensure safe and effective drugs for children some proposed reform elements such as 29 see senator clintons comments at the senate committee on health education labor
