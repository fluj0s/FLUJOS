resolution nevertheless some analysts drawing on the history of oil and natural gas pipeline development anticipate potential need for better deﬁned federal legislativeregulatory authority over an interstate co2 pipeline network accordingly congress may be called upon to consider whether existing federal jurisdictional disclaimers and the statebystate regulatory structure for enhanced oil recovery eor pipelines is an appropriate regulatory scheme for possible interstate co2 pipeline network in support of ccs congress could opt to amend existing statutes possibly those related to the interstate pipeline jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the surface transportation board stb to provide for deﬁnitive co2 pipeline rate jurisdiction by the federal

concerning jurisdiction over the siting of these pipelines and the prices they may charge for their transportation services while jurisdiction over co 2 pipeline safety resides with the office of pipeline safety branch of th department of transportation jurisdiction over hypothetical interstate co 2 pipeline siting and rate decisions is not clear jurisdiction could fall to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or to the surface transportation board stb however both agencies have at some point expressed position that interstate co 2 pipelines are not within their purview this report reviews the history of pipeline regulation including the limited history of interstate co 2 pipeline regulation and examines the regulatory missions of ferc the stb and other agencies the report discusses possible responses to preceived jurisdictional uncertainties under existing law as well as potential legislative steps intended to address any potential regulatory gap in interstate co 2 pipeline jurisdiction g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561g138g151g141g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the transportation of co 2 via pipeline is not hypothetical concept nor even recent development for many years companies have moved co 2 from one location to another for enhanced oil recovery eora process which extends oil production from mature oil fields there are several eor methods but gas injection dominated by co 2 injection accounts for nearly 50 of eor production in the united states1 during this process co 2 is injected underground at an oil field forcing more oil from the reservoir to the extraction wells ultimately increasing the amount of oil that can be recovered from given field approximately 5800 kilometers 3600 miles of co 2 pipeline operate today in the united states2 the oldest longdistance co 2 pipeline in the united states constructed for eor is the 225 kilometer canyon reef carriers pipeline in texas which began service in 19723 other large 1 us

states have expanded the co 2 pipeline network for eor these pipelines carry co 2 from naturally occurring underground reservoirs natural gas processing facilities ammonia manufacturing plants and large coal gasification project to regional oil fields additional pipelines may carry co 2 from other manmade sources to supply range of industrial applications however with one notable exception discussed below federal regulation of siting and rates for these pipelines has not been addressed due in large part to the fact that many of them are intrastate and that they often transport co 2 for the benefit of the pipelines owners so there are rate or service disputes g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g5g138g155g139g152g151g561g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g162g561 in recent years the public the press and government officials have shown increasing concern about global climate change many have suggested that recent increases in the global temperature as well as future anticipated increases are the result at least in part of emissions of large quantities of co 2 from manmade sources one of the more prominent ideas to limit co 2 emissions especially co 2 emissions from power plants is carbon capture and direct sequestration ccs ccs is process whereby co 2 emissions are captured at their source and then stored sequestered either underground or elsewhere rather than being released into the atmosphere4 ccs science and associated technology are still in the early stages of development among many questions yet to be answered is whether we may ultimately see large number of sequestration sites located geographically close to co 2 source facilities or smaller number of more centralized or more distant sequestration locations5 if widespread ccs network does develop whether that network features decentralized or centralized storage configurations remains to be seen however pipeline requirements and storage configurations are necessarily related if sequestration is widely used and relatively centralized significant interstate pipeline network would likely be required to transport the co 2 to the sequestration sites

than the current pipeline network for eor is to be developed questions aris as to who will regulate pipeline siting and the rates to be charged for the transportation of co 2 based on their current regulatory roles two of the more likely candidates for jurisdiction over interstate pipelines transporting co 2 for purposes of ccs are the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the surface transportation board stb the natural gas act of 1938 nga vests in ferc the authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities 6 ferc is also charged with extensive regulatory authority over the siting of natural gas 4 for detailed discussion of ccs see crs report rl33801 carbon capture and

of natural gas and other elements of transportation service ferc also has jurisdiction over regulation of oil pipelines pursuant to the interstate commerce act ica7 the ica as amended by the hepburn act of 1905 provided that the interstate commerce commission icc was to have jurisdiction over rates and certain other activities of interstate oil pipelines as these pipelines were considered to be common carriers8 this jurisdiction was transferred to ferc in the department of energy organization act of 19779 fercs jurisdiction over oil pipelines is not as extensive as its jurisdiction over natural gas pipelines ferc is not involved in the oil pipeline siting process however as with natural gas ferc does regulate transportation rates and capacity allocation for oil pipelines10 ferc is assigned jurisdiction over natural gas and oil pipelines explicitly in statutory language jurisdiction over rate regulation for other types of pipelines resides with the stb the stb is an independent regulatory agency administratively affiliated with the department of transportation charged by congress with the primary mission of resolving railroad disputes pursuant to the ica it is the successor agency to the icc pipelines like railroads are common carriers used by more than one company for the transportation of goods therefore the ica also assigned the icc and thus the stb oversight au thority over pipelines transporting commodity other than water gas or oil 11 it should be noted however that unlike ferc the stb does not require pipeline companies to file tariffs and justify their rates instead the stb acts as forum for resolution of disputes related to pipelines within its jurisdiction parties who wish to challenge rate or another aspect of pipelines common carrier service may petition the stb for hearing there is ongoing regulatory oversight thus there are two federal regulatory agencies that generally speaking have jurisdiction over interstate pipeline rate and capacity allocation matters however as explained below both of these agencies appear to have explicitly rejected jurisdiction over co 2 siting and rates and there is legislative or judicial history indicating that their rejections were improper these decisions the reasoning behind them and the status of federal jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines are covered in the next section g18g155g146g152g155g561g5g17

commissions jurisdiction cortez argued that the gas in question was not natural gas as the term is defined in section 25 of the nga12 so proposed pipeline to transport this gas was not under fercs nga jurisdiction ferc agreed with cortez and issued declaratory order disclaiming jurisdiction over the proposed pipeline13 in its decision ferc explored the inherent ambiguity in the term natural gas explaining that it has two very different definitions ferc recognized that in the terminology of chemistry natural gas refers to any substance that is gaseous in its natural state including carbon dioxide 14 however according to ferc the more common usage of the term natural gas refers to gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons15 ferc held that it was this meaning of natural gas that applied to the term as it was used in the nga ferc pointed to the goals and purposes of the nga which are primarily to regulate specific natural gas industry16 thus the term natural gas as used in the statute referred to gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons17 as result ferc held that the proposed cortez pipeline was not within the nga jurisdiction of the commission18 g11g5g5g561g6g142g140g146g156g146g152g151g561 in 1980 after ferc issued its co 2 ruling the owners of the proposed cortez pipeline went to the icc to seek similar declaratory order that the pipeline would not be subject to the iccs jurisdiction either as the icc recognized at the outset of its decision there was controversy concerning whether icc approval was necessary for construction or expansion of pipeline facilitiesthe statute and previous case law plai nly state that the icc has pipeline siting jurisdiction whatsoever 19 furthermore the icc noted that th us department of transportation would exercise jurisdiction over the pipelines compliance with applicable safety standards20 instead the decision focused solely upon the iccs regulation of other aspects of pipeline service ie rates and whether co 2 pipelines are covered by the statutory exception from icc regulation for pipelines that transport water gas or oil21 relying on the legislative history of previous versions of the statutory language in the ica which excluded natural or artificial gas as well as the plain language of the current statute the icc concluded that congress intended to exclude all types of gas including co 2 from icc regulation the icc recognized that its initial ruling in this matter in concert with fercs order disavowing jurisdiction over the proposed cortez pipeline created regulatory gap of sorts the icc noted that generally the opinion of sister agency should be given weight if possible so that related statutes can be coordinated 22 however the icc found that in this

interpret the terms natural and artificial gas under the ica its decision was based on other grounds23 although the icc found in this initial decision that it likely did not have jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines it did conclude that the issue is important enough to institute proceeding and accept comments on the petition and our view on it24 after the comment period the icc confirmed its view that co 2 pipelines were excluded from the iccs jurisdiction25

1980 disclaimer of jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines in the cortez pipeline case other evidence indirectly suggests the possibility that interstate co 2 pipelines could still be considered subject to the jurisdiction of the stb for example an april 1998 report by the general accounting office gao26 stated that interstate co 2 pipelines as well as pipelines transporting other gases are subject to the boards oversight authority the report stated that gao had identified five products carried by 21 pipelines subject to the stbs jurisdiction 27 one of the five identified products was co 2 another was hydrogenalso gas in fact the report lists 14 different pipelines transporting co 2 for purposes of eor including the cortez pipeline which are said to be subject to the jurisdiction of the stb28 the gao states that the stb reviewed its analysis and presumably did not object to this jurisdictional classification29 it should also be noted that the cortez pipeline decision was issued by the icc not the stb although the stb is the successor to the nowdefunct icc and the statutory language regarding the stbs jurisdiction is virtually identical to the language at issue in the cortez decision they are not the same agency the stb conceivably could determine that its jurisdiction is not governed by the iccs decision in the cortez pipeline matter indeed the supreme court has ruled that federal agencies are not precluded from changing their positions on the issue of regulatory jurisdiction according to the court an initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone on the contrary the agency to engage in informed rulemaking must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on continuing basis 30 accordingly regulation of co 2 pipelines for ccs purposes by the stb or by ferc for that matter under existing statutes remains possibility 23 id at 85178 24 id 25 cortez pipeline companypetition for declaratory ordercommission jurisdiction over

regulation by the surface transportation board april 1998 28 id at 27 29 surface transportation board stb personal communication december 2007 the stb office of governmental and public affairs informed crs that the board recognizes the conflict between this gao report and the icc decision as well as the wording of 49 cfr 15301 governing stb jurisdiction over pipelines other than those transporting water gas or oil however the office did not want to state an opinion as to the current extent of stb jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines and suggested that the stb would likely not act to resolve this conflict unless co 2 pipeline dispute comes before it 30 chevron usa v nat res def council 467 us 837 at 86364 1984

disclaim jurisdiction over co 2 pipelines then the potential regulatory gap discussed above may receive attention this gap does not necessarily demand resolution as commenters have noted state laws and contractual arrangements among interested parties established under the eor model would also apply to co 2 pipelines for ccs31 interstate co 2 pipelines would still be required to meet the safety requirements of the department of transportation also although there would be federal rate regulation any anticompetitive behavior by the owners or operators of co 2 pipeline could be addressed by federal antitrust enforcement agencies including the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the us department of justice finally any pipelines needing to cross federal lands would be required to obtain rightofway from the federal government and so would be subject to any conditions such rightsofway might impose nevertheless some analysts drawing on the history of oil and natural gas pipeline development anticipate potential need for better defined federal regulatory authority over potential expansive co 2 pipeline network32 the growth of these sectors and the growing importance of transportation abuses of market power price discrimination and other issues including conflicts between state and federal authorities led both to preemption by the federal government and administrative regulation as the co 2 transport and storage sector grows similar issues of regulatory frameworks and the mix of federal and state jurisdiction are likel to have to be confronted as has been the case for all network industries in the united states the eventual economic regulatory development for ccs will need to consider the varying approaches taken for oil and natural gas and the serious problems th at their history experienced thus congress may ultimately be asked to consider whether the existing federal jurisdictional disclaimers and the statebystate regulatory st ructure for eor pipelines is an appropriate regulatory scheme for potential national co 2 pipeline network in support of ccs congress could choose to amend existing statutes to provide for definitive co 2 pipeline rate jurisdiction by the federal government if it does not favor the existing regulatory scheme ferc and the stb are two candidates for administration of such oversight alternatively congress could establish another federal regulator of co 2 pipelines or enact legislation addressing specific aspects of the existing regulatory structure for eor 31 see for example philip m marston doing the
