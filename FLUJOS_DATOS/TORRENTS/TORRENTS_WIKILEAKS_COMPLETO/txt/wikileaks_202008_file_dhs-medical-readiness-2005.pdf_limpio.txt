major terrorist attacks or natural di sasters but currently lacks clearlydefined and unified medical capability to support this mission additionally it lacks the capability to properly support dhs personnel operat ing in field units and hazardous conditions by providing little or medical pport therefore it is impera tive that an office of medical readiness becomes established within dhs so these medical readiness responsibilities are addressed in coordinated ffective and efficient manner review of existing dhs medical readiness responsibilities and capab ilities indicates realignment of assets personnel and fiscal resources is required prior to the establishment of dhs the depart ment of health and human services hhs was responsible for national medical and public health programs hhs responsibilities included preventive medicine health promotion and disast er medical response w ith the passage of the homeland security act 2002 and th establishment of dhs the dhs secretary was

capabilities strategy for realigning and strengthening the federal medical response system introduction prior to the events of september 11 2001 this nations medical preparedness and response efforts primarily focused on the medical and public health concerns and events of the daypreventing and eliminating childhood diseas improving the nutrition and health of minorities women and children fighting hiv aids and drugresistant tuberculosis and building national medical response system capab of providing emergency assistance in times of largescale natural disasters for the mo st part disease reporting was accomplished retrospectively to determine the focus and fundi ng of future medical and public health efforts rather than to identify potential new threats the department of health and human servic hhs is the federal agency primarily responsible for the nations health and wellness its services and expe rtise cover the spectrum from health and social science research dis ease prevention health promotion and assuring food and drug safety to providing targeted services fo r the aging native americans and other special populations number of healthcare focused ag encies reside under the hhs umbrella these include the national institutes of health nih the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the food and drug administration the indian health service the health research and services agency the substance abuse and mental health services administration the agency for healthcare research and quality and the u s public health service usphs with the exception of few medical response functions within nih and cdc hhs principal role remains that of health promotion and disease prev ention not the response to incidents of national significance in the current environment the potential for terrorist attack on the united states involving weapons of mass destruction wmd has dramatically increased consequently the need for the us private sector healthcare system and its 6000 hos pitals to prepare for an influx of casualties as the result of such an attack has also increased for most of the 20th century healthcare costs rose but did not ve significant impact on the rge capacity and capability of city county and regional hospita ls however with the closure of more than 500 hospitals and 1100 emergency departments in the past deca the national ability to respond to mass casualties resulting from largescale disasters has been substantially reduced during testimony before the subcommittee on oversight and inve stigations of the house committee on energy and commerce in october 2001 dr dennis olear md president of the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare or ganizations jcaho underscored the need for medical worker training community or statewide analyses of preparedness national funding policies and medicalpublic health surveillance system since 2002 the department of ho meland security has had the responsibility to prevent protect respond to and recover from major terrorist attacks or natu ral disasters but it currently lacks clear and unified medical capability to support this mission in september 2004 for official use only 1for official use only secretary tom ridge directed review of the medical response requirements and capabilities within the department this report summarizes the findings of that review and provides strategy for strengthening and realigning medical readiness ssets within dhs and improving coordination and collaboration with other federal partners methodology qualitative medical needs assessment was conducted within dhs between september 23 and november 9 2004 to identify current dhs medical response cap abilities and assets document the perceived effectiveness of those capabilities identify ga ps and concerns and develop medical readiness improve ment strategies preliminary interviews were conducted the resulting data were analyzed and an asse ssment instrument was created the assessment instrument consisted of eight openended topical discussion points intended to stimulate free flowing discussion thirtytwo management nd nonmanagement employees across all five dhs directorates management science and technology information analysis and infrastructure protection bord er and transportation security and emergency preparedness and response and included representatives from the us secret service the federal law enforcement training center citizenship and i mmigration services and the us coast guard were interviewed interviewees were provided the assessment objective and reassurance that their identity would remain confidential response data were recorded categorized by subject area and analyzed to ex tract significant findings findings and recommendations the dhs medical needs assessment confirmed what has been perceived by many internal and external observersthat the nations medical leadership works in isolation its medical response capability is fragmented and illprepared to deal with mass casualty event and that dhs lacks an adequate medical support capability for its field operating units major findings of the assessment are discussed in this section s ee appendices 46 for deta iled results of the medical needs assessment major paradigm shif t in dhs planning and operations is required to mount successful response to any incident of national significan ce especially those involving chemical biological radi ological nuclear and highene rgy explosives cbrne the medical response must be staffed trained and equipped to manage overwhelming numbers of casualties prevent subsequent morbidity and decrease mortality thorough preparation and efficient performance are necessary to maintain public order engender confidence in the government and foster rapid return to nati onal normalcy this will also require carefully designed coordinated and delivered medical ri sk communications additionally dhs must meet its requirements for force health protection to ensure the health and safety of its personnel therefore to ensure the secretary of dhs has the capability to meet the departments medical response requirements the following findi ngs and recommendati ons are provided dhs medical infrastructure 1 finding unclear and overlapping legislation delegating medi cal responsibility to one department and response assets to another has left significant gaps in the nations medical for official use only 2for official use only response capability see appendices 2 and 3 for dhs medical readin ess responsibilities delineated by the homeland security act of 2002 and hspds 5 8 9 and 10 respectively recommendation revise hspd10 and esf8 to br ing them into compliance with the homeland security act of 2002 2 finding dhs lacks centralized coordinate d medical organizati onal structure to coordinate disparate efforts within dhs serve as the central medical point of contact to coordinate with othe r federal state and local agencies provide singlecontact medical dvice to the secretary of dhs design coordinate and deliver compre hensive medical risk communications develop medical policy doctrine an d oversight mechanisms within dhs ensure dhs employees are protected while on deployments and in the workplace ensure that medical issues are addressed in critical planning policy development and decisionmaking processes recommendation appoint dhs assistant secretary for medical readine ss and establish dhs office of medical readine ss and provide the requisite st aff resources and clearly defined authorities and responsibilities reali gn key dhs medical respon assets under this new office as described below assistant secretary for medical readiness the office of medical readiness should be h eaded by an assistant secretary for medical readiness who reports directly to the secretary for homela nd security the assistant secretary should be the departments senior medical official who serves as principal advisor to the secretary on all matters pert aining to federal emer gency medical support operations and dhs force health protection the assistant secret ary should establish priorities for fund and ensure the mission readiness of the ndms office of medical readiness the proposed mission of the office of medical readiness should be to coordinate and deliver rapid federal emergency medical support to federal stat and local authorities in support of homeland security operations and mitigate operational hazards to the dhs work force through comprehensive force hea lth protection program s the office of medical readiness should be structured to provide the core archite cture for managing and coordinating the delivery of federal emerge ncy medical support the office should be organized into four functionall oriented divisions to execute its responsibilities the ndms contains the offices operational staff resources and capabilities to deliver federal emergency medical support services the offices other divisions contain the necessary support staff and resources that able the ndms to maintain readiness and execute the federal emergency medical suppor t mission functional representation of the proposed dhs office of medical readine ss is shown in figure 1 the draft concept of operations conops for the proposed dhs office of medical readiness is provided in appendix 6 and notional cost s are provided in appendix 7 for official use only 3for official use only medical intelligence division the medical intelligence division should be responsible for collecting evaluating and analyzing allsource information concerning the immedi ate readiness capabilities capacity and needs of the nations emerge ncy medical systems to improve federal emergency medical support policy planning and operations the division should be responsible for collaboration and liaison with state and local governments federal departments and agencies and national bi omedical surveillancedetection programs including the national biodefense analysis and countermeasures center nbacc the division should be responsible for generating timely and accurate medical intelligence products both at the strategic level to support the offices policy preparedness and readiness activities nd at the operational level to support decisionmaking for federal emergency medical support to incident management operations national disaster medical system the national disaster medical system shoul d be responsible for delivering federal emergency medical support services in the fi eld the ndms should be an assetsharing partnership designed to provide emergency medical assistance to state and local jurisdictions following terrorist attack majo r disaster or other emergencies within the united states the system should be designed to care for victims of any incident that exceeds the medical care capability and res ources of the effected state and local jurisdictions dhs should administer the program in partnership with other federal agencies such as hhs the department of defense and the department of veterans affairs the ndms should maintain capabilit ies to deploy on short notice and deliver support under eight mission areas 1 medi cal command and control 2 prehospital patient care 3 inpatient care 4 community outreach services 5 casualty transportation 6 medical logistics 7 veterinary services and 8 mass fatality the ndms should consist of both fulltime and pa rttime federal teams as well as volunteer teams located throughout the united states wi th staffing levels determined by mission requirements medical preparedness division the medical preparedness di vision should be responsible for coordinating medical preparedness efforts at the federal level and working with all state local tribal parish and private sector emergency response providers to improve allhazards emergency medical response to incidents of national sign ificance specific functions should include providing training to ndms emer gency response providers pr oviding grants to states and local jurisdictions providing handson tr aining through number of residential training facilities and inservice training at the local level working with state and local jurisdictions to plan and execute exercises and providing onsite t echnical assistance to state and local jurisdic tions part of the divisions responsibilities should include oversight and administration of the mmrs nd ndms transformation activities as well as directing the office of pr otective medicines casualty care research center and counter narcotics and terrorism program s contoms which are currently in immigrations and customs enforcement ice within the border and transportation security bts directorate for official use only 5for official use only mission support division the mission support division should be respons ible for providing th necessary support services for transporting c oordinating sustaining and maintaining an effective ndms specific functions should include medical l ogistics communications and information technology facilities and resource management and force health protection part of the divisions responsibilities for the provision of force health protection should involve oversight of the departments occupational h ealth and safety program and other mutual support of health and safety risk mana gement programs eg risk communication personnel medical screening and medical surv eillance respirator protection personal protective equipment deployed medical response 3 finding there is widespread concern within dhs that the nation lacks the ability to adequately respond to mass casualty events velop and sustain hea lthcare surge capacity and effectively manage quarantine situa tion the national disaster medical system ndms lacks the medical overs ight required to effectively develop prepare for employ and sustain deployable medical assets see appendix 6 for detailed information regarding ndms concerns ndms teams are predeploying to national security special events nsses and responding to incidents of national significance for which they are not fully prepared ndms teams have not been adapted to meet current requirements with new doctrine policies or basic organization these teams are inflexible in st ructure training is outdated and equipment is designed to suppor t natural disasters rather than broader range of response scenarios inc luding terrorist incidents ndms is currently assigned to the emergency preparedness and response epr directorate where there are few qualified medical personnel assigned to develop the requisite medical doctrine policies and procedures during the transition from hhs to dhs th number of ndms ma nagement personnel was reportedly reduced from 144 to 57 and that staffing does not include physician medical planner or logistician ndms is considered by many insiders to be woefully underfunded undermanned and too remote from dhs leadership to gain the visibility it needs recent deployments to florida following the 20 04 hurricanes confirmed critical shortfalls in doctrine training logistic s support and coordination wi th esf8 as well as other federal agencies recommendation transform ndms to provide the in itial federal medical response and sustain medical operations until transition to th recovery phase develop tiered approach to the federal medical response that includes fulltime medical teams uniformed reserve corps as well as volunteer teams to sa tisfy casualty requirements conduct thorough analysis and revision of dmat staffing levels and team composition to satisfy medical care needs dictated by current mission requirements this will require substantial resource investment for both personnel and materiel fulltime and uniformed reserve medical corps will need to be recruited and supported this medi cal corps could be deve loped as part of the for official use only 6for official use only medical element of the national guard as ne w clinical readiness component of the us public health service or as an independe nt dhs medical corps expand the ndms program staff to include diverse medical specialists to develop concepts of operations and standardized procedures and to provide coordi nation with other federal state and local agencies create an ndms advisory board ch aired by the assistant secretary for medical readiness and consisting of senior repres entatives from each of the ndms partner organizations to provide strategic guidance to the assistant secretarys staff to facilitate ndms operations 4 finding the metropolitan medical response sy stem mmrs program assists highly populated jurisdictions numbering 124 in fy03 to develop plans conduct training and exercises acquire pharmaceuticals and persona l protective equipment and achieve the enhanced capability necessary to respond to mass casualty event unt il significant external assistance can arrive this approach requires linkages am ong first responders medical treatment facilities and resources public health emergency management volunteer organizations and other local elements it also requires planning and integration with neighboring jurisdictions state and federal agencies in fy04 110 grants totaling 46 million reached 114 mmrs jurisdictions yet in fy05 program support was nearly eliminated and was only reinstated as result of congressional pres sure the mmrs is one of the most effective programs for integra ting state and local emergency management and medical readiness planning and preparedness activities yet it lacks central medical oversight and integration into an overall nationa l medical response strategy and is currently only being funded on yeartoyear basis with sustained budget or planning recommendation provide support and direction to th is highlyvalued and relatively low cost program from focused medical readin ess proponent within dhs develop regional integrations of mmrs jurisdictions to pr ovide an interim capability before the activationarrival of fe deral medical response surge capacity 5 finding national healthcare systemwide stra tegy for providing surge capacity does not exist thus the ability to provide care to large numbers of casua lties following major incident remains one of the greatest challenges and vulnerabilities aggressive planning at local levels may have identified appropriate overflow facilities but few communities have successfully met require ments for managing several hundred or thousands of patients numerous federal programs eg ndms commissioned corps readiness force and the medical reserve corps program exist to enha nce surge capacity but they are fragmented and not incorporated into th national response effort recommendation develop surge capability to addr ess not only faciliti but healthcare personnel equipment supplies and transportation assets to care for track house feed and if necessary the movement of injured personnel to locations where definitive care is available such capability must 1 be available within 1224 hours to save the seriously injured 2 not decimate the communities of the medical expertise required for normal operations and for official use only 7for official use only 3 must be sustainable for as long as requi red develop mechanisms to address personnel tracking provider credentialing and privileg ing interoperable data and communications electronic patient tracking nd training and exercises emergency medical services ems 6 finding the nations ems programs and assets are numerous varied and lack central coordination point ems programs are currently situated within several different us government usg departments dhs emerge ncy preparedness and response directorate department of transportation hhs state and calprivate service provi ders the lack of single usg program coordinator to provide cons istent direction and ove rsight of state and local programs standards and funding is of significant concern within the dhs epr directorate there is first responder focus which provides very strong technician level expertise but lacks depth from the emergency dicine perspective for example the noble training center at ft mcclellan alabama is dhs asset that could be better utilized for this purpose it is the only hospital facility in the us devoted entirely to multidisciplinary medical training applied research and beta tes ting injury treatment protection of healthcare personnel and facility protection for weapons of mass struction wmd incidents yet since its transfer to dhs it has been severe ly underutilized and lacks coordination and support from knowledgeable dhs medical readiness personnel recommendation establish national ems coordination program in cooperation with relevant professional organizations monitor state and national ems activities and make recommendations on ems policy standards legi slation liability and educational issues ensure that adequate funding is provided to ems agencies for cbrne response assist in developing educational programs nd products for the ems community occupational health and safety 7 finding the dhs internal occupational health and safety program is fragmented and inconsistently implemented across organizational units it currently lacks the visibility authority and manpower to effectively implem ent the policies and programs necessary to provide the minimal workplace occupational health and safety elements required by the federal government or to medically protect or treat dhs employees nd contractors within their assigned mission operations program deficiencies include lack of personal protective equipment ppe or training on its use lack of people in positions to administer occupational health policies and programs lack of information on whom to call where to go for medical assistance personnel not trained in selfaidbuddy care lack of medical support to field operating units occupational health and safety policy communication program evaluations for physical fitness to deploy not accomplished insufficient and in some cases complete l ack of orientation or periodic training on occupational health and safety policies and pr ograms for either management or employees for official use only 8for official use only recommendation identify and resource an organizati onal entity to establish and provide oversight for the dhs occupational health and safety program including workforce health protection this includes an eff ective occupational health an d safety program for all dhs employees ppe program including an appr opriate medical monitoring program and program for medical support to field operati ng units including tact ical field medics conclusion the creation of dhs required the secretary to prevent protect respond to and recover from natural and man made disa sters throughout history disaster s really only occur when an event negatively impacts people clearly meetin g the health and medical needs of nation at times of disaster is core re quirement of dhs and the secretar to efficiently and effectively complete this mission it is imperative that dhs re evaluate and refine th medical component of its mission design develop and realign medi cal response capabilities within dhs and collaborate with hhs and other fe deral partners to ensure the seamless integration of medical preparedness and response capabiliti at the federal regional st ate and local levels through the creation of the office of dical readiness dhs will be ab to design medical response operations and capabilities to leverage existing fe deral state and local medical capability to successfully respond to any incident of nationa l significance especially those involving cbrne the office of medical readiness will provide medical response that is staffed trained and equipped to manage overwhelming numbers of cas ualties prevent subsequent morbidity and decrease mortality while enabling dhs to meet it s requirements for workforce health

terrorist attacks the best protection possible should be provided agai nst successful attack on the agriculture and food system which coul d have catastrophic health and economic effects as established in hspd7 the secretary of homeland security is responsible for coordinating the overall national effort to enhance the protec tion of the critical infrastructure and key resources of the

paragraph 8 and integr ate and analyze domestic and international surveillance and monitoring data collected from human health animal health plant health food and water quality systems the secretaries of agriculture health and human services and homeland security shall expand and continue vulnerability assessments of the agriculture and food sectors these vulnerability assessments should identify re quirements of the nati onal infrastructure protection plan developed by the secretary of homeland security as appropriate and shall be updated every two years the secretary of homeland s ecurity

protection surveillance and detection and response and recovery successful implementation of the program re quires optimizing critical crosscutting functions such as information management and communications research development and acquisition creation and maintenance of needed biodefense infrastructure including the human capital to support it public pr eparedness and strengthened bilateral multilateral and intern ational cooperation national biodefense preparedness and response requires the involvement of wide range of federal departments and agencies the s ecretary of homeland security is the pfo for domestic incident management and is re sponsible for coordina ting domestic federal operations to prepare for respond to and rec over from biological weapons attacks the secretary of homeland security coordinates as appropriate with the heads of other federal departments and agencies to effectively accomplish this mission assessments one critical element of the biodefense policy is the development of periodic assessments of the evolving biological weapons threat first the united states requires continuous formal process for conducting routine capabilit ies assessments to guide prioritization of ongoing investments in biodefenserelated research development planning and preparedness these assessments will be tailored to meet the requirements in each of these areas second the united states requi res periodic seniorlevel policy net assessment that evaluates progress in implemen ting this policy identifies continuing gaps or vulnerabilities in the biodefense posture and makes recommendations for rebalancing and refining investments among the pillars of the overall biod efense policy the department of homeland security in c oordination with other appropriate federal departments and agencies will be respons ible for conducting these assessments critical infrastructure protection protecting the critical infrastructure from th effects of biological weapons attacks is priority biological weapons attack coul d deny access to essential facilities and response capabilities therefore efforts ar underway to improve the survivability and ensure the continuity and rest oration of operations of crit ical infrastructure sectors following biological weapons attacks assessing the vulnerability of this infrastructure particularly the medical public healt h food water energy agricultural and transportation sectors is the focus of curre nt efforts the department of homeland security in coordination with other appropriate federal partments and agencies leads these efforts which include developing nd deploying biodetecti on technologies and decontamination methodologies for official use only 24for official use only attack warning early warning detection or rec ognition of biological weapon s attacks to permit timely response to mitigate their consequences is an essential component of biodefense through the presidents recently proposed biosur veillance initiative the united states is working to develop an integrated and compre hensive attack warning system to rapidly recognize and characterize the dispersal of biological ag ents in human and animal populations food water agriculture and the environment creating national bioawareness system will permit the recogniti on of biological attack at the earliest possible moment and permit initiation of robus t response to prevent unnecessary loss of life economic losses and social disruption such system will be built upon and reinforce existing federal st ate local and internationa l surveillance systems the department of homeland security in c oordination with other appropriate federal departments and agencies integrates these efforts attribution deterrence is the historical cornerstone of fense and attribution the identification of the perpetrator as well as method of att ack forms the foundati on upon which deterrence rests biological weapons however lend themse lves to covert or clandestine attacks that could permit the perpetrator to remain nonymous attribution capabilities are being improved to enhance the deterrence posture the capability to perform technical forensic analysis and to assimilate allsource inform ation to enable attribution assessments is being improved the national bioforensic an alysis center of the national biodefense analysis and countermeasure center under th department of homeland security has been created and designated as the lead fede ral facility to conduc t and facilitate the technical forensic analysis and interpretation of mate rials recovered following biological attack in support of th appropriate lead federal agency response planning once biological weapons attack is detecte d the speed and coordination of the federal state local private sector and internationa l response will be critical in mitigating the lethal medical psychological and economic cons equences of such attacks responses to biological weapons attacks depend on preatta ck planning and preparedness capabilities to treat casualties risk communicati ons physical control measures medical countermeasures and decontamination capabilities biological response annex is being drafted as part of the national response plan nrp state and local plans consistent w ith the nrp are being developed to ensure seamless coordinated effort capabilities required for response and mitigation against biological attacks will be based on interagenc yagreed scenarios derived from plausible threat assessments these plans will be regular ly tested as part of federal state local and international exercises the department of homeland security in coordination with other appropriate federal departments and ag encies is developing comprehensive plans for official use only 25for official use only that provide for seamless coordinated federal state local and international responses to biological attack risk communication critical adjunct capability to mass casualt care is effective risk communication timely communications with the general public and the medical and public health communities can significantly influence the succ ess of response efforts including health and lifesustaining interventi ons efforts will be made to develop communication strategies plans products and channels to reach all segments of society including those with physical or language limitations these efforts will ensure timely domestic and international dissemination of information that educates and reassu res the general public and relevant professional sectors before during and after an attack or other public health emergency the department of homeland security in co ordination with other appropriate federal departments and agencies is developing co mprehensive coordinate d risk communication strategies to facilitate emergency prepare dness for biological weapons attacks this includes travel and citizen advisories inte rnational coordination and communication and response and recovery communications in the ev ent of largescale biological attack for official use only 26for official use only appendix 3 survey methodology general the assessment instrument was formul ated after conducting series of preliminary interviews with dhs medical and nonmedical staff that included discussions with jeffrey lowell md facs senior adviso r to the secretary for medical affairs and capt veronica stephens msn an pc wmd operations and incident management science and technology director ate dhs as well as others the actual interviews were conducted and analysis performed by an expert team from the international consulting firm battelle data from the preliminary interviews was analyzed and compiled with input and di rection from dhs personnel to create the assessment instrument methodology the assessment instrument consisted of eight openended topical discussion points intended to stimulate freeflowing di scussion from the individuals interviewed interviews were conducted with thirtytwo management and nonmanagement employees across all five dhs directorates manag ement science and technology information analysis and infrastructure protection border and transportation security and emergency preparedness and response and the us secret service federal law enforcement training

determining wh at medical and public health requirements and capabilities are needed w ithin dhs we have been tasked to conduct confidential and nonattribution interviews with selected staff your insights and thoughts will help us get clear picture of the medicalphs requirements and capabilities when we prepare our notes from this intervie w number will be substituted for your identity to prevent any attribution to you personally wed appr eciate it if you would be candid and share your personal perspective with us discussion points 1 personal data for perspective of depth bread th of their knowledge brief biosketch of interviewee background time in role which role how individual got there 2 what is your understanding of any medi calph requirements and capabilities for your specific area of responsibility can you think of any circumstances where you would want to be able to have medical expertise use list of medicalph functional disciplines as stimulant are there any medph areas where you need reachback capability do you know who these folks in dhs are do you know how to reach them do you have an understanding of the system to reach out to these folks what do you know about the internal mechanisms or protocols within dhs for reaching medicalph assetsresources what is your understanding of c ontacting the hsoc within dhs how do you currently use the medicalph assets within dhs at all how do you see them supporting your area of responsibilities are there any impediments blocks gaps or disconnects to obtain the medph information andor assistance you need do the current capabilities meet your needs 3 talk to us about how your directorate or area of responsibility ensures you have the equipment training fitness levels you need to safely operate if you are deployed to disaster or in cident site does anyone ensure you have the inoculations ou need tetanus vaccines for official use only 41for official use only 4 if you are deployed to fiel d situation how does your team manage any injuries or exposure to toxic substances or bioagents you might encounter 5 tell about any medical or ph operationa l and organizational pol icies that pertain to your area did you bring those policies with you when your division moved to dhs or formed them from startup are they uniform throughout dhs 6 were going to lighten up little now he res an opportunity to have some fun be creative were looking at an image ssage that can be used internally maybe externally to communicate about the important work being done at dhs think of the role that dhs employees hold the role that you hold within dhs now take your vision of that role and design character that you might see in television series or an action movie that would play that ro what would that be person be like 7 phs commissioned corps only lets talk about what you see as the career advantages or disadvantages of being detailed to dhs 8 other are there any other issues you want to discuss or anything else you might want to share with us for official use only 42for official use only appendix 5 survey responses and conclusi ons by topical categories 1 medical capabilities general responses focused on the understandi ng and knowledge of dical capabilities within dhs ranging from current capab ilities to required capabilities conclusion dhs employees do not know the medica l capabilities that exist within dhs but they know which capabilities are not in dhs regardless of the medical capabilities that exist those medical cap abilities are not known thr oughout the department or the directorate in which the medical capability resides currently there is medical component or system that can manage medical event involving mass casualty injury or illness the use of existing medical capab ilities to respond to medical event creates secondary medical emergency for local medical facilities hhs response units are not capable of re sponding to medical event on their own issues with the current medical capabilities survey quotes i have visited all the training centers and s t is not capable to train physicians and nurses to respond to wmd event docs and nurses will be the first responders and they need to know the dhs perspective and issues they need to deal with regarding cbrne most hospitals are understaffed and over booked only couple of extra patients overwhelms most hospital systems today here is the issue i have 60 physicians uscg most are flight surgeons with bioweapons training only 60 docs of 40 for 40000 uscg personnel weve had two docs in the persian gulf along w ith seven physician assistants we are barely doing the mission now we are not m anned to assist with all these other deployment requests that co in of the 60 docs 10 are administrative leaving 50 for the mission we have 17 physician assistants 630 corpsmen 59 dentists ndms said we had to go to the next hurricane hhs sent in the commissioned corps readiness force with three gallons of water and stethoscopes nor refills or gas ccra said we need your toys they sent the patients to the local hospitals the goal was to keep the pa tients from overwhelming the local hospitals hhs thinks it was big ccess but none of these people were injured for official use only 51for official use only we have to fix the key problem on medical surge we cannot afford solution to protect everyone everywhere we have to tell the public how we are parsing this without ndms their hhs healthcare providers have infrastructure supplies team structure training they come as individuals from all over the country not very many of them have current clinical skills some have had clinical experience in n years this is not good hhs has the responsibility for the medical response but arent capable of doing it especially alone hhs is not really getting any lower than the state level there is absolutely impact it is ext remely small in st medical has very small footprint in dhs ndms is the medical component under dhs we are going to get terrorist attack and our ndms in the capital region is out of service because one pays the bills ndms is decaying i heard they literally shut down the indian health emergency room in new mexico to put the medical assets in florida we just put together catastrophic in cident plan its ju st plan but do we have the capability of ca rrying out the plan we used the army model of 100000 casualties fema asks the phs for assistance for officers and phs then calls the uscg for those people its triangle we need to rethink patient movement we would be in big trouble if there was large hit training in clinical forens ic medicine forensic science dealing with living patients we do not train physicians to do forensic science physicians are wrong 70 of the time in 30 of the cases wounds that are documented on the chart are not there at all and exit w ounds are erroneously labeled they hh advertise that they have 1200 but they are really not able to do it there are 1200 hhs employees the phs commissioned corps that are detailed to indian health prisons other agencies that could be deployed but many are not clinically competent nd they send them to liaison spots for official use only 52for official use only i have one to reach out to i see rge need for mental health consequence management and mitigation we need to look at the psychosomatic phenomenon which is widespread we were ready to treat 200 patients in orange county florida in twentyfour hours this was hhs mission that wa s accomplished by ndms hhs was not ready to treat patients there are dmats ndms around the country but they are so slow to activate and respond then by the time they get there they ar not needed lot of people sign up to volunteer d mat but when the call comes theyre not available there is limited number of people who can go to disaster when it occurs even though dhs is not the lead for medica l to guide the s ecretary he needs an inherent medical public health capability if you looked at defending your country the medical is necessary it makes sense to have it here dhs 2 medical requirements general responses focused on the perceptions of the medical requirements that dhs has to fulfill its overall mission responses ra nged from discussions of extensive medical planning readiness and response needs to comme nts that medical is strictly for someone else to do conclusion dhs needs unified medical compon ent at the headquart ers level to 1 educate its internal management as to how medical component within dhs contributes and is necessary to fulfill the dhs mission 2 provide additional medical assets to meet the medical element of it mission 3 lead fforts for nationwide medical credentialing and standardization initiative that will enable licensed and credentialed medical professionals including emts to work nati onwide 4 advocate for appropriate funding of its medical components 5 correct its or ganizational restrictions that impede its ability to hire and retain qualified medical professionals and 6correct human capital policies and practices that medically prot ect its federal employees but exclude its contractors from those protections medical readiness requirements survey quotes we have requirement to talk medicine preventative medicine resulting effects mitigating medical requirement s after the incident we need smart element like that in dhs for official use only 53for official use only the need for medical understanding of medical issues to manage an event is needed throughout all of dhs clearly mass casualty care assessment planning doctrine execution are very critical part if not the critical part of our biodefense capability the sns strategic national stockpil needs to be expanded to regional stockpiles they need to be closer to the incident we need to get that out more immediately if we have major terroris t incident the planes wont be flying it needs to be decentralized we need to ex pand to parallel system i think that we dont want to duplicate what hhs is doing but with the threats out there we need to build robust medical response capability i could use medical oversight i ne ed an md with medical operational emergency experience i need an avia tion medical specialist md nurses and managers dhs has responsibility to address public health areas that would reduce our vulnerability to chembio attack you have doctor that doesnt recognize the biothreat and wouldnt be able to dete ct it if he had twobyfour upside the head i reached out and tried to get tropical disease doctor we needed one badly we deploy p3s to peru columbia and other countries in south and central america in areas with tropical diseas like malaria on my own i had to research the parasite and find out how to kill it without any ssistance i am not physician we need clinical infectious disease exper tise clinical consequence of disease is important but help on responder issues is needed there needs to be outreach from characterization programs to the larger medical community in terms of doing ri sk assessments focusing largely on infectious disease issues we need infectious disease expertise in the organization i see the need for training and educa tion awareness piece the first responder is getting trained and equipped but when you get to the hospital the doctor doesnt have clue what to do with mustard gas patient we need someone who can say im doc i care for you someone who knows what theyre going through the other thing were concerned about is developing three medivac teams dod doesnt have enough people to do it for official use only 54for official use only there are some critical specialties need ed like psychology infectious disease pathology anesthesiologists ra diation oncology and surgeons the secretary needs strategic level medical staff in the role of staff advisors to do strategic planning initiatives and as th connecting conduit to hhs regarding similar initiatives if he had these pe ople on board he would not have to call tommy thompson people supporting the secret ary need to be real doctor or nurse so they can advise the entire healthcare system is shutting doors and it is difficult to get support from them when they are shutting down we have to have 247 availa bility to respond to the needs of this country whenever the locals or states are overwhelmed by medical incident when challenger blew up they sent search teams with emts in them but the emts werent licensed to operate in the state of texas and texas wont recognize the national registry whose license do we apply our services to it was the surgeon general we do not have anyone here in dhs with medical license to apply to also we need someone who can put fo rth nationwide med ical certification process that allows people to go anywhere in virginia its all local emt license is local protocols are local when activated you could do paramedic advanced support in that county but once i step out of that county i cant do it those issues need to be taken and dealt with we are not necessarily federalized when we work on these teams there are nationwide protocols on what to do or how to do it dod sets protocols for first responders it should be something like that there needs to be scope of practice with lin of licensure medical control docs and protocols to use within that we need some more complete than those from dod for first responders for the ndms teams that are activated nowhere do they set these standards there is position open now but what md would come in here and work in an office with low pay if flask is dropped with the vapors wa fting in the air and you decide if youre going to treat or not treat because of the distinction between government employee and contractor for official use only 55for official use only contractors could not receive care at wramc because they were not government employees we had to farm them out to occupational health physicians in the community there is consensus to treatment the treatment protocol is up to ad hoc occupational he alth physicians if dealing with more dangerous organisms it is helpful to ve way for government and contractors to get care there at the government facility number one is funding until you have funding you cant get what you need number two you cant attract anyone wort h their salt upstairs cant attract the quality types and the numbers you need without proper funding you cant develop teams they need to have traini ng and equipment but you cant without the funding our ndms budget last year was 34m not nearly enough weve got 70 teams and we got 34m they just havent been paying attention we are grossly under funded i need mostly money to support the ams we have 34m appropriated we are starting at zerobased assessment nd have requirement for 87m and 14m just to keep the doors open it is hard to maintain the system when we are not supported 3 occupational health buddy ai d and occupational health policies general responses to the three topical areas of occupational health buddy aid and occupational health policies were so closely connected nd intertwined that it was deemed necessary to conduct th analysis of these areas t ogether in all three areas responses reflected disparate awareness and knowledge of the need and utilization of dhs occupational health policies and programs in the extreme across dhs directorates and agencies that awareness and utilization of occupational health policies and programs appears to be connected to the origin of the particular operational unit conclusion occupational health and safety for dhs lacks the visibility authority and manpower to effectively implement the polic ies and programs necessary to provide the minimal workplace occupational health and safety elements required by the federal government or to medically protect or treat dhs employees and cont ractors within their assigned mission operations lacking key component in the department is internal communication messaging and program support that reaches all organizat ional units within dhs management and employees of dhs need basic orientati on and training to understand what the dhs occupational health and safety policies are and how they apply to their work as managers and employees managers need particular orie ntation towards occupational health and safety matters in operations and continuity planning in thei r decisions as to st aff deployments and for official use only 56for official use only utilization in the provision of necessary support services equipment and training for deployed staff and to the necessity and importance for the proper adherence to and enforcement of these policies and procedur within their organizational units dhs needs management accountability for communicating implementing staffing and enforcing occupational health and safety policies and programs in each and all organizational units as is necessary to achieve dhs compliance with basic federal mandates in this area dhs managers need 1 access to occupationa l health and safety service support for program implementation and maintenance and 2 individual analysis of their organizational units mission operations and staffing to determine their units occupational health and safety program needs responses to occupational health buddy aid and occupational health policies if someone becomes ill we call 911 do we have occupational health policies nope those created by law st um iaip and the office of the secretary thats where there is big lack of occupational health people i have not seen medical support in dhs right now there are as many approaches as there are agencies there is occupational health component active in wmdoim in st weve been stuck out at the rnc republic an national convention in tunnels on bridges with water prot ective clothing or equipment during rnc eml lab peopl were working side by side with the new york port authorities who had ppe personal protective equipment but eml people did not have any ppe at rnc we sent people up there they were going to put guy who had just had open heart surgery five months before on the george washington bridge in protective mask for 8 hours with water relief was planned they sent guy who had just had sten t put in he was dmort person we got frantic call from the office of research and development within st to get them they could have been hurt or sick they needed mask protection from internal combustion engine fumes plan whatsoever it has not been corrected it is not part of ope rations planning its never done for official use only 57for official use only i need medical and public health support for potential cbrne events and to protect my people and the people i am moving out of town we have training most managers in dhs dont know about any dhs policies i have knowledge of dhs occ upational health policy we get orientation as an employee or manager we need to figure these things out dhs internal safety and occupational health needs we need to be compliant to th extent that other federal agencies have to comply with federal agency requirements repeated this twice we need standard programs and policies and medical operational support there isnt any buddy aid it doesnt exist out in the field dmats have management support teams to take care of the people employees of dhs sent out separate from the dmats are on their own take socom for example special operations command they had special operations trooper hit with an ied i mprovised explosive device and he literally bled to death there was an tire troop around him all he needed was tourniquet for most bio agents it is urgent care not emergen cy care we need system set up for when people have accidents they can get care promptly its hard to go to local hospital if worki ng on classified project you cant tell them what they were exposed to i need imbedded medical support for thes people and this s hould extend to all of dhs all dhs deployments n eed embedded medical support perhaps we should go the phs route so th at not every directorate has their own capability we should have the same medical support for all dhs employees and all dhs deployed employees i will help at any time to help with this initiative we want consistent policies to look at the impact and mitigation we dont want to cause adverse health effects for official use only 58for official use only 4 organizational visionissues general responses to the topics for disc ussion revealed organizational issues concerning medical assets existing within dhs there were numer ous comments about the need for placing all dhs dical assets under unified leadership with comparable authority to an undersecretary background major medical asset within dhs is the national disaster medical system ndms which currently resides under the federal emergency management administration fema within the emerge ncy preparedness and response p r directorate responses focused on the issu that arise with ndms being placed under fema as well as the need for ndms to be part of separate medical readiness and response organizationa l unit within dhs ndms is currently managed by fema within dhs ndms consists of volunteers from the medical profession that perform medical response in national disaster they also include nonmedical teams these volunteer teams are equipped with trucks containing emergency medical equipment and supplies the team members who respond to request to provide medical assistance are paid for th services they provide and generally leave their regular jobs to perform these volunt eer services fema operates under strict management rules and directives originally designed to manage nonmedical emergency response and recovery to natural national disast ers in such cases fema sends staff and contractors to set up satellite offices near the disaster to provide recovery funding assistance to disaster victims those fiel d administrative systems are not designed for medical response teams deployed to disast er site their administrative and payment systems do not work well for the vol unteer teams deployed through ndms conclusions medical assets within dhs are fragmented underutilized and mismanaged 1 ndms is losing functional ffectiveness under femas inflexible and inappropriate management for medical response circumstances 2 medical assets need to be organized under unified leadership that has authority comparable to the undersecretary level with in dhs 3 dhs medical assets need to be included in response planning throughout dhs and 4 dhs needs to establish culture of national response to replace an organizational culture of federalized bureaucracy responses to organizational visionissues problems are with administration personnel actions and excessive signature chains to get things done right now were in crisis some team s are being evicted dmat teams from warehouses where all their stuff is stor ed three semis full of stuff they store because fema hasnt paid the bills the teams put up with lot of stuff but dont you dare screw with their pay and expense reimbursement for official use only 59for official use only people are leaving the teams becaus they dont get pai d theyre angry and they cant afford two weeks without pay they need it right away and cant wait months to be paid in california one team leader put the whole teams expenses on personal credit card so they could get their missi on done it was 11000 so the team would have what they needed and he couldnt get paid back when ndms was with hhs we had manage ment support teams for us while we were deployed now it is pushed to one support team to manage two different assets with two different missions and skill levels it doesnt work very well it is not effective to date it has not worked th ere is lot of discontent over it i am dhs employee but i cannot say that fema does not want you to say you are dhs employee fema wants it done the fema way but i work for dhs to fema credentialing means getting your fingerprints and your picturenot medical credentials fema does not use people appropriately for example they wanted an md to pass out brochures as community relations person in florida traditional medical disaster response is through ndms femas attitude on everything is if it doe snt fit the rules we dont do it one will change the rules they dont ever fix the rule to get the job done in fema rules take priority over getting the job done fema will spend 300 to watch dime they go completely out of common sense to follow the rule it is re ally frustrating there is flexibility in the system rules apply over the mission they dont treat employees like adults they are twenty years behind in personnel management my team recent deployment to kirksv ille mo plane crash site was in personal protective equipment ppe and it was hot and we cant buy water for the team because of fema rule the teams have to use their per diem for supplies for themselves fema buys water for disaster victims but does not provide it to the team who have to use their per diem many times there is vehicle way to get to place to buy it for official use only 510for official use only on the other hand im not sure from what ive seen that fema does not see how to take care of the medical response teams theyve got to provide what the teams need to get the job done the folks on the dmort teams in kirksville were under usera not the stafford act they have onthe job protection we need to fix that if you stick medical and health under one directorate it then becomes subordinate to that director who is not dical the medical voice gets stifled and lost and the department does not benefit we used to be one step under the secretary in hhs and now we are section under an operations chief seven layers down here in dhs almost everyone is law enfo rcement and as result the right thing to do for medical support and operations is not understood it is lost this is medical operations and it needs clean uninhibited role we need to look at setting up separate medical arm in dhs medical undersecretary that handles all that stuff it needs to be stand alone area in dhs we need to do careful study it absolutely needs to be its own direct orate an acting secretary for medical affairs take the best methods from everywhere and make standardized and efficient program medicine is an opera tional mission here in dhs we need to take the best of the best medical in dhs and widen it for all of dhs i believe that within dhs all of our bio support needs to be coordinated it is not coordinated among director ates and it should be this place really needs deputy sg surgeon general someone with horsepower to make things happen i am not sure that we are organize d to address operational health versus security issues i have problem with dhs standing up their own unit of corporate medical care right now the capability does not exist an autonomous directorate is needed effecting change means stepping on feet and poking skunk the institutional beliefs cronyism and bureauc racy is still in place there are so many cultures here it s like splitting up th navy and it is more and then try to blend it with other groups for official use only 511for official use only dhs is typical government bureaucracy with all its faults and inefficiencies and the real problem is keeping the best people once they st art and hit the wall with the government system we need to establish our culture here we need to integrate that culture and integrate it with dmat teams and cal fire and rescue so everyone understands what is to be done and how we need the same standards same protocols we can do this if we can pull it together within the department if we could have an office in dhs that is put in charge will define the mission set the regulations for all employees put in pe rformance appraisals of each of the undersecretaries in dhs and make them acc ountable so they dont blow it off in strict disaster respon we are not consulted there are people with understanding of the health implications of bio event and they set up this knowledge center what were they thinking the fbi and the cia are connected to it but not th organizations that have to do with health and medical 5 political issues general responses to the topics for discussion revealed political issues existing between dhs and other agencies that could cause in terference in the perf ormance of the dhs mission in nsse national disaster or ot her event requiring re sponse or support from dhs political issues also affect internal dhs operations and capability discussions of political issues with agencies outside dhs came primarily from the st directorate and the epr directorate interv iews discussion of political issues centered on disagreements over legal responsibilitie s for medical readiness and response to national disasters and events between dhs and hhs hspd 10 and esf 8 stipulate that hhs has the lead role in medical response but the dhs secretary is the incident commander ic when two or more federal ag encies are involved further aggravating disagreements between these two agencies are bad feelings over the tearing off of ndms from hhs and placing it with dhs public h ealth service commissioned corps officers headquartered in hhs face political retaliat ion that impacts their individual careers when they accept assignments within dhs number of respondents expressed the need to enact legislation that will clarify and ssign the medical leadership readiness and response roles to dhs conclusions politically adversarial turf wars between dhs and hhs and similar battles between organizational units within dhs threat dhs ability to lead effective medical response in the event of national medical ev ent dhs needs 1 legislative clarification regarding medical readiness and response in homeland secu rity responsibility 2 address and reconcile interagency and internal turf wars 3 establish clear medical response mission philosophy and 4 unify dhs medical assets under centralized leadership for official use only 512for official use only responses to political issues my perspective right now is that ag encies have an adversarial role i dont personally know this but there is yelling and screaming on conferences and they hhs are screaming we have the medical lead what dont you get about what the presiden t said that ridge is the ic incident commander hhs fought tooth and nail to keep ndms in hhs some of those officers phs who stayed at hhs called those that came to dhs castoffs some of the problems will ta ke legislation to correct the approach medicine takes the medica l approach versus sc ience from the public health perspective any death is too many from the strict science perspective there will be deaths th hhs perspective is they take extreme measures to protect the dying it is an accepted fact from the dhs side someone is going to die but we must protect the nation the military approach is to let person die to save others the civilian approach is to save the most critical public health wants zero loss trea t the most critical first from the homeland security side that may not be the approach we could use our teams to take care of those victims that would otherwise use up the resources let the local docs use the resources and personnel that could be saved how we deal with the dical versus public health side is an interagency issue quarantine has never been done before and there are issues of responsibility and authority between dhs and hhs and we ma not get quick decision that would mitigate the spread of disease i believe that within dhs all of our bio support needs to be coordinated it is not coordinated among director ates and it should be we are not playing well with each othe r we need to be more successful at bridging stovepipes for official use only 513for official use only quarantine thats raising the number one issue how are you going to enforce quarantine we are sending in unprotected cops so we need to train if we isolate people we need laws we need proce dure to localize and give them gear we need cops talking to cops we ought to be taking the lead in quarantine we have been propping up hhs since the transition it absolutely needs to be its own dir ectorate an acting secretary for medical affairs take the best methods from everywhere and make standardized and efficient program we need to look at setting up parate medical arm in dhs medical undersecretary that handles all that stuff it needs to be stand alone here in dhs we must get the word out that medical problems need to be addressed at the highest levels of dhs cronyism may continue to be proble m with pay banding i dont expect things to change with pay banding supervising staff must be trained well on how to rate performance battles at wmdoim level and up turf fights and people who report directly to the undersecretary or assistant secretary thats where things are wishywashy networks and friendships are more important than performance if you want to be an ses in this organization your old friends will get you the ses we cant do anything about it wer caught in the politics of dhs 6 communicationsmessaging general responses focused on capturing image and language from dhs employees for potential use of medical asset communicati ons messaging branding and recruitment preliminary interviews used in the instrume nt creation revealed the messagingbranding topic to be somewhat problematic in ach ieving responses dhs employees are by the nature and purpose of their work not prone to imaginative flights of fancy and had difficulty switching their mindset from serious medical response needs and capabilities to promotional images and language about the medical aspects of the dhs mission in this topic interviewers found the most effective approach to be one of asking the interviewees about the imag of dhs medical recruitm ent poster or dhs medical recruitment poster character that most reflected the medical mission of dhs for official use only 514for official use only conclusions dhs currently lacks clear focu sed branding image and message that articulates clean vision of its mission and how it will fulfill that mission dhs needs 1 to create branding image and message to clearly communicate its mission and identity to the american peopl 2 strong medical readiness and response message to communicate with public health internal dhs organizational units and with inter agency coordination 3 system of knowledge management to foster and ensure the sharing and integration of information acro ss and throughout the orga nizational units of dhs and 4 to capture and formalize its inte rnal cultural language to use in internal communications and external messaging communicationsmessaging responses it needs visible nationally reco gnized and trusted spokesperson who communicates well and openly the dhs medical requirement is rving the country they should be formulating and putting together cavalry like the old ndms it was people at the local level who hold the line until the cavalry gets there emergency rooms are the place where the medical nurses emts fire all come together one of the old ndms broc hures had pictures and stuff like that rescue type pictures i like the minute man image the 3corner ed hat holding rifle lot of people will probably talk about shields shields impl that we are about war we need to avoid images that show separa tion like moats walls etc the image i think the surgeon genera l we need to see him more our interest needs to be in the overall healthcare of our country im big believer in making sure our hometowns are secure it needs to give solutions and needs to communicate to people in language they understand and they need to build that trust for dhs to be success it has to have an articulate cle an vision of where it is going plan on how to get there and way of assessing whether its there or not response to stay the course even when it is not in the news i love the mission i love what we do what we do has real and immediate impact we have pretty neat miss ion its the purpose that matters for official use only 515for official use only we need to ensure our focus is in th best health interest of americans protect the protectors the mission of the office of protecti ve medicine is to serve as unique national resource safeguarding federal employees and their workplace through protective medicine operations specializ ed consultation and education for the public health community it is clear we have to attract the right people we need to be able to retain and keep them on board scientists managing leading edge re search and development programs to dramatically change the current paradigm this is the place where the action is wh ere you can affect things in the short term research and development is tr anslated into immediate products work is interesting scientifically and in tellectually this is not basic research but cutting edge applied research personnel and colleagues in contact with are top flight people come to dhs and apply your talents in making the nation safe and i suggest always couching the statement in mee ting our mission to protect the nation working for dhs is noble cause you have the chance to be on the ground floor of an organization that cant go anywhere but up youd have significant environment to arn in grow in interact with other people its phenomenal opportunity to get into building new organization join something new you are serving your nation public service to your country we need to put forth the dhs values in appealing to them integrity fairness dealing with peoples live these are important people come here for altr uistic reasons its glamor ous youre protecting the country one knows what dhs actually does so they are attracted to the mystery and glamour for official use only 516for official use only when recruiting i explain the downside challenges and the upside opportunities i sell the mission and th upside opportunities to make it i explain to them that this is dy sfunctional organization with an important mission i sell it on casebycase basis i make sure theyre informed about the downside and let them know about the upside opportunities dhs is typical government bureaucracy with all its faults and inefficiencies and the real problem is keeping the best people once they st art and hit the wall with the government system there is the perspective in the public health community that biodefense preparation is waste of resources that take them away from their core mission public health has trus t except from medical diagnosis as opposed to an architecture or surveillance system but they would have missed their best treatment window we are all over the place and trying to talk to get the directorates to talk with one another the biggest issue is one is talking we say its rice bowl this is mine knowledge is power we are not going to share instead of all of us working together we are the glue that is supposed to facilitate communication and coordination there is system in place at this point in time we have to figure out how to share language general the language or vernacular used w ithin an organization is reflection of its corporate culture member mindset and individual employee behavior the organizational language can be significan t means to changing or establishing an organizational culture interviews revealed unique blend of scientific military law enforcement medical federal government speak nguage and geographical colloquialisms interviews revealed extensive use of analogies and metaphors throughout dhs as primary method of translating meaning this special blend of langua ge specific to the mission of dhs creates an excellent opportunity to formulate branding and communication messages unique to the dhs mission the use of this language identifies messaging as dhs communication it supports and reinfor ces the use of logos and other dhs for official use only 517for official use only identifiers resulting in an opportunity to develop strong branding presence for dhs amid multitude of competing government agency images and communications repeatedly used and topically signifi cant vocabulary was isolated by terms images and messaging phrases its inclusi on to this report provides basis for communications language branding ssaging and recruitment messaging it could also be used as support for corporat culture change efforts should change be implemented 7 phs officers detailed to dhs general this topic was brought up for discussion only with public health service phs commissioned corps officers working at dhs who were interviewed as part of the total assessment some of those officers hold permanent positions with dhs but most of them are detailed to dhs phs commissioned co rps officers were asked to discuss what they see are career advantages or disadvantages in working at dhs conclusion dhs organizational units have not been able to incorporate special career management necessary for phs officers the adversarial interagency relationship with hhs is threatening dhs ability to utilize the skills and rvices of phs commissioned corps officers dhs needs 1 to establish an internal agency program for awards and personnel management modeled after other agencies that empl oy phs commissioned corps detailees and 2 resolve pay promotion and cleara nce status issues for phs commissioned corps officers that threat phs employee retention within dhs phs officers detailed to dhs responses there are bigtime battles going on at hhs very senior leadership dislike senior officers at dhs and they control the promotion boards i feel i am stuck as an 05 even though i am in an 06 job part of it is being in dhs and part of this is because of the new rules they are imposing on us now requiring masters in public heal th to be promoted to 06 i am an 06 but filling an 07 billet the only issue i have about being with dhs is that i will not get an 07 promotio n i cant get an 07 and stay at dhs military people here dont have the same career restrictions they get promoted all the agencies where phs officers are located phs officers are owned by that agency not phs phs has control of about 20 of 6000 phs officers phs is trying to exert control to have ready force they tell us we need to buy uniforms follow their rules and this hurts morale for official use only 518for official use only phs holds promotion panels and the precept is to have phs deployment my phs officers are called directly and they in turn are told to speak wit their commanding officer and work it out makes for difficult re lationship between the commanding officer and the phs officer the commander is in catch22 dont let him go then promotion let hi m go and get backfi ll to do the work at hand one officer in alaska has deployed si x or seven times for phs deployments and the co is furious he is the only one in 400 mile arc from sitka to victoria canada he is the only one doing lifesaving missions weekly and these do not count as phs deployment the phs has asked the uscg for dentists to examine marine recruits at camp lejune to do this the uscg had to pull dentists from cape may new jersey where they were providing oral health to uscg recruits also getting ready for deployment where this comes into play is the security clearances are an issue dhs thinks hhs holds the security clearance if ou are not detailee then dhs holds the security clearance xxx and xxx are phs and hold dhs clearance there is grandfather clause this position should be in washington dc ordinarily liaisons are in headquarters where the agencies reside there is total breakdown hhs does nt care we have an mou but fema doesnt have mechanism for the commissioned corps they have rule about it so they ignore it most of the people worki ng for make more money than i do most of them are at least gs15 one of the advantages we fall into l oopholes in the laws because of phs we dont count as ftes since dhs sends th money out they d ont count against hhs ftes they dont appear as fte to either organization for our level of expertise we are cheap if dhs cut off phs officers the officer does not have an organization to go back to i would have to go find an organization to take or i would have to quit phs people are leaving lost two peoplewho have gone to other agencies for better pay and opportunities this place is like swinging door for official use only 519for official use only i am eligible but i have b een told that i wont get star over here dhs and that sends the negative mess age that hhs doesnt care the negative implication for dhs might be that i decide to go back to hhs just to get my star that would have big impact on dhs morale is awful we have lost about 10 more professionals than in any other time in history uscg more have left this year than in any other 8 other general very little data was collected in the other category most of the data categorized in this topic dealt with di sconnects in understandi ng the dhs internal organizational structure or with previous i ssues that have been partially addressed we just started out with our 5th set of space planners is an example of expressed frustration over the organizational issues that dhs has faced as start up organization negative corporate cultural may already be forming and becoming entrenched in dhs as an organization and is an indicator of the need to proactively and positively take actions to intentionally instill chosen co rporate culture this was expressed in the statement you often get the answer that we have never done that that way and we never will for official use only 520for official use only appendix 6 national disaster medical sy stem recommendations for disaster medical assistance team dmat transformation background federallycoordinated system the nationa l disaster medical system ndms was initially developed by the us public health service usphs to support state and local healthcare agencies during natura l disasters following the trag ic events of september 11 2001 the ndms mission has expanded to include tech nological disasters major transportation accidents acts of terrorism including weapons of mass destruction events and support for national security special events nsses working in partnership with the departments of health and human services hhs defense dod and veterans affairs va the ndms deploys health and medical personnel equipment nd supplies in phased regional approach the ndms has gone through major management changes in recent years in 2001 the office of emergency response oerof wh ich the ndms section was componentwas transferred to the newlyformed assistant secretary for public health emergency preparedness in hhs on march 1 2003 the ndms and oe r were reassigned to the emergency preparedness and response ep r directorate of the depart ment of homeland security dhs personnel changes during these two move s reduced the staff from reported 144 to 57 positions in addition the commissioned corps readiness force ccrf personnel who had previously worked closely with and augmen ted the oer staff were retained by hhs methodology an initial review of the ndms was conducted concurrently with th dhs medical needs assessment between september 23 and november 9 2004 the ndms review focused on documenting the perceived effectiveness of nd ms capabilities partic ularly the disaster medical assistance teams dmats identif ying gaps and concerns and developing recommendations for transforming the dmats to satisfy current mission requirements previous assessments of the ndms recent af teraction reports from the democratic and republican national conventions an d hurricane response deployments and other relevant reports were reviewed interviews with ndms core staff members solicited ideas for improving the ndms dmat commanders and team member s who deployed to these disasters were interviewed telephonically or co ntacted via email to discuss their experiences and elaborate on recommendations to improve cap abilities and re sponsiveness for official use only 61for official use only findings the national disaster medical system is an organization comprised of over 8000 personnel with the exception of very sma ll number of committed management personnel in the ndms section of the epr directorate the bulk of ndms staff members are devoted volunteers located throughout the country past nm ds successes can be directly attributed to these committed and dedicated personnel during an event these volunteer members and the few fulltime staff members accomplis h the ndms mission by taking days to weeks away from their primary jobs often living in austere and sometimes dangerous environments while their colleagues at home cover their work shifts and practices major findings of the ndms assessment are discussed in this section the ndms lacks the medical oversight required to effectively develop prepare for employ and sustain deployable medical ssets the chief medical officer position is vacant and there is plan to provide supporting medical sta ff to develop operational plans or standard operating procedures even though the ndms mission has expanded beyond re sponse to natural di sasters there has been substantial change in doctrine organi zation or funding to satisfy the demands of the new requirements dmats are now frequently predeployed to support national security special events nsses as an onscene asset to provide em ergency care within minutes of an untoward event the dmats are not currently organize d trained or equipped to accomplish such tasks the center for naval analysis cna cor porate readiness assessment dated october 2002 was focused on the dmats national medical response teams nmrts and management support team mst the indep th evaluation identified the following key components as deficient or completely lacking dmat guidelines did not correl ate to mission requirements the hhs oer lacked data to completely assess readiness partial readiness assessments based on oer ad ministrative data conf licted with data derived from team members dmats were fulfilling missions unrelated to stated capabilities absent or outdated doctrine and policy s resulted in the lack of consistency among dmats the policies that do exist are not enfo rced as result dmat commanders have developed their own policies and guidelines wh ich vary considerably from one team to another these variations negativ ely affect the ability of dmats to work together cohesively and have an adverse impact on the frequent requirement for one team to replace or augment another letter from one prominent dmat leader to dhs reported the loss of warehouse space resulting from dhs not paying the rent as previously negot iated another dmat member reported providing 7000 in personal funds to pay for warehouse space when dhs did not for official use only 62 for official use only make the rent payments some warehouses ve been locked and team members denied entry while others have received threats of eviction problems like these are common and continue to degrade federal response capabilities the recent report bioterrorism america still unprepared by the house select committee on homeland security dated october 22 2004 concl udes that our nation is not prepared to distribute federallysupplied medicines and v accines quickly enough to successfully respond to bioterrorism event or other public heal th emergency such as pandemic flu even though initial response to such incidents is not th immediate mission of the ndms the lack of readiness at the state and local levels could be further com pounded by continued degradation of the federal medical respons capability which is intended to augment and support local healthcare response efforts the absence of medical leadership within the federal emergency management agency fema and dhs is clearly apparent the stru cture and volunteer nature of the ndms is different from other components of dhs nd fema other vital us government program in the department of justice health and human services or department of defense is being staffed predominantly by volunt eers the responsibility for planning for and responding to incidents of such national sign ificance cannot be relegated to volunteer workforce which when activated are not legally bound to report for duty recent hurricanes in the south east severely taxed the ndmsn early threequarters of fully deployable ndms teams were reportedly mob ilized in addition substantial number of usphs personnel were deployed to support local medical requirements rather than providing direct care to hurricane victims coupled with the fact that there were few if any serious injuries incurred raises serious questions about the ability of ndms to respond to mass casualty events resulting from cbrne incident or pandemic illness in which hundreds of healthcare providers would be needed for extended periods recommendations to ensure the ndms possesses the requisite cap abilities to provide the primary federal medical response the following actions are recommended ndms leadership appointing senior medical lead er within the proposed dhs of fice of medical readiness to provide oversight of the ndms is essentia l without this the nations only

operational deficiencies dhs has insufficient health and medical resources lacks an infrastr ucture to support its mission and lacks human resource funding and training to address critical elements of mass casualty support in addition the location of the limited health and medical dhs resources are fragmented and lie at low levels within the department in addition the dmats mu st be staffed trained and equipped to satisfy current mission requirements as result th nation has limited federal medical response capability to mass casualty event the allvolunteer ndms organization is longer capable of supporting the new demands being placed on the system providing trained and responsive federal response assets in times of crisis requires dedi cated force of healthcare providers military models may
