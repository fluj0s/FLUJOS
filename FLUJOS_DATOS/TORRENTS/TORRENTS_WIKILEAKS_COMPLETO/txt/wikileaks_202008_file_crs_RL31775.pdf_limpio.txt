attention to their economic effect particularly whether they raise interest rates any explanation of the budget deficitinterest rate relationship must first come to grips with an indisputable fact budget deficits consume real resources and this is the more relevant public policy concern when the government borrows from the public to finance public spending or tax cuts the resources must come from somewhere in mainstream theory the resources come from the nations pool of saving which pushes up interest rates for simple supply and demand reasons as result the deficit crowds out private investment that was competing with government borrowing for the same pool of na tional saving since less investment reduces the future size of the economy economists often describe deficits as placing burden on future generations but other theories offer different explanations of where the resources come from that do not involve higher interest rates in the capital mobility view foreigners lend the united states the savings it needs to finance deficit leaving interest rates unaffected but foreign capital can only enter the country through trade deficit leading to decline in the output of us exporting and importcompeting industries in an alternative theory popularly known as the barroricardo view forwardlooking rational infinitelylived individuals see that budget deficit would result in higher taxes or lower government spending in the future therefore they reduce their consumption and save more today this provides the government with the saving needed to finance its deficit placing upward pressure on interest rates empirical evidence that budget deficits do not affect interest rates does not prove that government budget deficits do not impose burden as demonstrated by the capital mobility and barroricardo views in the capital mobility view deficits crowd out the trade sector of the economy in the barroricardo view they crowd out current private consumption and in both of these views deficits longer have any stimulative effect on the economy comparing changes in budget deficits to changes in interest rates is not valid way to determine whether budget deficits affect interest rates that is because there are many other factors that also affect interest rates such as the state of the economy to determine the effect of budget deficits on interest rates these other factors must be held constant using statistical methods otherwise the effect of budget deficits on interest rates could be misestimated or even reversed empirical evidence on link between budget deficits and interest rates is mixed there is not consensus among economists on how to model the economy and what relevant variables should be included therefore conclusions drawn from empirical evidence vary widely more recent evidence tends to find stronger positive relationship between the two in addition 10 major forecasting models all predict that budget deficit would increase interest rates according to gale and orszag 2002 the models predict that budget deficit equal to 1 of gdp would increase interest rates with range of 011 mean052 percentage points after one year and 0052 mean099 percentage points after 10 years this report will be updated

government budget deficits have been concern of policymakers in recent years one concern has been what effects these sustained deficits are having on the us economy tax cut proponents have claimed that deficits dont matter in phrase attributed to vice president cheney1 while deficit hawks claim that deficits rais interest rates to the economys detriment this is an important question because how effective tax cuts are in stimulating the economy depends on how the rest of the economy adjusts 2 as this report explains the adjustment can occur through interest rates the trade balance or private saving this report reviews theoretical and empirical evidence to see what relationship exists between budget deficits and interest rates unfortunately simply observing whether interest rates are higher or lower in the presence of deficits is not sufficient test of the hypothesis that is because there are many other factors that are simultaneously affecting interest rates these include the state of the economy the saving behavior of individuals and companies the inve stment opportunities of business the state of financial markets demographics and the financial relationship between the united states and the rest of the world in the real world these factors cannot be held constant so economists try to control for them statistically to separate out the effects of deficits but controlling for other factors requires theoretical model that explains and identifies how deficit and those other factors affect interest rates thus even those who are skeptical of theoretical explanations are dependent on theoretical models to translate the relationship from the empirical evidence because so many different models of the economy exist some models offer positive evidence about the deficitinterest rate relationship while others offer evidence refuting the relationship any explanation of the budget deficitinterest rate relationship must first come to grips with an indisputable fact budget deficits consume real resources when the government borrows from the public to finance public spending or tax cuts the resources must come from somewhere in mainstream theory the resources come from the nations pool of saving which pushes up interest rates for simple supply and demand reasons th is crowds out private investment that was competing with government borrowing for the same pool of national saving but other theories offer different explanations of where the resources come from that do not involve higher interest rates fundamentally the effect of budget deficits on interest rates is only the proximate question that economists and policymakers wish to answer the ultimate question is where the resources come from to finance deficit and what ramifications the use of those resources have for the nations welfare model in which budget deficits do not affect interest rates still has consequences for the nations welfare in reviewing the major theories of the budget deficits effect this report explores the deficits effect on both interest rates and the nations welfare it begins with the mainstream view and then explains how other versions differ from that view 1 ron suskind educating paul oneill wall street journal jan 12 2004 p b1 2 for evidence on the tax cuts efficacy see crs report rl32502 what effects did the 2001 to 2003 tax cuts

deficits expand total spending aggregate demand and thereby shortterm economic growth3 if budget deficit is the result of higher government spending the additional government spending expands aggregate spending directly if budget deficit is the result of tax cuts aggregate spending is expanded by an increase in spending by the tax cuts recipients4 in an economy operating at full employment production aggregate supply cannot be increased to match the increase in spending because all of the economys labor and capital resources are already in use this mismatch between aggregate demand and aggregate supply must be resolved through market adjustment market adjustment ta kes place in four distinct ways each of which has consequences for interest rates the greater demand for goods and services pushes up prices leading to temporary increase in inflation because nominal interest rates are equal to real inflationadjusted interest rates and the expected inflation rate an increase in inflation if anticipated would push up nominal interest rates if the federal reserves objective is to maintain stable inflation rate as most observers believe it will offset the rise in demand through contraction in monetary policy it will increase shortterm real interest rates directly and this will reduce interestsensitive spending ie private investment and consumer durables in the market for savings the demand for savings has increased for two reasons first because the government is now co mpeting with private firms for the same pool of national saving to finance its deficit the government has increased the demand for savings directly and interest rates rise as result higher interest rates make investment spending less profitable for private firms and the budget deficit is thus said to have crowded out private investment second in response to the greater demand for their goods firms wish to increase their investment spending in order to increase their supply of goods investment demand increases in response to the desire for higher production and interest rates rise as result 5 in the money market the increase in aggregate spending leads to an increase in money demand as result if monetary policy is left unchanged interest rates increase since the opportunity cost of holding money is now greater with higher interest rates the same supply of money can now be used to purchase more 3 for more information see crs report rl31235 the economics of the federal budget deficit by brian w cashell 4 note that the increase in the budget deficit described here is due to policy changes which is referred to as change in the structural deficit the change is not due to changes in economic conditions such as fall in tax revenue due to fall in taxable income when economic conditions cause tax revenues to fall the actual deficit would rise but the structural deficit would be unchanged 5 the conventional model usually assumes that the household savings rate would be unaffected by deficitfinanced increase in government spending and that households would save fixed percentage of deficitfinanced tax cut since the average household saving rate is low it is usually assumed that the bulk of the tax cut would be spent to the extent that households save portion of deficitfinanced tax cut there will be less crowding out and stimulus than deficitfinanced increase in government spending in the conventional model

money velocity increases as result of the interaction between these market forces resources have been shifted toward the government or tax cut recipients and away from the saving of the private sector this has consequences for the economy in the long run in the long run economic growth is dependent on increases in private investment productivity and the labor force by identity private investment equals national saving less the budget deficit foreign saving will be considered below thus by reducing national saving budget deficits lead to less private investment this reduces the size of the economy in the long run and future standards of living 6 if the deficit lasts for one year there would be onetime reduction in growth if the ficit lasted for several years it would reduce growth for the duration of that time7 for this reason economists often describe deficits as placing burden on future generations deficits allow individuals to enjoy more consum ption today but since this higher consumption comes at the expense of lower saving and hence lower investment it reduces the size of the economy in the future thus individuals would enjoy lower consumption in the future8

thus far it has been assumed that the expansion in the budget deficit was taking place in an economy with fully employed resources since all of the economys resources were already in use for the government to redirect resources to itself or tax cut recipients required reduction in the resources available to others this reallocation occurred through higher prices and interest rates the latter of which crowded out private investment and consumer durables but in an economy with underemployed labor and capital resources as result of recession or low growth the financing of budget deficit is longer zerosum scenario in which any resources redirected to the government or tax cut recipients must be fully offset by reduction in the purchasing power of others that is because the increase in aggregate spending caused by the deficit leads to unemployed resources being brought back into use generating new aggregate production to match the increase in aggregate spending this is how expansionary fiscal policy stimulates the economy during recession in an extremely underemployed economy enough unused resources are available to match the increase in aggregate spending entirely the increase in the budget deficit would be multiplied by the fact that reemployed workers increase their spending as well so that the total increase in ggregate spending is larger than the increase in the budget deficit in this case the budget deficit would be unlikely to have much of an effect on 6 if the deficit was used to finance public investment eg highways the effects on growth would be different in this case private investment would still be reduced by an equivalent amount but it would be shifted to public investment rather than public or private consumption whether this increased or decreased economic growth would depend on whether public investment was more or less productive than private investment 7 budget deficits could also cause interest rates to rise if they caused the debt to grow at unsustainable rates in which case investors would demand risk premium to be induced to hold government debt for fear of default budget deficits have never grown large enough in the postwar period for this to be relevant factor in the united states where government debt has always been considered riskless risk premiums have been observed for foreign sovereign debt however particularly in the developing world the crowding out argument outlined in this section is not related to risk premiums 8 for more information see crs report rl30520 the national debt who bears its

economy returned to full employment9 the us economy has not faced this extreme scenario since the great depression in all recessions since the 1930s including the last one some underemployed resources have been available to be brought into use in response to an increase in aggregate spending but not enough so that there would not be any increase in interest rates or prices within the framework of the conventional model thus expansionary fiscal policy would cause some increase in aggregate spending with larger increases the further the economy is from full employment it would also cause some increase in interest rates and prices but less than in fully employed economy during the past couple of years the economy has been close to economists estimate of full employment so the effect of deficits on interest rates and prices would be expected to be greater if prices and markets do not adjust instantaneously and peoples expectations do not change instantaneously even at full employment it may be possible to temporarily bring additional resources into production thereby generating some transient stimulus from an increase in the budget deficit in other words an increase in the deficit is unlikely to ever lead to zero increase in aggregate spending in the very short run however deficit is likely to lead to much smaller increase in output and larger increase in prices at full employment than in recession and after adjustment took place the economy would return to full employment with the same higher interest rates and prices as described in the previous section economists tend to disfavor attempts to push the economy above full employment in this way since the inevitable move back down to full employment could result in overshooting in the opposite directionrecession

does not flow between it and the rest of the world relaxing this assumption has very important ramifications for interest rates in closed economy the pool of savings available to the government to finance its deficits and the private sector to finance its investment spending is fixed for that reason any increase in the demand for that savings must push up interest rates but what if the firms and government of the united states could draw from the world pool of savings rather than being limited to the national pool of savings if the increase in the deficit were an insignificant fraction of world savings it would have effect on world interest rates 10 therefore it would have effect on us interest rates because us interest rates adjusted for risk would have to equal world interest rates any 9 in the previous section one reason that budget deficits pushed up interest rates was because the pool of national savings was fixed in the extreme case of an underemployed economy budget deficits do not push up interest rates because the pool of national savings grows along with national income as deficits bring resources back into production income is generated and some of that income will be saved adding to national savings 10 it is often argued that deficits should not affect interest rates because they are an insignificant fraction of world wealth or financial capital this argument is not valid because interest rates are determined by current saving and investment not wealth which is cumulative measure of past saving and investment less depreciation although the assumption that the increase in the deficit is an insignificant fraction of world saving is made here for illustrative purposes this assumption may be questionable for large deficits in reality

capital mobility deficit would have effect on interest rates deficit would still have cost to the economy first though the foreign capital inflows permit larger us capital stock than would otherwise exist the returns from that capital would flow to foreigners rather than us citizens however us workers would benefit from the larger capital stock in the form of higher wages the second cost comes from the effect the capital inflow has on the economy for foreign capital to enter the country foreigners must buy us dollars the increased demand for dollars causes the dollar exchange rate to appreciate as the dollar appreciates us exports become less competitive abroad and us importcompeting firms become less competitive domestically this causes the trade deficit to expand which reduces aggregate spending in the economy in world of perfectly mobile capital the expansion in the trade deficit would offset the expansion of fiscal policy onetoone so that fiscal stimulus had net effect on aggregate spending by adding capital mobility crowding out has not been eliminated it has been shifted from the investment sector to the trade sector thus although there is effect on interest rates fiscal policy in this scenario longer has any stimulative effect on the economy whereas the burden of deficits was borne by future generations in closed economy in the presence of perfect capital mobility it is borne by us exporters and import competing firms

the conventional view simple assumptions are made about the behavior of private saving in response to budget deficit if the deficit is the result of tax cut the conventional view assumes that the tax cuts recipient would save fraction of that tax cut and spend the rest although there is direct way to measure how much of tax cut recipients would be likely to save since the average household saving rate is very low it averaged 44 of gdp in the 1990s and 03 of gdp in 2006 it is typically assumed that tax cuts to individuals would be mostly spent therefore the rise in private saving would be much smaller than the fall in public saving and little crowding out would be prevented supply siders hold that the rise in private saving could be much greater than would be implied by looking at the average saving rate if saving is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates small increases in the aftertax rate of return as result of lower marginal tax rates could lead to large increases in saving technically saving would be said to have high and positive interest 11 technically this is referred to as an arbitrage condition if interest rates did not equalize arbitrageurs could make unlimited profits by selling buying foreign securities and bu ying selling us securities by attempting to exploit unlimited profit opportunities the arbitrageurs eliminate the interest rate differential this example also holds economic conditions in other countries constant if other countries interest rates rose or fell in step with ours because they were pursuing the same policies for example then there would be interest rate differential and resulting capital flow trade deficit

would keep the budget deficit from causing large changes in interest rates and hence investment12 yet look at the long run behavior of private saving in this country casts doubt upon the assertion that small changes in tax rates could generate large changes in the private saving rate the corporate saving rate has been relatively constant in the postwar period while the household saving rate has dropped considerably in the past two decades the downward trend in the household saving rate has occurred during period with many changes in marginal tax rates including large reductions in top marginal income tax rates marginal tax rate s on investment income and the expansion of tax preferred savings vehicles in the 1980s and the 2000s 13 it is also worth considering from theoretical perspective that private saving could be sensitive to interest rates in the opposite way rather than saving more in response to higher interest rates individuals could save less if individuals are prim arily target savers saving to meet goal such as owning house car or to support certain sta ndard of living in retirement higher interest rates would make that goal easier to meet this would cause them to save less in response to budget deficit making the deficits negative effect on long run growth even greater than under the conventional view thus even if incentives are an important determinant of saving behavior it is not clear in which direction the incentives cause behavior to react and there is straightforward evidence to suggest which view is correct indeed the rapidly rising stock market in the late 1990s coincided with decline in the household savings rate to nearly zero as the targetsaver view would predict

budget deficit some economists complain that the explanation of how savers react to changes in the governments fiscal position is not well developed in the mainstream view there is explanation of how todays policy decisions affect the future and how individuals incorporate their perceptions of the future into their plans today the barroricardo view named after the 19th century economist david ricardo and robert barro who revived nd developed ricardos theory addresses this issue14 based on very particular set of assumptions barro showed how deficits could have effect on interest rates barro assumed that people were perfectly rational planned their lifetime consumption through optimization had infinite life spans he suggested that concern for offspring on par with ones own wellbeing could substitute for infinite life spans in reality could borrow against future earnings without limit and were all taxed equally if the deficit finances government purchases those purchases must be perfect substitutes for private consumption he assumed that if the deficit finances tax cuts the tax cut was lumpsum in nature so that incentives to work or save are not changed 12 it should be noted that if this view is correct then ta x cuts would be significantly less stimulative than government spending when the economy is below full employment that is because the portion of tax cut that is saved is not contributing to an increase in aggregate spending for more information see crs report rs21136 government spending or tax reduction which might add more stimulus to the economy by marc labonte 13

increase in the budget deficit would have to be offset by an increase in their tax burden or decrease in their government services in the future15 in light of the larger deficit their previous lifetime consumption plan would lead to too much consumption today and too little in the future to make up for the reduction in future consumption brought about by the deficit they would save more now thus as the government placed greater demand on the nations savings the pool of savings would expand so that upward pressure was placed on interest rates since interest rates and investment levels are the same longterm growth would be the same this also means that an increase in the budget deficit would have shortrun stimulative effect on the economy since national saving and thus aggregate spending has stayed the same the stimulus provided by the government has been offset by contraction in private spending as can be seen the fact that interest rates do not rise in the barroricardo view does not mean that deficits can be financed without using any resources instead of transferring resources from the investment sector as in the conventional view or the trade sector as in the capital mobility view the resources are transferred from private consumption in this sense the effect of deficit under the barroricardo view is similar to tax increase resources are transferred to the government through reduction in private consumption the barroricardo view has clear advantage over the conventional view it offers an explanation for how individuals adjust their saving behavior to take into account fiscal policy but the strict conditions adopted to make this explanation tractable are also its greatest weakness if any of the highly exacting prerequisites are weakened the results may longer hold for example what if individuals do not plan out their lifetime consumption because of uncertainty or myopia what if individuals do not understand the link between deficits and their future welfare or what if individuals who in real life are not all the same think that someone else will get stuck with the bill for example nobodys lifespan is infinite and not everyone has children under any of these cases individuals would longer increase their saving enough to match the increased demands placed on national saving by the budget deficits therefore the barroricardo view would not hold and deficits would cause interest rates to rise g7g150g153g146g155g146g140g138g149g561g7g159g146g141g142g151g140g142g561 comparing changes in budget deficits to changes in interest rates is not valid way to determine whether budget deficits affect interest rates th at is because there are many other factors that affect interest rates to determine the effect of budget deficits on interest rates these other factors must be held constant using statistical methods otherwise the effect of budget deficits on interest rates could be misestimated or even reversed for example interest rates often fall during recessions since investment demand is reduced and precautionary saving may rise if the business cycle has greater effect on interest rates than budget deficits and changes in the budget deficit more specifically changes in the structural deficit happen to coincide with recessions simple comparison of deficits and interest rates would suggest that deficits cause interest rates to 15 in later paper barro drew distinction between anticipated and unanticipated increases in the budget deficit he reasoned that the barroricardo view of zero effect of deficits on the economy and

to fall and after controlling for the recession very different results may be achieved16 it should also be stressed that empirical evidence that budget deficits do not affect interest rates does not demonstrate that government budget deficits are burdenless empirical tests of the effects of deficits on interest rates are only tests of the conventional view without capital mobility the capital mobility view and barroricardo view both explain how deficits could have effect on interest rates and yet the deficits still impose burden in both views in the capital mobility view they crowd out the trade sector of the eco nomy in the barroricardo view they crowd out current private consumption over the past two decades there have been dozens of econometric studies estimating the effects of budget deficits on interest rates the studies have reached very different conclusions because they have covered different periods included different variables and modeled the relationship between the variables and interest rates differently seemingly insignificant changes in the structure of the model such as how long defic it should affect interest rates how deficits and interest rates are defined and the mathematical form used to represent the relationship can drastically change the results not only do variations in the model used lead to different results but some researchers make assumptions at odds with theory these include the use of the actual budget deficit rather than the structural deficit the effect of debt on interest rates instead of the deficit the use of nominal instead of real interest rates the omission of foreign capital flows and so on another problem with the statistical method used in all of the studies reviewed time series analysis is that there can be fundamental change in the economic regime over the time period for the results to be valid yet many studies commingled data from both the fixed and floating exchange rate period the period in which capital mobility has been relatively free and the period that used capital controls the 1970s in which the fed arguably tolerated high inflation and the period since when it did not some studies even included world war ii although this period featured the rationing of goods and credit price controls and the fixing of interest rates by the federal reserve rather than review all of these studies this report will summarize the results of three literature reviews in 1991 barth et published literature review of 42 papers exploring the link between deficits and interest rates 17 they found the evidence to be mixed with 17 studies finding deficits to have positive and statistically significant effect on interest rates 6 having mixed effects and 19 having statistically insignificant or negative effects some studies with positive relationship estimated that the effect of deficit equal to 1 of gnp could increase interest rates as much 0412 percentage points summarizing the studies the authors reach number of conclusions more of an effect is found on longterm interest rates than shortterm rates this makes sense since overnight rates are targeted by the federal reserve and thus heavily influenced by monetary policy in the short run changes in structural budget deficits have more of an effect on interest rates than changes in the actual budget deficit the structural fullemployment deficit is 16 this would be similar to claiming that men are fatter than women because on average men weigh more than women without controlling for the fact that men are on average

cycle on the budget downturn in economic activity automatically causes revenues to fall as taxable income falls and certain types of government expenditures such as unemployment benefits to rise using the actual budget deficit in statistical study would skew the results because the actual deficit is being determined in part by the same factors the state of the economy that are determining interest rates using the structural budget deficit or advanced statistical techniques avoids this problem link between deficits and interest rates is less likely to be found when high frequency monthly or quarterly data are used this makes sense given how noisy volatile high frequency data tend to be an effect is more likely to be found if study uses measure of the expectation of future deficits rather than contemporaneous deficits this makes sense if investors are rational and forward lookinginvestors are not only concerned about what will happen today but also what will happen in the future however the proper measure of future deficits is controversial the cbo baseline is not proper measure since it is an extension of current policy and thus not best guess of future policy the link between deficits and interest rates is better established when the deficits finance government spending than when they finance tax cuts the effect of tax cut on interest rates would be expected to be smaller if tax cut recipients save some of the proceeds of the tax cut studies using statistical method called vectorautoregression consistently found deficits to have effect on interest rates basically the vectorautoregression uses small number of variables and makes attempt to identify the theoretical relationship between the variables this method has advantages and disadvantagesit would not be as accurate as an estimation of the correct theoretical model but given the lack of consensus over what the correct model is it may be more accurate than an incorrect theoretical model it is not method that can control for investors expectations of future deficits which is drawback if this an important factor they conclude that since the available evidence on the effects of deficits is mixed one cannot say with complete confidence that budget deficits raise interest rates and reduce saving and capital formation but equally important one cannot say that they do not have effects 18 this conclusion seems apt given the balanced range of results in the studies they surveyed they also look at studies that attempt to estimate whether deficits crowd out investment the trade sector or consumption and find the results of these studies to be mixed as well joint economic committee study surveyed many of the same studies19 it surveyed five articles all of which were included in the

negative or statistically insignificant it also surveyed 15 articles on the relationship between deficits and consumption which the study took to be test of the barroricardo theory and found that seven studies supported the barro ricardo theory and eight rejected it gale and orszag review journal articles written on the subject in the 1990s since the barth paper was published20 they find that of the 16 studies published since the barth paper 11 found that deficits had positive and statistically significant effect on interest rates five had mixed effects and none found statistically insignificant or negative effects this evidence is quite bit stronger than the evidence found in the barth review and they attribute the change in outcome to some changes in research techniques which they believe to be superior to earlier studies the studies also covered several more years of data specifically they believe the more recent studies to be superior because all of the recent studies focus on changes in longterm budget forecasts rather than currentyear deficit totals and because they differentiate between longterm interest rates and shortterm interest rates these developments seem consistent with the expectations theory of interest rates which suggests that longterm interest rates are determined by combination of todays shortterm interest rates and investors perception of future shortterm rates longterm deficits would therefore have greater effect on interest rates than temporary deficit shortterm rates may also offer misleading evidence since they are so heavily influenced by the fed which targets overnight interest rates gale and orszag also examined the effects of budget deficit on interest rates in 10 leading macroeconomic forecasting models including the models of dri macroeconomic advisers cbo and the federal reserve in all 10 models budget deficit equal to 1 of gdp would increase interest rates with range of 01 to 10 mean052 percentage points after one year and 005 to 20 mean099 percentage points after 10 years it is striking that all forecasters with reputational and profit motives to produce the most accurate results use models in which deficits increase interest rates g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g156g561 any explanation of the budget deficitinterest rate relationship must first come to grips with an indisputable fact budget deficits are financed through the use of real resources when the government borrows from the public to finance public spending or tax cuts the resources must come from somewhere in mainstream economic theory the resources come from the nations pool of saving which pushes up interest rates for simple supply and demand reasons this crowds out private investment which was comp eting with government borrowing for the same pool of national saving because less investment leads to smaller economy in the future economists often describe deficits as placing burden on future generations but other theories offer different explanations of where the resources come from that do not involve higher interest rates in the capital mobility view foreigners lend the united states the saving it needs to finance deficit leaving interest rates unaffected but foreign capital can only enter the country through trade deficit leading to decline in the output of us exporting and importcompeting

higher taxes or lower government spending in the future therefore they reduce their consumption and save more today this provides the government with the saving needed to finance its deficit placing upward pressure on interest rates although theoretically compelling the very particular assumptions made in the barroricardo view such as infinite lifespans lead one to question its practicality as an explanation of the real world fundamentally the effect of budget deficits on interest rates is only the proximate question that economists and policymakers wish to answer the ultimate question is where the resources come from to finance deficit and what ramifications the use of those resources have for the nations welfare empirical evidence that budget deficits do not affect interest rates is not evidence that government budget deficits do not impose burde n the capital mobility view and barroricardo view both explain how deficits could have effect on interest rates and yet still impose burden in both views in the capital mobility view they crowd out the trade sector of the economy in the barroricardo view they crowd out current private consumption ironically the conventional view is the only one which suggests that deficits can stimulate aggregate spending in the short run so rising interest rates would be positive sign for policymakers attempting to stimulate the economy that they have succeeded simply comparing changes in budget deficits to ch anges in interest rates is not valid way to determine whether budget deficits affect interest rates because there are many other factors that simultaneously affect interest rates these include the state of the economy the saving behavior of individuals and companies the investment opportunities of business the state of financial markets demographics and the financial relationship between the united states and the rest of the world to determine the effect of budget deficits on interest rates one must hold these other factors constant using statistical methods otherwise the effect of budget deficits on interest rates could be misestimated or even reversed but controlling for other factors requires model that explains how deficit and those other factors affect interest rates thus even those who are skeptical of theoretical explanations are dependent on theoretical models to glean the relationship from the empirical evidence because so many different models of the economy exist the empirical evidence is mixed with some models offering positive evidence about the deficitinterest rate relationship while others offer evidence refuting the relationship some studies are questionable because they make assumptions at odds with the underlying theory eg measuring the relationship of interest rates and debt rather than deficits gale and orszag 2002 argue that more recent evidence tends to find stronger positive relationship between the two with all sixteen of the studies they surveyed finding positive or
