tidball and richard best jr specialist in national defense foreign affairs and national defense division summary the 106th congress is expected to resume an ongoing debate on restricting the export of sophisticated computer encryption systems in the 105th congress strong support for removing encryption export restrictions and allowing us software firms to compete in the world marketplace was balanced by concern that widespread availability of such systems could undercut important law enforcement and intelligence interests encryption legislation passed in the 105th congress the clinton administration relaxed some restrictions on encryption sales based on existing export legislation but opposes the complete lifting of restrictions out of concern that use of highly sophisticated encryption might hinder law enforcement and intelligence collection efforts the views of law enforcement agencies have been forcefully set forth by fbi director louis freeh but less has been said about the implications for the collection of foreign intelligence especially by the national security agency nsa which is responsible for acquiring information from foreign communications although such concerns are necessarily shrouded in secrecy they are likely to have an important influence in the ongoing congressional debate this report will not be updated background encryption and decryption are methods of using cryptography the science of writing and reading messages in code to safeguard the confidentiality of data and communications message that is encrypted is electronically scrambledtranslated by computer according to an equation or algorithm into unreadable text that can only be understood by someone who possesses the key to unscramble it or decrypt it simple encryption systems can be broken by brute forceusing computers to try every possible combination messages encrypted by the stronger systems now becoming available can be broken only after many years of computer time or if there is access to the key to better protect their information businesses and consumers want the stronger computer encryption products that have become available in recent years encryption software producers also want the opportunity to sell stronger encryption products competitively in international markets at present restrictions govern the sale or use congressional research service the library of congress crs2 of any encryption product in the united states but pursuant to statutes that govern exports in general successive administrations have placed limits on the sales of strong encryption products abroad recognizing that some sophisticated encryption products are available from foreign firms or are downloadable from the internet the clinton administration has sought to accommodateat least to some extentthe demands of the software industry that export restrictions be lifted or at least modified executive order 13026 of november 15 1996 permits exports of strong encryption systems if producers create and maintain key recovery agents essentially spare keys that can be made available to duly authorized government entities in september 1998 the administration announced an intention to permit the sales of strong encryption products after onetime review to financial institutions insurance companies and to the health and medical 1 sector in some 45 nations many in congress advocate legislation that would remove export regulations with narrow exceptions and allow us firms to take advantage of worldwide demands for encryption products at the same time law enforcement officials are concerned that stronger encryption may serve to protect the communications of those engaged in illegal activity federal state and local authorities conduct approximately 1200 courtordered criminal wiretaps each year2 but law enforcement specialists are faced with growing difficulties in gathering information protected by sophisticated encryption investigators have discovered encrypted communications in minimum of 500 and possibly up to 1000 criminal cases over the past few years and the number of criminal cases is growing at an estimated annual rate of 50100 percent3 according to louis freeh director of the federal bureau of investigation fbi law enforcement remains in unanimous agreement that the widespread use of robust nonrecoverable encryption will ultimately devastate our ability to fight crime and terrorism uncrackable encryption allows and will continue to allow with increasing regularity drug lords terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their criminal intentions with impunity and to maintain electronically stored evidence of the crimes impervious to lawful search and seizure4 1 for further information and analysis

the subcommittee on technology terrorism and government information of the senate judiciary committee director freeh advocated that even encryption systems sold within the united states be required to include key recovery provisions in effect freeh has urged tighter restrictions on the encryption industry even as industry leaders were pressing for relaxation of current regulations freehs views have not however been adopted by the clinton administration crs3 free speech advocates and civil libertarians support the removal of export controls and strongly oppose facilitating government access to private communications any key recovery process they note is only so reliable as the custodians of the keys further they argue that on balance strong encryption serves law enforcement by deterring or preventing such abuses as credit card theft and hostile efforts to tamper with databases it is also pointed out that in some foreign countries humanrights advocates must shield their communications from hostile governments which might be able to obtain key recovery documentation if it exists the role of the national security agency more widespread use of sophisticated encryption systems outside the united states would also have significant implications for national defense and intelligence policymaking and operations in general law enforcement agencies gather and analyze information to support efforts to prosecute illegal activities foreign intelligence agencies gather and analyze information to support national security policymaking diplomacy and military operations extensive overlap exists between the efforts of law enforcement and foreign intelligence agencies especially in such areas as narcotics trafficking and terrorism considerable body of legislation however separates the roles missions and authorities of intelligence agencies from those of the fbi and other law enforcement agencies ongoing efforts of the us government to acquire foreign intelligence through signals intelligence sigint are necessarily kept secret5 there is an extensive historical literature about us sigint efforts during the world war ii era based in part on documents available in the national archives6 the massive cold war sigint effort has been discussed in various journalistic accounts but is not widely appreciated by the public7 in postcold war years officials have been somewhat more forthcoming about the us sigint effort responsible for sigint as well as the protection of official us communications is the national security agency nsa headquartered at fort meade maryland reportedly marylands largest employer8 nsa was created by presidential memorandum on november 1 1952 consolidating separate sigint elements of the military services the director nsa at present army lieutenant general kenneth minihan traditionally has been military officer of flag rank with civilian deputy nsa is part of the defense department but has recognized independent status as collector of 5 see 18 usc 798 6 during world war ii us cryptanalysts had great success in breaking japanese diplomatic and naval codes in discovering plans to attack midway island they contributed to crucial defeat of the japanese fleet many observers believe that us sigint efforts directly contributed to the shortening of the war by at least year 7 see james bamford the puzzle palace report on nsa americas most secret agency boston houghton mifflin 1982 and the series of articles by scott shane and tom bowman such agency baltimore sun december 315 1995 8 shane and bowman december 3 1995 crs4 intelligence relating to both military and nonmilitary topics for the entire federal government along with imagery and reporting by human agents sigint is major source of intelligence and is the most expensive of the intelligence disciplines the senate intelligence committee has noted by collecting and analyzing signals intelligence us intelligence agencies seek to understand the policies intentions and plans of foreign state and nonstate actors signals intelligence plays an important role in the formation of american foreign and defense policy it is also significant factor in us efforts to protect its citizens and soldiers against terrorism the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction narcotics trafficking international crime and other threats to our nations security9 nsa officials have been involved in the preparation of the administrations initiatives on encryption providing technical advice and serving as public spokesmen in testimony prepared for the house national security committee in july 1997 nsas deputy director william p crowell argued that the administrations goal was to create an international framework in which the use of strong encryption will grow specifically he advocated requirement for key recovery capabilities ie keys to encryption systems would be held by third parties such keys would logically be desired by any company concerned about emergency or backup access to its data they would according to the administrations position be available to law enforcement agencies with proper authorization and potentially to intelligence agencies crowell acknowledged the widespread availability of encryption systems from foreign companies or downloadable from the internet but argued that legitimate consumers will seek out the infrastructure support that us firms can best provide few companies would trust an encryption system downloaded from the internet although fbi director freeh has had higher public profile nsa officials have made clear to congress their serious concern about loosening export restrictions on sophisticated encryption systems crowell testified to the house national security committee that the immediate decontrol of strong encryption products would make our signals intelligence mission much more difficult and ultimately result in the loss of intelligence this would greatly complicate our exploitation of foreign targets including military targets10 nsa officials are undoubtedly concerned that widespread use of strong encryption will frustrate their ability to provide sigint regarding foreign entities including terrorist groups operating internationally nsa officials anticipate that american encryption software backed by an extensive infrastructure when marketed is likely to become standard for international commercial communications if arrangements for legal access 9 us congress senate 105th congress 2nd session select committee on intelligence authorizing appropriations for fiscal year

5 crs5 to such communications are not made vast quantities of information of vital importance to the national security will be unavailable this is likely even though some foreign entities will make use of nonus encryption systems nsa officials indicate desire to see us software manufacturers remain competitive in international markets and believe that us systems will remain the standard even with key recovery in place it is often noted that ordinary telephones continue to be used for sensitive communications because they are convenient and reliable even though more secure systems exist legislative proposals although the strength of encryption products sold and used in the us is not regulated pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act and other legislation11 strict limits are imposed on the types of encryption that can be exported legislative proposals have been introduced that would preempt export current regulations for encryption systems and allow the us software industry to market their products worldwide hr 695 introduced by representative goodlatte on february 12 1997 became the focus of interest in the house it would prohibit requirements that exported encryption systems include capabilities to permit recovery by third parties as well as eliminate export controls on generally available commercial encryption except for military enduses or to identified individuals or organizations in specific foreign countries hr 695 with over 245 cosponsors was strongly backed by the software industry it was approved by the judiciary international relations and commerce committees with only minor amendments and had support by some in the house leadership it nonetheless elicited strong opposition not only from law enforcement officials but also from defense and intelligence agencies subsequent to briefings by nsa and other agencies the national security and intelligence committees amended hr 695 in september 1997 to impose by statute restrictions on encryption exports that the original bill was designed to eliminate the national security committee concluded that unrestricted export of capabilities that make it more difficult for the united states to comprehend the plans and activities of hostile military forces could significantly degrade the technological advantage presently held by us combat forces12 the committee proposed an amendment to the legislation that would give the president statutory authority to determine the maximum level of encryption products that could be exported without license with exceptions to be made with the concurrence of the secretary of defense arguing that the original version of hr 695 left our intelligence and intelligence related capabilities at considerable risk13 the intelligence committee went further and 11 the background of this legislation is discussed in glennon j harrison et export administration legislation crs report 96492e august 27 1996 see also jeanne j grimmett

security and freedom through encryption safe act of 1997 house rept 105108 part 4 september 16 1997 p 14 some members also noted that policy built on different regulations for domestic and foreign sales complicates the possibility of crs6 inserted new section 2803 making it unlawful to sell in interstate or foreign commerce any encryption product that does not provide duly authorized persons an immediate decryption capability the intelligence committee stated that it is important to the countrys security interests that the the intelligence community be able to continue to support our policy makers deployed forces and us interests at home and overseas14 in the senate s 909 introduced by senators mccain kerrey and hollings essentially codified existing domestic use and export policies it was strongly opposed by the software industry and was not scheduled for floor consideration s 2067 introduced by senator ashcroft on may 12 1998 would remove encryption export restrictions and establish national electronic technologies center to provide information about sophisticated technological developments to concerned government agencies another bill hr 1903 that would encourage various efforts to enhance the security of communications without addressing the export of encryption systems was passed by the house on september 16 1997 but the senate did not take action on it senate majority leader trent lott strongly advocated modernizing export controls of encryption 15 and in june 1998 house speaker newt gingrich indicated that he would personally chair task force to design plan to ease encryption restrictions16 the 105th congress adjourned however without floor action on encryption bills although the clinton administration has placed emphasis on establishing dialogue between affected agencies and the encryption industry and has further liberalized export regulations in september 1998 agreement is expected to be achieved in the near future as one industry spokesman noted both sides on the outer edges of the debate have enough votes to cancel each other outin congress and even in the administration17 conclusion the governments need for signals intelligence is significant factor in the encryption debate but it is one that cannot for security reasons be fully analyzed in public discourse nsa officials have repeatedly stressed the dangers of widespread use of strong encryption systems by foreign entities they have argued in particular that hr 695 would directly threaten national security although some both in the executive branch and congress are inclined to support the position of the software industry it appears that any consensus will to some extent accommodate nsas concerns effective international cooperation on encryption
