disinvestments have increased substantially in recent years rising from 101billion in 1990 to ove r 237 billion in 1995 private capital has been the fastest growing element the annual net flow of foreign investment grew from 28 billion in 1990 to 128 billion in 1995 while the net flow of commercial lending went from17 billion to 57 billion during this period at the same time the net flow offoreign assistance declined from 57 b illion in 1990 to 53 billion in 1995 the net flow of lending from the multilateral velopment banks mdbs fell from 16 billion to 11 billion during these years most mdb loans are lent on near market repayment terms the higher interest rate s and shorter repayment periods for these loans limit the net flow of resources that they provide many have suggested that private capital can now provide the funds that the developing world needs to finance its deve lopment they say that mdb loans are not needed in the new international envir onment close look at the data suggests that this may not be the case particularly for lowincome countries in 1995 middleincome developing countries received 65 of the total net flow of financial resources going to developing countries they also received nearly 71 of all net private capital going to the developing world lowincome countriesreceived only 35 of the net capital flow and 29 of the net private capital in 1995 most lowincome countries also received very small share of that total in 1995 china received 63 of all net funds going to lowincome countries and indiareceived an additional 4 of that total indias share would have been much higher except that it suffered massive outflow the inflow of new bilateral loans having fallen off from bilateral lending they so got most of the private capital china received 82 of the foreign investment and 91 of the commercial loans going to lowincome countries in 1995 india receive d 6 of the net foreign investment and 12 of the commercial loans in 1995 all other lowincome countries received only 57 billion in net foreign investment and 13 billion in commercial loans that year by contrast net mdb loans totaled more than 44 billion in 1995 and bilateral grant aid accounted for more than 16 billion most lowincome countries have beenunsuccessful in attracting foreign capital many of the activities of the mdbs and th bilateral aid agencies are focused on helping lowincome countries improve their attractiveness to foreign investorsand commercial lenders some of the activities funded by the mdbs might be of interest to foreign investors howeve r most of the mdbs loans have gone to finance activities education health social projects national roads reform ofgovernment institutions and economic policy reform that seem unlikely to beprofitable to foreign investor conce ssional mdb loans account for most of the total most poor countries have too little income from foreign trade and are toouncreditworthy to borrow much more th an they do presently from commercial lenders most lowincome countries will have few alternatives if the mdbconcessional loan programs shrink in the future and their access to such mdbassistance declineshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881contents introduction 1 the flow of resources to developing countries 2 flows to all developing countries 2 closer look at the data 3 middleincome countries 3 f l w

introduction the world bank estimates that the total net flow of resources to developing countries in 1996 totaled almost 285 billi on 48 billion increase over the total for 1995 it also estimates that the net flow of foreign investment both direct and portfolio increased by 20 between 1995 and 1996 while the net flow of officiallending bilateral and multilateral fell by over 50 lending from multilateraldevelopment banks comprised less than 5 of the total net flow in 1995 somesuggest that the mdbs need to change the focus of their operations in order to magnify and not supplant the effect of privat capital flows many also say that the large flow of private funds shows th at these can now be relied on finance development activities and there is less need for multilateral lending others arguethat there is still need for traditional md b lending and that the mdbs have already changed the focus of many of their operations this memorandum discusses the current pa ttern of financial flows to developing countries it finds that th mdbs now play an increasingly modest and specialized role in most middleincome developing countries however most lowincome countries have difficulty attracting private capital and the mdbs still play animportant role in their economies other factors such as appropriate economicpolicies and pol itical stability so play key role facilitating and promoting economic development many analysts argue however that foreign loans and grants and other kinds of foreign capital are still very important if the flow of foreigninvestment remains limited and marketrate ans continue to be too expensive most poor countries will still need continued access to mdb concessional loans stepsmight be taken to possibly increase the flow of private funds to lowincomecountries nevertheless the poor countries would probably be unable able tosubstitute foreign investment and marketra loans for their current access to mdb concessional loans if the latter became less available this paper does not address the question whether current us contribution levels are appropriate too low or too high or whether membership in the mdbsserves the national interests of major stockholders such as the united stateslikewise it does not address the questi on whether the mdbs loans would be more effective if the banks organizational bur eaucracy and their operational procedures were reformed the focus of this paper is solely on the question whether it is likely that private capital flows might substitute for mdb lending if the multilateral bankshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs2 1the data shown here were derived from the 1997 issue of the world banks annual publication now called global development finance through 1996 it was called the world debt tables the electronic version of this document the socioeconomic timeseries access and retrieval system stars was used in the preparation of this study uponrequest copy of the tables constructed from the stars data can be supplied showing the numbers that were used to generate the four area graphs and two pie charts displayed in this report 2net flow is the total inflow of funds inv estments grants and loans minus the total outflow of funds from these same sources the figures include movements of principal onlyinterest payments on commercial loans and the repatriation of profits from foreign investments are not included in the totals 3foreign direct investments are those where the foreign investor owns at least majority of the stock and has operational contro l portfolio investments are those where the foreign investor owns shares of foreign firm without having control figure 1 net flow of resources to developing countries 197595funding levels were reduced in size this paper concentrates on the period through 1995 as the figures for 1996 are preliminary estimates1 the flow of resources to developing countries flows to all developing countries the flow of foreign resources to deve loping countries has grown substantially in recent years according to world bank statistics the total net flow increased from 101 billion in 1990 to over 237 billion in 19952 foreign investment is the fastest growing part of this flow fi gure 1 shows that the net annual inflow of foreign direct investment grew fr om 25 billion in 1990 to 96 billion in 1995 portfolio investment likewise increased from 3 billion to over 32 billion3 the net flow of commercial loans grew from 17 billion in 1990 to nearly 57 billion in1995httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs3 figure 2 net flow of resources to middleincome developing countriesduring this same period the net flow of official assistance to developing countries declined the flow of grant ai d increased slightly from 29 billion in 1990 to nearly 33 billion in 1995 the net flow of bilateral lending fell however from nearly 12 billion to 9 billion the net flow of multilateral mainly mdb lendingalso declined from almost 16 billion in 1990 to barely 11 billion in 1995 closer look at the data the gross figures may obscure however more than they reveal very different pattern emerges if distincti on is made between lowincome and middle income developing countries the situ ations facing these two groups of countries are very different the 63 lowincome countries included in this analysis have anaverage per capita gross national product gnp of less than 750 year the 96middleincome countries in this study have an average per capita gnp of 751 to8260 year by comparison the average per capita gnp of the top two countriesin 1995 the united states and swit zerland were 26980 and 25860 respectively middleincome countries flows of private capital most of the money and most of the private capital flows to developing countries have gone to middleincome nations included in the middleincome category are such countries such as argentina botswana costa rica egypt hungary poland russia and tha iland in 1990 middleincome developing countries received about 61 of the net re sources flowing into developing countries five years later in 1995 they received over 65 of the funds as figure 2 indicates foreign investment and commercial loans comprise large and increasing share ofall the foreign funds these countries have received in 1990 funds from private sources accounted for 52 of the net infl ow of funds in 1995 they accounted for more than 84 of the total mdb loans accounted for less than 5 of the total net inflow to middle income countries during these five years private borrowers received over 48 of all longterm loans to middleincome countries as whole middleincome developing countries have been the largest recipients of private funds in 1995 nearly 71 of the net foreign investment and commercial loans going to the developing world went to middleincome countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs4 this is decline from the 90 level seen in 1990 in recent years china india and few other countries have experienced substantial major increase in their receipts from foreign investment and commercial loans this is discussed below growth and savings rates in these countries this inflow of private funds is not necessarily related to the middlein come countries current economic situation as group between 1990 and 1995 middleinco countries had an annual gross domestic savings rate of about 25 by comparison the rate for the united stateswas 15 in east asia and the pacific the rate was about 38 while in latinamerica it was half that level on the other hand the middleincome countries grew as whole at an average annual rate of only 01 between 1990 and 1995east asia grew by 103 annually however while latin america increased by 32 and the middle east expanded by 23 ea stern europe and the former soviet union region that has received considerable amount of foreign investment inrecent years saw its economy shrink by 65 annually during these years flows of foreign aid before 1989 most middleincome countries received little or grant foreign aid since the collapse of communism in eastern europeand the former soviet union however significant flow of grant aid to those countries has occurred however middlec ountries received few bilateral aid loans in dollar terms middleincome developing countries receive much more in the way of new loans from the mdbs than do lowincome countries however mostof these loans have come from the banks near marketrate loan windows such as the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd their higher interest charges and shorter repayment periods limit the net transfer of resources tothe borrowers between 1991 and 1995 such loans accounted for about 76 of all mdb lending to middleincome countries the concessional loans went mainly to countries in special circumstances or to lowermiddle income countries whose percapita incomes are only little higher than those of the lowincome group lowincome countries total flows much less money has gone to lowincome countries even though their combined population 32 billion is twice as large as that of the middle income group during the period 1991 to 1995 the poor countries received about37 of all net resources flowing to all developing countries in 1990 they got 39 of the total while their share fell to 35 in 1995 private capital flows they also received 30 of the net private resources foreign investment and commercial loans going to developing countries during this five year period in 1990 they got 10 of the total while in 1995 their share was about 29 as group lowincome countries now receive significant share oftheir net funds from abroad in the form of private capital as figure 3 indicates next page foreign investment and commercial loans accounted for 65 of the aggregate net inflow in 1995 while foreign aid gran ts represented 21 and mdb loans about 9 of the total bilateral aid loans accounted for only about 5 of the total governments have been the principa l borrowers between 1991 and 1995 only about 6 of the net disbursements for longterm loans went to private borrowers httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs5 4though india and china are both lowincome countries that have had some success attracting inflows of foreign investment there are significant differences in their relativelevels of development chinas per capita inco level is approximately twice that of india for example and industry comprises much larger share of its economic output comparedto its annual import bill chinas foreign ex change reserves are more than double those of india indias infant mortality rate is twice that of china yet india has twice as manydoctors and twice as many hosp ital beds per capita see comparing countries levels of development crs report 97759 f august 7 1997 figure 3 net flow of resource to all developing countries 197595 china and india these overall figures on fi nancial flows to lowincome countries are significantly skewed by the preponderance of two countries china and india4 in 1994 china received over 56 of ll net resources flowing to lowincome countries in 1995 it received 63 of the tota l india received about 9 of the total flow in 1994 and 4 in 1995 indias share for 1995 would have considerablyhigher this last year except that its ne t receipts from mdb lending fell and the net flow of bilateral lending was sharply ne gative 125 billion figure equivalent to 38 of its net receipt of foreign funds the two countries have also been relatively successful in attracting private capital in 1994 and 1995 foreign inve stment accounted for 79 and 74 respectively of the net funds china received from abroad commercial loanscomprised another 14 and 11 respectively of the total meanwhile for india in 1994 and 1995 foreign investment accounted for 67 and 85 respectively of its net capital receipts commercial loans comp rised another 13 and 24 of the total the total can exceed 100 because as noted the net flow in 1995 for bilateral loans was large and negative flows of private funds excluding china and india very different pattern emerges if china and india are subtracted from the total for one thing asfigure 4 shows below the total net flow of resources is smaller about 33 million in 1994 and 28 million in 1995 the populati on of these 61 lowincome countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs6 figure 4 net flow of resources to lowincome countries excluding china and indiamost of them located in subsaharan africa or south asia is about equal to that of the middleincome group for another thing these countries had proportionallymuch less access to private sector funds in 1995 they received net 57 billion in foreign direct and portfolio investment about 4 of the net foreign investment inflow to developing countries they so received net 13 billion in commercial loans about 2 of the overall total the inflow of major amounts of portfolio investment and commercial lending began in 1994 overall flow of funds excluding china and india foreign aid grants are the most important source of foreign funds for this group of lowincome countries in 1995 grants accounted for more than 57 of the total net flow of resources they received net mdb loans comprised another 16 while bilateral aid loans wereabout 2 of the total foreign direct investment and portfolio investment accounted for about 20 of the net financial receipts of these countries while commercial loans comprised little less than 5 of the total between 1991 and 1995 over 93 of the ne t disbursements of new mdb aid to this group of lowincome countries was provided on concessional terms the world banks international development association ida accounted for most ofthe concessional loans most donor countries now provide their bilateral foreign aidto lowincome countries in the form of grants rather than loans growth and savings rates if china and india are included in the total the growth rate for the lowincome countries has been impressive averaging 68 yearbetween 1990 and 1995 if they are removed from the group however the growthrate for the lowincome countries was about 18 annually for this period growthrates in south asia including india av eraged about 46 annually while those for subsaharan africa were 14 the gross domestic savings rate for the lowincome countries without china and india was about 10 annually httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs7 5many observers believe the mdbs have not moved fast enough to institute reforms in their organizational structure and their opera tional procedures some argue that cuts in us contribution levels will catch the banks attention and encourage them to be more attentive to the need for reform about 75 of the mdbs annual lending is provided by their near marketrate loan facilities using funds the mdbs borrow themselves while about 75 of their member countries annual contributions to fund the banks concessional loanprograms some analysts believe that cutb acks in the donors contributions to the mdb concessional loan facilities may not be painful enough to induce the banks to adopt reforms in addition funds for aid to poor countries w ould be cut but reduction would likely occur in the amounts of money available for loans to middleincome countries debt arrears many lowincome countries have had difficulty keeping up their foreign debt payments between 1991 and 1995 the total arrears for principal and interest on their longterm debt increased by 466 billion more than doubling the total threequarters of their arr ears are owed to official creditors mainly bilateral lenders concern about repayment or blocked repatriation of profits isalmost certainly reason why the private sector has been reluctant to put muchmoney into these lowincome countries china and india have had arrears formany years between 1991 and 1995 middleincome countries reduced their arrearsby 54 billion more than half 52 of th eir arrears are owed to private lenders arrears due to the multilateral banks from all borrowers totaled 26 billion in mid 1996 most of this was attributable to few countries lowincome countriesaccounted for about 833 million yugoslavia accounted for nearly half the totalarrears due to mdbs multilateral banks and developing countries there have been discussions in congre ss in other countries and elsewhere about possible reductions in the size of th donor countries contributions to mdb concessional loan programs such as the ida and the asian development fund this is feasible if the goal is principally re duction in government expenditures it may not be effective however if the goal is one of encouraging the mdbs to adopt reforms that they have avoided previously5 similarly it seems unlikely that cuts in donor country payments to the multilatera l banks will lead to more growth and larger flows of private capital to developing countries the mdb concessional loan programs mu st receive annual contributions from their donor country governments in order to continue operations the multilateralbanks near marketrate loan programs are mainly funded with money the banksborrow in world capital markets in most cases their capital base is sufficient forthem to continue their current levels of lending indefinitely the question arises whether developing countries have realistic alternatives if the size of the mdb loan programs diminish in future years two alternative sources of capital have been proposed more commercial lending and expandedflows of foreign private investmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs8 substitute commercial loans for mdb loans foreign aid accounts for about 16 of th net financial resources that middle income countries receive from abroad mdb loans account for between quarter and third of this aid as whole ddleincome countries would not be injured if the mdb concessional loan programs were terminated or reduced in size most of them borrow little or nothing from t hose facilities many of the activities currently funded with mdb near marketrate loans could be financed with commercial loans though the higher cost of these loans may limit th amount countries can afford to borrow mdb near marketrate loans typically cost onehalf percent or so more than the average rate the mdbs pay to borrow f unds in world commercial capital markets lowincome countries on the other hand would probably be unable to replace their current flow of mdb concessional ans with higher cost loans in 1995 foreign aid to the group excluding china and india accounted for about 75 of thenet financial assets they received from ab road almost all of it was on concessional terms mdb loans accounted for about fifth of that total most of these countries are too poor and their creditworthinessis too weak for them to borrow much from the mdb near marketrate loan facilities or from commercial lenders replace them with foreign investment figures 5 and 6 show the sectoral di stribution of ibrd and ida lending in 1996 altogether loans in the areas of finance and industry and the construction ofeconomic infrastructure accounted for about 477 of ibrd lending and 183 of ida lending in 1996 some of these projects might be of interest to foreign investors particularly some of the projects designe d to create new electric power capacity closer look suggests however that many will not be attractive most mdb finance projects seek to help countries develop new budget or pe nsion procedures or to reorganize their domestic financial systems improvements in the relevanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs9 agencies and the adoption of more effective policies and procedures were generally the main focus of the loans institution bu ilding and policy reform were likewise the main focus of mdb loans in the areas of industry and mining some mdbtransportation loans may fund bridges or highways where the revenue yield mightbe sufficient to interest foreign i nvestor most however are designed to rehabilitate or build national road networ ks or to reorganize and strengthen the agencies responsible for the maintenance and management of national transportsystems many of the other activities financed by the mdbs are not likely to be of much interest to foreign investors projects in the social sectors for example basiceducation and basic health may offer substantial longterm benefits for society butit is difficult to see how they could genera much revenue for private investor likewise projects in the area of public sect or management administrative and civil service reform reorganization of government agencies and the adoption of newpolicies and procedures may improve the efficiency and effectiveness ofgovernment this may help encourage mo re privatization and it may help improve the overall productivity of the economy it is difficult to imagine how foreigninvestor could generate profit however through investment in public sectorreform the same point could be made regarding mdb loans for urban development for the construction of water and sewerage systems in impoverishedareas for structural adjustment and fundamental economic policy reform or foragricultural projects targeted to help lowincome rural residents few alternatives for lowincome countries worldwide the total level of bilatera l development aid has been declining nevertheless if donor countries were willi ng to expand their bilateral aid programs they might pick up the cost of some of the programs the mdbs have been funding in that case however the budgetary savings from reductions in the size of the mdb program would be limited most bilateral foreign aid agencies do not have thecapacity or experience to undertake these programs and some will not be willing to invest the time and money needed for th eir acquisition many lowincome countries will be unable to borrow more from comme rcial lenders and they may have trouble finding organizations with the requisite skills to help them if they want to continuefunding these programs on their own most likely particularly for lowincomecountries many of the activities now finan ced by the mdbs would not be sustained if the multilateral banks reduce the future size of their operations lowincome countries might be able to attract more foreign investment if they adopt economic policy reforms and they create an environment more attractive toforeign investors the public mood in many countries may not be such that policy of open acquiescence to the concerns of fore ign investors can be adopted most low income countries have small domestic markets and are not likely to attract manyinvestors interested in procuring local sale s similarly in many countries the roads railways airport and port facilities may not be sufficient for investors orientedtowards production for export the local telecommunications system may beinadequate for the needs of firms that re quire close continuous contact with other countries the local workforce may not be sufficiently productive due to lack ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97881crs10 education and poor health many countries also lack the legal and policy framework necessary for the operation of modern market system they may not have adequate rules and institutions to both protect and regulate private commerce in many cases the multilateral banks current loan programs in poor countries aim at remedying exactly these situations the issues are often complex and time consuming the united states and other donors might want assurances that theresolution of these problems is among the banks top priorities for lowincomecountries however reduction in the net flow of mdb assistance to these countriesis not likely to encourage the countries or the mdbs to accelerate their activity on this front often political consensus must be achieved to overcome domesticopposition in the recipient country to desired changes without affordableassistance from the mdbs or comparable ssistance from other foreign aid agencies the governments in many lowincome c ountries may have difficulty building domestic support for economic reform and marketoriented economic policies inthe absence of such reforms it seems unlikely that major inflows of foreign investment or commercial credit would be available to them
