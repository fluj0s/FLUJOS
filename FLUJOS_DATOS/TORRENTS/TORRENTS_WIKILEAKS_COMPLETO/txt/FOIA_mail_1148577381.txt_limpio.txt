from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re expert review comments on ar4 date thu 25 may 2006 131621 0400 replyto mannpsuedu xflowed hi keith here is the submitted comment by tapio schneider attached please do not pass along or show to others thanks in advance mike keith briffa wrote hi mike thanks for these comments and especially thanks for your remarks on the effort of trying to produce balanced picture of the current state of things in the ipcc chapter 6 in fact i know that it is already out of date and i am going to get particularly lambasted for not discussing problems with recent tree responses to warming and potential problems wit co2 fertilization i may have to add even more text yet you are absolutely correct that we had unreasonable trouble from susan who was not as hands off as she might have been i will certainly study your comments carefully as i always do i would rather reserve comment on the crowley reconstruction til i speak personally to you i really hope that we can get an atmosphere of constructive discussion that i believe must include some discussion of the sceptics look forward to those drinks and some time away from the mad house of teachingexam marking etc see you soon best wishes keith at 1808 24052006 you wrote hi keith i wanted you to have an advance copy of the comments ill be submitting on the final draft of the ar4 i commend you for the excellent work youve done and the tough battle i know you have had to fight i dont envy it and you know the tough battles ive been through confidentially i do have number of specific concerns mostly in the area of discussions of where things actually now stand in terms of some of the earlier criticisms i believe that the discussion is still out of date given what has been shown in recent publications including wahl and ammann science also and i dont think this is the only place youre going to hear this from there are deep problems w hegerl et 06 particularly the claims of what tls can do which are egregiously incorrect there is comment in review in nature not but i can promise you by someone who understands the statistical issues involved better than anyone else in our community that is very critical i think its unwise for the tar to uncritically accept the claims made particularly given that the actual j climate paper was in limbo at least at the time the most recent draft was finalized i believe that disqualifies it for consideration for ar4 also i think it is an absolute travesty that figure 610 isnt being shown in the spm i think that is unforgiveable and there should be an effort to override that decision i would suspect that is susan solomons doing i hope we can discuss these things and much else over few beers in switzerland looking forward to seeing you soon mike michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone 814 8634075 503 walker building fax 814 8653663 the pennsylvania state university email mailtomannpsuedumannpsuedu university park pa 168025013 httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtmhttpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa michael mann associate professor director earth system science center essc department of meteorology phone 814 8634075 503 walker building fax 814 8653663 the pennsylvania state university email mannpsuedu university park pa 168025013 httpwwwmetpsuedudeptfacultymannhtm xflowed attachment converted ceudoraattachhegerl06_commentpdf
