poverty since the development of plan colombia in 1999 the colombian government with substantial us support has stepped up its counternarcotics and security efforts congress has provided more than 6 billion to support colombia from fy2000 through fy2008 proponents of the current us policy towards colombia point to the inroads that have been made in improving security conditions and in weakening the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc guerrillas critics argue that despite these security improvements us policy has not rigorously promoted human rights provided for sustainable economic alternatives for drug crop farmers or reduced the amount of drugs available in the united states president alvaro uribe reelected in may 2006 has made headway in addressing colombias 40 year plus conflict with the countrys leftist guerrillas as well as the rightist paramilitary groups that have been active since the 1980s uribe enjoys wide popular support which has not been significantly affected by an ongoing scandal concerning past government ties to illegal paramilitary groups uribes popularity soared after colombias march 2008 raid of farc camp in ecuador resulted in the killing of top guerrilla commander and the seizure of his computer files it spiked again following the colombian militarys successful july 2 2008 rescue of 15 hostages long held by the farc those hostages included three us defense contractors and former colombian presidential candidate while some colombians are calling for president uribe to seek third presidential term others have been disillusioned

lived in poverty down from close to 60 in 20002 colombias ability to reduce poverty in recent years is at least partly due to increases in the countrys economic growth rates which reached 75 in 20073 security improvements and more stable economy have likely led to the recent increase in foreign direct investment fdi fdi grew from roughly 65 bill ion in 2006 to some 9 billion in 2007 with the bulk of new investments occurring in the oil manufacturing and mining sectors despite the colombian governments success in reducing poverty levels income inequality and land concentration are still significant problems 4 drug trafficking has helped to perpetuate colombia s conflict by providing earnings to both left and rightwing armed groups the two main leftist guerrilla groups are the farc and the national liberation army eln both of which have kidnapped individuals for ransoms committed serious human rights violations and carried out terrorist activities most of the rightist paramilitary groups were coordinated by the united selfdefense forces of colombia auc which disbanded in 2006 after more than 30000 of its members demobilized members of the auc have been accused of gross human rights abuses and collusion with the colombian armed forces in their fight against the farc and eln colombia is democratic nation with bicameral legislature the liberal and conservative parties which dominated colombian politics from the 19 th century through much of the 20th century have been weakened by their perceived inability to resolve the roots of violence in colombia in 2002 colombians elected an independent alvaro uribe as president largely because of his aggressive plan to reduce violence in colombia the major political parties currently represented in the colombian congress include the liberal conservative alternative democratic pole national unity and radical change parties as well as several smaller political movements to some observers the legitimacy of the colombian congress has been seriously called into question because more than 70 of its 268 members many from prouribe parties have either been jailed or placed under investigation for alleged ties to illegal paramilitary groups 5 2 these statistics are taken from the colombia national planning department as cited by the us department of state see us department of state charting colombias progress

campaign promises to address the paramilitary problem defeat leftist guerrilla insurgents and combat narcotics trafficking6 president uribe took hardline approach to negotiations with illegally armed groups declaring that the government would only negotiate with those groups who are willing to give up terrorism and agree to ceasefire including paramilitary groups with which former president pastrana had refused to negotiate negotiations with the auc paramilitaries resulted in july 15 2003 agreement in which the auc agreed to demobilize its members by the end of 2005 president uribe endorsed controversial justice and peace law that was designed to provide framework for those demobilizations at the same time uribe sought to build up the size and strength of the colombian military and police whose forces stepped up their counternarcotics operations and activities against the farc high public approval ratings likely due to reductions in violence that had occurred largely as result of his security policies prompted colombia to amend its constitution in 2005 to permit uribe to run for reelection

prouribe parties won majority of both houses of congress in elections held in march 2006 giving president uribe strong mandate as he started his second term the domination of prouribe parties most of them new appears to have further weakened the traditionally dominant liberal and conservative parties nevertheless there is not high level of unity among the prouribe parties entering the third year of his second presidential term president uribe retains widespread support in colombia his popularity derives from the progress his government has made in improving security situation in colombia demobilizing the auc and defeating the farc and eln according to us state department figures kidnappings in colombia have declined by 83 homicides by 40 and terrorist attacks by 76 since uribe first took office in 2002 police are now present in all of colombias 1099 municipalities including areas from which they had been previously ousted by guerrilla groups 7 president uribe has also overseen the demobilization and disarmament of more than 31000 auc paramilitaries although the demobilization process has been criticized for failing to provide adequate punishments for perpetrators and reparations to victims of paramilitary violence8 on march 1 2008 the colombian military successfully carried out raid of farc camp in ecuador that resulted in the killing of top farc leader and the capture of his computer files this was followed by successful operation on july 2 that resulted in the rescue of 15 hostages long held by the farc including three us defense contractors and former

activities9 not all paramilitaries demobilized and still others have returned to paramilitary activities since demobilizing one of the weaknesses of the demobilization program has been reintegration of demobilized forces into lawabiding civilian life10 moreover there are credible reports that new generation of paramilitaries is forming that is much more criminal than political in nature11 an estimated 9000 new fighters have formed and as many as 15 to 20 of the new paramilitary groups may consist of former combatants 12 although president uribe has not been personally implicated the colombian supreme court is pursuing ongoing investigations into possible links between colombian politicians many from prouribe parties and paramilitary groups ongoing peace talks with the eln have yet to yield any tangible results since the 2006 elections there have several scandals involving some colombian military officials and lingering concerns exist about extrajudicial killings committed by colombian security forces 13 the latest scandal occurred in october when 27 soldiers and military officers including three generals were fired over the discovery of eleven murdered civilians who had been dressed as guerilla fighters to increase military body counts as result general mario montoya the commander of the colombian army stepped down on november 4 2008 drug production and

paramilitary demobilization process president uribe introduced justice and peace law granting conditional amnesties to illegal combatants which would mean that the law could also apply to farc and eln fighters if they decide to enter into negotiations with the government colombias congress approved the legislation in 2005 the justice and peace law called on demobilized fighters to provide voluntary account of their crime and to forfeit illegally acquired assets in exchange for an alternative penalty of up to eight years imprisonment if the accused was subsequently found to have intentionally failed to admit to crime the alternative penalty could be revoked and the full sentence imposed critics contended that the penalties provided for in the law were too lenient and amount to impunity the uribe administration argued that without the inducement of the new law paramilitary leaders and fighters would be unwilling to demobilize and spiral of violence would continue in colombia in july 2006 colombias constitutional court upheld the constitutionality of the law in the same ruling however the constitutional court limited the scope under which demobilizing paramilitaries can benefit from the reduced sentences paramilitaries who commit crimes or fail to fully comply with the law will have to serve full sentences the ruling also stipulates that paramilitaries must confess all crimes and make reparations to victims using both their legally and illegally obtained assets paramilitary leaders reacted by stating that they would not comply with the law in response president uribe ordered paramilitary leaders to turn themselves in by october 2006 all but 11 paramilitary leaders had complied with this order 42 the merits of the justice and peace law have been fiercely debated both in colombia and the united states supporters believe it is an effective means to end paramilitary activities the bush administration has expressed support for the law noting that it has facilitated the demobilization of more than 31000 paramilitary members supporters of the law maintain that paramilitaries must act in good faith and avoid further participation in illegal activities in order to benefit from the peace process the uribe administration has removed some demobilized paramilitaries including carlos mario macaco jiménez from the justice and peace process due to their continued participation in illegal activities in may 2008 uribe extradited jiménez salvatore mancuso and 13 other paramilitary leaders who had violated the terms of the law to the united states where to stand

institutions and the persistence of armed conflict and threatening presence of new illegal armed groups 43 human rights organizations are also concerned that the paramilitaries have not been held accountable for their illegal activities and that by under reporting illegally obtained assets have failed to provide adequate reparation to their victims44 other observers have expressed concerns

eligible to receive benefits under the justice and peace laws framework in response to concerns that the justice and peace unit tasked with investigating and prosecuting the paramilitaries was

measure indicating decreased availability deas acting administrator michele leonhart credited the changes in price and purity to regional counternarcotics efforts including us funded programs in colombia63 the national drug threat assessment 2009 published in december 2008 found decline in cocaine availability in the united states that may have been responsible for price increases and purity declines while the report states the leading cause of the decrease in domestic availability is unclear the likely factors include the exceptionally large drug seizures made while the drugs are in transit to the united states the crackdown in enforcement by the mexican government intercartel violence in mexico us law enforcement efforts along the southwest border and expanding markets in europe and south america 64 some observers have expressed caution in interpreting government figures on price purity and availability they maintain that shortterm fluctuations are not uncommon and may not be sustainable65 still others express caution because cocaine production levels have not fallen another possible explanation for the declining cocain supply in the united states is that cocaine is being diverted to europe where drug traffickers can earn more money presumably because of the strong euro66

had only partially fulfilled its drug reduction goals in the years 20002006 coca cultivation and production of cocaine had actually increased by about 15 and 4 respectively the report concludes that while significant security gains were achieved by the colombian government with us assistance coca farmers had undermined eradication goals by taking effective countermeasures and alternative development programs had not been implemented in the areas where the majority of coca is grown 73 moreover the report criticized the nationalization of plan colombia programsthe transfer of usadministered programs to the colombiansas too slow and lacking coordination74 proponents of the current us policy towards colombia point to the progress that has been made in improving security conditions in colombia and in weakening the farc guerrillas they favor maintaining the current level of security assist ance to colombia in order to help colombian security forces continue to combat the farc and eln solidify their control throughout rural areas and eradicate illicit narcotics they also believe that guerrilla forces regularly cross borders using neighboring countries territory for refuge and supplies and that this has potentially destabilizing effect in the region opponents of current us policy in colombia respond that the counterdrug program uses repressive approach to curbing drug production which could provoke negative popular reaction in rural areas they argue for halting aerial fumigation of drug crops limiting aid to the colombian military and stressing interdiction rather than eradication so that the direct costs to peasant producers is less some critics of us policy support policy that focuses largely on economic and social aid to combat what they consider to be the conflicts root causes curbs human rights abuses by paramilitary groups and security forces provides vigorous support for negotiated end to the fighting and emphasizes illicit drug demand

than 280000 jobs have been created84 the success of alternative development in colombia has been limited both by security concerns and the limited scope of the program various reports including the

where the majority of coca is grown in colombia and they have not been evaluated with regard to drug reduction goals or sustainability security concer ns were blamed for the planned withdrawal of usaid assistance to five departments where co ca production was increasing according to usaid memo leaked to the press in october 2006 unodc reported in june 2006 that alternative development programs have been successful but only reach 9 of colombian coca growers and called for tenfold increase in international donor support for alternative development programs in 2007 unodc reported disparity in

intentions to begin negotiating an andean region free trade agreement fta with colombia peru ecuador and bolivia in its announcement the administration asserted that an fta would reduce and eliminate barriers to trade and investment support democracy and fight drug activity after regional talks broke down the united states pursued bilateral trade agreements with colombia and peru the united states and colombia signed the uscolombia trade promotion agreement on november 22 2006 now called the uscolombia free trade agreement cfta th agreement must now be ratified by both nations congresses colombia bolivia ecuador and peru currently benefit from the andean trade preference act atpa 90 on october 16 2008 the 110th congress enacted legislation to extend tpa trade preferences until december 31 2009 for colombia and peru and until june 30 2009 for bolivia and ecuador pl 110436 91 the tpa authorizes the president to grant dutyfree treatment to certain products with more than half of all us imports in 2004 from the andean countries entering under these preferences critics of the free trade agreement are concerned about the status of labor rights in colombia and the ongoing parapolitical scandal critics argue that violence against labor activists in colombia is excessive and inadequately addressed by the uribe government labor activist killings declined under president uribe but increased in 2006 data on the number of labor leaders murdered in any given year vary widely by source in 2002 the colombian government estimated that 99 labor activists were killed while the national labor school ens colombian ngo estimated that 178 labor activists were killed in 2006 the colombian government estimated that 60 labor activists were killed while ens estimated that 72 labor activists were killed in 2007 both groups reported drop with the colombian government reporting 26 labor activists killed and ens estimating 39 labor activists according to the us state department 92 one reason for the discrepancy is that the colombian government counts deaths of unionized teachers separately from other labor union deaths another area of concern is whether labor activists were killed because of their union activity very few investigations have been completed more than 2000 killings between 1991 and 2006 remain unsolved of the 470 union murders that have occurred since president uribe first took office in 2002 97 remain unsolved in january 2007 the colombian attorney generals office set up unit of 13 prosecutors and 78 investigators to investigate 200 priority cases in 2007 36 people were convicted on charges related to the murder of union members more convictions than in 2004 through 2006 combined 93 as of october 20 2008 total of 147 convictions were made 89 see crs report rl34470 uscolombia free trad agreement economic and political implications by m angeles villarreal 90 see crs report rs22548 atpa renewal background and issues by m angeles villarreal 91 ibid 92 us department of state charting colombias progress november 5 2008 another possible reason for the decline in murders is the overall declin in labor union membership in colombia

stipulated that congress must vote on that implementing legislation within 90 legislative days of its introduction but on april 10 2008 the house voted 224195 in favor of changing those procedures effectively putting congressional consideration of the uscolombia free trade agreement on hold it is unclear whether and how the 111 th congress will consider implementing legislation for the pending cfta in the future it could be considered pursuant to the usual rules or the house could restore tpalike fast track procedures95 the likelihood of reintroduction and passage of the cfta under the new obama administration is also unclear during his campaign presidentelect obama favored delaying consideration of the trade agreement in order to pressure the colombian government to further reduce labor violence96 given these misgivings some predict the obama administration will not support moving the legislation any time soon97 other analysts believe that president obama may push for approval of the trade agreement with stronger human rights provisions98 94 embassy of colombia from the colombian embassy lette r to the honorable george miller november 5 2008 attachment 5 p 4 95 for more
