legislative proposals to restrict the availability of firearms to the public have raised the following questions what restrictions on firearms are permissible under the constitution does gun control constitute crime control can the nations rates of homicide robbery and assault be reduced by the stricter regulation of firearm commerce or ownership would restrictions stop attacks on public figures or thwart deranged persons and terrorists would household street corner and schoolyard disputes be less lethal if firearms were more difficult and expensive to acquire would more restrictive gun control policies have the unintended effect of impairing citizens means of selfdefense in recent years proponents of gun contro l legislation have often held that only federal laws can be effective in the united states otherwise they say states with few restrictions will continue to be sources of guns that flow illegally into more restrictive states they believe that the second amendment to the constitution which states that well regulated militia being necessary to the security of free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed is being misread in todays modern society they argue that the second amendment 1 is now obsolete with the presence of professional police forces 2 was intended solely to guard against suppression of state militias by the central government and therefore restricted in scope by that intent and 3 does not guarantee right that is absolute but one that can be limited by reasonable requirements they ask why in todays modern society private citizen needs any firearm that is not designed primarily for hunting or other recognized sporting purposes proponents of firearm restrictions have advocated policy changes on specific types of firearms or components that they believe are useful primarily for criminal purposes or that pose unusual risks to the public fully automatic firearms ie machine guns and shortbarreled rifles and shotguns have been subject to strict regulation since 1934 fully automatic firearms have been banned from private possession since 1986 except for those lega lly owned and registered with the secretary of the treasury on may 19 1986 more recently saturday night specials loosely defined as inexpensive small handguns assault weapons ammunitionfeeding devices with capacities for more than seven rounds and certain ammunition have been the focus of control efforts opponents of gun control vary in their positions with respect to specific forms of control but generally hold that gun control laws do not accomplish what is intended they argue that it is as difficult to keep weapons from being acquired by highrisk individuals even under federal laws and enforcement as it was intended to stop the sale and use of liquor during prohibition in their view more stringent federal firearm regulatory system would only create problems for lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32842g9g158g151g561g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152 g151g561 g561

gun regulators and possibly threaten citizens civil rights or safety some argue that the low violent crime rates of other countries have nothing to do with gun control maintaining instead that multiple cultural differences are responsible gun control opponents also reject the assumption that the only legitimate purpose of ownership by private citizen is recreational ie hunting and targetshooting they insist on the continuing need of people for effective means to defend person and property and they point to studies that they believe show that gun possession lowers the incidence of crime they say that the law enforcement and criminal justice system in the united states has not demonstrated the ability to furnish an adequate measure of public safety in all settings some opponents believe further that the second amendment includes right to keep arms as defense against potential government tyranny pointing to examples in other countries of the use of firearm restrictions to curb dissent and secure illegitimate government power the debate has been intense to gun control advocates the opposition is out of touch with the times misinterprets the second amendment and is lacking in concern for the problems of crime and violence to gun control opponents advocates are naive in their faith in the power of regulation to solve social problems bent on disa rming the american citizen for ideological or social reasons and moved by irrational hostility to firearms and gun enthusiasts

of the existing sources of statistics provide either comprehensive timely or accurate data with which to definitively assess whether there is causal connection between firearms and violence 2 for

from 1987 to 1992 indicate that in each of those years roughly 62200 victims of violent crime 1 of all victims of such crimes used guns to defend themselves20 another 20000 persons each year used guns to protect property persons in the business of selfprotection police officers armed security guards may have been included in the survey21 another source of information on the use of firearms for selfdefense is the national self defense survey conducted by criminology pr ofessor gary kleck of florida state university in the spring of 1993 citing responses from 4978 households dr kleck estimated that handguns have been used 21 million times per year for selfdefense and that all types of guns have been used approximately 25 million times year for that purpose during the 19881993 period22 why do these numbers vary by such wide margin law enforcement agencies do not collect information on the number of times civilians use firearms to defend themselves or their property against attack such data have been collected in household surveys the contradictory nature of the available statistics may be partially explained by methodological factors that is these and other criminal justice statistics reflect what is reported to have occurred not necessarily the actual number of times certain events occur victims and offenders are sometimes reluctant to be candid with researchers so the number of incidents can only be estimated making it difficult to state with certainty the accuracy of statistics such as the number of times firearms are used in self defense for this and other reasons criminal justice statistics often vary when different methodologies are applied survey research can be limited because it is difficult to produce statistically significant findings from small incident populations for example the sample in the national selfdefense survey might have been too small given the likely low incidence rate and the inherent limitations of survey research

on june 26 2008 the supreme court issued its decision in district of columbia v heller on the constitutionality of dc gun law that banned handguns for 32 years among other things passed by the dc council on june 26 1976 the dc handgun ban required that all firearms within the district be registered all owners be licensed and prohibited the registration of handguns after september 24 1976 in 54 decision the supreme court found the handgun ban to be unconstitutional because it violated an individuals right under the second amendment to possess handgun in his home for lawful purposes such as self defense 42 g6g5g561g5g152g158g151g140g146g149g561g18g138g156g156g142g156g561g7g150g142g155g144g142g151g140g162g561g14g138g160g561 on july 15 2008 the dc council passed temporary emergency law that allows residents to apply for home handgun license that would allow them to keep handgun in their home as long as that firearm has capacity of fewer than 12 rounds of ammunition and is not loadable from magazine in the handgrip which in effect limits legal handguns under the temporary law to revolvers as opposed to semiautomatic pistols the emergency law also continues to require that handguns be kept unloaded or disassembled or trigger locked unless an attack in home is imminent or underway pro gun groups immediately criticized the councils emergency law for not being in the spirit of the supreme c ourts decision because it continued to ban semiautomatic pistols and did not fully roll back the trigger lock requirement

mental defective includes person who is found to be mentally incompetent by the veterans benefit administration vba under veterans law an individual is considered mentally incompetent if he or she lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs for reasons related to injury or disease under 38 cfr 3353 55 in proposed rulemaking the atf opined that the inclusion of

in november 1998 the vba provided the fbi with disqualifying records on 88898 v beneficiaries whom v rating specialists had determined to be mentally incompetent based on medical evidence that they were incapable of managing their own affairs58 thus fiduciary or designated payee was appointed for them during the determination process beneficiaries were notified that the v was proposing to rate them mentally incompetent and they were able to submit evidence to the contrary if they wished59 this determination process is still followed today at the v a60 interestingly enough the veterans medical administration has not submitted any disqualifying records on v beneficiaries to the fbi for inclusion in nics for any medicalpsychiatric reason like ptsd unless those veterans had been involuntarily committed under state court order to v medical facility because they posed danger to themselves or others in those cases the state in which the court resides would submit the disquali fying record to the fbi if such submission would be appropriate and permissible under state law 61 nevertheless the decision by the v to submit vba records on mentally incompetent veterans to the fbi for inclusion in the nics mental defective file generated some degree of controversy in 1999 and 200062 critics of this policy underscored that veterans routinely consented to mentally incompetent determinations so that fiduciary designated payee could be appointed for them those critics contended that to take away veterans second amendment rights without his foreknowledge was improper they also pointed out that other federal agencies were providing similar disqualifying records to the fbi this controversy subsided but it reemerged when congress considered the nics improvement amendments

representative howard coble chair of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security and representative robert scott the subcommittees ranking minority member on april 5 2006 among other things the bill would have amended gun control act provisions governing the suspension and revocation of federal licenses for firearms dealers manufacturers and importers by establishing graduated scale of fines and penalties for administrative violations for serious violations however revocation would have remained an option it would have also barred tf from initiating administrative enforcement actions for violations that are more than five years old except for cases involved the intentional obstruction of discovery of such violations by the licensee proponents for this proposal argue that these provisions would allow federal firearms licensees greater opportunity to address nonsubstantive recordkeeping issues that under current law could have led to the revocation of their licenses opponents argue that relaxing such provisions would weakened tf authority and efforts to reduce the number of kitchen table top dealers who were not substantively engaged in the business and

section 7 of hr 5005 would have eliminated provision that provides for the transfer of multiple handgun sale reports made by gun dealers to the attorney general to state and local law enforcement authorities proponents argue that state and local authorities have mishandled such confidential records and often ignore certain certification requirements set out in the gun control act opponents counter that those reports often lead to illegal gun traffickers and without them vital leads would go undiscovered

from electronically retrieving the records of gun dealers who had gone out of business by name or any personal identification it is notable that outofbusiness records have been converted from paper to digital format at the atf national tracing center proponents argue that such prohibition would protect the privacy of former federal firearms licensees and that the prohibition would not extend to searches of those records by firearms serial number opponents counter that if available those records should be analyzed further to uncover wider patterns of gun trafficking and other illegal activities

representative phil gingrey on march 17 2005 this bill would have amended the gun control act to allow federal firearms licensees to transfer any firearm to outofstate residents as long as those transfers complied with the laws of both states that is the laws of the state in which the licensees business was located and the laws of the state in which the licensees customer resided under current law licensees are permitted to transfer long guns to outofstate residents only if such transfers are made in person facetoface hr 1384 would have allowed federal firearms licensees to transfer handguns to outofstate residents as well in addition hr 1384 would have allowed federal firearms licensees to transfer any firearm to other federal firearms licensees at outofstate gun shows or similar events as long as those transfers complied with the laws of both states under current law federal firearms licensees are permitted to display and take orders for firearms at outofstate gun shows but they must return to their business locations to initiate the subsequent transfers of those firearms proponents argue that this proposal would eliminate federal requirements on shipping such firearms interstate and reduce the risk that such firearms would be stolen during shipment opponents counter that relaxing existing federal re quirements regarding the interstate transfer of handguns could necessitate dualstate background checks in addition in the view of the proposals opponents the relaxation of these requirements could be exploited by illegal firearms traffickers hr 1384 was

retaining the approved records was tantamount to temporary registry on july 11 2000 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia found that nothing in the brady act prohibited the temporary retention of information about lawful firearm transfers for certain audit purposes93 on january 22 2001 doj promulgated final rule that allowed such records to maintained for up to 90 days94 attorney general john ashcroft opposed this rule however and doj proposed another rule that called for the nextday destruction of those files on july 6 2001 95 in july 2002 meanwhile gao reported that under attorney general reno the fbi had conducted non routine searches of the nics audit log for law enforcement agencies to determine whether person whom subsequent information showed was prohibited person had been transferred firearm within the previous 90 days the fbi informed gao that such searches were routinely conducted but were secondary benefit given that the audit log was maintained primarily to check for system accuracy privacy and performance in addition gao reported that the nextday destruction of records would adversely affect other nics operations including firearmretrieval actions nics audit log checks for previous background checks verifications of nics determinations for federal firearms licensees and tf inspections of federal firearms licensees record keeping 96 despite those adverse affects opponents of greater federal gun control viewed the nonroutine use of nics records as beyond the scope of authority given the attorney general under the brady act as described below gao reported that doj took steps to minimize the adverse affects of the nextday destruction of those records but in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks additional issues regarding brady background checks emerged g22g142g155g155g152g155g146g156g157g561g25g138g157g140g145g561g14g146g156g157g561g5g145g142g140g148g156g561 historically terrorist watch list checks

as is the case today to determine such eligibility fbinics examiners check three databa ses maintained by the fbi they include the national crime information center ncic the interstate identification index iii and the nics index the nics index includes disqualifying records on persons 1 dishonorably discharged from the armed forces 2 adjudicated mentally defective or 3 convicted of certain serious immigration violations the iii includes criminal history records for persons arrested and convicted of felonies and misdemeanors the ncic includes law enforcement hot files on fugitives and persons subject to restraining orders among other persons ncic also includes hot file known as the violent gang and terrorist offender file vgtof prior to the 911 attacks this file included limited information on known or suspected terrorists and gang members nics examiners were not informed of vgtof hits as such information was not considered relevant to determining firearms transferpossession

searched approved firearm transaction records in the then nics 90day audit log for 186 illegal alien detainees two were found to have been improperly cleared to be transferred firearms97 upon learning of this practice however then attorney general ashcroft barred the fbi from s earching the nics audit log maintaining that the brady act prohibited the use of nics as an electronic registry of firearms dispositions or owners98 advocates of greater gun control opposed this shift in policy arguing that law enforcement and counterterrorism officials ought to have access to nics records to further ongoing terrorist and criminal investigations as described above however gun rights advocates successfully amended the fy2004 justice appropriations to require the destruction of those records within 24 hours similar requirement was enacted for fy2005 and fy2006 as well it was also been included in the housepassed and senatereported versions of the fy2007 doj appropriations bill hr 5672 in february 2002 doj initiated nics transaction audit to determine whether prohibited aliens noncitizens were being improperly transferred firearms as part of this audit nics procedures were changed so that nics examiners were informed of vgtof hits under homeland security presidential directive 6 moreover the administration initiated broadbased review of the use of watch lists among other terrorist identification and screening mechanisms 99 in september 2003 the fbiadministered terrorist screening center tsc was established and work was begun to improve and merge several watch lists maintained by us government into consolidated terrorist screening database tsdb one of thes watch lists was vgtof as part of those efforts tsdb lookout records from other agency watch lists were downloaded into vgtof growing that file from 10000 to more than 140000 records effective february 2004 the fbi officially changed its nics operating procedures to inform nics examiners of vgtof hits for known and suspected terrorists 100 under the new procedures in nonpoint of cont act nonpoc states nics staff validate terrorismrelated vgtof hits by contacting tsc staff the latter have greater access to identifiers in terrorist files with which known and suspected terrorists can be more positively identified in full and partial poc states the law enforcement officials that conduct firearmsrelated background checks under the brady act contact tsc staff directly in the case of valid hits nics staff delay the transactions for up to three business days and contact the fbi counterterrorism division to allow field agents to check for prohibiting factors if prohibiting factors are uncovered within this threeday period nics staff anonymize the transaction record by deleting the subjects identifying informa tion the firearms dealers may proceed with the transaction at their discretion but fbi counterterrorism officials continue to work the case for up to 90 days if they learn of prohibiting factor within that 90day period they are able to contact the nics unit and deanonymize the transaction record by filling in the subjects identifying fields at the end of 90 days if prohibiting factor

record hits in vgtof of these 44 were found to be valid as noted above however being identified as known or suspected terrorist is not grounds to prohibit person from being transferred firearm under current law as consequence 35 of these transactions were allowed to proceed 6 were denied one was unresolved and 2 were of an unknown status 102 gao recommended that the attorney general should 1 clarify what information generated by the brady background check process could be shared with counterterrorism officials and 2 either more frequently monitor background checks conducted by full and partial poc states that result in terrorismrelated vgtof hits or allow the fbi to handle such cases103 several related pieces of legislation were introduced that are related to nics operations and terrorist watch lists the terrorist apprehension and record retention act of 2005 s 578hr 1225 introduced by senator lautenberg and representative john conyers would have required that the fbi along with appropriate federal and state counterterrorism officials be notified immediately when the nics indicated that pe rson seeking to obtain firearm was known or suspected terrorist furthermore the proposal would have 1 required that the fbi coordinate the response to such occurrences 2 authorized the retention of all related records for at least 10 years and 3 allowed federal and state officials access to such records in addition representative peter king introduced hr 1168 bill that would have required the attorney general to promulgate regulations to preserve records of terrorist and gangrelated record hits during such background checks until they were provided to the fbi representative carolyn mccarthy introduced hr 1195 bill that would have made it unlawful for anyone to transfer firearm to person who was on the fly lists maintained by the transportation security administration in the 110 th congress representative mccarthy has reintroduced this measure hr 1167 also senator lautenberg has introduced bill s 1237 that would authorize the attorney general to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms and explosives licenses to known or suspect terrorists the language of s 1237 reportedly reflects legislative proposal made by the department of justice 104 representative king has introduced an identical measure hr 2074 more recently senator

little sporting hunting or recreational purpose they maintain that these rifles could be used to shoot down aircraft rupture pressurized chemical tanks or penetrate armored personnel carriers gun control opponents counter that these rifles are expensive cumbersome and rarely if ever used in crime furthermore they maintain that these rifles we re first developed for longrange marksmanship competitions and then adopted by the military as sniper rifles the fifty caliber sniper weapons regulation act of 2005 s 935 introduced by senator dianne feinstein would have amended the national firearms act nfa106 to regulate 50 caliber sniper weapons in the same fashion as shortbarreled shotguns and silencers by levying taxes on the manufacture and transfer of such firearms and by requiring owner and firearm registration in the 110th congress senator feinstein has introduced similar measure s 1331 the other proposal introduced by representative james moran the 50 caliber sniper rifle reduction act hr 654 would have also ame nded the nfa to include those weapons but would have also amended the gun control act107 to effectively freeze the population of those weapons legally available to private persons and to prohibit any further transfer of those firearms in other words hr 654 would have grandfathered in existing rifles but would have banned their further transfer consequently the proposal woul d have eventually eliminated those rifles all together from the civilian gun stock it would have been likely that covered 50 caliber rifles would have had to be destroyed or handed over to the atf as contraband when the legal firearm owner died or wanted to give up the firearm hr 654 included compensation provision for rifles destroyed or handed over to the federal government furthermore both proposals s 935 and hr 654 would have defined 50 caliber sniper weapon to mean rifle capable of firing centerfire cartridge in 50 caliber 50 bmg caliber any other variant of 50 caliber or any metric equivalent of such calibers many rifles and even some handguns are chambered to fire 50 caliber ammunition meaning the projectile is about onehalf inch in diameter opponents of this legislation note that this definition was very broad and would have likely covered 50 caliber rifles that would not be considered longrange or sniper rifles the 50 bmg caliber round on the other hand is an exceptionally large cartridge projectile and casing which was once used almost exclusively as heavy machine gun round representative moran also offered an amendment to the fy2006 department of commerce appropriations bill hr 2862 that would have pr ohibited the use of funding provided under that bill to process licenses to export 50 caliber rifles but that amendment was not adopted by the house g7g161g153g146g155g142g141g561g21g142g150g146g138g158g157g152g150g138g157g146g140g561g3g156g156g138g158g149g157g561g25g142g138g153g152g151g156g561g4g138g151g561 in 1994

designed to be fired in fully automatic mode meaning that once the trigger is pulled the weapon continues to fire rapidly until all the rounds in the magazine are expended or the trigger is released often these rifles were also designed with select fire feature that allowed them to be fired in short bursts eg three rounds per pull of the trigger or in semiautomatic mode ie one round per pull of the trigger as well as in fully automatic mode semiautomatic firearms by comparison including semiautomatic assault weapons fire one round per pull of the trigger under current law any firearm including assault weapons that can be fired in fully automatic mode or in multiround bursts is classified as machine gun and must be registered with the federal government under the national firearms act of 1934 furthermore it is illegal to assemble machine gun with legally or illegally obtained parts the population of legally owned machine guns has been frozen since 1986 and they were not covered by the semiautomatic assault weapons ban according to 1997 survey of 203300 state and federal prisoners who had been armed during the commission of the crimes for which they were incarcerated fewer than 1 in 50 or less than 2 used carried or possessed fully automatic or semiautomatic assault weapon 108 the statute classified rifle as semiautomatic assault weapon if it was able to accept detachable magazine and included two or more of the following five characteristics 1 folding or telescoping stock 2 pistol grip 3 bayonet mount 4 muzzle flash suppressor or threaded barrel capable of accepting such suppressor or 5 grenade launcher 109 there were similar definitions for pistols and shotguns that were classified as semiautomatic assault weapons110 semiautomatic assault weapons that were legally owned prior to the ban were not restricted and remained available for transfer under applicable federal and state laws opponents of the ban argue that the statutorily defined characteristics of semiautomatic assault weapon were largely cosmetic and that these weapons were potentially more lethal than other semiautomatic firearms that were designed to accept detachable magazine and were equal or superior in terms of ballistics and other performance characteristics proponents of the ban argue that semiautomatic militarystyle firearms particularly those capable of accepting large capacity ammunition feeding devices had and have place in the civilian gun stock in the 108 th congress proposals were introduced to extend or make permanent the ban whereas other proposals were made to modify the definition of semiautomatic assault weapon to cover greater number of firearms by reducing the number of features that would constitute such firearms and expand the list of certain makes and models of firearms that are statutorily enumerated as banned proposal s 1034 intro duced by senator dianne feinstein would have made the ban permanent as would have proposal hr 2038s 1431 introduced by representative carolyn mccarthy and senator frank lautenberg the latter measure however would have modified the definition and expanded the list of banned weapons senator

specifically federal law regulating firearm transfers however is applicable to such transfers at gun shows federal firearms licenseesthose licensed by the federal government to manufacture import or deal in firearmsare required to conduct background checks on non licensed persons seeking to obtain firearms from them by purchase or exchange conversely non licensed personsthose persons who transfer firearms but who do not meet the statutory test of being engaged in the businessare not required to conduct such checks to some this may appear to be an incongruity in the law why they ask should licensees be required to conduct background checks at gun shows and not non licensees to others opposed to further federal regulation of firearms it may appear to be continuance of the status quo ie noninterference by the federal government into pr ivate firearm transfers within state lines on the other hand those seeking to increase federal regulation of firearms may view the absence of background checks for firearm transfers between non licensedprivate persons as loophole in the law that needs to be closed possible issue for congress is whether federal regulation of firearms should be expanded to include private firearm transfers at gun shows and other similar venues among gun showrelated proposals there are two basic models the first model is based on bill s 443 that was introduced in the 106 th congress by senator lautenberg who successfully offered this proposal as an amendment to the senatepassed violent and repeat juvenile offender act s 254 several members introduced variations of the lautenberg bill in the 107th congress in the 108th congress representative conyersranking minority member of the judiciary committeeintroduced hr 260 which was very similar to the lautenberg bill in addition former senator daschle introduced the justice enhancement and domestic security act of 2003 s 22 which included gun show language that was similar to the lautenberg bill the second model is based on bill s 890 introduced in the 107 th congress by senators mccain and lieberman in the 108th congress senators mccain and reed introduced bill s 1807 which was similar to s 890 in the 108th congress on march 2 2004 the senate passed an amendment offered by senator mccain to the gun industry liability bill s 1805 that would have required background checks
