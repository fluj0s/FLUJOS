feel or do something differently as result were asking people to think differently about climate change and it requires specific techniques the clearer you can be about what you want your audience to do the better for example you might want your audience to understand that climate change is happening now understand why it is happening understand that it affects the uk and the region where they live see the connection between everyday life and climate change or be aware of the need for immediate actionsome advice for new communicators 1213 it is important to be as specific as possible about who you want to communicate with and how youre going to do it understand as much as you can about who your audience is what they value which media they readwatchlisten to and whose opinions they trust once you know your audience then you can ask questions about their attitude to climate change how do they feel about climate change now what do they say about it how willing are they to take action what would it take to change their thinking have others tried to talk to them about it in the past and were they successful have you got the time and money to communicate effectively with them is there something they care passionately about that can be linked to the issue of climate change 1415know who you are talking totiming its important to plan your timing your message might be effective but if your email gets delivered when everyones at the christmas party it wont be read printers advertisers newspapers and websites all need advance notice if you want their help keep clear schedule for your campaign and try to remain flexible so you can make the most of any opportunities to reach your intended audience budget youll need clear idea of how much money youve got to work with and what it will buy budget planning minimises the risk of missing opportunities when you need them most for example will your message work in press release or an article instead of an ad theyre both ways of getting information into newspapers and magazines for free ask the audience what they think did it work for them did they understand what you were trying to say did it make difference all this

at an event or making phone call you know your audiences best what are they most likely to respond to consider the following ideas when planning your communications messages create some simple messages and try them out in different ways would they work better in press release report or on website tone of voice different audiences respond to different tones if youre speaking in public you need to use one style of language if youre writing press release for newspaper editors you need another take time to consider which is right for your audience partners time and money are always consideration climate change is big issue that touches many different areas if you can link it to another issue with its own campaign you might be able to share resources for example if the it department in your office wants to reduce the number of printer cartridges it has to buy ask them if you can add message to their communications about recycling old ones and the benefits to the climate creating communications plancommunicating differently when youre communicating climate change 1819research has shown that there are some important issues you should consider when you communicate climate change people are rarely motivated to act by threats to their longterm survival think about how many people still smoke despite the known risks in fact when it comes to climate

frightening issues or put them to the back of their minds they will its often unhelpful to criticise behaviour that people consider normal in their home or family instead make behaviour that reduces the threat of climate change seem positive and desirable dont rely solely on logic facts or even moneysaving incentives people need to be inspired and provoked encourage discussion between individuals
