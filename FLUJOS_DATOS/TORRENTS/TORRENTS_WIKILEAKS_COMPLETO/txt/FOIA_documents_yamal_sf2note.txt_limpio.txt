dear keith stepan shiyatov said you need only data covered last 2 millenium now i send data of 35 samples covered earlier millenium these are all samples concerning this period and they are checked there are about 130 more samples from 0 to 1800 ad not checked at this time i hope your desire to see low growth about 350 bc will be more or less satisfied however for some reason there are good correlation between number of samples and growth rate for instance about 700 bc provided by only one sample with very high growth during just this period i dont know why may be number of trees depends on burial conditions as well i have to note that 364 bc not 360 bc as i wrote before on sample 60 slightly looks like false on sample 453 it is normal ring on other sample it is very small therefore i cant still say something definitely best wishes rashit hantemirov
