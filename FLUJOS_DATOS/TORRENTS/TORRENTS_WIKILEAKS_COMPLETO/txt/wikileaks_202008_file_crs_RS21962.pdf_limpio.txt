innovation from the laboratory bench to the patients bedside more efficient and predictable types of research on medical technology basic research is conducted for the advancemen t of knowledge in medicine research questions focus on the cause and eff ects of health and disease there is obvious application of basic re search other than laying foundation of knowledge for other scientific end eavors findings are often publis hed in peerreviewed journals applied research builds on the foundation to ask speci fic questions for specific purpose increasingly the line between basic and applied research is blurred as some would argue that the overarching goal of basic research is to uncover information about targets and processes to ultimately improve health and ameliorate disease clinical trials are studies that investigate the safety and effectiveness of new drugs or medical devices compared to placebo or current alternatives clinical trials are designated as phase i ii iii or iv based on the questions that the study is designed to answer phase i trials initially study new dr ug or device in small group of people eg 2080 to evaluate its safety determine sa fe dosage range for drugs and identify side effects phase ii trials study the product in larger group of people eg 100300 to seehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21962crs2 1 see 21 cfr 31221 2 see crs report rl31940 public health

side effects compare it to commonly used treatments or devices and collect information that will allow the drug treatment or device to be used safely phase iv trials are usually largescale multicenter postmarketing studies which are conducted after the food and drug administration f da approves new drug or device for marketing in order to demonstrate further evidence of effectiveness in broader clinical context1 health services research hsr investigates the relationship between medical services and health outcomes experienced by patient and strate gies to understand how health care delivery system can provide access to highquality highvalue care for various patient populations the results of hsr studies can provide policymakers with information to assess the impact of system changes on outcomes quality access to cost and use of health care servi ces across different populations hhs agencies that evaluate new medical products within the department of health and huma n services hhs network of agencies conducts and funds basic research2 and clinical evaluation of new medical technologies critics say the system is not well coordinated along the tinuum of technology transfer from benchtop research to patient care current estimates suggest that it takes 10 to15 years and 800 million to 17 billion in public and private investment for new drug to go from the laboratory to patient care3 hhs invests heavily in medical innovation4 all along the continuum including 1 grants for basic research 2 funding for clinical trials 3 technology assessmen t to support decisionmaking 4 health outcome studies 5 programs or demonstration grants adminis tered by states or 6 coverage in public insurance systems eg medicare and medicai d in supporting these efforts congress may wish to consider

information needed to use medicines and diagnostics effectively7 fda reviews drugs and devices but it does not review entire treatments or procedures in the face of declining numbers of product

for evaluating medical innovation ultimately data on how new medical pr oduct impacts health outcomes are necessary to make judgments on the effectiveness and value of that product for patients in times of constrained resources for healthcare some assert that hhs needs to assess the effectiveness and value of ne w technologies at each stage of research activity through more effective collaboration of federal assessment efforts and integration with private efforts hhs agencies they say will need better means of handing the baton among agencies to evaluate different snapshots of the process to create panoramic view of effectiveness and value and to put the nations investment in research into practice without stifling innovation advocates urge that funding initiatives include downstream investments in health services research as natural outgrowth of the substantial investment in basic research legislation may have impact across the sp ectrum of medical technology transfer rather than just on isolated elements fo r example the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 fdama made it easier and quicker for medical products to get fda approval the act included langua ge in section 505d to clarify that data from one adequate and wellcontrolled clinical investigation15 and confirmatory evidence could constitute substantial ev idence of effectiveness if fda so found where previouslyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21962crs5 16 surrogate endpoints are typically laboratory si gns or physical finding s that are plausibly correlated with health outcome see 57 federal register 58942 dec 11 1992 use of surrogate endpoints reduce the time drug needs to be studied the problem with surrogate endpoints is that often they are f ound not to be highly predictive of health benefit as result other programs such as medicare still rely on actual health outcomes as measured endpoints before approving an intervention under their program 17 medicare does cover certain preventive services as matter of exception under section 1861s10 ie for pneumonia influenza nd hepatitis b vaccines and certain screening services that are defined in the statute 18 cms medicare

trials we re typically required in ddition the act encouraged the agency to develop surrogate endpoints as pr edictors of drugs therapeutic effect16 these actions to bring medical products to market quicker seem at odds with requirements of medicare where fda appr oval is often necessary but not always sufficient for the program to pay for servi ce in contrast to fdas regulations the statutory standard for covered item under medicare as defined in title xv iii of the social security act section 1862a1a is that the item be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of malformed body member17 medicare has interpreted the st atute by looking for evidence that the service is medically necessary and effective and that the service is not experimental medicares guidelin for assessing effectiveness18 rely on outcomes data in the past fda and cms have been inte rested in coordinating their assessments but cultural political regulatory andor statutory differences in their authorities may prevent them from sharing data characterization of the barriers and the extent to which they may impede more efficient technolog assessment was considered in 2004 hhs meeting on medical innovation19 in january 2005 hhs released report detailing five recommendations 1 enter into new or expanded memoranda of understanding with appropriate nonhhs federal agencies to pr omote more rapid and efficient technology transfer 2 streamline hhs involvement in medical technology transfer 3 improve collaborations between fda and cms 4 s upport standardized formats for electronic clinical trials data and 5 initiate training program in technology development and transfer for hhs personnel scientists and engineers20 several additional ideas ve been suggested for improving coordination between agencies proponents envision these ideas as complementing each other without being redundant and facilitatin g interagency coordination ra

fda and cms could work together with researchers manufacturers and sponsors who are planning clinical studies to develop protocols that would provide for the collection of the relevant outcomes measures the agencies would need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for fda and medical necessity for cms21 after the study was completed the agencies would separately evaluate if the sponsor met the respective standards and would define the circ umstances of produc t approval andor coverage applications if cms requires data beyond those th at are necessary for fda approval fda and cms could
