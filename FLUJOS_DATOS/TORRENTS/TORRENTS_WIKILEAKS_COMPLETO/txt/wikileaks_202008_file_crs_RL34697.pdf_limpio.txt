henning law clerk american law divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34697supreme court appellate jurisdiction over military court cases summary military courts authorized by article i of the us constituti on have jurisdiction over cases involving military rvicemembers includi ng in some cases retired servicemembers they have the pow er to convict for crimes defined in the uniform code of military justice ucmj including both uniquely military offenses and crimes with equiva lent definitions in civilian laws for example in recent case united states v stevenson military courts prosecuted retired serviceman for rape crime often tried in civilian courts the military court system includes military courtsmartial criminal court of appeals for each branch of the armed services and the us court of appeals for the armed forces caaf which has discre tionary appellate jurisdiction over all military cases with the exception of potential final review by the us supreme court these article i courts handle review of military cases in an appellate system that rarely interacts with article iii courts criminal defendants in the article iii judicial system have an automatic right to appeal to federal courts of appeal and then right to petition the supreme court for final review in contrast defendants in military cases typically may not appeal their cases to the us supreme court unless the highest military court the caaf had also granted discretionary review in the case the equal justice for our military act of 2007 hr 3174 which the house passed on september 27 2008 and companion bill in the

court federal courts of appeals federal district courts and the us court of international tradesupreme court appellate jurisdiction over military court cases the us military justice system exercises jurisdiction over criminal cases pursuant to article i of the us cons titution and the uniform code of military justice ucmj military courts jurisd iction is limited to trying people connected to the armed forces for crimes defined by the ucmj within these constraints military courts jurisdiction is relatively broad for example it extends to retired servicemembers such as the defendant in united states v stevenson 1 recent case in which military courts convicted man on the navys temporary disability retired list in stevenson the navy prosecuted the defendant for rape crime routinely tried in nonmilitary courts w ith civilian defendants2 in general the military justice system including its system of appellate review is separate and distinct from the civilian judicial system some constitutional safeguards and supreme court interpretations are inapplicable in military courts also after following appellate review through the military court system military defendants may appeal to the us supreme court only in limited circumstances two bills intr oduced in the 110th congress hr 3174 which the house passed on september 27 2008 and companion b ill in the senate s 2052 would

authority from article i sec 8 of the us constitution4 the uniform code of military justice ucmj passed by congress and implemented by the president through the manual for courtsmartial mcm governs military courts jurisdiction and procedures5 military courts exercise jurisdiction over officers and enlis ted servicemembers on active duty6 the scope of their jurisdiction may extend to individuals other than active duty and enlisted servicemembers specifically such jurisd iction extends to cases involving retired servicemembers who receive military pay or hospital care from an armed force specified members of reserve units enemy combatants and other individuals with connections to military operations or benefits7 as noted below in the discussion of united states v stevenson questions remain regarding the scope of military courts power over retired servicemembers however it is clear that military courts jurisdiction extends to military veterans only when veteran maintains at least some current relationship with the military8 if defendants connection with the armed forces is sufficient to establish jurisdiction military cour t may try that defendant for broad range of activities including conduct not related to official military duties as long as the alleged conduct constitutes crime under the ucmj the ucmj includes some crimes that are unique to military service for exampl under the ucmj defendant might be prosecuted for effecting unlawful enlistment appointment or paration desertion or absence without leave9 however the armed forces may also prosecute defendants under the ucmj for conduct over which civilia n courts could also exert jurisdiction for example the ucmj cr iminalizes murder rape r obbery and other common law crimes10 appellate structure for military

authority who is commissioned officer other than the defendants accuser who convenes the investigation and courtmartial proceeding and then approves or modifies the court martials findings and sentences12 convening authorities do not provide legal review instead they provide the equiva lent of sentencing determin ations by giving full and fair consideration to matte rs submitted by the accused and determinin g appropriate action on the sentence13 under the ucmj convening authorities have substantial discretion to modify sentences and findings14 after convening authority approves or modifies courtmartial decision court of criminal appeals offers the firs t opportunity for legal review in military cases each branch of the armed services has court of criminal appeals comprised of panels of military judges15 established by the judge advocate general for each branch16 the courts of criminal appeals revi ew cases in panels or occasionally banc 17 review is not discretionary each

such findings of guilty and the sentence as they find correct in law and fact and termine on the basis of the entire record should be approved19 after court of criminal appeals has reviewed case the united states court of appeals for the armed forces caaf provides the final oppor tunity for appellate review within the military court system the caaf is an article i court

comprised of civilian j udges whom the president appoints21 in general the caaf has discretion to grant or deny petitions for appeals analogous to the us supreme courts discretion to grant or deny writs of certiorari22 however the caaf must accept appeals in two circumstances 1 all cases in which the relevant court of criminal appeals has affirmed death sentence and 2 all cases in which judge advocate general has sent case to the caaf for review after final court of criminal appeals decision23 the caafs appellate review is limited the caaf must act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the courtmartials convening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the court of criminal appeals24 in other words appeals to the caaf must involve issues originally heard by court martial and affirmed or denied by conve ning authority and the relevant court of criminal appeals the caaf cannot hear appeals based on the all writs act or other jurisdictional authority unless they aid direct review of c ourtmartial decisions for example in clinton v goldsmith 25 the air force had dropped from its rolls servicemember who had served an earlier sentence for engaging in unprotected sex without telling his partners of his hi vpositive status the servicemember had petitioned the air force court of criminal appeals for injunctive relief under the all writs act but that court denied relief holding that it lacked jurisdiction the caaf then granted the injunctive relief26 the us supreme court held that the caaf had exceeded its jurisdiction in granting injunctive relief because the relief did not involve review of c ourtmartial decision27 in so holding the supreme court rejected the caafs argument that jurisdiction was proper because the air forces dropping of the servicemember related to c onduct at issue in an earlier courtmartial proceeding instead the court emphasized that there is source of continuing jurisdiction for the the caaf over all actions administering sentences that the caaf at one time had the power to review28 with respect to appeals from the caaf the us supreme court has jurisdiction to grant certiorari in four specific circumstances 1 cases in which death sentence has been affirmed by the relevant branchs court of criminal appealshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34697crs5 29 28 usc 1259 2008 30 28 usc 12541 31 weiss v united states 510 us 163 17781 1994 holding that lack of fixed terms for military court judges does not violate fifth amendment due process guarantees 32 id 33 60 mj 198 205 caaf 2004 34 id at 1992 cases that judge advocate general has certified to the caaf 3 cases in which the caaf granted petition for review and 4 cases that do not fall in the other categories but in which the caaf has granted relief29 the first two categories represent the two circumstances in which the caaf must grant appeals the second category represents cases in which the caaf has exercised its discretion to grant an appeal and the final category is catcha ll provision for other cases in which the caaf might grant relief because the supreme courts jurisdiction is limited to these four circumstances its power to review military cases generally extends only to cases that the caaf has also reviewed for this reason the caaf s discretion over the acceptance or denial of appeals often functions as gatekeep er for military appellant s access to supreme court review if the caaf denies an appeal the us supreme court will typically lack the authority to review the decision in contrast criminal appellants in article iii courts have an automatic right of appeal to federal courts of appeals and then right to petition the supreme court for review30 interactions between articl i and article iii courts the us armed forces have long hi story of selfregulation except for limited interaction with the us supreme court article i military courts operate separately from the article iii judicial system as discussed bove military courts have distinct trial procedures and structures for ppellate review in addition because military courts jurisdictional authority arises under article i rather than article iii defendants in military cases do not have the benefit of certain article iii safeguards such as lifetime appointments for judges31 in addition althoug h military defendants are entitled to due process rights under th fifth amendment to the constitution the supreme court has upheld narrowed interpre tation of such rights in the context of military courts32 furthermore legal interpretations by article iii courts do not n ecessarily create binding precedent for article i courts and vice versa the only article iii court holdings that bind military courts are those of the us supreme court however military courts sometimes reject even supreme court preced ents as inapplicable in the military context for example in united states v marcum 33 the caaf declined to follow an interpretation of the constitutional right to privacy that the supreme court had handed down s hort while earlier in marcum courtmartial had convicted servicem ember of various crimes in cluding nonforcible sodomy34 on appeal the servicemember ar gued that with respect to the nonforcible sodomyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34697crs6 35 539 us 558 2003 36 marcum 60 mj at 205 37 id 38 id at 206 39

the caaf declined to follow lawrence 36 the caafs rationale for diverging from supreme court precedent in marcum was that constitutional protections may apply differently to members of the armed forces than they do to civilians37 thus although constitutional rights identified by the supreme court generally apply to members of the military such rights do not apply when by text or scope they are plainly inapplicable38 similarly article iii courts are not bound by military courts decisions the supreme court may consider caaf decisions or ucmj provisions as potentially persuasive for example th supreme court ordered briefs to examine the impact of military code provision after it handed down its decision in kennedy v louisiana 39 case involving the question of deat h penalty sentence for child rapist40 in kennedy the supreme court held that the 8th amendment prohibits punishment by death penalty for defendant who rapes child but did not cause or intend to cause childs death41 in so holding the court emphasized the national consensus against the death penalty in such cases42 in its petition for rehearing louisiana argued that congresss recent amendment of the ucmj to include death penalty punishment in military cases for the rape of child undermined the courts national consensus argument43 however the supreme court decided not to reconsider its kennedy decision instead reaffirming its prio r ruling with only minor modifications in its opinion accompanying its denial of rehearing the supreme court disagreed with louisianas interpretation of the death penalty language in the ucmj amendment but it also emphasized that au thorization of the death penalty in the military sphere does not indicate that the penalty is constitutional in the civilian context44

united states v stevenson recent case united states v stevenson 45 highlights two issues relevant to jurisdiction in military cases first it raises questions regarding the scope of military courts jurisdiction over retired servi cemembers second it raises question regarding supreme court jurisdiction to review legal questions when the caaf denied review the first stion was the basis for the stevenson appellants petition to the supreme court for certiorari46 the united states raised the second question in its brief opposing appe llants certiorari petition47 although the us supreme court clearly has jurisdiction over cases in which the caaf granted review48 it is unclear whether the supreme courts jurisdiction extends to specific issues that the caaf declined to address in stevenson naval criminal investigative service officials had investigated the appellant man on the navys temporary disability retired list while he recei ved treatment at veterans affairs hospital military c ourtmartial then tr ied and convicted the appellant for rape on appeal the caaf remanded the cas for fact finding regarding blood draws taken while appellee was patient at the va hospital49 after the united states navymarine corps court of criminal appeals affirmed the courtmartia ls decision on remand the caaf granted second review of the case50 however exercising its discre tion the caaf limited the issues on appeal to potential fourth amendment viol ations declining to review the question of the military courts jurisdiction over man on the temporary disability retired list51 in his petition to the supreme court for certiorari the appellant in stevenson requested review of only the issue that th caaf had declined to address namely the issue of military courts jurisdiction over case involving person on the temporary disability retired list52 in response the united states argued in its opposing brief that the supreme courts ppellate review power does not extend to issues that the

the supreme court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal54 bills introduced in the 110th congress companion bills hr 3174 and s 2052 introduced in the 110th congress would expand the us supreme courts appellate jurisdiction over military cases55 the house passed its version entitled the qual justice for our military act of 2007 by voice vote on september 27 2008 the bills would amend the ucmj to authorize appeals to the supreme court in military cases regardless of the caafs acceptance or denial of an appeal bill sponsors have emphasized the need for the law to address the longstanding disparity between the broad ability to appeal the supreme court in civilian cases on one hand and the limited ability to appeal to the supreme court in military cases on the other hand56 for example when introducing hr 3174 representative davis stated that the legislation would give our servicemembers equal access to the united states supreme court57 she also emphasized that under the current system service men and women sacrifice one of the fundamental legal rights that all civilian americans enjoy namely the right to appeal their cases to the us supreme court58 courts have recognized compelling justifications for military justice system that is distinct from article iii courts for example in marcum the caaf emphasized the importance of ensuring discipline and obedience in the armed forces59 the marcum court also stressed the militarys interest in disciplining servicemembers differently according to their rank60 however it is unclear whether such arguments justify disparity in access to supreme court review especially in the context of servicemembers longer on active duty or crimes that exist under both military and civilian laws conclusion military cases follow unique process of appellate review moving from courts martial through the following steps 1 automatic appeals to courts of criminal appeals for each armed forces branch 2 potential discretionary review by the highest military court the caaf and 3 review by the us supreme court inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34697crs9 limited circumstances usually only when the caaf has also granted review legislation introduced in the 110th congress would expand supreme court jurisdiction over military cases by authorizing supreme court review even if the caaf had denied an appeal if this measure became law it would make moot the question highlighted by united states v stevenson regarding the supreme courts jurisdiction over specific issues that the caaf had declined to review
