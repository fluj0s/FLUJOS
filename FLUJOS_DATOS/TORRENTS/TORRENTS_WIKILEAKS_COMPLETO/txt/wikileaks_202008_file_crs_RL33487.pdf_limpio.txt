background and us relations summary despite its weak military and lackluster economy syria re mains relevant in middle eastern geopolitics the asad regime has its hands in each of the four major active or potential zones of c onflict in the region lebanon israelpalestine iraq and iran in the levant syrian leaders aim to dominate the internal politics of lebanon and have been accused of involvement in the assassination of f our parliamentarians and former prime minister rafik hariri the asad regime has resisted us and french attempts to bolster the prowest ern government of prime minister fouad siniora believing that it can weather the storm of us pressure over time syria also plays key role in the middle east peace process acting at times as spoiler by sponsoring palestinia n militants and facilitating the r earmament of hezbollah at other times it has participated in substantive negotiations with israel most recently in 19992000 september 6 israeli air strike against an alleged nascent syrian nuclear facility heightened an already nse atmosphere between the two countries though most experts believe th at neither side desires ne w war regarding iraq the iraqi refugee crisis has affected syria far mo re than syria has influenced internal iraqi politics since the fall of saddam hussein there now may be close to 14 million iraqis inside syria many of whom face the dim prospect of remaining in permanent exile finally syrias longsta nding relationship with the iranian clerical regime is of great concern to us strategists as syria has grown more estranged from the united states syrianiranian relations have impr oved and some analysts have called on us policymakers to woo syrian leaders away from iran others believe that the administration should go even further in pressuring the syrian government and should consider implementing even rsher economic sanctions against it variety of us legislative provisions and executive directives prohibit direct aid to syria and restrict bilateral trade relations between the two countries largely because of syrias designation by the us state department as sponsor of international terrorism on december 12 2003 president bush signed the syria accountability act hr 1828 as pl 108175 which imposed additional economic sanctions against syria in recent years the administration has designated several syrian entities as

mcconnell and national security adviser stephen j hadley privately briefed members of congress on north koreas alleged role in constructing reactor in northeastern syria that was destroyed in an israeli air strike on september 6 2007 this marked the first time that the united states had officially provided details on both the israeli operation and the nature of the targeted facility following the closed door briefings us intelligence officials provided background news briefing to the media which has since reporte d extensively on the subject according to the washington post syria and north korea were suspected of collaborating on secret nuclear program since 19971 since then senior north korean officials2 and scientists from north ko reas yongbyon nuclear complex reportedly visited syria several times before construction began in syria at remote desert facility known as kibar between 2001 and 20033 in the spring of 2007 israel reportedly provided the administration with photographs of the interior of the alleged facility s till under construction4 according to the washington post the pictures depicted site similar to th one at yongbyon which produces plutonium for nuclear weapons according to the new york times the photographs clearly show the rods that control the heat in nuclear reactor as both the yongbyon and kibar reactors had virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods5 in reaction to the briefings the syrian government denounced the us evidence and accused the united states of helping is rael to carry out the september 2007 raidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33487crs2 6 us never gave israel green light for syria strike us official agence france presse april 24 2008 7 new york times april 25 2008 opcit 8 us shows

in israel raid in syria nhk reuters april 28 2008 although the administra tion has acknowledged discussing policy options with israeli leaders prior the september 2007 attack senior us officials have denied any covert us role in the bombing stating that is rael proceeded without green light from us none was asked for none was given6 since the us intelligence briefing on april 24 many observers have accepted the administrations evidence of syriann orth korean nuclear collaboration though some skeptics have argued that syria lacked the technical capacity to build nuclear weapon and posed imminent danger to is rael that would have justified the september 2007 attack according to david bright nuclear expert at the institute for science and international security the information provides dramatic confirmation that the syrian site was nuclear reactor but the us does not have any indication of how syria would fuel this reactor and information that north korea had already or intended to provide the reactors fuel in order to create weaponsgrade plutonium syria would have needed to acquire uranium fuel and then have it reprocessed either at facility inside syria or elsewhere after their briefings to congress senior us intelligence offi cials acknowledged that there was sign that syria had built an operation to convert the spent fuel from the plant into weaponsgrade plutonium but that they had told president bush last year that they could think of other explanation for the reactor7 in order to stress the imminent danger posed by syrias actions senior us intelligence officials have repeatedly stressed that kibar was nearly operational at the time of the israeli strike us offi cials were quoted saying that before the israeli bombing kibar was within weeks or months of becoming operational8 others have noted that the reactor th ere would have ultimately produced enough plutonium for one or two bombs with in year of becoming operational9 several days after the intelligence briefings japane public broadcaster nhk citing south korean intelligence officials reported that 10 north koreans working at kibar had died in the september 2007 air raid and that the dead included officials of the north koreas communist party unit that exports weapons and military technology and members of the north korean military unit which made nuclear facilities in the country10 although the new information on kibar may in the short term dramatically affect us efforts to broker nuclear disarmament deal with north korea analysts also have raised number of questions on how these new developments will impact the middle east although the possibility of syrianisraeli military confrontation over the september attack remains slim the israeli defense establishment has beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33487crs3 11 public status of us congress hearing on iaf syria bombing still undecided jerusalem post april 15 2008concerned that public conf irmation of syriannorth korean nuclear cooperation would embarrass syria and possibly force president bashar asad to retaliate against israel in order to save face11 while there has been military response from syria president asad statedretaliate doesnt mean missile for missile and bomb for bomb we have our means to retaliate maybe politica lly maybe in other ways but we have the right to retaliate in different means the israelisyrianlebanese border had been tense after the 2006 summer war and there were scattered reports indicating that the israeli military had heightened its state of alert and that the syrians had increased their defensive fortifications near the border nevertheless major confrontation appears unlikely in the past syria has used proxies such as hezbollah and palestinian islamic jihad to carry out reprisal terrorist ope rations against israel rather than use its own military or intelligence forces for many experts the israeli attack s implications that go far beyond syrian israeli relations although the veil of secr ecy surrounding the attack may reflect us efforts not to derail ongoing middle east peace negotiations the attack has been largely seen through the prism of restoring israeli deterrence at time when some analysts expect israel to take action against irans uranium enrichment facilities though strike against iran would be far more difficult than the september 6 bombing or even israels st rike against the osirak nuclear facility in iraq in 1981 israels bombing may be intended to send signal to its opponents in the region that it has the will to act if nece ssary unilaterally to stop iran and others from developing an advanced nuclear weapons program mughniyeh assasination on february 13 2008 imad mughniyeh hezbollahs longtime special

behind th kidnapping of western hosta ges in beirut during the 1980s one has claimed responsibility fo r his killing though syria and iran have launched joint investig ation and may publicly announce their findings in the weeks to come many analysts have sp eculated that israel may be behind the operation though some expert s believe that syria itsel f could have had hand in mughniyehs murder days

succeeded his father in 2000 in smooth transfer of power inherited readymade politicomilitary apparatus his father helped build although bashar is ge nerally considered to be less ruthless and calculating than his father he has essentially sought to preserve the status quo and above all else mainta in regime stability key members of the asad family bashar asad the 41year old president of syria is married to asma akhras british born syrian sunni muslim and formerly an investment banker at jp morgan maher asad the younger brother of bashar he heads the presidential guard and other military agencies bushra asad assef shawkat bushra is the older sister of bashar and she is rumored to be key decisionmaker her husband assef shawkat is head of military intelligence and part of the presidents inner circle pillars of the regime the alawite sect the alawite religious sect which evolved from the shiite sect of islam constitutes approximately 12 of the sy rian population formerly the most economically deprived and socially disadvantaged group in syria the alawites rose rapidly in the ranks of the military establishment and the ruling bath party in the 1960s and have dominated political life in syria since then the alawite community as whole and the asad family in particular constituted an important power base for the late president hafiz asad and at least for the time being have rallied behind his and successor t hough committed to maintaining the primacy of the alawite community the asads ve sought with some success to coopt support from other sects many senior positions including that of prime minister are ordinarily held by mbers of the sunni mus lim majority however most key positions particularly in the security institutions remain in alawite hands and some observers believe that any weakening of the central regime or an outbreak of political turmoil could precipitate power struggle between entrenched alawites and the majority sunni muslims who comp rise over 70 of the population the bath party the socialist panarab bath party whose rival wing governed iraq before the collapse of saddam husseins regime came to power in syria in 1963 although the syrian constitution specifies leading role for the bath party and the party provides the regime with political legitimacy the bath is more an instrument for the execution of policy than an originator of policy many bathists are not alawites but there is complex synergistic relationship between the party and the community still barring major governmental change syrian leader would need to enjoy the support of the ba th party apparatus the partys top decisionmaking body known as the regiona l command sits at the top of syrias policymaking process and membership in this body is stepping stone to top positions in syria in june 2000 when senior syrian officials were orchestrating the succession of bashar asad to the presidency after the death of his father one of their first steps was to arrange for bashar to be elected secretary general of the regional command replacing his late fatherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33487crs5 12 eyal zisser where is bashar alassad heading middle east quarterly winter 2008the military and security establishment the role of the armed forces and national security services has figured prominently in most syrian regimes and predates by some years the establishment of the bathist regime factionalism within the armed forces was key cause of instability in syria in the past as military cliques jockeyed for power and made and unmade governments with considerable frequency this situation changed abruptly after 1970 as the elder asad gained position of unquestioned supremacy over the military and security forces the late president appointed longstanding supporters partic ularly from his alawite sect to key military command positions and sensitive intelligence posts thereby creating military elite that could be relied upon to help maintain the asad regime in power according to one syria expert within the military bashar has replicated the patronclient relationship wi elded so effectively by his father despite repeated rumors about tension within the assad fa mily there is evidence that any rival most notably asaf shawkat bashars brotherinlaw and the head of the shubat almukhabarat alaskariyya military security departme nt

group13 has been largely in exile since its crushing defeat at the hands of the asad regime in 1982 when sy rian forces attacked the brotherhoods stronghold in the city of hama and k illed approximately 10000 people since then the government has attempted to coopt the forces of political islam by continuing to outlaw the muslim brotherhood and keep its activists in prison while promoting islam as social force for national unification14 over the past twenty years the syrian government has financed the constr uction of new mosques aired more islamic programming on state television loosen ed restrictions on public religious celebrations and weddings and monitored the sermons of clerics many of whom are on the states payroll at the same tim the syrian government like other dictatorships in the region has used the threat of homegrown islamist violence in order to justify oneparty rule and has frequently exaggerated its threat in order to bolster its own appeal to western governments syria has received some favorable attention for its reported coope ration with us intelligence agencies in detaining and tracking qaeda operatives in the middle east and in europe
