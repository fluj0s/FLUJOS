industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33411ecosystem restoration in the great lakes the great lakes regional collaboration strategy summary the great lakes are recognized by many as an international natural resource that has been significantly altered over th past two centuries by human development problems in the great lakes include poor water quality degraded fish and wildlife habitat contaminated sed iments and nonnative invasi ve species among others restoration of the great lakes ecosystem has emerged as top priority among wide variety of federal state and local st akeholders and among several members of congress in the past few decades the us congress has enacted more than 30 federal laws specifically fo cused on restoring aspects of the great lakes basin attention to restoration in the great lakes was heightened in 2004 with the creation of federal great kes interagency task force the purpose of the task force is to provide strategic direction fo r great lakes policies on restoration and to form regional collaboration of stakeholders interested in restoring the great lakes ecosystem the latter purpose was accomplished with the creation of the great lakes regional collaboration in 2004 the collaboration whic h consists of over 1500 stakeholders recently released the great lakes regional collaboration strategy plan for restoring the great lakes ecosystem the strategy is series of recommendations for actions and activities aimed at starting the restoration of the great lakes ecosystem over the next five years the strategy encompasses eight issue areas aquatic invasive species fish and wildlife habitat habitatspecies coastal health contaminat ed sediments nonpoint source pollution toxic pollutants indicators and information and sustaina ble development the total cost of implementing the strategy is estimate d to be 20 billion over five years some have criticized the strategy for being too costly relying too heavily on new sources of funding and not establishing governance structure to coordinate implementation proponents of the strategy contend that the estimated funding needs for the great lakes ecosystem match the size and breadth of the ecosystem and are similar to those of other largescale ecosystem restoration initiatives such as the everglades and chesapeake bay further they contend th at one of the functions of the interagency task force is to provide governance and to oversee and coordinate restoration activities in the great lakes this report summarizes the strategy analyzes issues related to the strategy and its implementation and discusses federal legislation related to restoration in the great lakes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33411contents background 1 g r t l k s i n t r g n c t s k f r

restoration ecosystem restoration in the great lakes the great lakes regional collaboration strategy background the great lakes watershed is the largest system of fresh surface water in the world the watershed covers approxima tely 300000 square miles and is shared by eight us states illinois indiana michigan minnesota new york ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin and one canadian province ontario see figure 1 the great lakes have national and inte rnational importance because of their abundant natural resources and relations hip to the economies of both the united states and canada the great lakes contain nearly 90 of the surface freshwater of the united states and 20 of the surface freshwater of the world the great lakes basin also supports an expanding population and accompanying development an estimated 40 million people rely on the great lakes basin to provide jobs drinking water and recrea tion among other things the great lakes are recognized by many as an international natural resource that has been significantly altered over the last two centuries in the last several decades agricultural activity throughout the basin and ur ban and industrial development concentrated along the shoreline have degraded water quality in the great lakes posing potential threats to wildlife populations human health and the great lakes ecosystem development has also led to changes in terrestrial and aquatic habitats the intr oduction of nonnative species the contamination of sediments and the listing of more than 50 threatened or endangered species in the basin in response the fede ral governments of the united states and canada and the state and provincial governments in the gr eat lakes basin are implementing several restoration activities1 the us congress has recognized the importance of the great lakes ecosystem and has played role in restoration effort s in the great lakes congress has enacted more than 30 federal laws specifically focused on restoring aspects of the great lakes basin these laws have authorized several activities ranging from grant programs that fund mitigation of toxic s ubstances to restoration programs that improve water quality and fish

interagency task force in 2004 the great lakes interagency task force was created by an executive order2 its purpose is to provide strategic direction on federal great lakes policy the task force is chaired by the administr ator of the us environmental protection agency epa and contains 10 agency and cab inetlevel officers the task force in collaboration with the council of great kes governors the great lakes cities initiative great lakes tribes and the great lakes congressional task force convened group known as the great lakes regional collaboration3 t h collaboration includes representatives from great lakes states local communities tribes nongovernmental organizations and ot her interests in the great lakes region the structure and goals of the collabora tion were

hereafter referred to as the strategy 6 framework for the great lakes regional collaboration accessed jan 30 2008 at httpwwwepagovglnpocollaborationframeworkhtml 7 more than 1500 people representing federal state local and tribal governments non governmental organizations and private stake holders participated on eight issuespecific strategy teams to develop recommendations for restoring the great lakes the recommendations with the highest priority fo r early restoration activities are presented in the strategy other recommendations for long term restoration are listed in the appendices of the strategythe first goal of the collaboration was to create workable strategy to restore and protect the great lakes within one ear of the creation of the task force4 this great lakes regional colla boration strategy was released in december 20055 the second goal of the collaboration is to serv as forum for addressing regional issues related to the protection and restoration of the great lakes the third goal is to create an oversight forum to coordinate the implementation of the strategy6 great lakes regional co llaboration strategy the strategy is series of recommendations for actions and activities aimed at restoring the great lakes ecosystem recommendations from the strategy are intended to be implemented over the next five years and represent the highest priorities for restoration accord ing to the strategy teams7 the strategy encompasses eight issue areas aquatic invasive species fish and wildlife habitat habitatspecies coastal health contaminat ed sediments nonpoint source pollution toxic pollutants indicators and information and sustainable development under each issue area description of the issue and recommendations for addressing the issue are presented each recommendation contai ns several specific activities and is justified by the collaboration with its rationale the activities range from supporting existing programs to creating new ones and in some cases identifying projects to be implemented in specific geographical locations eg the completion of fish barrier in the chicago waterway system an estimated cost for implementing the recommendations over five years is provided after each set of recommendations the estimated costs repres ents the sum of federal and nonfederal contributions goals and interim milestone s are also provided for each issue area the implementation of the strategy relies on existing authorities programs and funding at federal state and local levels of government as well as the creation of some new actions eg enacting new legisl ation further the strategy aims to improve coordination among stak eholders and relies on the shared resources of all collaborators especially noting the role of tribes according to the strategy the coordinated use of existing resources s hould allow some of the recommendations to be implemented but other recommendations will require modest additional funding and some recommendations will be impossible to implement absent substantial newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33411crs4 8 strategy p 12 9 according to the strategy additional actions for the complete restoration of the great lakes are included in the appendices 10 strategy p 14 11 the strategy notes that several invasions of ais will be impossible to eradicate in the great lakes and that control rather than elim ination of these ais is the goal of the issue area 12 strategy p 23 13 wet weather programs employ mitigation strategies to reduce stormwater and sewage overflow during periods of precipitation expenditures8 the collaboration emphasizes that the strategy is not meant to chart out the complete restoration of the great lakes ecosystem and that decisions to implement activities ffecting the great lakes should be guided by the strategy9 the following sections provide summa ry of issue areas and recommendations made in the strategy aquatic invasive species the great lakes ecosystem is home to more than 160 nonnative invasive aquatic species economic losses from invasive species terrestrial and aquatic were timated at 50 billion annually in 200510 according to the strategy existing measures to pr event the introduction nd spread of aquatic invasive species ais are inadequate the goals of this issue area are to prevent all new introductions of ais and to control existing ais in the ecosystem11 this would be accomplished by preventing the spread of ais through canals and waterways and in the ballast water of ships as well as by creating research and management programs on ais habitatspecies development agricultural expansion toxic pollutants and invasive species have led to habitat loss and species declines in the great lakes basin in addition to providing ecosystem services eg filtering water habitat and species support booming recreation industry that is estimated to generate over 50 billion in economic activity annually12 the goals of this issue area are to improve fisheries and restore wetlands riverine and riparian hab itat and coastal and upland habitat the recommendations for this issue are to increase habitat conservation and species management funding by 288 milli on annually through existing programs and through new authorizations where program gaps exist coastal health water quality in coastal areas of the great lakes is degraded and has led to outbreaks of disease among humans eg diarrhea beach closings and drinking water advisories the goals of this issue area are to eliminate inputs of untreated or badly treated human and indus trial waste into the great lakes reduce toxic contaminants at local beaches nd protect drinking water quality the recommendations include implementing wet weather programs13 and improving wastewater treatment systems regulating and researching pollution sources and managing waters used for recreation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33411crs5 14 twentysix aocs are in us waters 12 in canadian waters and 5 shared by both countriessediment contamination in 1987 the united states and canada identified 43 areas of concern aoc in the great lakes basin that represented the most degraded portions of the ecosystem14 the most common reason for degradation in aocs is contaminated sediments contaminated sediments result from toxic pollutants that settle out of the water column and deposit in sediment agitation of underwater sediments can cause pollutants to be resuspended in the water column and potentially enter the air or food chain th goal of this issue is to restore all aocs in the united states through reaut horizing and funding programs under the great lakes legacy act and promoting th development of sed iment treatment and disposal technologies nonpoint source pollution nonpoint source pollution has been identified as one of the main contributors to impaired waters in the great lakes ecosystem nonpoint source pollution cannot be traced to specific sources and generally comes from many diffuse sources eg rainfa ll that moves over an area and picks up pollutants before entering river would be nonpoint source of pollution point source pollution can be traced to specific sources such as wastewater treatment plant or factory some of the primary nonpoint source pollutants in the great lakes are excessive levels of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen reducing excess sediment phosphorus and nitrogen loadin g into the great lakes ecosystem and improving flow regimes in waterways are goals of this issue recommendations include restoring 550000 acres of wetlands and 335000 acres of buffer habitat to reduce excess nutrients and reducing soil loss and waste flows into waterways toxic pollutant strategy persistent toxic substa nces pts have been problem in the great lakes for many years and are released from contaminated sediments industrial pro cesses nonpoint sources and atmospheric deposition the goals of this issue are to virtually eliminate the discharge of pts into the ecosystem and to increase scientific understanding of pts reco mmendations include reducing pts such as mercury pcbs dioxins pes ticides and other new toxic chemicals from the ecosystem creating program to conduc t research monitoring and forecasting of pts in the great lakes and in creasing public education about pts indicators and information according to the strategy ecosystem monitoring observation research modelin g and indicator development are all currently underfunded and lack compre hensive ecosystem approach the overarching goals of this issue are to cr eate network of monitoring and observing systems and to conduct great lakes resear ch in comprehensive and coordinated manner recommended actions include conti nuing the development of sciencebased indicators of ecosystem health doubling res earch funding for the great lakes and coordinating scien tific and technical information sustainable development the strategy acknowledges that development in the great lakes should be balanced among economic social and ecological factors the goal of this issue is to foster the development of the great lakes basin so that human activities s

board at house committee on science subcommittee on environment technology and standards great continuedneeds and is in balance with the ecosystem to accomplish this goal the strategy contains several reco mmendations that would enhance the sustainable planning and use of resources in new and existing government programs and promote the livability of the great lakes to the public issues funding the amount and sources of funding for the strategy are contentious issues15 the strategy calls for an estima ted 20 billion from fe deral and nonfederal sources to implement all of its recommendations over the next five years the most significant portion of funding would be fo r the coastal health issue at 153 billion of this total 137 billion in new funds is for wastewater treatment system improvements the anticipat ed federal share is 75 billion and nonfederal share is 62 billion and 13 billion for improvement of drinking water treatment facilities some have asserted that 20 billion over five years is too high for restoring the great lakes ecosystem and cite funding totals for other largescale ecosystem restoration initiatives namely the florida everglades which has total estimated cost of 105 billion further the interagenc task force in its annual report stated that the strategy should be funded from existing programs and use current funding from federal and state governments to be implemented16 according to the task force existing federal programs and state local and tribal programs that have activities directly and indirectly related to restoring water quality in the great lakes spend approximately 523 million nd 100 million respectively on restoration activities annually17 figures for federal spending were given for other aspects of the ecosystem such as terrestrial habitat and shorelines some proponents of the stra tegy contend that some of the proposed funding already is being spent on existing programs and that the expansive size of the great lakes ecosystem warrants higher price tag than other largescale ecosystem restoration initiatives around the country fo r example some have estimated that the restoration of the chesapeake bay will require between 15 billion and 19 billion to meet previously set restoration goals by 201018 some proponents also contend that one of the main barriers to restoration in the great lakes is inadequate funding19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33411crs7 19 continued lakes restoration how how soon hearing 109th cong 2nd sess apr 21 2006 20 gao great lakes restoration 21 testimony of diane katz the

estimated ne w funding from existing funding is difficult because data for spending under curre nt federal state and ot her recommended programs in the strategy are not given for all components the exception is new funding for wastewater treatment plants which is pr oposed to be 5545 federallocal costshare in the strategy further the strategy does not provide or commit to costsharing plan among federal state and other entities thus making it difficult to determine where funding gaps may exist governance the collaboration and strategy were created partly to improve coordination of ecosystem restoration activities in the great lakes among federal state and local stakeholders this focus was derived from the assertion that restoration efforts in the great lakes ffer from inadequate c oordination and lack of comprehensive plan20 the interagency task fo rce and the collaboration are viewed by some as entities facilitating the coordination of restoration activities however some others contend that the st rategy does not address governance issues that would increase coordination limit overlap ping efforts and assign restoration responsibilities to all ty pes of stakeholders21 the strategy itself does not propose specific governance stru cture or plan for coordinati on questions such as who is in charge what are the federal and stat roles in restora tion and how will the implementation of the strategy be govern ed are not specifically addressed in the strategy on the other hand coordination of rest oration activities in the great lakes is stated function of the task force in its annual report the ta sk force lists several examples of where coordinated respons to an ecosystem issue was undertaken successfully22 further the executive committee of the collaboration will be creating plans for coordinating the implementation of the strategy according to the glrc strategy implementation framework the executive committee will remain intact and serve as an administrative structure to implement the strategy the committee will direct activities of the glrc implement mechanisms to promote accountability identify implementation issues and facilitate coordination of restoration activities among stakeholders23 in other largescale ecosystem restoration initiatives governance and coordination have been addre ssed in federal and state laws for example in the everglades governance is largely shared among the department of the interior the us army corps of engineers the state of florida and the south florida water management district the nonfederal sponsor of co rps activities policieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33411crs8 24 for example see testimony of dr donald scavia associate dean school of natural resources and environment university of michigan house committee on science subcommittee on environment technology and standards great lakes restoration how how soon hearing 109th cong 2nd sess apr 21 2006 25 the strategy would require 4 billion annually from federal state and other resourcesexplaining how these stakeholders interact and how the plan to restore the everglades is implemented were required by federal law and promulgated in programmatic regulations setting priorities the breadth and estimated cost of the strategy have led some to contend that implementing all the programs outlined in the strategy would not be financially feasible within the fiveyear time span the strategy covers some suggest that setting prioritie s for implementing programs within each element would help decision makers choose which progra ms to fund if f unds are limited some priorities discussed at congressional hearing on the great lakes strategy included restoring and protecting nearshore and coastal waters of the great lakes controlling aquatic invasive species and addressing the problem s of nonpoint source pollution24 congressional role some have anticipated that the strategy could be used as platform for introducing federal legisla tion for restoring the great lakes there are two main approaches to authorizing tions of the strategy reflected in pending legislation one approach is to author ize large grant program to fund various aspects of restoration projects and the ot her approach is to reauthorize existing programs to increase their funding to support restor ation activities the strategy contains seve ral projects or programs th at could be funded through grant programs targeting ecosystem rest oration one approach used in the 109th congress would have authorized grant programs that could fund several recommendations under the strategy they would have authorized 4 billion and 6 billion for restoration activities in the great lakes these proposed authorizations for federal funding could not be compared to the proposed funding needed for the strategy because the strategy does not sp ecify sources of funding for each of its categories25 similar bills have not been introduced in the 110th congress different approach to enacting portions of the strategy into federal law would be to reauthorize existing federal programs that the strategy identifies for accomplishing its goals and recommendations for example the great lakes fish and wildlife restoration ac t of 2006 pl 109326 reaut horizes appropriations for the great lakes fish and wildlife act of 1990 pl 101537 as amended 16 usc 941 et seq through 2012 and makes veral amendments that will increase reporting requirements and allow the us fish and wildlife service to conduct regional projects third strategy would use both approach by authorizing new programs within the strategy as well as reauthorizing existin g programs to support the strategy in the 110th congress this strategy is incorporated into bills that would also authorize and prescribe duties for the task force the executive committee and the collaboration that go beyond the creation of the strategy for example the task force would behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33411crs9 established within the epa nd would coordinate the imple mentation of the strategy the executive committee would hold meetings and report on the progress of the initiative and the collaboration would be responsible for developing longterm restoration and protection strategy and creating fo rum for program oversight conclusion the strategy envisions itself as the first step towards restoring the great lakes in the near term its goals and recommendations reflect fiveyear span and according to the strategy do not represent all that needs to be done to completely restore the great lakes the shortterm outlook of the strategy and its 20 billion price tag generate questions regarding the process to completely restore the great lakes ecosystem such questions include 1 what will it take to completely restore the ecosystem 2 how much will it cost and how long it will take 3 what are the federal and nonfederal roles in the process 4 how will the process be governed 5 how will success be measures and when will we know it is done and 6 how likely is it that substantial increases will be made to current funding levels for restoration given the current budget envir onment the answers to these questions are not addressed in the strategy but may come from the collaborative process that created the strategy the collaboration is expected to continue to serve as broad forum to address issues related to rest oration and protection of the great lakes ecosystem
