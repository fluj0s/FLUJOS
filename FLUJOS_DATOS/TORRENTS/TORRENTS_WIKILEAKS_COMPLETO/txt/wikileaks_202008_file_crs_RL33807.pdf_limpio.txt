administrator has been sharply critical of several of epas decisions casac was established by statute in 1977 its members largely from academia and from private research institutes are appointed by the epa administrator they review the agencys work in setting national ambient air quality standards naaqs relying on panels of the nati ons leading experts on the health and environmental effects of the specific pollutants casac panels have nearly 30 year history of working quietly in the background issuing what were called closure letters on agency documents that summarize the science and the policy options behind the naaqs the science and po licy documents written by epa staff generally have gone through several iterations before the scientists were satisfied but with the issuance of closure letter casac has in past years removed itself from the process leaving the final choice of standards to the administrator in 2006 however casac and its 22memb er pm review panel forcefully objected to the administrators decisions regarding revision of the particulate naaqs the committ ee took the unpr ecedented steps of writing to the administrator both after he proposed th standards in january and after he promulgated them in september in the latter communication casac stated unanimously that the administrators action does not provide an adequate margin of safety requisite to

the nexttolast formal step before the administrator proposed to revi the ozone naaqs in doing so the panel drew firm line there is scientific justification for retaining the current primary 8hr naaqs and recommended range far more stringent than the previous standard the administrator pr omulgated standard outside of casacs range in march 2008 at the same time that casac panels were speak ing out epa was conducting review of casacs role and other as pects of the naaqsrevision process december 7 2006 epa memorandum made numbe r of changes in that process that many argue will diminish the role of casac and agency scientists as the changes have been implemented casa c has objected to some of the new procedures and number of senators have written the epa administrator to express their

comes from sec tion 109 of the act and the procedures for controlling naaqs or criteria pollutants are found throughout titles i ii and iv of the act pollutants that are less widely emitted are generally classified as hazardous air pollutants and are regulated under diffe rent section of the act section 112 2 the six criteria pollutants are ozone pa rticulates carbon monoxi sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and lead all six were first identified as criteria pollutants subject to naaqs in the 1970s 3 the clean air acts definition of welfar is found in section 302h of the actair quality standards and sound science what role for casac introduction the role of naaqs in air quality regulation setting national ambient air quality standards naaqs is an action th at is at the core of the clean air act naaqs apply to criteria pollutants pollu tants that endanger public health or welfare and whose presence in ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources1 six pollutants are currently identified as criteria pollutants2 the epa administrator can add to the list if he determines that additional pollutants meet the acts criteria or delete them if he concludes that they longer do so naaqs do not directly regulate emissions rather the primary naaqs identify pollutant concentrations in ambient air that must be attained to protect public health with an adequate margin of sa fety secondary naaqs id entify concentrations necessary to protect public welfare br oad term that includes damage to crops vegetation property building materials etc3 in essence naaqs are standards that fine what epa considers to be clean air their importance stems from the long and complicated implementation process that is set in motion by their establishmen t once naaqs have been set epa using monitoring data and other information submitted by the states identifies list of areas that exceed the standards and must therefore reduce pollutant concentrations to achieve them state and local governments then have three years to produce state implementation plans which outline the measures they will implement to reduce the pollution levels in these nona ttainment areas epa also acts to control many of the naaqs pollutants wherever they are mitted through national standards for products that emit them particularly mobile sources such as automobiles and emission standards for new stationary s ources such as power plants casac and naaqs revision because the understa nding of pollutions effects changes with new research the clean air act requires that epa review naaqs at fiveyear intervals and revise them as may be appropriate to ensure thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs2 4 the decisions that casac objected to also failed to follow the advice of

in 2005 appears to have been the root of the public c ontroversy over the pm standard in 2006these reviews meet the highest scientific standards the 1977 amendments to the act required the administrator to appoint an independent clean air scientific advisory committee casac casac has seven mbers largely from academia and from private research institutions who generally serve for two consecutive threeyear terms in conducting naaqs reviews their expertise is supplemented by panels of the nations leading experts on the health and environmental effects of the specific pollutants that are under review these pa nels can be quite large the recent particulate matter and ozone review panels for exampl had 22 and 23 members respectively casac as well as the public makes suggestions regarding the membership of these panels with the fina l selections made by epa the panels review the agencys work during naaqs setting and naaqsrevision rather than conducting their own i ndependent reviews casac panels had nearly 30year history of working quietly in the background advising the agencys staff on naaqs reviews and issuing what were called closure letters on the agency documents that summarize the science and the policy options behind the naaqs closure letters have been used by casac panels to indicate consensus that the agency staffs work provides an adequate scientific basis for regulatory decisions the science and policy documents written by epa staff generally have gone through several iterations before the scientists were satisfied but with the issuance of closure letter casac has in past years removed itself from the process leaving the formal proposal and final choice of standards to the administrator proposal comes in the form of federal register

to commenting on the paper after it appears in the federal register during public comment period the goal according to agency officials is to speed up the review process which has consistently taken longer than the five years allowed by statute these improvements will help the agency meet the goal of reviewing each naaqs on fiveyear cycle as required by the clean air act without compromising the

unusually forceful stance regarding re vision of the ozone naaqs and epas decision to change the naaqs review proce ss have thrust casac heretofore relatively obscure scientific committee into the

was authority for the establishment of national ambient air quality standards control of air pollution and standards for air quality were considered primarily states right and responsibility beginning in 1963 however congress bega n establishing the framework for what became the naaqssetting process the clean air act of 1963 pl 88206 and the air quality act of 1967 pl 90 148 directed the secretary of health education and welfare10 to develop and issue to the states such criteria of air quality as in his judgment ma be requisite for the protec tion of the public health and welfare these criteria were to be issued after consultation with appropriate advisory committees and federa l departments and agencies and were to accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on health and welfare11 to provide scientific advice the surgeon general established national air quality criteria advisory committee naqcac in march 196812 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs5 12 continued ambient air pollutants aerosol science and technology volume 6 1987 p 101 13 four months after enactment of this au thority on april 30 1971 the epa administrator established the first naaqs simultaneously promulgating standards for six categories of pollutants particulate matter photochemica l oxidants principally ozone hydrocarbons sulfur oxides nitrogen dioxide and car bon monoxide with some modifications these naaqs form the cornerstone of the agencys air pollution regulatory programs today 37 years later three of the standards for so2 nox and co have changed little the pm and oxidant standards have been modified both in the form and the specified concentration of the pollutants reflecting the developing understanding of the effects of pm and ozone pollution but the categories of pollution being regulated have not changed the hydrocarbon standard was revoked in 1983 but hydrocarbons continue to be stringently regulated as volatile organic compounds in order for areas to meet the ozone naaqs 14 only one additiona l naaqs has been issued for lead in 1978 15 lippmann previously cited p 101establishment of the naaqs process the air quality criteria were originally intended primarily to assist the states in establishing their own air quality standards but they survive today as the first step in the establishment of national standards naaqs naaqs themselves were first required by the clean air act amendments of 1970 pl 91604 the 1970 amendments directed the new environmental protection agency which had taken over the air pollution functions of the health education and welfare department to promulgate naaqs for each pollutant for which air quality criteria had already been issued13 and to promulgate naaqs with respect to any additional air pollutant for which criteria would be issued after the date of enactment14 primary naaqs as described in section 109b1 were to be ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the administrator based on such cr iteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety are requisite to protect the public health secondary standards whi ch in practice are often the same as the primary were also to be based on the criteria and set at level requisite to protect the public welfar from any known or anticipated adverse effects section 109b2 the administr ator was permitted to revise both types of standards establishing formal review requirements sab and erddaa to assist the administrator in setting criteria th advisory committee established by the surgeon general in 1968 naqc ac was transferred to epa in 1970 as part of the reorganization plan that established epa but it had statutory authority according to lippmann former chai r of casac and perhaps the man most familiar with the history epa did not nece ssarily feel obliged to follow the advice of the committee15 beginning in 1974 epa reorganized its science advisory structure several times ultimately abolishing naqcac over the st rong objections of its chairman and members and reassigning the members to the agencys science advisory board sab according to lippmann at the time it was abolished it had been surveying the contents of all the cds criteria documents and was drafting final report thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs6 16 ibid 17 us house of representatives committee on science and technology the environmental protection agency research program with prim ary emphasis on the community health and environmental surveillance system chess an investigative report november 1976recommended complete review and revisions of all the air quality criteria documents16 about this time the house sc ience and technology committee held hearings and produced an investigative report on series of epa studies that were intended to provide an improve d health basis for the naaqs17 the report led to provisions in the environmental res earch and development demonstration authorization act of 1978 enacted in november 1977 erddaa pl 95155 that required the sab to review all scientific information on which air quality standards are based 1977 clean air act amendment s deadli nes and c asac the process of establishing naaqs in section 109 of the clean air act was also amended in the clean air act amendments of 1977 pl 9595 adding two major dimensions first in section 109d1 the act estab lished more formal requirement for review and revision of the naaqs directing the ad ministrator to review the criteria and standards by december 31 1980 and at fiveyear intervals thereafter for variety of reasons lack of resources inadequaci in draft documents competing demands on agency managers and in some cases lack of political will these reviews have generally not taken place on the schedule mandated but by establishing nondiscretionary duty of the administrator the 1977 act has allowed citizen suits to force the administrator to undertake reviews second in section 109d2 the ame ndments required the epa administrator to appoint an independent scientific review committ ee to which epa gave the name casac requiring that it also comple review of the criteria and standards by december 31 1980 and at fiveyear interv als thereafter and that it recommend to the administrator any new naaqs and revisi ons of existing criteria and standards as may be appropriate wh ile casac is directed to review the criteria and naaqs and make recommendations to the administrator the administrator is not under legal obligation to follow casacs advice as noted below however section 307d of the clean air act requires the admin istrator to explain the reasons for any differences from casacs or the nationa l academy of sciences recommendations thus in the same year 1977 congress ga ve authority to both casac and the sab to review air quality criteria nd naaqs epa resolved this potentially overlapping jurisdiction by making casa c part of the science advisory board there have been changes to thes legislative requirements since 1977 specifics of the statutory requirements in section 108 the clean air act requires the administrator to provide specific information regarding criteria pollutants without specifying the form of any required documents it describes at some length what the criteria shall refl ect and include in response to this language epa has developed what it has called criteria document whenever it hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs7 reviewed or established new naaqs the criteria document summarizes the state of scientific knowledg regarding the effects of the pollutant in question second document that epa has prepared as part of the naaqssetting or revision process the staff paper summarizes the information compiled in the criteria document and provides the administrator with options regarding the indicators averaging times statistical form and numerical level concentration of the naaqs the staff paper has statutory basis but it is hard to imagine the setting of standard wit hout some document or docum ents that would serve its purpose section 109 of the clean air act make s clear that naaqs are to be proposed and promulgated as regulations thus requiring their publication in the federal register the procedural requirements are addressed in sec tion 307d which exempts naaqs promulgation or revision from the requirements of the administrative procedure act but establishes its own in most cases similar requirements section 307d requires the establishment of rulemaking docket it requires notice of proposed rulemaking in the federal register accompanied by statement of the proposals basis and purpos including summary of the factual data on which the pr oposed rule is based the methodology used in obtaining and analyzing the data and the major legal interpretations and policy considerations underlying the proposed rule the statemen t is required to set forth or summarize and provide reference to any pertinen t findings recommendations and comments by casac and the national cademy of sciences and if the proposal differs in any important respect from any of these recomme ndations provide an explanation of the reasons for such differences section 307d also requires that any drafts of proposed and final rules submitted by the administrator to the office of management and budget omb prior to proposal or promulgation all docum ents accompanying those drafts and all written comments thereon and epa res ponses to such comments be pl aced in the docket later than the date of proposal or promulgation the promulgated naaqs like the propos ed rule must appear in the federal register it must be accompanied by statement of basis and purpose and an explanation of the reasons for any major changes from the proposed rule as well as response to each of the significant co mments criticisms nd new data submitted during the public comment period standardsetting in practice in practice naaqs standardsetting has not directly followed the path envisioned in the statute only one of the six standards for photochemical oxidantsozone wa s reviewed by december 31 1980 and none has been reviewed at fiveyear intervals since that time several reviews have been begun only to languish for years in lim bo with criteria being issued and decisions as to standards being made th agency has rarely had the resources to conduct more than two reviews at time c itizen suits have generally been the factor that sets the agencys priorities role of casac as discussed further in later sections of this report the clean air scientific advisory committee has been one of the few exceptions to this recordhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs8 18 casacs establishment by statute and its modus operandi apparently grew out of the experience of an ad hoc scientific advisory body that helped epa develop the naaqs for lead in the 1970s for the history of this see roger mcclellan

provided much of the discipline to keep the naaqs process moving and has set high standards for agency reviews as result the completed reviews have generally elicited respect from the scientific community and have generally survived court challenge at the same time casacs role has been somewhat different than that specified by the letter of the statute18 rather than conduc t its own independent reviews of naaqs casac in practice has fulfilled its obligations by reviewing and evaluating the adequacy of the key documents the criteria document and staff paper prepared by epa staff as they develop or review naaqs in conducting these reviews casac has played an important role in the decisionmaking process in general th administrator has not proposed revision of naaqs until casac provides him or her what have been called closure letters stating its consensus that the criteria document and staff paper provide an adequate scientific basis for regulatory decisionmaking the closure letter is not statutorily required it dates from j une 1979 memorandum pres ented to casac by key officials in epas office of research and development office of air quality planning and standards and the casac staff officer19 until the pm review completed in 2006 however every naaqs revi ew resulted in closure letters before the criteria document and staff paper went to the administrator for decisions on naaqs revision as will be discussed fu rther below this departure from past practice in the 2006 naaqs for pm was oppos ed by numerous current and former casac members in comments to epa20 staff paper recommendations the recommendations in staff papers have tended to provide range of options so that the administrators choice often fell somewhere within the range discussed fo r example in 1997 when epa revised the pm standard the staff pa per recommended 24hour pm25 standard somewhere in the range of 20 to 65 µgm3 the administrator chose 65 µgm3 as the standard the staff paper also recommended an annual standard of 125 to 20 µgm3 the administrator chose 15 µgm3 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs9 21 grant padgett and yosie memo p 2 previously cited 22 personal communication vanessa vu direct or science advisory board staff office us epa april 24 2006on several occasions the administrator took acti on despite staff paper recommendation for example in 1990 staff paper on revision of the lead standard recommended range of st andards from 05 to 15 µgm3 vs the existing standard of 15 µgm3 monthly rather than quarterly averaging period and more frequent sampling epa took action on th recommendations however and never formally published decision the sulfur dioxide review completed in 1996 provides slightly different example in which the agency deviated from staff paper recommendations in this case the staff paper recommended three possible regulatory alternatives 1 establish new 5minute naaqs 2 establish ne w regulatory program under the general authority of section 303 of the clean air act or 3 retain the existing suite of standards but augment their implementati on by focusing on those sources likely to produce high 5minute peak so2 levels epa retained the existing standard but has not addressed the augmentation issue early reports memoranda concerning the naaqs process after the last statutory changes to the naaqssetting process in 1977 numerous reports and memoranda discussed casacs role and the standardsetting process in general this section briefly reviews these reports and memoranda before we turn to the 2006

these reports and memos made num ber of recommendations that have resurfaced in the december 2006 revisions to the naaqs review process these include repeated conclusions that the criteria documents are too long or too encyclopedic and need to be focused on key scientific issues to improve the focus casac as early as 1981 called for the identif ication of critical sc ientific issues and greater public involvement in the early stages of the naaqs review process casac both in 1981 and 1985 also called fo r increased efforts to develop and incorporate risk assessment methodologie s in order to

released april 3 2006 th recommendations were presented as measures that could enha nce the efficiency and timeliness of the overall naaqs review process33 in calling for better risk asse ssment the 2006 review echoed the recommendations of both the 1981 and 1985 casac reviews better risk assessment would presumably clarify the policy choices the administrator faces in making naaqs decisions at the same time it is difficult to see how adding third significant document to the process would enhance its timeliness as stated in the report in its may 12 2006 letter to th epa administrator casac raised this point noting that casac would now have to double up the scientific subject matter to be considered at certain meetings the casac chair wrote therefore it was not apparent to us how the suggested alterations would make the naaqs process more efficient or streamlined on the contrary epas proposed process appears to be less timeconsuming and likely more resourceintensive than the current proc ess indeed rather than helping the agency moreeasily achieve its naaqs reviews for the six criteria air pollutants within the statutorilymandated fivey ear period ie per the clean air act amendments of 1977 codified at 42 us c sec 7409 the proposed process would seemingly ensure that courtordered completion dates the result of external litigation would continue to be the principal

involved in deciding the scope of such document as well as deciding whether such document would continue to reflect staff views epa nior management views or both and how that choice may affect the process by which such document would be reviewed by casac and the public36 the december 7 2006 decision memorandum reite rates the language of the april 3 recommendation in stating the agency will develop policy assessment that reflects the agencys views consistent with epa practice in other rulemakings this policy assessment should be published in the federal register as an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr with supporting documents placed in the rulemaking record as appropriate the use of an anpr will provide an opportunity for both casac and the public to evaluate the policy options under consideration and offer detailed comments and recommendations to inform the development of proposed rule37 number of observers have interpreted this language to mean that casac will review the policy options after completion of the document rather than before diminishing its role in the naaqsreview pr ocess in its july 18 2006 letter to the administrator casac said that it wished to review both first and second draft version of the policy assessment pa doc ument before the issuance of notice of proposed rulemaking the december 7 d ecision memorandum doe s not address this wish

the committee these were that epa prepare more comprehensive guidance on casacs statutory role to enhance the or ientation of panel members and increase awareness of the importan ce of maintaining the distinction between science and policy judgments in casacs recommendations that further consideration be given by epa and perhaps communication with casac regarding the issue of casac closure on epa documents and that epas sab staff office consider issues related to the selection and management of casa c naaqs review panels42 these recommendations may have arisen s imply from concerns for effectiveness ie they may represent only concern that the agency better orient new members make the selection process fo r review panels more transparent and review the issue of closure which was raised by seve ral current and former casac members in comments they submitted to the workgroup but coming in the context of the other recommendations they raised the possibility that epa intended to

and the need to reinstate the closure procedure criteria document commenters generally agreed that cds are too encyclopedic take too long to compile are too difficult to read and are not sufficiently focused on research that would inform the naaqs review process commenters had number of suggestions for improving the process which are reflected in the workgroups recomme ndations epas february 2006 cd on ozone was mentioned by seve ral commenters as vast imp rovement and model for future efforts closure the closure issue was raised by 7 of the current or former casac members who generally felt that the lack of closure on the pm staff paper completed in 2005 was serious and unwarranted break with precedent and contributed to the controversy over the administrators choice of an annual pm25 standard crs contacted ep staff to ask for background concerning the change in policy on closure in particular epa was asked if there were memorandum or guidance document either from casac or from the agency that explained the new policy epas response was that there was in fact change in policy the current casac chair who assumed the chairmanship in 2005 simply stopped using the term closure according to the director of the science advisory board staff office she is trying to get away from the implication that casac approves of the document its semantic difference44 casac commenters appeared to strongly disagree with that assessment dr george wolff for example said the recent decision by the agency to eliminate the need for casac closure will shorten the process but in my opinion was bad decision and i fear that quality will suffer the iterative review process leading to closure gave the agency incentive to produce document that ca sac would approve removing that incentive could lead to inferior products45httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs17 46 lippmann in workgroup report attachments p a20 47 mauderly in workgroup report attachments p a23 48 goldstein in workgroup report attachments p a12dr morton lippmann stated it is important that any changes made in the process do not weaken the longestablished integrity objectivity and credibility of the process to the scientific community and interested st akeholders this needs to be explicitly considered in light of the recent changes in sab staff management of casacs modus operandi in relation to its demands for discontinuing the issuance of formal casac closure letter on air quality criteria documents cds and staff papers sps from the casac review process this management decision was unwise 46 several of the statements regarding the cl osure decision show the strong feelings it generated among casa c members dr joe mauderly stated one of the reasons given for the recent apparently successful move by epa to relegate casac to reviewer rather than an approver of documents is that it slows the process that is pure balderda sh i cannot recall single instance over my 15 years of experience with the committee that casac was truly the root cause of significant delay on the ot her hand i can recall multiple instances in which if casac had not the preroga tive to close on documents epa was clearly on track to ignore scientific ad vice and move forward with inadequate documents or incorrect conclusions47 dr bernard goldstein added epas recent decision tells the scientific community that it is not worth our time to be i nvolved in the epa advisory process48 casacs july 18 2006 letter to the admin istrator attempted to resolve the closure issue by saying that in order to avoid any implication that closure meant approval the committee would go back to the original wording of the 1979 memo in which the term closure was first used when the casac thinks that the science presented in particular document is adequate for rulemaking it will affirmatively state so in the closing paragraph of the final letter to the administrator regarding the review of that document this issue was not addressed in epas december 7 2006 decision memorandum public comments and transparency third issue raised by several commenters was sense that epa and ca sac do not adequate ly consider public comments during the preparation of the criteria document and staff paper in large part because of the lack of deadline for submission for example dr george wolff stated over the years there have been numerous excellent scientific comments produced by various organizations unfortunately th ey typically arrive day or two before the casac meeting which gives the memb ers insufficient time to digest themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs18 49 wolff in workgroup report attachments pp 2728 50 hopke in workgroup report attachments p a19 51 wolff in workgroup report attachments p a28 52 henderson in workgroup report attachments p a14 some agency response to the public comment documents should be prepared and provided to casac49 on related note dr roger mcclellan complained that too many of casacs meetings are now being scheduled as tel econferences of which only summary transcript is later made available timeliness and efficiency there was general agreement that the biggest obstacle to more timely completion of naaqs reviews was the poor quality of initial cd and staff paper drafts that epa presen ted to casac for review the net result is an iterative ping pong process in which casac requests improvements to the documents and epa revises them until after several iterations casac finally closes on the documents adequacy distinguishing scientific judgm ents from policy choices and values another area in which epa asked for comments was on the issue of how to distinguish more clearly scientific conclusions and advice from policy judgments and recommendations this question produced consensus on one hand dr ellis cowling and others noted that casac is required by the statute to recommend to the administrator any new ambient air qua lity standards as dr hopke noted in distinguishing between scie nce and policy judgments i hearken back to the law which asks the committee to recommend standard casac has typically left the recommendati on to the staff through closure on the sp now since closure has been eliminated it becomes incumbent on the committee to make formal recommendation and this will clearly include more than the science the loss of closure has helped to blur the line between scientific advice and clearly leads to the committee taking more active policy role50 on the other hand dr wolff argued th at particularly in its january 17 2006 letter regarding the proposed pm standard s casac has clearly overstepped their boundaries and ventured into the policy arena51 somewhere between these views are the comments of dr rogene henderson the current chair of casac who states the agency should make clear to casac what they require in terms of scientific advice and what they consider to be policy issues on which they do not need advice the line between science and policy is not always apparent and this difference should be made clear in th charge questions given to casac52 similar point is made by another longtime casac member dr joe mauderlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs19 53 mauderly in workgroup report attachments pp a24 a25 54 goldstein p a11 in workgroup report attachments 55 mcclellan p 5 in workgroup report attachments 56 lippmann p a20 in workgroup report attachmentsneither scientists nor policy makers want to draw the line or to define it or admit to it casac meetings ar rife with discussions about how its pronouncements will affect policy and scientist advocates on casac and its panels as well as others game the system to achieve th eir ideological policy goals when epa proposes or promulgates standards it is re luctant to state clearly how science and policy enter into the decision it wants to portray that all is based on science these behaviors are absolutely understandable most scientists are convinced that they know whats best for the country and epa administrators dont want to admit to any motive other than the best science at present my only suggestion is that the administrator make explicit much more so than at present just how science and policy separately bore on the proposed standard and how the two were integrated53 consensus observation in reviewing the many comments on the naaqs process much was found to critic ize or to recommend but perhaps more striking than the criticism was the degree to which commenters appear to believe that the system has worked as stated by dr bernard goldstein former chair of casac and former assistant administrator of epas office of research and development in my teaching of envir onmental health policy to both public health students and to law students i routinely present the naaqs standardsetting process as one that represents an ideal in terface between science and regulation54 dr roger mcclellan who in some respects was critical of the process stated without question the casac has played critical role in ensuring that the final criteria documents were of high scientific quality the activities of the casac in my opinion have been in accord with the language and intent of the clean air act 1977 and consistent ov er time with the evolution of casac practices that have received substantial public and legal scrutiny the modus operandi has proved successful in helping to ensure that the naaqss are sciencebased55 dr lippmann asked can the process for settin g naaqs be st rengthened the easy answer is of course it can and i will address how it can in text that follows however it is important that any changes made in the process do not weaken the longestablished integrity objectivity and credibility of the process to the scientific community and interested stakeholders56 conclusions sections 108 and 109 of the clean air ac t establish statutory requirements for the identification of naaqs or

reviewing_naaqspdf review of the naaqs standards but the pr ocess used by epa is as much the result of 37 years of agency practice as it is of statutory requirements in section 109 for example the statute establishes the clean air scientific advisory committee to make recommendations to the administrator regarding new naaqs nd at fiveyear intervals to make reviews of existin g naaqs with recommendations for revisions in practice epa staff not casac have prepared these reviews drafting criteria documents which review the science and health effects of criteria air pollutants and staff papers which make policy recomme ndations casacs role has been to review and approve these epa documents before they went to the agencys political appointees and the administr ator for final decisions under epas new procedures epas political appointees have role early in the process helping to choose the scientif ic studies to be re viewed and casac will longer approve the policy staff pa per with its recommendations to the administrator casacs iterative role that refined the epa staff paper conclusions could be eliminated and the committee relegated to commenting on the policy paper after it appears in the federal register during public comment period57 the goal according to agency officials is to speed up the review process which has consistently taken longer than the fi ve years allowed by statute these improvements will help the agency meet the goal of reviewing each naaqs on fiveyear cycle as required by the clean air act without compromising the scientific integrity of the process58 according to the memorandum that finalized the changes the changes have caused concern among environmental groups and some in the scientific community however because they say they give larger role to the agencys political appointees and sm aller role to epa staff and casac casacs statutory role if congress chooses to review these new procedures one issue that it may wish to focus on is the statutory role of casac whether it should play some formal role in approving the administrators choice of standards under current law casacs role is purely advisory epa is not required by the clean air act to follow casacs recommendations the act in section 307d3 requires only that when the ad ministrator proposes new or revised naaqs in the federal register he set forth any pertinent findings recommendations and comments by ca sac and the national academy of sciences and if his proposal differs in an important respect from any of their recommendations provide an explanation of the reasons for such differences httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33807crs21 59 in the administrators judgment th science underlying casacs recommendation regarding the pm25 naaqs was not sufficient relying primarily on two studies neither of which provides clear basis for selec ting level lower than the current standard the administrator agreed with casac that th science shows relationship between higher levels of pm25 and an array of adverse health effects but he maintained that there was too much uncertainty in the analysis to justify lowering the annual standard see discussion beginning at

in practice has tended to play larger role evaluating epa staffs analysis of the science and its polic recommendations and withholding formal closure on the agency documents until it was satisfied that the documents accurately reflected the state of the science the statute has never required epa to have casacs appr oval before proposing or prom ulgating naaqs revisions but in practice the need to build record that it could defend against court challenges has generally led epa to promulgate sta ndards within the range of casacs recommendations in 2006 for the first time the administrat or promulgated st andards outside of that range59 and casac in written response ma clear that it felt the standards did not meet the statutory re quirements that may be th role congress intended for casac or it may not on one hand c ongress could conclude that casac has overstepped its bounds in essence judging an administrators final decision in contrast to its statutory ma ndate to make reco mmendations beforehand on the other hand congress might conclude that the ad ministrators judgment should have been constrained to the range of options that casac established as being supported by the science judicial review the courts are likely to play role here as well thirteen states the district of co lumbia electric utilities and other industry groups groups representing farmers and ranchers and several environmental groups have challenged the pm standards in court60 legal challenges to naaqs are not unusual in reviewing epa regulations in the past courts have ofte n deferred to the administrators judgment on scientific matters focusing more on issues of procedure jurisdiction and standing nevertheless casac s detailed objections to the administrators decisions and its desc ription of the process as having failed to meet statutory and procedural requirements could play ro as these standards are reviewed in court the subsequent ozone review which was completed in march 2008 provides second example of the administrator not following casacs recommendations61 as of this writing the new standard had not been challenged in court but it is expected that it will be giving

major concerns that the old process spent too much time compiling an encyclopedic review of the literature much of which had little relevance to the policy questions that needed to be addressed with respect to epa taking comments from casac at the same time that it considers comments from the public casacs chair was reported to say some of the members were concerned but most are not because it

reported that the committee would compose another letter to the epa administrator critical of the new process henderson casac chair dr rogene hende rson said the staff paper had been based on

january 2008 casacs concerns now informed by experience with each step of the new review process crystalliz ed in fourpage letter to administrator johnson the committee discussed significant problems that exist in the latter steps of this new review process specifically the absence of staff paper document highlyvalued by casac for its thorough an alysis of the new scientific evidence its presentation of the possible alternatives for the standards and most importantly its provision of the scientific eviden ce undergirding those alternatives66 the committee said it had been reassured that the policy assessment to be published as an advance notice of pr oposed rulemaking anpr would be functionally equiva lent to the staff paper but in practice in the ongoing review of the lead naaqs it found that the anpr was both unsuitable and inadequate as basis for rulemaking 67 the letter states that there is stark contrast between the empty and regressive nature of the anpr which is not true policy assessment and the scholarly and complete scientific analyses presented in epas staff paper68 the letter noted that the anpr asked fo r comment on options that had already been dismissed on scientific grounds the re sult is that rather than inducing greater efficiency in the review process it slows down the process through its illogical contemplation of greater number of options as time progresses69 while agreeing that there may be role for an anpr at the beginning of the review process the letter concludes by reitera ting casacs view of its statutory mission in reviewing the policy assessment furthermore it is essential that this policy assessment document be furnished to the casac for peerreview in public advi sory meetings in the same manner as multiple drafts of the staff paper were provided to the committee for review under the previous process it cannot be overstated that in order to fulfill its congressionallymandated and thus legal role the committee needs to conduct thorough and open evaluation of this best available science ie the scientific justification and underlying analyses of the various options for standardsetting that the
