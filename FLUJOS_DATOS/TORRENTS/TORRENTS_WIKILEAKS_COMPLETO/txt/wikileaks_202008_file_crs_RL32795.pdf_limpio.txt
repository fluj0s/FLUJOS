home mortgage financing3 to help these institutions accomplish this mission congress has provi ded them with veral benefits not available to other financial institutions4 these statutory benefits provide the enterprises with lower funding costs th ability to operate with less capital and lower direct costs5 the advantages of gse status have enabled the enterprises to grow rapidly and become

of the enterprises be maintained so that they can meet their public policy mission and not pose risks to taxpayers prior to 1992 oversight was the responsibility of the department of housing nd urban development hud and the federal home loan bank board in 1992 congress established th office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo an independent agen cy within hud to oversee the financial

after the creation of ofheo total assets at the gses grew by more than 820 to 19 trillion at the end of 20036 the gses have become two of the largest private debt issuers in the world in 2003 outsta

mortgagebacked securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac7 as result of the rapid growth of these institutions and their implied federal backing there has been an increasing concern that the enterprises may pose problem of systemic risk to the financial system8 many financial institutions around the world hold large quantities of gse debt and default by either gse could have widespread unpredictable and potentially serious repercussions accordingly questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the current regulatory environment events of the past two years have br ought new

and practices at fannie mae and published its preliminary findings in september 200410 ofheo charged that fannie mae did not follow generally accepted accounting practices in two critical areas 1 amortization of discounts premiums and fees involved in the purchase of home mortgages and 2 accounting for financial derivatives contracts according to ofheo these deviations from standard accounting rules allowed fannie mae to reduce volatility in reported earnings present investors with an artificial picture of steadily growing profits and in at least one case to meet financial performance targets that triggered the payment of bonuses to company executives11 on december 15 2004 the securities and exchange commission sec essentially endor sed ofheos report and directed fannie mae to restate its accounting results since 2001 after finding inadequacies in fannies accounting polic ies and methodologies fannie maes ceo and cfo stepped down soon thereafter while problems at fannie mae

responsibilities for low nd moderateincome housing for debts incurred by the federal government in ndling deposit insurance crises of the 1970s and 1980s and for some comm unity development projects several bills were considered in the 108th congress that would have restructured ofheo while the proposals took somewhat different approaches to regulatory reform all appeared to abolish ofheo and reconstitute the gse regulator within the department of the treasury or as an independent agency12 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32795crs4 13 statement of secretary john w snow on senate banking bill to

assessments from the annual ppropriations process and enhance the safety and soundness nd enforcement tools available to the new regulator none of these bills whose provisions are summarized in crs report rl32069 improving the effectiveness of gse versight legislative proposals in the 108th congress by loretta nott and mark jickling were enacted legislative proposals in the 109th congress incorporated most of the features of the 108th congress bills but also include significant new provisions as discussed below and set out in table 1 the bush administration has generally supported gse regulatory reform treasury secretary john snow issued st atement following the mark up of s 190 praising the legislation though noting th at certain elements the administration wanted were not present in the bill the legislation creates significantly enhanced market discipline and capital requirements for fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks the legislation strikes proper and prudent balance in ensuring that the activities undertaken by these entities do not engender systemic risk while providing broad access to housing finance13 major differences between house and senate bills the house and senate bills take common approach to the restructuring of the gse regulator there is general consensus that ofheo needs to be strengthened given the importance of the gses to th financial system and the potential risks they pose there is very little support fo r keeping the gse regulator inside hud both hr 1461 and s 190 give the new ag ency tools and authorities that resemble those of federal bank regulators where the bills differ most significantly is in their approaches to the business operations of the gses particularly fannie and freddie the house bill seeks to increase gse support for lowincome housing and would permit fannie and freddie to buy larger mortgages than current law permits while the senate bill seeks to shrink the companies portfolios by restricting the kinds of assets they can purchase affordable housing fund section 128 of hr 1461 as passed the house requires fannie and freddie to establish affordable housing funds to in crease homeownership among very low and extremely low income families to increase investment in housing in low income andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32795crs5 14 the difference is in the range of 2540 basis points or hundredths of percent some of the difference might persist even if the loan limits were abolishedeconomically distressed areas and to increas and preserve the supply of rental and owneroccupied housing for very low and extremely low income families each enterprise shall allocate to this fund 35 of its aftertax income during the first year after enactment and 5 in subs equent years had the 5 rate been in effect during the five years ending with 2003 the two firm s combined contributions to these funds would have averaged about 620 million per year the senate bill contains comparable provision proponents of the affordable housing funds recognize that fannie and freddie receive valuable subsidy in the form of their gse status which permits them to borrow at lower rates than other private fi nancial firms the affordable housing fund proposal can be viewed as m eans of capturing some of the value of this subsidy and applying it to worthy policy objective opponents argue that fannie and freddie would likely use the funds to reward political allies during floor considera tion of hr 1461 an amendment was adopted that prohibited the use of money disbur sed by the affordable housing funds for political lobbying or advocacy purposes other amendments included fiveyear sunset for the fund with the director of the new regulator to recommend to congress whether the fund should be extended and tablished priority for activities in areas affected by hurricanes katrina and rita and in other areas designated by the president as major disaster areas conforming loan limits current law sets limit on the size of mortgages that fannie and freddie can buy mortgages above the limit called jumbo loans are less likely to be securitized than the conforming mortgages that fannie and freddie are allowed to purchase partly as result mortgage rates for nonconforming loans are slightly higher than conforming loan rates14 critics of the conforming an limit argue that the limit has disparate geographical effect in some areas of the country the limit which was 417000 for singlefamily homes in 2006 and 2007 covers all but the high end of the market while in other areas such as san francisco or new york city virtually all real estate transac tions take place over the limit hr 1461 would raise the conforming loan limit in metropolitan areas where the median home price exceeds the current limit in those areas the limit would be set at the median home price up to ce iling of 150 of the current limit for more information on this proposal see crs report rs22172 proposed changes to the conforming loan limit by barbara miles and mark jickling like the affordable housing fund provisi on the proposal to raise the loan limit in highcost areas recognizes that gs status confers subsidy on fannie and freddie and seeks to attain more unifo rm distribution of the benefits of that subsidy in the process raising the limit increases the size of the subsidy allowing fannie and freddie to expand operations in to the jumbo mortgage market enhanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32795crs6 15 eg testimony of alan greenspan chairma n board of governors of the federal reserve system before the house committee on financial services feb 17 2005the value of the gses funding advantage which is dependent on their gse status the senate bill has comparable provision portfolio limits while the two house bill provisions disc ussed above seek to redistribute the fruits of the gse subsidy the senate bill contains provision that could dramatically reduce the value of that subsidy both fannie and freddie hold large portfolios of mortgages and mortgagebacked securities which generate interest income they pay for those mortgage assets by issuing debt securities at rates below what the mortgages and mortgagebacked bonds pay the difference between the yield on mortgagerelated assets and the gses cost of funds is profit thus the gses have strong incentive to pursue portfolio growth the two firms together have nearly 15 trillion in portfolio assets leading some obs ervers to describe them as the worlds largest savings and loan institutions th size of their portfolios represents concentration of mortgage market risk that led former federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan and others to urge congress to consider ways to shrink the size of the gses asset portfolios15 section 109 of s 190 as reported enumerat the types of permissible assets that fannie and freddie would be permi tted to purchase they would only be allowed to acquire mortgages and mortgagebacked securities for purposes of securitization and for certain other limite d purposes under this proposal fannie and freddies business models would be considerably altere d instead of very large investment funds they would be transf ormed into conduits buying mortgages from the original lenders pooling them packaging them into mortgagebacked securities and selling them to bond investors this would greatly reduce their portfolio earnings currently one of the chief sources of their profits proponents of portfolio limits argue that this step is necessary to reduce the cost of the gse subsidy to taxpayers which takes the form not of annual appropriations but of the assumption of risk the potential cost to the treasur of having to bail out either fannie or freddie to avoid the possibility of syst emic catastrophe in th financial markets should either firm encounter serious difficulties oppone nts argue that reducing the gses interest earnings would mean ss support for low nd moderateincome housing goals the house bill contains similar provision under hr 1461 the new regulator would ve authority to cap the size of the gse portfolios as part of its general safetyandsoundness author ity however the house bill would not impose statutory re quirement that the portfolios be shrunk the table below provides sidebysi summary of legislative proposals introduced
