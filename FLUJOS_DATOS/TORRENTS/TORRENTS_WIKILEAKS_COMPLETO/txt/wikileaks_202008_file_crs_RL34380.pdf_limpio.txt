under the general schedule gs and certain ot her systems are governed by section 529 of pl 101 509 the federal employees pay comparability act of 1990 fepca which generally requires that covered employees receive an annual basic pay adjustment and localitybased comparability payment for the gs pay adjustment that took effect in january 2008 the size of the total pay increase ie the annual adjustment plus locality pay varied across the 32 pa areas but averaged 35 nationwide in recent years t hough an increasing number of gs employees have not received all of the base and locality pay increases that we re designated for their pay areas by law 5 usc 5304g1 base gs pay and locality pay combined cannot exceed level iv of the executive schedule exiv which for 2008 is set at 1490 00 therefore gs employees whose total pay was already equivalent to exiv could only receive the same amount of pa increase that was provided to employees in the executive schedule which for 2008 was 25 any employees whose pay was below exiv but after the increase would have been above level iv could only receive portion of the total increase scheduled for other employees in their pay area for the gs pay adjustment that took effect in january 2008 more than 7100 gs15 and equivalent employees in 12 pay areas did not receive all of the pay increase designated for th eir pay areas an increase of more than 6000 capped employees from the year before primarily because the exiv cap affected employees in the washington dc pay area for the first time some gs15 employees have been affected by the cap since 2002 and em ployees in three additional pay areas may be affected in 2009 by 2012 certain gs 14 employees may also begin to be affected as result of the exiv cap the affected employees salaries are substantially lower than they would have b een had the cap not been in effect and any pensions that they are due to receive in the future will also be lower this report provides information on the

the department of continuedthe executive schedule iv pay cap on general schedule compensation introduction on january 4 2008 president george w bush signed an executive order implementing the 2008 pay adjustment s for most federal employees1 as result employees within the general schedule gs and related pay sy stems covering more than 13 million of the nearly 19 million employees in the executive branch as of september 20072 received an average 35 pay increase 25 acrosstheboard increase to their base pay under 5 us c 5303 and an average 1 locality pay increase under 5 usc 5304 the size of the locality portion of the pay increase varied by pay area based on differences in the size of the federalnonfederal pay differential in those areas3 as result the total pay increase provided to gs employees ie the acrosstheboard increase plus locality pay was often either somewhat more than or somewhat less than the 35 national average for example gs employees in indianapolis in received 296 total pay increase in january 2008 whereas gs employees in sa n francisco ca received an increase of 423 and employees in washington dc received 449 increase however in recent years an increasing number of gs employees have not received all of the base and locality pay increases that we re designated for their pay areas by law 5 usc 5304g1 an employees base gs pay and locality pay combined

level iv could only recei ve portion of the total increase for the adjustment that took effect on january 6 2008 more than 7100 gs and gsequivalent employees in 12 pay areas did not receive all of the pay increase for their pay areas some gs employees have been affected by the cap since 2002 as result these capped employees salaries are substantially lower than they would have been had the pay caps not been in effect and any pensions that they are due to receive in the future will also be lower because federal pensions are based in part on the average of the highest three consecutive years of base pay5 this report provides information on the ffect of the exiv pay cap on pay for gs employees and discusses the potential implications of the pay cap on the ability of agencies to recruit and retain staff first the report describes the gs and executive schedule pay systems and th annual pay adjustment process general schedule pay adjustments created by the classification act of 1949 the gs pay system is divided into 15 grades of difficulty and responsibility of work with 10 steps within each grade that employees progress across through longevity and at least an acceptable level of performance the duties and responsibilitie s of gs15 employees are described in 5 usc 5104 as follows grade gs15 includes those classes of pos itions the duties of which are to perform under general administrative direction with very wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment work of outstanding difficulty and responsibility along special technical supervisory or administrative lines which has demonstrated leadership and excepti onal attainments b to serve as head of major organization within bureau involving work of comparable level c to plan and direct or to plan and execute specialized programs of marked difficulty responsibility and national significance along professional scientific technical administrative fi scal or other lines requiri ng extended training and experience which has demonstrated leadership and unusual attainments in professional scientific or technical re search practice or administration or in administrative fiscal or other specialized activities or d to perform consulting or other professional scientific techni cal administrative fiscal or other specialized work of equal importance difficulty and responsibility and requiring comparable qualifications annual pay adjustments for employees unde r the gs and certain other systems are governed by section 529 of p l 101509 the federal employees pay comparability act of 1990 fepca whic h generally require s that coveredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34380crs3 employees receive an annual basic pay ad justment and localitybased comparability payment the same amount of basic pay adju stment is provided to nearly all covered employees and is based on the bureau of labor statistics bls employment cost index eci which measures changes in private sector wages and salaries federal pay rates are generally require d to be increased by an amount that is 05 less than the percentage change in the eci from one year to the next but the law stipulates 15month lag at the time of each adjustme nt for example the pay increase for january 2008 was based on the percentage ch ange in the eci from the quarter ending on september 30 2005 to the quarter nding on september 30 2006 the eci change for this period was 30 so th formula required th at the basic pay adjustment ie without the locality di fferential for january 2008 would be 25 however fepca also authorizes the presid ent to issue an alternative pay plan by september 1 of the year prior to the sche duled effective date in the event of national emergency or serious economic conditions affectin g the general welfare the locality portion of the annual adjus tment for gs and other employees is based on comparison of federal pay rate s for particular pos itions to nonfederal rates of pay as measured by bls surveys within designated local pay areas in 2008 there are 32 such local pay areas inc luding one called rest of the united states those pay areas and how they ar referred to later in this report are

alternative level of localitybased comparability paym ents because of national emergency or serious economic conditions ffecting the general welfare to do so the president must transmit report to congress at least one month before the comparability payments would be payable that describes the alternative level of payments and why the alternative level is necessary this complicated formula for calculating basic and locality payments notwithstanding fepca has never been implemented without presidential or congressional intervention annual basic pay adjus tment was made in 1994 and the

13454 jan 4 2008 the process by which gs pay rates are co mpared to pay rates outside the federal government within local pay areas was determined by congress and is administered by the office of personnel ma nagement opm using data collected by bls that process has been examined by top compen sation experts in academia and elsewhere and found to be va lid and reliable6 such reviews have found consistently that federal pay lags behind the private sector by as much as 50 in some localities nevertheless concerns by congress and the current and previous presidents about the validity of the pay comparison pr ocess and the budgetary implications of implementing the results of that process have led to the establishment of alternative pay plans in virtually each year since fepca was enacted because of differences in locality paym ents provided the salaries associated with each gs grade and step vary by loca lity for example in 2008 gs salaries in indianapolis in range from low of 19349 to high of 140764 in san francisco ca gs salaries range from low of 22591 to high of 149000 executive schedule pay adjustments the executive schedule ex establis hed by section 303 of pl 88426 in

source crs based on information from opm if the exiv pay cap remains in place more and more locality pay areas and steps within those pay areas will likely be affected by the cap in the future as table 4 below shows if the exiv cap increases by 28 in january 2009 gs15 step 10 employees in three add itional pay areas philadelphia seattle and minneapolis are likely to have their sala ries capped at the exiv rate in 2009 by that point employees at gs15 step 10 and in several areas below step 10 in nearly half of the 32 pay areas would receive the same salary effectively eliminating for these employees the localitybased pay diversification that was contemplated by fepca the trend data indicate that gs15 step 10 employees in several other pay areas eg miami dallas cincinnati atlanta and cleveland may be capped by 2010 or 2011 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34380crs10 table 4 gs15 step 10 pay rates may be capped in three additional pay areas in 2009 year exiv capgs15 step 10 pay in

assume 28 increase in 2009 and 24 increases in 2010 and 2011 estimates for the gs15 step 10 rates in the five pay areas assume 40 increase in 2009 and 34 increases in 2010 and 2011 the average for these areas from 2004 thro ugh 2008 also because the exiv pay cap has affected gs15 employees at lower and lower steps over time eventually the cap is likely to affect employees at the gs14 pay grade as figure 2 below indicates based on the average rates of increase in the exiv cap and gs pay rates in san fr ancisco since 2002 gs 14 step 10 employees may be affected by the exiv pay cap in the year 2012 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34380crs11 source crs note estimates for the exiv caps assume 28 increase in 2009 and 24 increases in 2010 through 2013 estimates for the gs14 step 10 rates for 2009 thro ugh 2013 marked with asterisks assume 42 increase each year the average rates of increase in the san francisco pay area from 2004 thro ugh 2008 concluding observations because of the interaction between 1 the current exiv statutory limitation on gs base pay and locality pay and 2 the current salaries of some 275 exiv employees more than 7100 gs employees in 12 pay areas are not receiving pay increases that they would otherwise be due also the number of pay areas and gs employees affected by the exiv pay cap are expected to grow in the next few years based on recent trends by 2009 gs15 employ ees in nearly half of the 32 federal pay areas may be affected for these capped employees the notion of locality based differentials will have been diminished as all of them will be making the same salary regardless of location also because their salary increases are tied to the lower rates of increase in the executive schedule these gs15 employees will be losing buying power at the same rate as the executive schedule by 2012 certain gs14 employees in the san francisco pay area may have their pay capped should that occur some gs14 employees may be unwilling to be promoted after seeing that their pay cannot increase also some gs15 employees seeing that their highthree salaries used to calculate retirement annuities cannot incr ease at the same pace as lowergraded employees in the

employees highthree average salary would be 12565 less than it would have been without the cap as consequence the employees annual pens ion assuming exactly 30 years of service would be 7068 less than it would have been without the cap over 20year period of retirement not counting annual increas in pensions the employee could be expected to forgo an additional 141360 in retirement income because of

subcommittee on the federal workforce postal service and the district of columbia federal pay hearings 110th cong 1st sess july 31 2007 ms bonosaro said that gs employees working for one senior executive in high costofliving area were receiving salaries 20000 more than he is and th ey are also eligible for compensatory time for travel or work after duty hours or on weekendspay system linkages the link between exiv pay and the top of the gs pay system is only one of several statutorily ba sed interrelationships within nd between federal pay schedules the appendix of this report provides chart showing the salary and total compensation limitations between different schedules for example as discussed at length in another crs report the salaries of members of cong ress and officials paid at exii generally have been in parity since the executive schedule was established in 196411 in agencies where the senior executive service ses senior level sl and scientific or pr ofessional st appr aisal systems have not been certified by opm ses sl and st base pay cannot exceed ex iii but where those appraisal systems have been certified ba pay may be up to exii total compensation ie base salaries plus locality pay plus bonuses for gs em ployees cannot exceed exi the same cap that applies to ses sl and st employees in agencies without certified appraisal systems however in agencies where opm has certified the appraisal system total compensation for s sl and st employees can be as high as the vice presidents salary 221100 also under the ethics reform act of 1989 the pay adjustment for the executive schedule can be larger than the gs base pay adjustment regardle ss of the amount specified by the relevant eci data the december eci minus 05 because of this interlocking series of pay and compensation linkages raising the pay cap on gs pay rates eg from exiv to exiii to relieve the pay compression that has occurred at the gs15 level in recent years could create other problems for example raising the gs total pay cap ie base pay plus locality pay from exiv to exiii would allow gs employees to earn up to 158500 in 2008 the same cap that applies to sl st and ses employees in agencies without certified appraisal systems as result gs employees could earn as much or more than their supervisors this type of pay compression or pay inversion is reportedly already occurring in some areas with ses employees earning less than the employees they supervise12 on the other hand ses sl and st employees in agencies with certified appraisal systems can earn sa laries up to ex ii 172200 in 2008 andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34380crs14 13 as noted earlier in this report ses sl nd st employees in agencies with certified performance appraisal systems can earn
