points of order in the congressional budget process introduction the congressional budget act of 19741 established the basic framework that is used today for congressional consideration of budget and fiscal policy the act provided for the adoption of concurrent resolution on the budget budget resolution as mechanism for coordinating congressional budgetary decision making this process supplements other house and senate procedures for considering spending and revenue legislation by allowing congress to establish and enforce parameters with which those separate pieces of budgetary legislation must be consistent the parameters are established each year when congress adopts the budget resolution setting forth overall levels for new budget authority outlays revenues deficit and debt these overall spending levels are then allocated to the various committees in the house and senate responsible for spending legislation the overall levels and allocations are then enforced through the use of points of order and through implementing legislation such as that enacted through the reconciliation process2 points of order are prohibitions against certain types of legislation or congressional actions these prohibitions are enforced when member raises point or order against legislation that is alleged to violate these rules when it is considered by the house or senate points of order are not selfenforcing point of order must be raised by member on the floor of the chamber before the presiding officer can rule on its application and thus for its enforcement 1 the congressional budget act titles iix of pl 93344 has been amended on number of occasions since its enactment the most salient of the modifications has been as result of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 pl 99177 also known as grammrudmanhollings or grh the balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 pl 100119 the budget enforcement act of 1990 title xiii of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 title xiv of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 and title x of the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 2 the reconciliation process is an optional procedure set forth in section 310 of the congressional budget act first used in 1980 reconciliation is twostep process triggered when the budget resolution includes instructions to one or more committees directing them to recommend changes in revenue or spending laws necessary to achieve the overall levels agreed to the recommendations are then considered in one or more reconciliation measures under expedited procedures certain features of the reconciliation process are enforced by points of order that are included in this report for more on the reconciliation process generally see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr crs2 although the congressional budget process encompasses myriad procedures dealing with spending revenue and debt legislation this paper focuses only on that portion of the process that stems from the congressional budget act the tables below list the points of order currently included in the congressional budget act table 1 as well as related points of order established in other measures these other measures include the fy2009 budget resolution table 2 the fy2008 budget resolution table 3 hres 6 110th congress adopting the rules of the house for the 110th congress table 4 and the budget enforcement act of 1990 table 5 that pertain to the consideration contents or implementation of the budget resolution points of order are typically in the form of provision stating that it shall not be in order for the house or senate to take specified action or consider certain legislation that is inconsistent with the requirements of the budget act other provisions of the act formulated differently establish various requirements or procedures particularly concerning the contents and consideration of the budget resolution or reconciliation legislation these provisions however are not typically enforced through points of order and are not included here3 as amended through the balanced budget act of 1997 points of order in the congressional budget act are permanent none of the provisions listed in table 1 is scheduled to expire although several points of order have limited applicability or have been rendered moot by the expiration of limits they were intended to enforce4 the freestanding point of order protecting the social security trust fund in the house established in the budget enforcement act table 5 is also permanent however other points of order established under recent budget resolutions have various sunset provisions or limited application see table 2 and table 3 for current examples application of points of order most points of order in the budget act apply to measures as whole as well as to motions amendments or conference reports to those measures when point of order is sustained against consideration of some matter the effect is that the matter in question falls the application of points of order in the house is clarified in section 315 of the budget act this provision states that for cases in which reported measure is 3 for example the prohibition against motions to recommit concurrent resolutions on the budget in the house under section 305a2 of the act is typically not counted as separate point of order likewise the requirement under section 308a of the act for reports on legislation to include cost estimates is not formulated as point of order although the house has deemed it necessary to formally waive the provision on occasion 4 the expiration of the provisions of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act at the end of fy2002 has rendered moot number of points of order for example points of order provided in the congressional budget act to allow the senate to enforce discretionary spending limits section 312b or maximum deficit amounts section 312c have been rendered moot because statute currently specifies such limit or amount crs3 considered pursuant to special rule point of order against bill as reported would apply to the text made in order by the rule as original text for the purpose of amendment or to the text on which the previous question is ordered directly to passage in this way point of order would be considered as applying and waiver would be required if substitute resolved the problem in addition the rules of the house for the 110th congress include provision further specifying that for measure considered pursuant to special rule points of order under title iii of the budget act apply regardless of whether the measure considered is actually reported from committee under rule xxi clause 8 points of order apply to the form of measure recommended by the reporting committee where the statute uses the term as reported in the case of measure that has been reported the form of the measure made in order as an original text for the purpose of amendment or the form of the measure on which the previous question is ordered directly to passage the effect of point of order in the senate is clarified under section 312f which provides that when point of order against measure is sustained the measure is recommitted to the appropriate committee for any further consideration this allows the senate an opportunity to remedy the problem that caused the point of order section 312d is also designed to provide the senate with the opportunity to remedy problem that would provoke point of order this provision states that point of order may not be raised against measure amendment motion or conference report while an amendment or motion that would remedy the problem is pending section 312e clarifies that any point of order that would apply in the senate against an amendment also applies against amendments between the houses further this section also states that the effect would be the same as if the senate had disagreed to the amendment this would allow the senate to keep the underlying measure pending and thus retain the ability to resolve their differences with the house this provision therefore means that any resolution of the differences between the house and senatepassed versions of measure whether it is in the form of conference report or not must adhere to the provisions of the budget act there are exceptions to the general principle of applying points of order to measure as whole the most salient is probably section 313 the socalled byrd rule this section applies to matter contained in any title or provision in reconciliation bill or resolution or conference report thereon as well as any amendment or motion if point of order is sustained under this section only the provision in question is stricken or the amendment or motion falls5 several of the points of order in the senate established under recent budget resolutions have been written so that they apply to individual provisions rather than the measure as whole in the manner provided in section 313e of the budget act the point of order against emergency spending designations section 204a5 of sconres 21 110th congress further provides that if sustained the effect of this point of order is that provision making an emergency designation shall be stricken and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor 5 section 313d provides special procedure for further consideration of measure should point of order under this section be sustained against provision in conference report crs4 procedures for waiving points of order the congressional budget act sets forth certain procedures under section 904 for waiving points of order under the act these waiver procedures apply in the senate only under these procedures senator may make motion to waive the application of point of order either preemptively before it can be raised or after it is raised but before the presiding officer rules on its merits6 in the senate most points of order under the budget act may be waived by vote of at least threefifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn 60 votes if there are vacancies see table 1 the threefifths waiver requirement was first established for some points of order under the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 beginning with the balanced budget act of 1997 this supermajority threshold was applied to several additional points of order on temporary basis these points of order are identified in section 904c2 and the threefifths requirement is currently scheduled to expire september 30 20177 the threefifths threshold has also been required for the senate to waive the application of many of the points of order established in recent budget resolutions such as the paygo point of order as with other provisions of senate rules budget act points of order also may be waived by unanimous consent in the house budget act points of order are typically waived by the adoption of special rules although other means such as unanimous consent or suspension of the rules may also be used waiver may be used to protect bill specified provisions in bill or an amendment from point of order that could be raised against it waivers may be granted for one or more amendments even if they are not granted for the underlying bill the house may waive the application of one or more specific points of order or they may include blanket waiver that is waiver that would protect bill provision or amendment from any point of order 6 in the case of points of order under section 313 of the budget act and by extension points of order under section 204 of sconres 21 110th congress and section 313 of sconres 70 110th congress as well as points of order under section 314 of sconres 70 110th congress single point of order may be raised against several provisions the presiding officer may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the provisions and motion to waive the point of order may likewise be made concerning some or all of the provisions against which the point of order was raised 7 as originally provided in title x of the balanced budget act of 1997 the threefifths requirement expired on september 30 2002 the senate subsequently adopted sres 304 on october 16 2002 renewing the threefifths requirement for all of the points of order identified in section 904c2 except for section 302f2b through april 15 2003 the threefifths requirement including for section 302f2b was renewed through september 30 2008 under section 503 of hconres 95 108th congress extended through september 30 2010 under section 403 of hconres 95 109th congress and is
