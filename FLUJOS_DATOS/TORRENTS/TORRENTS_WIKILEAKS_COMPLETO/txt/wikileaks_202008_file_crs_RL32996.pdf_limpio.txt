patent reform has expanded as the importance of intellectual prope rty to innovation has increased patent ownership is perceived as an incentive to the technological adva ncement that leads to economic growth however growing interest in patents has been accompanied by persistent concerns about th fairness and effectiveness of the current system several recent studies including those by the national academy of sciences and the federal trade commission have reco mmended patent reform to address perceived deficiencies in the operation of the patent regime other experts maintain that major alterations in existing law are unnecessary and that the patent process can adapt and is adapting to technological progress patent reform proposals considered during the 109th congress would have worked significant legal reforms to the patent system among the more notable of these proposed changes was shift to fi rstinventortofile priority system substantive and procedural modifications to the patent law doctrines of willful infringement and inequitable conduct and adoption of postissuance opposition proceedings prior user rights and preissuance publication of all pending applications several of these proposals have been th subject of discussion within the patent community for many years but others are more novel propositions prior legislative reform efforts would have also addresse d several issues of concern including the quality of issued patents the expense and complexity of patent litigation harmonization of us patent law with the laws of our leading trading partners potential abuses committed by patent speculators and the special needs of individual inventors universities and small firms with respect to the patent system in addition although the existing patent st atute in large measure applies the same basic rules to different sorts of inventions regardless of the technol ogical field of that inventi on the pa tent system is widely believed to impact different industries in varying ways the provisions of the proposed legisla tion would arguably have worked the most sweeping reforms to the us patent system since the nineteenth century however many of these proposals such as preissuance publication prior user rights and oppositions have already been imp lemented in us law to more limited extent these and other reforms such as the firstinventortofile priority system and elimination of the best m ode requirement also refl ect the decadesold patent practices of europe japan and our other leading trading partners other knowledgeable observers are nonethel ess concerned that certain of these proposals would weaken the patent right thereby diminishing needed incentives for innovation some also believe that changes of this magnitude occurring at the same time do not present the most prudent course for the patent system patent reform therefore confronts congress with difficult gal practical and policy issues but also with apparent possibilities for altering and possibly improving the legal regime that has long been recognized as an engine of innovation within the us

significant to us industr there is broad agreement that more patents are sought and enforced then ever be fore that the attention paid to patents in business transactions and corporate boardr ooms has dramatically increased and that the commercial and social significance of patent grants licenses judgments and settlements is at an alltime high1 as the united states becomes even more of

usc 112 21 35 usc 154 22 eisenberg supra at 1017innovation policy patent ownership is percei ved to be an incentive to innovation the basis for the technological advancement th at contributes to economic growth it is through the commercialization and use of new products and processes that productivity gains are made and the scope and quality of goods and services are expanded award of patent is intended to stimula the investment necessary to develop an idea and bring it to the marketplace embodied in product or process patent title provides the recipient with limitedtime monopoly over the use of his discovery in exchange for the public dissemination of in formation contained in the patent application this is intended to permit the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery but does not guarantee that the patent will generate commercial benefits the requirement for publication of the patent is expected to stimulate additional innova tion and other creative means to meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace innovation produces new knowledge one characteristic of this knowledge is that it is public good good that is not consumed when it is used this public good concept underlies the us patent system absent patent system free riders could easily duplicate and exploit the inven tions of others further because they incurred cost to develop and perfect the technology involved copyists could undersell the original inventor the resu lting inability of inventors to capitalize on their inventions would lead to an envir onment where too few inventions are made19 the patent system corrects this market fa ilure problem by providing innovators with an exclusive interest in their inventions thereby allowing them to capture its marketplace value the regime of patents purporte dly serves other goals as well the patent system encourages the disclosure of products nd processes for each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention20 at the close of the patents 20year term21 others may practice the claimed invention without regard to the expired patent in this manner the patent system ultimately contributes to the growth of the public domain even during their term issued patents may also encourage others to invent around the patentees proprieta ry interest patentee may point the way to new products markets economies of production and even entir industries others can build upon the disclosure of patent inst rument to produce their own technologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent22 the patent system has also been identified as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inventor may have

the conduct of contracting party any technology or knowhow that s been disclosed to prospective licensee might be appropriate d without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protection decreases the ability of contracting parties to engage in opportunistic behavior by lowering such transaction costs the patent system may make technologybased tran sactions more feasible23 through these mechanisms the patent system can act in more socially desirable ways than its chief legal alternative tr ade secret protection trade secrecy guards against the improper appropriation of va luable commercially useful and secret information in contrast to patenting tr ade secret protection does not result in the disclosure of publicly valuable information that is becau an enterprise must take reasonable measures to keep secret the in formation for which trade secret protection is sought taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures also imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society24 the patent system has long been subject to criticism however some observers have asserted that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of innova tion the desire to obtain lead time advantage over competitors as well as the recognition that technologically backward firms lose out to their rivals may we ll provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives25 other commentators be lieve that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets26 still other observers believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity27 when analyzing the validity of these competing views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analyti cal methods available for study ing the effect of the patent law upon the us economy as whole the relationship between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood as result current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the pate nt system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in innovation thus each of the arguments for and against the patent system remains open to challenge by those who are unpersuaded by their internal logichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs6 28 see dan l burk mark lemley i s patent law technologyspecific 17 berkeley technology law journal 2002 1155 29 crs report rl31281

proposed number of changes to diverse aspects of the patent system although these reforms were undoubtedly motivated by range of concerns discre number of issues have been the subject of persistent discussion in the patent community over period of many years among these issues are concern for the quality of issued patents the expense and complexity of patent litigation harmonization of us pa tent law with the laws of our leading trading partners potential abuses committed by patent speculators and the special needs of individual inventors universities and small firms with respect to the patent system in addition although the pa tent statute in large measure applies the same basic rules to different sorts of inventions regardle ss of the technological field of that invention the patent system is wi dely believed to impact different industries in varying ways28 as result different industr ies can be expected to espouse dissimilar views of certain pate nt reform proposals before turning to more specific analysis of individual legislative pr oposals this report reviews the proposed legislations broader themes with re gard to these issues and concerns patent quality government industry academia and the patent bar alike have long insisted that the uspto approve only those patent app lications that desc ribe and claim patentable advance29 because they meet all the requirements imposed by the patent laws quality patents may be dependably enforced in court and employed as technology transfer tool such patents are said to confirm private rights by making their proprietary uses and therefore their value more predictable quality patents also may clarify the extent that others may approach the protected invention without infringing these traits in turn should st rengthen the incentives of private actors to engage in valuemaximiz ing activ ities such as i nnovation or commercial transactions30 in contrast poor patent qua lity is said to hold delete rious consequences large numbers of inappropria tely granted patents may negativ ely impact entrepreneurs for example innovative firms may be approach ed by an individual with low quality patent that appears to cove r the product they are marketing the innovative firm may recognize that the cost of challenging patent even of dubious validity may be considerable therefore the firm ma choose to make

attracted by large damages awards and potentially porous uspto rentseeking entrepreneurs may be attracted to form speculative patent acquisition and enforcement ventures industry particip ants may also be forced to expend considerable sums on patent acquisition and enforcement32 the net results would be reduced rates of innovati on decreased patentbased transactions and higher prices for goods and services although low patent quality appears to ffect both investors and competitors of patentee patent proprietors themselves may also be negatively impacted patent owners may make managerial decisions such as whether to build production facilities or sell pr oduct based upon their expectation of exclusive rights in particular invention if thei r patent is declared invalid by the uspto or court the patentee will be stripped of exclusive righ ts without compensation the issuance of large numbers of invalid patents would increase the possibility that the investment backed expectations of pate ntees would be disappointed33 the notion that high patent quality is socially desirable has been challenged however some commentators believe that market forces will efficiently assign patent rights matter what their quality others observe that few issued patents are the subject of litigation and further estimate that only minority of patents are licensed or sold because many patented i nventions are not used in way that calls their validity into question some observe rs maintain societ may be better off making detailed review into the patentability of an invention only in those few cases where that invention is of commercial significance34 previously introduced legislation bears upon the patent quality issue both the house and senate bills from the 109th congress hr 2795 and s 3818 would have allowed for increased public participation in uspto decisionmaking through pre issuance submission procedure these bills would have also allowed for post issuance opposition proceedings which would potentially allow inte rested parties to weed out invalid patents before they are the subject of licensing or infringement litigationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs8 35

costs patent enforcement is often expensive the complex legal and technological issues extensive discovery proceedings ex pert witnesses and specially qualified attorneys associated with patent trials can lead to high costs35 one study published in 2000 concluded that the average co st of patent enforcement was 12 million36 these expenses appear to be increas ing with one more recent commentator describing an industry rule of thumb wh ereby any patent infringement lawsuit will easily cost 15 million in legal fees alone to defend37 higher stakes litigation is even more costly for patent suits involving damages claims of more than 25 million expenses reportedly in crease to 4 million per side38 for innovative firms that are not infrequen tly charged with patent infringement or that bring claims of patent infri ngement themselves the annual expenses associated with patent litigation can be very dear the microsoft corporation reportedly defends an average of 35 to 40 pate nt lawsuits annually at cost of almost 100 million39 the intel corporation has r ecently been estimated to spend 20 million year on patent litigation40 the high costs of litigation may discourage patent proprietors from bringing meritorious claims against infringers they may also encourage firms to license patents of dubious merit rather than contest them in court previously introduced legislation endeavored to make patent litigation less costly and complex through modification of the patent law doctrines of willful infringement and inequitable conduct it would also call for an admin istrative

postissuance opposition system assignee filing publication of all pe nding patent applications and prior user rights elimination of the best mode requirement and encouragement for the adoption of

speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in research development manufacturing or other socially productive activity42 p t n t speculators are sometimes termed trolls after creatures from folklore that would emerge from under bridge in order to waylay travelers43 the late jerome c lemelson prolific inventor who ow ned hundreds of patents and launched numerous charges of patent infringement has sometimes been mentioned in this context the total revenue of the lemels on estates patent li censing program has been reported as in excess of 15 billion44 but as explained by journalist michael ravnitsky critics charge that many lemelson patents are socalled submarine patents overly broad applica tions that took so long to issue or were so general in nature that their owners could unfairl claim broad infringement across entire industry sectors45 of such patent ventures pate nt attorney james pooley observes of course there is nothing inherently wr ong with charging someone rent to use your property including intellectual prope rty like patents but its useful to keep in mind especially when listening to prattle about losing american jobs to foreign

continuedpatent enforcement suits brought by patent speculators appear to present special concerns for manufacturers and service provi ders if one manufacturer or service provider commences litigation against anothe r the defendant can often counter with its own claims of patent infringement against the plaintiff because patent speculators do not otherwise participate in the marketplace however they are immune to such counterclaims this as ymmetry in litigation positions reportedly reduces the bargaining power of manuf acturers and service providers potentially exposing them to harassment47 observers hasten to note however that not every patent proprietor who does not commercialize the patented invention shoul d properly be consid ered an opportunistic troll nonmanufacturing pa tentee may lack the expertise or resources to produce patented product prefer to commit itsel f to further innovation or otherwise have legitimate reasons for its behavior48 universities and small biotechnology companies often fit into this category further whether classified as troll or not each patent owner has presumptively fu lfilled all of the re levant statutory requirements among these

particular technology for example trade secrecy ready access to markets trademark rights speed of development and consumer goodw ill may to some degree act as substitutes to the patent system52 however individual invent ors and small firms often do not have these mechanisms at their disposal as result the patent system may enjoy heightened importance with respect to these enterprises53 in recent years universities have also b ecome more fullfledged participants in the patent system this trend has been attributed to the bayhdole act54 federal statute that allowed universities and other government contractors to retain patent title to inventions deve loped with the benef it of federal funding55 in recent years there has reportedly been dramatic incr ease in academic institutions investments in technology licensing activities56 this increase has been reflected in the growth in the number of patents held by universities the number of universities with technology transfer offices and the amount of patentbased licensing revenues that these offices have raised57 the us patent system has long acknow ledged the role and particular needs of independent inventors small firms and universities for example the patent statute calls for each of these tities to r eceive 50 discount on many uspto fees58 as the uspto is currently entirely funded by the fees it charges its

sophisticated knowledge of the patent system61 others disagree stating that smaller concerns rely heavily on the exclusivity of the patent right and that the adoption of prior user rights would advantage large enterprises62 similar debates have occurred with respect to other patent reform proposals perhaps re flecting the fact that the community of independent inventors small firms and universities is itself diverse one provisions of previously introduced legisla tion that appeared to be of particular interest to independent inventors universities and small businesses include shift

should be drawn with care two industries widely perceived as viewing the patent system in different ways are the pharmaceutical and software sectors with in the pharmaceutical industry individual patents are perceived as critical to busin ess model that provide s lifesaving and life enhancing medical innovations but eventua lly allows members of the public access to medicines at low cost in particular often only handful and sometimes only one or two patents cover particular drug product patents are also judged to be crucial to the pharmaceutical sector because of th relative ease of replicating the finished product for example while it is expe nsive complicated and time consuming to duplicate an airplane it is relatively simple to perform chemical analysis of pill and reproduce it65 in contrast to the pharmaceutical field the nature of software development is such that innovations are typically cumulative and new products often embody numerous patentable inventions this environment has led to what has been described as poor match between patents and products in the software industry it is difficult to patent an entire product in the software industry because any particular product is likely to include dozens if not hundreds of separate technological ideas66 this situation may be augmented by the multiplicity of patents often associated with finished computer product that utilizes the software it is not uncommon for thousands of different patent s relating to hardware and software to be embodied in one single computer in addition owners hip of these patents may well be fractured among hundreds or thousands of di fferent individuals and firms in summary then the patent laws provide one size f its all system where all inventions are subject to the same requirements of patentability and scope of protection regardless of the technical fi eld in which they arose innovators in different fields nonetheless ve varying experiences with the patent system thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs14 discrepancies among others lead to the ex pectation that distinct industries may react differently to the various patent reform proposals presently

would have altered the us patent priority rule from the current firsttoinvent principle to the firsti nventortofile principle67 within the patent law the priority rule addresses the circumstance where two or more persons i ndependently develop the identical or similar invention at approximately the same time in such cases the patent law must establish rule as to which of these inventors obtains entitlement to patent68 under current us law when more than one patent application is filed claiming the same invention the patent will be awarded to the applicant who was the first inventor in fact this conclusion holds ev if the first inventor was not the first person to file patent applicati on directed towards that invention69 within this firsttoinvent system70 the timing of realworld events such as the date chemist conceived of new compound or machin ist constructed new engine is of significance in every patentissuing nation except the united states priority of invention is established by the earliest effective filing date of patent application disclosing the claiming invention71 stated differently the inventor who first filed an application at the patent office is presumptively entitled to the patent whether or not the first applicant was actually the first individual to complete the invention in the field is irrelevant this priority system follo ws the firstinvento rto file

2005 claiming that compound suppose further that inve ntor b independently i nvents the same compound on september 1 2005 and files patent pplication on october 1 2005 inventor would be awarded the patent under the firs ttoinvent rule while inventor b would obtain the patent under the firs tinventortofile principle under the current us firsttoinvent rule priority disputes may be resolved via

may mislead however because the expense of interference cases may result in their use only for the most commercially significant inventions by shifting to firstinventortofile priority rule the house and senate bills would have eliminated the need for interfe rence proceedings instead the applicant with the earliest filing date rather than the first individual to have created the invention would have been eligible for the patent notably the proposed bills would not have rendered patent pplicants actual date of invention completely irrelevant as this report discusses immediately below the invention date would have remained pertinent with respect to the socalled grace period in this respect these legislative proposals departed from first inventortofile practices in other patentissuing countries policy considerations the relative merits of the firsttoinvent and first inventortofile priority prin ciples have been the subject of lengthy debate within the patent community supporters of the current firsttoinvent principle in part assert that the firstinvent ortofile system would creat inequities by sponsoring race to the patent office they are also concerned that the firsttofile system would encourage premature and sketchy t echnological disclosu res in hastilyfiled patent applications74 supporters of the firstinvent ortofile principle in part assert that it provides definite readily determined and fixed date of priority of invention which would lead to greater legal certainty within innovative industries they also contend that the firstinventortofile principle would d ecrease the complexity length and expense associated with current uspto interference proceedings rather than being caught up in lengthy interference proceedings in an attempt to prove dates of inventive activity that occurred many years previously they assert invent ors could continue to go about the process of innova tion supporters also observe that informed us firms already organize their affairs on firsti nventortofile basis in order to avoid forfeiture of patent rights abroad75 the effect of shift to the firstinve ntortofile rule upon individual inventors small firms and universities has been debated some observers state that such entities often possess fewer resources and wherewithal than their larger competitors and thus are less able to prepare and file pa tent

commissioner of the uspto also suggested that the firsttoinvent rule neither advantaged nor disadvantaged small entities visavis larger enterprises77 the role of the us constitution is sometimes debated within the context of the patent priority principle article i s ection 8 clause 8 of the constitution provides congress with the authority to award i nventors with exclusive rights some observers suggest this language suggests or possibly even mandates the current first toinvent system others conclude that because the firstinventortofile only awards patents to individuals who actually developed the inven tion themselves rather than derived it from another this priority system is permissible under the constitution78 in weighing the validity of this pos ition it s hould be noted that under well established us law the firstinventorinfact does not always obtain entitlement to patent if for example firstinventorinfact maintain ed his invention as trade secret for many years before seeking pate nt protection he may be judged to have abandoned suppressed or c oncealed the invention79 in such case second inventorinfact may be awarded patent on that invention courts have reasoned that this statutory rule encourages individuals to disclose their inventions to the public promptly or give way to an inventor who in fact does so80 as the first inventortofile rule acts in similar fashion to this longstanding patent law principle conflict between this rule and the constitution appears unlikely notably firstinventortofile priority rule does not permit one individual to copy anothers invention and then by virtue of being the first to file patent application be entitled to pa tent all patent applicants must have originated the invention themselves rather than derived it from another81 in order to police this requirement both bills would have provided for inventors rights contests that would allow the uspto to determine which applicant is entitled to patent on particular invention82httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs18 83 35 usc 102b 84 schechter thomas supra at 431 85 in addition the textbook must be attributable to someone other than the patent applicant see 35 usc 102a 86 37 cfr 1131grace period domestic issues previous legislative propos als would have retained the existing oneyear grace period enjoyed by us inventors current us patent law essentially provides inventors with oneyear peri od to decide whether patent protection is desirable and if so to prepare an appli cation specified activities that occur before the critical date patent parlance for the day one year before the application was filed will prevent patent from issuing83 if for example an entrepreneur first discloses an invention by publishing an article in scientific journal she knows that she has one year fro m the publication date in which to file patent application importan tly uses sales and other t echnical disclosures by third parties will also start the oneyear clock running as result inventors have broader range of concerns than merely their own activities84 suppose for example that an electrical engi neer files patent application claiming new capacitor on february 1 2007 while reviewing the application uspto examiner discovers october 1 2005 journal article disclosing the identical capacitor because the article was published prior to the critical date of february 1 2006 that publication will prevent or bar th issuance of patent on that capacitor if relevant reference is first publicly disclosed during the oneyear grace period that is to say after the critical date but prior to the filing date the legal situation is more complex under current law patent applicants may antedate such reference by demonstrating that they had actually invented the subject matter of their application prior to the date of the reference if the applicant can make such showing then the reference cannot ordinar ily be used to defeat the patentability of the invention as an illustration of this procedure suppose that an inventor files patent application directed to polymer on fe bruary 1 2007 suppose that the uspto examiner discovers that textbook publis hed on january 1 2007 describes the same polymer that is claimed in the application85 because the textbook was published subsequent to the critical date of febr uary 1 2006 it does not absolutely bar the application in order to obtain patent however the applicant must nonetheless demonstrate that he invented the polym er prior to january 1 2007 the date the textbook was published the applicant might submit copies of his laboratory notebook for example or submit sworn declaration in order to make this showing86 both the house and senate bills contemplated by the 109th congress would have retained current patent law rules with respect to the grace period as result an inventor would still have been allowed to antedate prior art by showing that

had the advantage of maintaining longstanding us rules regarding the patentdefeating effect of refe rences that first become publicly available during the grace period it might benefit unive rsity professors sma ll firms and other entities that may lack the wherewithal to file patent applications promptly on the other hand these proposals would have meant that the us shift from firsttoinvent system to firsti nventortofile syst em would have been incomplete because an applicants date of invention would have remained relevant patentability decisions would have been more complex and less certain than in the firstinventortofile systems employed by all other patentissuing states such an approach would also not fully harmonize us law with those of other nations international issues in contrast to the unite d states many other patent granting states provide more limited grace pe riods or grace periods at all in europe any sales or publicati on of an invention anywhere in the world prior to the filing date defeats the patentability of an invention88 the japanese patent system includes sixmonth grace period tied onl to the activities of the inventor89 under the patent law of japan any disclosures of an invention made by third party even one day before the filing date will prevent the issuance of patent in the109th congress the house b ill would have included provision that might have encouraged adoption of oneyear gr ace period for inventor activities in europe and japan90 an understanding of this pr oposal requires some background information on the international priority system established by an international agreement known as the paris convention91 the international priority system allows an inventor to file patent application in one paris conve ntion signatory state which is usually the inventors home country if the inventor subse quently files patent applications in any other paris convention signatory state within the next 12 months overseas patentgranting authorities will treat the application as if it were filed on the first filing date critically information that enters the public domain between the priority date and subsequent filing dates does not prejudice the later applications paris convention priority allows us inve ntors to preserve their original uspto filing dates as they make arrangements to file patent applications overseas92 suppose for example that an inventor files patent application at the uspto on october 1 2006 the inventor then file s patent applica tion claiming the same invention in the japanese patent office on september 1 2007 as part of hishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs20 93 35 usc 119ajapanese application the inve ntor informs the japanese patent office of the earlier us application because japan has acced ed to the paris convention the japanese patent office will treat that inventors application as if it had been filed on october 1 2006 as result information that ente red the public domain after the us filing date would not prejudice the inventors japanese app lication journal article published on january 1 2007 for example would not limit the opportunity of the inventor to obtain japanese patent the us patent statute currently limits the usefulness of the paris convention priority date for foreign i nventors seeking us patent rights section 119 of the patent act states that patent shall be granted on any application for patent for an invention which had been patented or described in printed publication in any country more than one year before the date of the actual f iling of the application in this country or which had been in public use or on sale in this country more than one year prior to such filing93 the effect of this language is that the oneyear grace period is measured not from the paris convention internati onal priority date but th actual us filing date this limitation may discourage us tr ading partners from adopting grace period analogous to that of us law consider for example japanese inventor who publishes an article in scientific journal describing his new invention on august 1 2005 consistent with japanese patent law he then files patent application at the japanese patent office six months later on february 1 2006 then in accordance with the paris conventi on he files an application at the uspto on february 1 2007 under these circumstances the us pate nt application should be denied even though the japanese inventor appeared to comply with all legal formalities because the us patent statute compels the uspto to assess the grace period as ending as the actual us filing date in 2007 rather th an the paris conventi on priority date in 2006 the us patent is barred from issuance this state of affairs may give pause to nations considering adopting ussty grace period foreign applicants who rely upon grace periods within their own na tional systems may be put in position of forfeiture of their us patent rights apparently aware of this concern the house bill would have altered the date the grace period closes from the actual us filin g date to the pari s convention priority date provided that europe and japan adopt laws analogous to that of proposed us law in the language of the house bill before the date if ever that the dire ctor of the uspto publishes notice declaring that both the european patent

paragraphs c d and f of section 102 section 102c does not allow an applicant to obtain patent when he has abandoned the invention this statute does not refer to dis posal of the invention itself however but instead to the intentional surrender of an invention to the public older supreme court opinions instruct that abandonment may occur where an inventor ex pressly dedicates it to the public through deliberate relinquishment or conduct evidencing an intent not to pursue patent protection95 the circumstances must be such that others could reasonably rely upon the inventors renunciation96

presumable th at american citizens would obtain their first patent here while foreigner woul d first patent his invention in his own country the statute was designed to prevent foreigner from spending his time and capital in the development of an invention in his own country and then coming to this country to enjoy further monopoly when the invention had become free at home the result of such course would be that while the foreign country was developing the invention and enjoying its benefits its use could be interdicted here while if the term of the monopoly could be further extended here the market could be controlled l ong after the foreign nation was prepared to flood this country with the unpatent ed products of the patented process99 section 102d has been subject to criti cal commentary because inventors may choose to file patent pplication only in the united states the policy goal of assuring that the us market will b ecome patentfree contemporaneously with foreign markets may not be wellserved by this provision in addition 35 usc 102d effectively acts against foreign rather than usbased inventors as domestic inventors ordinarily file at the uspto first before

undesirable aspects of assignee filing the commission noted that patent applications filed by assignees may lack the actual inventors personal guarantee th at the application was properly prepared in

invalidating an issued patent the courts have established tw opart standard for analyzing whether an inventor disclosed her best m ode in particular patent the first inquiry was whether the inventor knew of way of practicing the claimed i nvention that he considered superior to any other if so then the pa tent instrument must identify and disclose sufficient information to enable persons of skill in the art to practice that best mode110 proponents of the best mode requirement have asserted that it allows the public to receive the most advantageous imple mentation of the technology known to the inventor this disclosure becomes part of the patent literature and may be freely reviewed by those who wish to design ar ound the patented invention absent best mode requirement some observe rs say patent proprietors may be able to maintain the preferred way of practicing their inventions as trade secret members of the public are also said to be better able to compete with the patentee on equal footing after the patent expires111 the best mode requirement has encoun tered severe criticis m in recent years however112 for example 1992 presidential commission recommended that congress eliminate the best mode requirement the commission reasoned that patents also are statutorily required to di sclose the manner nd process of making and using the invention in such full cl ear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same113 this enablement requirement was belie ved to provide sufficient info rmation to achieve the patent laws policy goals114 the

challenges over the past 20 years may serve as an indicator that the best mode defense is being used primarily as procedural tactic party currently can assert failure to satisfy the best mode requirement without any significant burden this assertion also entitles the party to seek discovery on the subjective beliefs of the inventors prior to the filing date of the patent application this broad authority provides ample opportunity for discovery abuse given the fluidity by which the requirement is evaluated eg even accidental failure to disclose any superior element setting or step can negate the validity of the patent and the wide ranging opportunities for discovery it is almost certain that best mode challenge will survive at least initial judicial scrutiny115 the commission further reasoned that the best mode at the time of filing is unlikely to remain the best mode when the patent expires many years later116 because many foreign patent laws include analog to the best mode require ment inventors based overseas have also questioned the desirability of the best mode requirement in us law apportionment of damages legislation before the 109th congress also would ve addressed monetary remedies in patent cases marketplace realities often re nder the determination of an appropriate damages award di fficult affair in patent litig ation in some cases the product or process that is found to infri nge may incorporate numerous additional elements beyond the patented invention fo r example the asserted patent may relate to single component of an audio speaker while the accused product consists of the entire stereo system in such circumstances court may apply the entire market value rule which permits recovery of damages based upon the entire apparatus containing several features where the pate ntrelated feature is the basis for consumer demand117 on the other hand if the court dete rmines that the infringing sales were due to many factors beyond the use of th patented invention the court may apply principles of apportionment to reach just measure of damages for infringement118 some observers believe that courts have sometimes been overly generous in assessing damages in patent cases as one commentator asserted inventors have learned to abuse the patent system and increase leverage against manufacturers by pursuing system claims in the uspto these

trial court121 although the statute does not specify the circumstances in which enhanced damages are appropriate the courts most commonly award them when the infringer acted in blatant disregard of the patentees rights this circumstance is termed willful infringement122 courts will not ordinarily enhance dama ges due to willful infringement if the adjudicated infringer did not know of the patent

without the evidentiary contribution or presumptive weight of an adverse inferen ce that any opinion of counsel was or would have been unfavorable126 patent laws willful infringement doctr ine has proven controversial some observers believe that this doctrine ensures that patent rights will be respected in the marketplace critics of the policy believe that the possi bility of trebled damages discourages individuals from reviewing issu ed patents out of fear that their inquisitiveness will result in multiple damages innovators may simply avoid looking at patents until they are sued for infringement to the extent this observation is correct the law of willful infringement discourages the dissemination of technical knowledge thereby thwarting one of the prin cipal goals of the patent system fear of increased liability for willful infringement may also discourage firms from challenging patents of dubious validity consequently so have argued that the patent system should shift to nofault regime of st rictly compensatory damages without regard to the state of mind of the adjudicated infringer127 the house and senate bills would have added several clarifications and changes to the law of willful infringement first finding of willful infringement would be appropriate only where 1 the infringer received specific written notice from the patentee and continued to infringe after reasonable opportunity to investigate 2 the infringer intentionally copied from the patentee with knowledge of the patent and 3 the infringer continued to infringe afte r an adverse court ruling

an ex parte procedure stated differently patent prosecution involves only the applicant and the uspto members of the public and in particular the patent applicants marketplace competitors do not

obligation to proceed in good faith may be undermined however by the great incentive applicants might possess not to disclose or to misrepresent information that might deleteriously impact their prospective patent rights the patent law therefore penalizes those who stray from honest and forthright dealings with the uspto under the doctrine of inequitable conduct if an applicant intentionally misrepresents material fact or fails to disclose material information then the resulting patent w ill be declared unenforceable132 two elements must exist before court will decide that the app licant

procured through inequitable conduct concerns have arisen that charge s of inequitable conduct have become routine in patent cases as one commentator explains the strategic and technical advantages that the inequitable conduct defense offers the accused infringer make it almost too attractive to ignore in addition to the potential effect on the outcome of the litigation injecting the inequitable conduct issue into patent litigation wreaks havoc in the patentees camp the inequitable conduct defense places the patentee on the defensive subjects the motives and conduct of the patentees personnel to intense scrutiny and provides an avenue for discovery of attorneyclient and work product documents135 as the federal circuit put it the habit of charging inequitable conduct in almost every major patent case has become an absolute plague136 other observers believe that because inequitable c onduct requires an analysis of the knowledge and intentions of the patent applicants the doctrine may also be contributing disproportionately to the time and expense of patent litigation137 due to these perceived burdens upon pa tent litigation some commentators have proposed that the inequitable conduct defense be eliminated138 others believe that inequitable conduct is necessary to ensu re the proper functioning of the patent system as the advisory commission on pa tent law reform explained in its 1992 report some mechanism to ensure fair dealin g between the patentee public and the federal government has been part of the patent system for over 200 years in its modern form the unenforceability defense provides necessary incentive for patent applicants to engage in fair nd open dealing with the uspto during the ex parte prosecution of patent applications by imposing the penalty of forfeiture of patent rights for failure to so deal the defense is also considered to be an essential safeguard against truly fraudulent conduct before the uspto finally the defense provides means for encouraging complete disclosure of information relevant to particular patent application thus from policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs30 139 1992 advisory commission supra at 114perspective the defense of unenforceability based upon inequitable conduct is desirable and should be retained139 proposed legislation in the 109th congress would have re tained the concept of an inequitable conduct defense but introduced number of substantive and procedural changes to the doctrine the senate bill would have limited the availability of inequitable c onduct as an affirmative defe nse to patent infringement in particular inequitable c onduct may only have been found if the patentee his agent or his privy failed to disclo material information or submitted false information with an intent to deceive the uspto finding of good faith on behalf of the applicant agent or privy would have ne gated conclusion of inequitable conduct finally in notable departure from current law court may not have reached finding of inequitable conduct if none of the claims of the patent have been held invalid the house bill also proposed reforms to the inequitable conduct doctrine but its approach differed the house bill would have provided statutory authorization for the uspto director to issue regulati ons governing applicants duty of candor it would have also imbued the uspto with authority to prosecute violations of the inequitable conduct doctrine in addition the house bill would have limited the circumstances under which the defense of in equitable conduct coul d be raised before the courts in broad outline under the house bill if court determined that an issue of possible misconduct existed then the court was directed to refer the matter to the uspto within judicial infringement pr oceedings issues of inequitable conduct could only have arisen after the court gran ted motion to amend the pleadings such motion would have had to describe the re levant facts in deta il and could not have been granted until the court has previously entered judgment that at least one of the asserted patent claims is invalid finally charge of inequitable conduct could not have been sustained unless the uspto woul d not have issued the invalidated claim acting reasonably in the absence of th misconduct or based upon the prosecution history as whole objectivel considered would have done so based upon in whole or in part on account of the misconduct prior user rights legislation offered in the 109th congress would have expanded the applicability of first inventor defens established by the american inventors protection act of 1999 as currently found at 35 usc 273 an earlier inventor of method of doing or conducting business th at was later patented by another may claim defense to patent infringement in certain circumstances both the house and senate bills would have broadened this defense by allowing it to apply with respect to any patented subject matter the impetus for this provision lies in the rather complex relationship between the law of trade secrets and the patent system trade secrecy protects individuals from misappropriation of valuable

customer lists or data compilations have traditionally been regarded as amenable to trade secret protection but not to patenting140 inventors might also maintain trade secret protection due to ignorance of the patent system or because they believe they can keep their invention as secret longer than the period of exclusivity granted through the patent system141 the patent law does not favor trade secr et holders however wellestablished patent law provides that an inventor who makes s ecret commercial use of an invention for more than one year prior to filing patent application at the uspto forfeits his own right to patent142 this policy is based principally upon the desire to maintain the integrity of the statutorily prescribed patent term the patent law grants patents term of twenty years commencing from the date patent application is filed143 if the trade secret holder could make commercial use of an invention for many years before choosing to file patent application he could disrupt this regime by delaying the expirati on date of his patent on the other hand settled pate nt law principles establis hed that prior secret uses would not defeat the pate nts of later inventors144 if an earlier inventor made secret commercial use of an inven tion and another person indepe ndently invented the same technology later and obtained patent protection then the trade secret holder could face liability for patent infringement th is policy is based upon the reasoning that once issued published patent instruments fu lly inform the public about the invention while trade secrets do not as between subsequent inventor who patented the invention and thus had disclosed the inve ntion to the public and an earlier trade secret holder who had not the law favored the patent holder an example may clarify this rather complex legal situation suppose that inventor develops and makes commercial use of new manufacturing process inventor chooses not to obtain patent pr

invention in such circumstances invent or as earlier trade secret use does not prevent inventor b from procuring pate nt furthermore if the uspto approves the patent application then inventor faces

have been made in good faith without derivation from the patentee or persons in privity with the patentee 147 both bills would have also removed the requirement that the prior use be reduced to practice at least one year before the effective filing date of such patent under the proposed legislation the defense would apply where reduction to practice occurred prior to the patents filing date

defense if successful146 inventor x would enjoy comp lete defense to infringement of inventor ys patent as originally enacted the first inventor defense applied only to patents claiming method of doing or conducting business although the american inventors protection act did not define this term the first inventor defense was arguably focused provision directed towards speci fic group of potential patent infringers the legislation introduced before the 109th congress would have expanded upon the first inventor defense by allowing it to apply to all patented subject matter147 by removing current restrictions referring to methods of doing business both the house and senate bills would effec tively introduce prior user rights into us law feature of many foreign patent regime s prior user rights are often seen as assisting small entities whic h may lack the sophisticati on or resources to pursue patent protection the provision of prior user rights would allow such entities to commercialize their inventions when they used the subject matter of the invention prior to the patents filing date even when they themselves did not pursue patent rights for this reason more

firms would not longer be required to engage in extensive defensive patenting but rather would be able to devote these resources to further innovation in addition some commentators observe that many us tr ading partners including germany and japan currently allow prior user rights as result us firms that obtain patent rights in certain foreign nations may face th possibility that foreign firm may enjoy prior user rights in that invention fore ign firms with us patents do not currently face this possibility with respect to us firms however under this view adoption of prior user rights in the united states would level the playing field for us industry149 proposals to dopt prior user rights have attracted critics however some observers believe that this regime would benefit large co rporations at the expense of smaller ones others believe that individuals who are aw are that they can rely upon prior user rights will be less likely to disclose their inventions through the patent system still others have stated that prior user rights reduce the value of patents and therefore make innovation less desirable the role of the us constitution is sometimes debated within this context as well article i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution provides congress with the authority to award inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries some comme ntators suggest this language suggests or possibly requires system of exclusive patent rights rather than an interest that may be mitigated by prior user rights150 extraterritorial infringement the senate patent reform bill

such manner as to actively induce the combina tion of such components outside of the united states in manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the united states shall

accused infringer sent limited number of copies of infringing software program overseas to be later incorporated into software stored on personal computers the federal circ uit has concluded that such software constitutes component within the meaning of 271f153 the result of this reasoning is that the infringer faces mone tary liability not just for small number of infringements but rather for each of the potentially thousands of copies of the software made abroad one commentator has opined that by any metric the reasoning of the federal ci rcuit involved an extraordinary extension of 271f to capture foreign sales154 by proposing to eliminate 271f the senate bill would have apparently res ponded to this concern notably subsequent to the introduction of the senate bill the us supreme court

new question of patentability with respect to an issued patent then it will essentially reopen prosecution of the issued patent traditional reexamination proceedings ar conducted in an accelerated

submission of argu ments and the filing of appeals either sort of reexamination may result in cer tificate confirming the patentability of the original claims an amended patent with narrower claims or declaration of patent invalidity congress intended reexamination proceedings to serve as an inexpensive alternative to judicial determinations of patent validity156 reexamination also allows further access to the legal and technical expertise of the uspto after patent has issued157 however some commentators believe that reexamination proceedings have been employed only sparingl and question their effectiveness158 some analysts have expressed concern that potential requesters are discouraged from commencing inter partes reexamination proceedings due to statutory provision that limits their future options in order to discourage abuse of these proceedings the inter partes reexamination statute pr ovides that thirdparty participants may not later ssert that patent is invalid on any ground that they raised or could have raised during the inter partes reexamination proceedings159 some observers believe that this potential estoppel effect disinclines potential requesters from use of this

concerns publication of pending applications until recent years the us patent system maintained pending patent applications in secrecy the first moment that the public would become aware of the existence of us patent application was the day the uspto formally allowed it to issue as granted patent this regime advantaged patent applicants because it allowed them to understand exactly what th scope of any allowed claims might be prior to disclosing an invention thus if the applicant was able to maintain the invention that was subject to patent app lication as trade secret then he could choose between obtaining the allowed patent claims and trade secret status in addition because the invention was not disclo sed prior to the award of formal patent rights unscrupulous competitors were di scouraged from copying the invention however this secrecy regime has been perceived as imposing costs as well others might well engage in duplicative research efforts during the pendency of patent applications unaware that an earlier inventor had already staked claim to that technology this arrangement also llowed inventors to commence infringement litigation on the very day patent issue d

submitted patents or printed publications if such comments are attached uspto staff will redact them before the submitted documents are forwarded to the examiner171 the proposed legislation would have au gmented the possibility for preissuance submissions under both the house and senate bills any person would have been able to submit patent documents and othe r printed publications to the uspto for review such prior art must have been submitted within the later date of either 1 the date the uspto issues notice of allowance to the patent applicant or 2 either six months after the date of pregrant publica tion of the application or the date of the rejection of any claim by the uspto examiner such submission must have included concise description of the asserted relevance of each submitted document172 most observers agree that ideally the uspto would have access to all pertinent information when making patentability determinations more expansive pre issuance submission policy may allow members of the public to disclose relevant patents and other documents that the usptos own searchers may not have revealed thereby leading to more accurate uspto decision making on the other hand lengthy preissuance submissions may rely be repetitive of the usptos own search results but still require extensive periods of examiner review that might ultimately delay exa mination the proposals set before the 109th congress apparently attempted to balance these concerns by expanding existing opportunities for post publication submissions but limiting the timing and nature of those submissions so as to prevent undue burdens upon th uspto and patent applicants interlocutory claim construction appeals in the 109th congress the senate bill would have allowed litigant to pursue an interlocutory appeal of pa tent claim construc tion order to the court of appeals for the federal circuit173 this provision appears to be motivated by the recognition that the interpretation of patent claims process that in large measure determines the scope of the patent owners proprietary rights is the most fundamental inquiry that occurs during patent litigation174 in addition numerous obser vers have perceived the federal circuit to have high reversal rate of claim interpretations by the district courts175 because claim construction is commonly the central focus of patent trial the

notoriously lengthy and costly exercise some observers believe that the current sy stem is overly expensive and inefficient176 some commentators have opined that allowing an immediate appeal of patent claim construction orders would allow the federal circuit review before the litigants are put to the full expense of trial in federal district court177 ordinarily litigants may appeal only final decisions from the district courts178 although federal law currently allows for review of an intermediate matter at trial179 socalled interlocutory appeal the federal circuit has declined to accept such appeals for routine claim interpretation cases180 the senate bill would have expressly authorized such interlocutory appeals venue legislation before the 109th congress would have refo rmed the venue provision that applies to patent infringement cases in federal court th requirement of venue complements the more fundame ntal requirement of jurisd iction in federal litigation in particular venue addresses the question of which court out of those that possess personal and subject matter jurisdiction ma most conveniently hear the specific lawsuit in question181 congress has enacted specialized venue statute that applies only to patent cases 28 usc 1400b provides that in patent litigation venue is proper either 1 in the judicial district where the defenda nt resides or 2 where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has re gular and established place of business an important question under this provision is where corporation is deemed to reside prior to 1988 corporation was viewed as residing in its state of incorporation182 commentators have explained th at during this period the patent venue statute was fairly restrictive tending to move infringement litigation into the defendants seat of operations183 congressional amendments subsequently liberalized venue c oncepts in patent litigati on in 1988 congress adopted new definition of reside as it applies tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs41 184 judicial improvements and access to justice act pl 100702 tit x 1013a 102 stat 4642 4669 1988 185 ve holding corp v johnson gas appliance co 917 f2d

defendants184 under the new definition corporation is presumed to reside in any j udicial district to which it could be subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the litigation commences congress codified this change in separate provision found at 28 usc 1391 although there is evidence that congress contemplated that these reforms would hold consequences for the specialized patent venue statute the fe deral circuit nonethel ess held that this amendment should also be read into 1400b185 the result of the 1988 amendments has been significant for corporate defendants which constitute the majority of defendants in patent litigation although 1400b still governs venue in patent cases few if any plaintiffs rely upon the restrictive second prong of that sec tion instead they base venue upon the residence requirement of the first pr ong which now is entirely conterminous with personal jurisdiction and which for larger corporations is likely to include every federal district in the country for corpor ate defendants then the venue statute has essentially become superfluous for th same standards governing personal jurisdiction also dictate whether court ma provide an appropria venue or not some observers allege that the liberal venue statute promotes forum shopping allowing patent proprietors to bring suit in courts that they believe favor patent owners over accused infringers one such magnet jurisdiction is said to be the rural eastern district of texas and in pa rticular the marshall texas federal court according to one account many observers wonder how an east texas town of 25000 even if it was named after supr eme court justice john marshall came to harbor an oversized share of intellectual property disputes186 in addition reportedly many of the local lawyers who once specialized in personal injury cases are turning their attention to intellectual property law187 others believe that the existence of single appellate court for patent cases the federal circuit minimizes forum shopping concerns and that certain di strict courts attract patent cases due to their expertise and timeliness rather than an inherent favoritism for patent holders in any event both the house and sena bills would ve amended 1400b by stipulating that notwithstanding 1391 for purposes of venue in patent cases corporation shall be deemed to reside in the judicial district in which the corporation has its principal place of business or in the state in which the corporation is incorporated this provisi on would essentially restore ve nue to more restrictive concept than under current practice similar to circumstances that existed prior to the 1988 legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32996crs42 188 merck co v kessler 80 f3d 1543 1550 fed cir 1996 189 the house bill did not address uspto rule making authority and therefore would have retained existing lawenhanced uspto rulemaking authority under current law the ability of uspto to issue regulations governing substantive patent law matters is extremely limited the most significant grant of rulemaking authority appears to be found in 35 usc 2b2a which allows the uspto to establish regulations that shall govern the conduct of proceedings in the office as explained by the federa l circuit congress has not vested the uspto director with any genera l substantive rulemaking power188 in the 109th congress the senate bill would have expanded uspto rulemaking authority189 the uspto director would be pe rmitted to promulgate such rules regulations and orders as the director determines appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title or any other law applicable to the uspto or that the director determines necessary to gove rn the operation and organization of the office concluding observations legislation that was introduced in the 109th congress arguably would have worked the most sweeping reforms to the us patent system since the nineteenth century however many of these proposal s such as preissuance publication prior user rights and oppositions have already b een implemented in us law to more limited extent these and other proposed modi fications such as the firstinventorto file priority system and elimination of the best mode requirement also reflect the decadesold patent practices of europe ja pan and our other leading trading partners as well many of these suggested changes enjoy the support of diverse institutions including the federal trade commission na tional academies economists industry representatives attorneys and legal academics other knowledgeable observers are nonethel ess concerned that certain of these proposals would weaken the patent right thereby diminishing needed incentives for innovation some also believe that changes of this magnitude occurring at the same time do not present the most prudent course for the patent system patent reform therefore confronts congress with difficult gal practical and policy issues but also with the apparent possibility for altering and potentially improving the legal regime that has long been recognized as an gine of innovation within the us economy
