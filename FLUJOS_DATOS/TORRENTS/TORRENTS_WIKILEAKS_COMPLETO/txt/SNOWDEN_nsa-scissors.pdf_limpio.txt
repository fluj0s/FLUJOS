fvey this wiki article collects and documents the activities within sso to optimize collection from sso sites it is direct result of the activities and findings from the large access exploitation lae working group optimization activities can be categorized as impacting primarily content collection ie feeding repositories like pinwale and pressurewave metadata perhaps better termed structured data collection ie primarily feeding repositories like marina or mainway or both tssirel usa fvey an examination into the content collected by sso sites in the fall of 2011 revealed that significant portion of collection was repetitive better placed into metadata repositories or of little foreign intelligence value rapidly changing internet protocols imprecise targeting methods and constantly shifting target technology use means that selectors or traffic seen by tasking today may not be the same tomorrow in addition several emerging technologies in use by targets or contacts of targets have protocols which can cause gross overcollection and selector detasking eg yahoo webmessenger which cannot be prevented under utt tasking as the protocol contains the precise selector tasked tssirel usa fvey the sso optimization teams job is to identify these types of data and ensure appropriate corrective action is taken throttling the data from corporate content or metadata repositories as appropriate tssirel usa fvey implementation details for specific sso sites can be found on the sso collection optimization noforn wiki page edit u address books u reason for optimizing tssirel usa fvey ownerless address books can account for 22 2012 are highly repetitive and can be both numerous and large additionally the data is highly structured so they are better parsed and analyzed in structured repositories like marina u criteria scissors tssirel usa fvey to alleviate the large number of ownerless address books currently being collected address books will be blocked at scissors scissors will process each flow and label sessions with the category of 8223 where they meet the following criteria yahoogmailhotmailviewaddressbook which represents 90 of all addressbook collection apmsgtype is present apactiveuser sigad given sigads currently four tssirel usa fvey the sessions that do not meet the above criteria will send metadata to fallout but the sessions will be dropped before reaching pinwale metrics for category 8223 will not be available in yellowstone and these volumes will not count against pinwale site caps set by the csrc u criteria xkeyscore tssirel usa fvey because of how inefficient the scissors implementation of ownerless address book throttles is essentially requiring that scissors process all of the selected content from the affected dataflows twice work is underway to implement the same throttle in xkeyscore at site this requires software modification to allow certain types of ownerless buddy list metadata to be created at site vs at scissors under the current architecture then deployed xkeyscore fingerprint will block the content while allowing the metadata to be memorialized xks versions xks version 158 v89 version 157 v151 digester

ownerless address book throttle was implemented on 2292012 for one site and for others in march and april of 2012 tssirel usa fvey the xkeyscore ownerless address book throttle is under development edit u yahoo webmessenger u reason for optimizing ssirel usa fvey yahoos webbased messenger client sends frequent requests and receives frequent responses for inbox and buddy status which are highly repetitive and contain little or useful fi information in the actual message content beyond the simple fact that the user was online during the first two weeks of december at least eight selectors were detasked by csrc due to excessive collection exceeding session limits u criteria ssirel usa fvey yahoo webmessenger is identified as either being request for status message from the client
