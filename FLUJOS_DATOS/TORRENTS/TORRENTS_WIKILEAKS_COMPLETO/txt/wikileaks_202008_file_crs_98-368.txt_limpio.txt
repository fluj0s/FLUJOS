amendment issues and options concerning supermajority requirement james v saturno specialist on the congress government and finance division summary proposals to limit the federal governments authority to raise taxes have been made several times in recent years most frequently these proposals call for limits on congresss ability to pass revenue measures typically limitation proposals would allow increases in tax revenues only under one of two circumstances first tax revenues could increase under existing tax laws as result of economic upturns alternatively they could increase because of new law but only if it were passed by supermajority typically twothirds or threefifths questions about how such proposals might be applied in practice have not been clearly answered congress has previously considered such proposals in 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 in each case the proposal has failed to achieve the twothirds majority necessary for passage most recently the house considered hjres 96 on june 12 2002 the measure failed to achieve the necessary twothirds 227178 this report will be updated to reflect any further legislative actions on such proposals introduction in recent years there have been number of proposals to place limits on the federal governments authority to raise taxes some proposals would hold total revenues to set percentage of some economic indicator such as gross domestic product gdp or gross national product gnp while others would limit increases in taxes to percentage of the growth of particular economic indicator such as national income the term tax limitation is also used to describe legislative proposals that would limit congresss ability to consider revenue measures regardless of their effect on the level or growth of tax revenues by requiring supermajority typically twothirds or threefifths for their passage this type of limitation would allow increases in taxes only under one of two circumstances first tax revenues could increase under existing tax laws as result of congressional research service the library of congress crs2 economic upturns alternatively they could increase because of new law but only if it were passed by supermajority1 such proposals have often been associated with proposed balanced budget constitutional amendments2 this association is based on the idea that tax limitation provision is needed so that congress would be less likely to raise taxes rather than cut spending in order to produce required balanced budget for example the senate judiciary committee has twice reported proposed balanced budget amendments that included provision limiting increases in receipts to rate not greater than the rate of increase in national income sjres 5 98th congress srept 98628 and sjres 13 99th congress srept 99162 neither proposal received floor consideration proposals to limit the level or rate of growth of revenues were considered on the house floor in conjunction with consideration of proposed balanced budget amendments in the 101st 102nd and 103rd congresses the first floor consideration of freestanding proposal to limit congressional consideration of tax legislation occurred in the 104th congress legislative history action in the 107th congress on june 6 2002 hjres 96 was introduced by representative pete sessions along with 150 cosponsors and referred to the house judiciary committee as introduced hjres 96 contains the following provisions section 1 any bill resolution or other legislative measure changing the internal revenue laws shall require for final adoption in each house the concurrence of two thirds of the members of that house voting and present unless that bill resolution or other legislative measure is determined at the time of adoption in reasonable manner prescribed by law not to increase the internal revenue by more than minimis amount for purposes of determining any increase in the internal revenue under this section there shall be excluded any increase resulting from the lowering of an effective rate of any tax on any vote for which the concurrence of twothirds is required under this article the yeas and nays of the members of either house shall be entered on the journal of that house section 2 the congress may waive the requirements of this article when declaration of war is in effect the congress may also waive this article when the united states is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious threat to national security and is so declared by joint resolution adopted by majority of the whole number of each house which becomes law any increase in the internal revenue enacted under such waiver shall be effective for not longer than two years 1 there have also been proposals to require that measures to increase revenues pass by majority of the total membership of each house rather than majority of members voting quorum being present as is typically required as well as proposals that would require rollcall vote but these are not discussed in this report 2 for more on the legislative history of proposed balanced budget amendments see crs report 97379 balanced budget constitutional amendment

house adopted new provision in its rules now in rule xxi clause 5b to limit certain increases in federal income tax rates this rule was subsequently modified at the beginning of the 105th congress10 some tax limitations advocates however argue that house rule xxi clause 5b is not sufficient and that permanent broadbased limitation needs to be imposed by the constitution they argue that whereas house rules must be readopted every 2 years constitutional amendment is much more difficult to change further they assert that tax limitation would benefit the us economy and that states with tax limitations have comparative advantage in terms of economic growth over states without such limitations advocates of tax limitation amendment point to polls that suggest the public supports the idea of making it difficult for the federal government to raise taxes however opponents argue that supermajority requirement would be antidemocratic and should not be imposed in addition they point out that although several states operate with various types of tax limitations it is not clear that these would be directly applicable to the federal government further they suggest that significant questions remain about the language of proposed tax limitation constitutional amendments and how it might be interpreted either by congress or the courts and point to difficulties in applying house rule xxi clause 5b in the 104th congress the term revenue appears in this context in article i section 7 of the constitution the socalled origination clause as interpreted by the supreme court the

the congressional record daily edition vol 142 apr 15 1996 p h3304 10 for more on this rule see crs report rl31197 revenue measures in congress procedural considerations by james v saturno crs5 bills raising revenue has typically meant measures raising revenue to support government generally but not necessarily measures that raise funds to support specific governmental programs11 this constitutional understanding of the term revenue may therefore differ from internal revenue as intended in recent limitation proposals relatedly not all types of receipts to the federal government are currently treated alike in the budget process collections from the public based on the governments exercise of its sovereign powers are generally treated as revenues eg personal income taxes collections by the government from business or marketoriented activities are generally treated as offsets to outlays eg various royalties and licensing fees these offsetting collections are sometimes applied against the outlays of specific agency or program and sometimes against the outlays of the government generally in an effort to clarify the application of supermajority requirement the terms internal revenue and internal revenue laws have sometimes been used as with house rule xxi these terms are intended to limit the application of proposed amendments to legislation concerning explicit changes in tax laws rather than all legislation effecting revenues however these terms have not been subject to rigorous interpretation by the courts therefore how the application of such limitation might be interpreted remains unclear it is possible that limitation on tax increases could apply only to measures that raise money for the general fund of the federal government but not to some funds raised for specific programs or for some types of fees paid to the federal government or government entities for example at one time president clinton proposed that fees be imposed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the federal reserve for the examination of both fdicinsured banks and bank holding companies it is not clear whether such fees tied to particular closely related service might be regarded as revenues for the purposes of this type of limitation amendment conversely the phrase increasing revenue as used in these proposals could be interpreted to apply these requirements broadly to wide variety of measures such provision might apply not only to measures that would increase revenues by increasing the rate of taxation but also to measures that would increase revenues by lowering the rate of taxation while increasing either the taxable base or the volume of taxable activity or both broadly interpreted such provision could have an impact on large portion of the legislation considered by congress legislation that has the direct or indirect effect of stimulating economic hence taxable activity and thereby increasing revenues might be covered by tax limitation provision for most recent proposals the question of rate increases versus revenue increases is not resolved although revenue increased resulting from lowered rates were specifically excluded from the application of hjres 37 and hjres 94 106th congress 11 justice joseph v story in commentaries on the constitution of the united states boston hilliard gray co 1833 reprint edition littleton co fred b rothman co 1991 vol 2 chap xiii sec 877 p 343 wrote that only bills to raise taxes in the strict sense of the word are bills for raising revenue and that bills for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue are not included this principle has been upheld by the supreme court in several instances for example twin city bank v nebeker 167 us 196 1897 millard v roberts 202 us 429 1906 and more recently united states v munozflores 495 us 385 1990 for more on the interpretation of the term revenue see crs report rl31399 the origination clause of the us constitution interpretation and enforcement by james v saturno crs6 to overcome some of the imprecision in such definitions several proponents have tried to develop language that focuses more on the terms of the measures than on their effect on revenues during the 104th congress one such proposal would have required any bill to levy new tax or increase the rate or base of any tax may pass only by two thirds majority of the whole number of each house of congress hjres 159 sjres 49 similarly the focus of hjres 62 105th congress and hjres 37 106th congress was partly on the form of measure rather than on its effect each proposal specifies that it would apply to measures changing internal revenue laws although it qualifies that phrase by excluding measures whose effect would not be to increase internal revenue by more than minimis amount12 the language in hjres 94 106th congress and hjres 41 107th congress takes this one step further by specifying the supermajority requirement would not apply to any legislation projected to produce increased revenue as result of lowering of an effective rate again the language is such that some interpretation would be required to fulfill the measures mandate for example president clinton proposed limiting deferrals of gains associated with exchanges of likekind property used in trade or business or for investment to only those exchanges located within the united states would this narrowing of the provision to exclude exchanges of property located outside the united states be seen as change in the taxable base and therefore subject the proposal to supermajority requirement also would the extension of tax due to expire be seen as new tax and thus require twothirds to pass however proposals in this vein generally focus on the effect of revenue legislation for example one typical proposal prohibits bill to increase receipts from becoming law unless approved by threefifths majority in each house sjres 12 105th congress it is not clear whether limitation on increasing revenues could also be applied to measures which increase tax rates to level intended to inhibit an activity eg possible increase in taxes on tobacco products and thus lower taxes collected the intended effect in such case may be reduction in revenues due to the inhibitory effect of making something cost more rather than an increase in revenues due to the higher rate the question remains as to how limitation amendment would be applied to such provision so that the longterm intended effect of such measure would exempt it from the restrictions of tax limitation provision by offsetting any temporary upsurge in revenues due to the increased rate or so that the shortterm revenue increase would be sufficient to require the measure to be passed by supermajority in the above example questions concerning the rate at which revenues would decrease and possibly when could make revenue estimates critical and controversial factor in determining the applicability of tax limitation constitutional amendment who would make such estimates possibly the joint tax committee the congressional budget office the treasury department or the office of management and budget relatedly would estimates focus on revenues generated in the next fiscal year or some longer period in addition the reliability of estimates already significant factor in the budgeting of federal expenditures would likely be at issue 12 the phrase more than minimis amount is generally understood to mean more 01 of federal revenues for other versions of this document see
