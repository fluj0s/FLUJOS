stephen cooney and robert pirog resources science and industry division march 28 2007 abstract two major issues or uncertainties may serve as economic constraints on such major capital investment undertaking the ﬁrst is whether the price of natural gas over the long term will repay investment in project now estimated to cost 25 billion or more and which would not deliver gas to the major us markets before 2017 secondly the price of steel the material to be used in building pipeline has more than doubled since 2003 and may account for signiﬁcant share of increased cost

ish the regulatory framework for building pipeline to bring natural gas from the alaska north slope to the lower 48 states alaska natural gas transportation act 15 usc 719 et seq despite the rich deposits of natural gas and the success of the alaska oil pipeline the alaska segment of gas pipeline has never been started to encourage its development congress passed in 2004 and the president signed into law the alaska natural gas pipeline act division c of pl 108324 which includes federal loan guarantee of as much as 18 billion since then north slope producers other potential pipeline developers and the state of alaska have been in extensive discussions on building gas pipeline under provision of the 2004 law as application for certificate of public convenience and necessity for the pipeline had been received 18 months after passage of the law the department of energy on april 13 2006 began study on alternative approaches to the construction and operation of an alaska natural gas transportation system two major issues or uncertainties may serve as economic constraints on such major capital investment undertaking the first is whether the price of natural gas over the long term will repay investment in project now estimated to cost 25 billion or more and which would not deliver gas to the major us markets before 2017 natural gas prices in the north american market are high but volatile spot prices rose to more than 13 per million btus in 2005 then fell to less than 6 by late summer 2006 the natural gas spot price reached 9 per million btus in only one week during the winter 200607 heating season developments of liquefied natural gas technology and of advanced drilling technologies portend new sources of supply at the same time the department of energys energy information administration reports that the only significant increase in us demand for natural gas over the past 10 years has been for electricity generation secondly the price of steel the material to be used in building pipeline has more than doubled since 2003 and may account for significant share of increased cost estimates earlier the pipeline project was viewed by some observers as possible way to boost domestic steel demand at time when prices were low many major rth american producers had gone into bankruptcy and trade safeguards were in place but the steel industry has recovered and restructured moreover because of the conditions under which the pipeline would be built and operated the gas producers pipeline consortium has specified grade of steel that is not yet produced anywhere commercially the american iron and steel institute aisi estimates that 3 to 5 million tons of steel could be required but states th at sufficient capacity can be readily developed in north america for manufacturing the necessary steel pipe pl 108324 contains sense of congress resolution that north american steel should be used in the project exxonmobil corporation one of the three developers of alaska north slope oil and gas has however announced an agreement with two japanese companies to commercialize new type of high strength steel that could reduce alaska pipeline costs

including federal loan guarantee of as much as 18 billion since then the north slope producers other potential pipeline developers and the state government of alaska have been engaged in extensive discussions on building gas pipeline this report focuses on two major issues or uncertainties that may serve as economic constraints on capital investment undertaking of this major scale natural gas prices in the north american market are high but volatile with gulf of mexico production shutdowns occasioned by major hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 spot prices rose to more than 13 per million btus prices fell to less than 6 by late summer 2006 they increased again in the winter 200607heating season but only once exceeded 9 per million btus advances in liquefied natural gas technology and transportation and in drilling technologies in difficult operating environments portend new sources of supply for the domestic market it is not clear if the fundamental demandsupply balance in the market will sustain high enough price over the long term to make building an alaska gas pipeline profitable venture the price of steel the major construction material to be used in building pipeline has more than doubled since 2003 earlier the pipeline project was viewed by some observers as possible way to boost domestic steel demand at time when prices were low global capacity was ample the domestic industry was being protected by extensive trade safeguards and many major north american producers had gone into bankruptcy but the steel industry has recovered and restructured higher prices for steel have contributed to an estimated increase in the cost estimates for the alaska gas pipeline from less than 20 billion to at least 25 billion moreover because of the conditions under which the pipeline will be built and operated the gas producers have specified grade of steel that is not yet produced anywhere commercially

reserves in the north slope at 354 trillion cubic feet tcf which is the energy equivalent of about 63 billion barrels of oil2 for comparison the entire annual us consumption of natural gas is approximately 20 tcf but most of the gas produced on alaskas north slope 80 of the eight to nine billion cubic feet produced annually has been reinjected into the ground3 only small amount has been used for operations in conjunction with oil production and transportation such as powering oil through pipelines and other local uses alaskan natural gas resources have not been developed because of lack of costeffective transportation to major consuming markets using more stringent definition than the state the energy information administration eia of the federal department of energy estimated that proved natural gas reserves in the entire state of alaska were 82 tcf at the end of 2005 because of the lack of pipeline or nearterm prospects for pipeline the remainder of alaskas gas reserves is commercially unrecoverable4

congress has established statutory framework for an alaska natural gas pipeline the legislative authority for designation of an alaska natural gas pipeline route and for the us role in the approval construction and operation of such pipeline was established in the alaska natural gas transportation act of 1976 15 usc 719 et seq which remains in effect acting under that framework private sector consortium planned natural gas pipeline that would parallel the existing alaska oil pipeline trans alaska pipeline system from the north slope to fairbanks and then head southeastward along the alaska highway and into canada via the ukon territory british columbia and alberta this is the proposed alaska natural gas transportation system angts which was approved by the us and canadian governments in

completed in the early 1980s and is in operation its two legs stretch from central collecting point in alberta in the direction of the us west coast and the midwest they deliver onethird of canadas total annual natural gas exports to the united states 7 but the crucial third leg connecting the prebuilt network to the north slope has never been started it would run for 2140 miles from prudhoe bay to edmonton alberta8 proposed pipeline capacity enhancements from canada to the dwest would increase the total length to 3500 miles9 the planned angts pipeline along the alaska highway route and the completed lower legs of the pipeline into the united states are shown in figure 1 6 codified at 15 usc 720 et seq 7 the prebuild section of the alaska natural gas pipeline in alberta was completed by

state government to build gas pipeline along the alaska highway route one group included the three north slope oil and natural gas producers bp plc conocophillips and exxon mobil corporation10 the other group was led by the alaska gas transmission company subsidiary of midamerican which is major us pipeline operator but in march 2004 midamerican cited the inability of the state of alaska to complete contract that would have allowed our consortium to move forward on an accelerated schedule with an exclusive fiveyear period and withdrew its proposal 11 in june 2004 transcanada corporation canadian pipeline company filed its own separate application to build the complete pipeline while frank murkowski then governor of alaska negotiated primarily with the producers group transcanada has

highway pipelin was proposed by separate group the arctic resources consortium arc based in canada this was the northern route gas pipeline project it was designed to access the prudhoe bay gas field in alaska then to swing offshore across the top of the state under the beaufort sea and to join the existing alberta pipeline connection via the mackenzie river see figure 1 this route also could deliver to the north american market the more recently discovered gas reserves of the mackenzie delta as well as the alaska north slope gas mackenzie river pipeline would require separate 1350 mile project arc claimed that it could feasibly build single 1665mile pipeline connecting both alaska north slope and mackenzie delta gas to north american markets 13 however the northern route was opposed in both congress and the alaska state legislature the alaska legislature enacted law that bans construction of gas pipeline in northern state waters while strongly supporting proposals for pipeline to the south it has been suggested that state officials see greater gain through the income multiplier effect of construction within the state and greater access by alaskan communities to the new gas supplies also at issue is the fact that canadian route would likely serve new canadian gas fields which would then compete with alaska in us markets 14 10 exxon petroleum news feb 8 2004 p 10 11 mid

agreed with the alaskan position hr 4 approved on april 25 2002 it provided that pipeline could be constructed for prudhoe bay gas that traverses the submerged lands of the beaufort sea as well as its adjacent shoreline and that enters canada at any point north of 68n latitude in march 2003 article peter behr of the washington post reported that the route along the alaska highway was mandated by the senate to secure the greatest number of construction jobs for alaskans15 in the 108th congress the house on april 11 2003 passed version of its energy bill which included the same provision as the senate on the location of the natural gas pipeline the same provision was passed again by the senate in the 109th congress and became law as section 103d of the 2004 alaska natural gas pipeline act16 but the law also includes sense of congress provision sec 114 that as north ameri can gas demand will continue to increase dramatically it will be necessary to complete separate mackenzie delta natural gas project and that federal and state officials should work together with officials in canada to ensure both projects can move forward in mutually beneficial fashion this section further stated that federal and state officials should acknowledge that the smaller scope fewer permitting requirements and lower cost of the mackenzie delta project means it will most likely be completed before the alaska natural gas pipeline17 g22g145g142g561g14g146g154g158g142g143g146g142g141g561g16g138g157g158g155g138g149g561g9g138g156g561g17g153g157g146g152g151g561 high prices for natural gas since 2000 have revived interest in the united states and abroad in developing liquefied natural gas lng technology lng is gas that has been liquefied by cryogenic technology transported in specialpurpose carriers then regasified for normal commercial use all four lng plants that were built in the united states in the 1970s have been reopened and more are currently being considered including on the us west coast 18 thus another possibility that has emerged is new natural gas pipeline wholly within alaska to feed an lng operation from there the lng co uld be transshipped by specialpurpose maritime carriers to domestic or foreign markets alaska voters in november 2002 referendum by 61 authorized new state authority to build gas pipeline to parallel the existing oil pipeline from prudhoe bay to valdez and to build new lng plant there this project was promoted by the alaska gas port authority19 but conocophillips alaska representatives in july 2003 reportedly

key question on approaches to building pipeline is government financial support the three major north slope oil and gas development companies exxonmobil conocophillips and bp undertook joint study of the costs of natural gas pipeline especially in view of rise in the north american price of natural gas the study completed in april 2002 estimated the cost of new pipeline as 194 billion if the angts route were used and 186 billion if it followed the northern route via the beaufort sea and the mackenzie delta either way the companies concluded that the cost was prohibitive for natural gas to be commercially delivered to the us market even at relatively high natural gas price levels 21 subsequently the rise in the price of steel and other factors have increased cost estimates for pipeline along the alaska highway to 25 billion22 in response to this question of cost congress has considered number of financial measures to support construction of an alaska pipeline in 2002 the senate included 10 billion loan guarantee for private sector parties that would undertake the project sec 710 of hr 4 as approved in april 2002 and price floor mechanism that would guarantee minimum price for alaskan natural gas through tax credits sec 2503 of the same bill in the 108th congress the senate energy and natural resources committee increased the alaska natural gas pipeline loan guarantee to 18 billion s 14 144 the price floor provision was included as section 511 of the revised energy tax incentives act s 1149 reported by the senate finance committee 23 the stated intention of the energy committee was to amend the energy tax incentives act into s 14 during floor action24 the bush administration in 2002 indicated its opposition to the pricefloor subsidy provision and any similar provision because it would distort markets could cost over 1 billion in annual lost revenue and would likely undermine canadas support for construction of the pipeline and thus set back broader bilateral energy integration 25 the statement of administration policy of may 8 2003 on senate energy legislation reiterated opposition to the pricefloor tax subsidy provision in the senate finance committee bill because it could distort markets and could be very costly26 in response senators john breaux jeff bingaman and tom daschle wrote president bush on may 21 2003 asking him to reconsider this position the three senators argued that given the inevitable volatility of gas prices over the 50 year life of this project this administration position effectively means that pipeline will be built 27 continued third report still lists this option p 1 21 crs interview with exxonmobil spokesman robert h davis april 25 2003 the study assumed that the pipeline would be completed to chicago so

neutrality between the two or more potential routes but opposition to any mandated unilateral selection of routes by the us government particularly if this is included in policy utilizing price support mechanisms for alaskan gas which canada strenuously opposes28 price supports and any other mechanisms that favor alaskan gas over imports from canada also may raise questions under world trade organization agreements the conference report of november 18 2003 on hr 6 hrept 108375 included the loan guarantee provision as approved in the senate energy committee but did not include the price floortax credit mechanism to reduce the risk of low natural gas prices the loan guarantee provision was incorporated into the final 2004 alaska natural gas pipeline act it would authorize the secretary of energy to issue guarantee within two years after final certificate of public convenience and necessity including any canadian certificates of public convenience and necessity is issued for the project the guarantee shall not exceed 80 of the total cost of qualified project up to 18 billion 29 according to press report conoc ophillips publicly confirmed that it would not participate in the pipeline project without price floor mechanism an alaska executive of the company informed conference in anchorage on november 20 2003 that were not going to be able to advance the project without the risk mitigation the same press source stated that bp was still interested in moving forward with the project though it would find the riskmitigation tax credit helpful 30 despite the stance negotiations on building the pipeline continued between the state of alaska and the north slope producers in addition to the basic loan guarantee and to enhance the prospects for the lng alternative senator lisa murkowski sought to provide equal financial incentives for federal support in transporting alaska natural gas to us markets whether that gas moves by pipeline through canada or by tanker from alaskas south coast 31 she succeeded in adding to earlier legislation provision to permit the consideration of an option providing loan guarantee for an lng transportation project in alaska32 this language was incorporated in the 2004 act the portion of the alaska gas pipeline 18 billion federal loan guarantee that could be used to cover an lng project is limited to 2 billion the cost of building lng tankers could be included 33 pursuit of the lng option would entail much shorter pipeline the trans alaska oil pipeline is about 800 miles long and therefore would imply use of much smaller amount of steel of course if the federal guarantee is used an additional amount of domestic steel may be required 28 ambassador of canada michael kergin trust the market and canada

his goal and theirs was to assure fiscally stable conditions under which the pipeline can be built this has meant seeking both longterm fiscal contract between producers and the state under the alaska stranded gas development act as well as changes to the states oil and gas tax and royalty laws draft contract was reached in early 2006 with the producers which provided 20 ownership share for the state of alaska in the primary project elements plus royalties to be paid in gas rather than cash in return the companies would have received guarantee of longterm stable tax rate 35 in august 2006 special session of the legislature approved new petroleum production tax ppt regime for oil and gas producers according to press reports the new plan fundamentally shifted the basis of taxation as sought by the governor and producers from tax on production to tax on net profits the new law also allowed for deductions and tax credits for new investments though it did not allow deduction for building gas pipeline it did allow companies to deduct the cost of gas treatment plants and other infrastructure the final law raised the tax on profits from 20 as originally proposed to 225 it also added surtax at any time when the price of oil is higher than 55 per barrel and set floor to the tax rate at 4 of gross revenues when the price of oil is low 36 the legislature refused to approve the draft contract in two separate special sessions in summer 2006 the oil companies refusal so far to develop the north slope gas fields is controversial in alaska for example it is reported that exxonmobil and its predecessor exxon corporation which operates the states largest untapped gas field has put off developing the field for 30 years and recently fended off state order to submit new development plan or face losing its leases the producers reportedly were concerned with the amendments to the state tax regime as finally approved and determined to secure contract provisions as favorable as possible 37 governor murkowski lost his bid for reelection in the republican primary on august 22 2006 the natural gas pipeline contract provisions were an issue in the campaign even

pipeline she proposed in march 2007 the alaska gasline inducement act designed to replace the alaska stranded gas act her approach would establish new competition under which all applicants willing to accept conditions of the law would be invited to submit their plans for the pipeline requirements include acceptance of threeyear open season in which the pipeline licensee would solicit firm commitments from all parties to ship gas on the pipeline applicants must also commit to firm date by which they would apply for final certificate authorizing the pipeline under agia the state would match the licensees costs in seeking certification up to level of 500 million after the first gas is shipped through the pipeline the state would also promise tenyear tax holiday for the pipeline operator under the agia the state ppt would remain in effect under gov palins plan but subject to future review 39 as stated by ferc in its second report when the commercial project emerges from negotiations between the state of alaska and producers and from the fiscal framework legislated by the state doe will proceed with structuring the loan guarantee40 ferc further estimated that it would be at least 10 years after any co ntract is approved before gas would flow from alaska to the lower 48 states41 moreover in its third report ferc concluded in january 2007 that pipeline application has been developed and the prospects of an application are more remote than year ago over the past year the schedule for an alaska gas pipeline has slipped considerably the main obstacle to prog ress is the failure to resolve state issues necessary before project sponsor will commit to go forward the fresh competitive approach announced by the new governor must be successful if alaska gas is to be

as noted above congress when approving the 2004 alaska pipeline law found that there was ample demand in north america for gas from both alaska and the mackenzie river delta of canada and that both projects should go forward moreover gas from the mackenzie delta may be used as fuel for the major oil sands project in alberta rather than for consumption elsewhere in north america however there is some possibility that moving forward simultaneously with the mackenzie and alaska pipelines could create competition for both steel and labor and thereby drive up the costs and create delays for both projects as currently planned the mackenzie pipeline would be about 800 miles long and would consist of 30inchdiameter pipe of grade that is presently available commercially the pipe would be mostly above ground because of the difficulties in constructing and maintaining pipeline built through permafrost the anticipated delivery rate of the pipeline would be 12 billion cubic feet per day bcfd if built under current plans compared to total current production in canada of 17 bcfd if more gas is found than currently anticipated in the mackenzie delta region plans are that the pipeline could be looped along the same route 45 current plans are that all of the mackenzie gas would be devoted to the alberta oil sands project natural gas is the primary fuel for that project current usage by that project is only about half million bcfd but when the project is built out to planned full capacity by 2015 the natural gas requirement would be 21 million bcfd or more than the anticipated throughput of the mackenzie pipeline at that time total nominal capacity of the oil sands projects would be 44 million barrels of oil per day mbd though official projections by the canadian national energy board are for an average peak output of 30 mbd the oil sands project is calculated to achieve required return of 10 on the projected capital investment as long as the price of oil is at least in the range of 3035 per barrel 46 ferc found that development of the mackenzie pipeline poses certain problems and risks to an alaskan project this not because direct competition in the gas market but because of lack of sufficient pipeline grade steel and shortage of skilled labor required to build two technically challenging arctic projects of such magnitude at the same time47 both ferc and the canadian government emphasize that the project has been expedited by creation under canadian law of joint review panel which is considering all environmental and social aspects of the project and plans to produce final report to the national energy board neb in 2007 one potentially contentious issue that remains unresolved is provision of an acceptable level of access to and benefits from the project for aboriginal peoples who live in and near the mackenzie valley48 if all these issues could have been resolved along the time line projected by the canadian government the mackenzie pipeline could be finished by 2012 before the peak of construction activity projected for an alaska pipeline49 45 connors interview canadian embassy ferc second report p 9 46 govt of canada national energy board neb

approval of the mackenzie gas project it has been reported that the joint review panel process has already led to delay of one construction season in the project and that cost estimates for the pipeline will increase from c75 billion to c10 billion in detailed project estimates being prepared by imperial oil of canada an exxonmobil affiliate active in both the oil sands and mackenzie gas projects private sector analyst quoted in the same article estimated that development of mackenzie delta gas is only economic if crude oil is in the range of 6070 per barrel and natural gas is 79 per million btus 50 in keeping with the expected rise in pipeline costs recent estimates presented by imperial oil with respect to the budget and time line for th overall mackenzie gas project indicate that the mackenzie pipeline will not receive permit before 2008 construction will not begin before 2010 construction would require four years and not be completed before 2014 there is presently not enough gas expected to be recovered from the mackenzie fields to fill the pipeline and additional supply would need to be committed from other fields that may be nearby51 if the mackenzie pipeline project does not go ahead there should be impact on the alaska project but if the mackenzie project is further delayed before proceeding it may lead to increased costs and delays in keeping with fercs concerns should the alaska project be constructed simultaneously

large scale capital investment projects such as an alaskan natural gas pipeline typically require substantial financial commitments at the inception of and in the early years of the project and promise to provide net profits to investors for many years into the future for this reason before undertaking such projects investors use financial tests such as net present value analysis that seek to determine whether for any particular project the value today of the proposed investment funds are less than or greater than the discounted future profit stream the principal financial advantage to having funds currently available is that they can be invested in financial assets and earn market rate of return 53 key factor in evaluating capital investment project decisions is whether this financial return which is given up or traded off is compensated by the potential earnings of the real capital investment54 50 petroleum news costs pose threat sept 3 2006 p 1 51 ibid makeorbreak mac

return may vary depending on the class of financial asset chosen for investment however the financial rate of return is generically referred to as the rate of interest 54 the most common investment

any factor that affects the revenue the project might earn or the costs that the project might accrue is likely to affect the determination of whether the project is profitable and likely to be implemented in the case of an alaskan natural gas pipeline the key market factors are likely to be natural gas prices and consumption levels which will largely determine the revenue derived from the pipeline and the price and availability of steel required to construct the pipeline which is major part of projected costs 55 as result analyses of the natural gas and steel industries and markets carried out in this report can contribute to understanding the nature of the debate concerning the need for and economic viability of an alaska natural gas pipeline additionally these analyses can identify the factors that determine the risk of the project in large scale project that could have economy wide implications such as an alaskan natural gas pipeline risk sharing may be one approach for government policy concerning the project g18g146g153g142g149g146g151g142g561g20g142g157g158g155g151g156g561 an alaskan natural gas pipelines main purpose is to deliver natural gas supplies from fields at the north slope of alaska to consuming markets in the lower 48 states this natural gas is now stranded in the sense that it can be physically produced but cannot be delivered to consumers because of the lack of transportation system currently the gas is not wasted it is reinjected into oil wells operating in the area increasing the productivity of those wells the key factors determining the returns or revenues that might be earned by an alaskan natural gas pipeline are the expected price of natural gas over the life of the pipeline the quantity of natural gas that might be delivered through the pipeline each year and the number of years that the pipeline and the producing fields that feed natural gas into it will be operational these factors are all related to the current and future projected conditions of the natural gas market an analysis of the natural gas market is carried out later in the report g18g146g153g142g149g146g151g142g561g5g152g156g157g156g561 the costs of an alaskan natural gas pipeline fall into two categories investment or capital costs and operating costs large number of factors enter into the determination of either class of costs in subsequent section this report focuses on one of the main capital costs of the project the cost and timely availability of steel pipe that would be used in construction of the pipeline the report focuses on that cost factor because of its potential significance to the north american steel industry g20g146g156g148g561g8g138g140g157g152g155g156g561 in financial analysis the riskiness of given factor is taken to be equivalent to its variability56 if the value of factor is taken to be constant this implies that the factor is risk free if its volatility continued zero ie discounted profits are greater than the initial investment the project qualifies for implementation 55 an additional factor is the availability of skilled labor to construct and operate the pipeline factor not

demonstrates high volatility this is associated with high levels of risk57 generally higher levels of risk associated with capital investment project must be compensated with higher levels of expected return if the project is to be approved for implementation through application of the net present value criterion in relation to an alaskan natural gas pipeline several of the key market factors that will determine the expected revenues and costs are likely to exhibit considerable risk these factors include the price of steel to be used in the construction of the pipeline the near and long term price of natural gas and the price of labor both for construction and operation of the pipeline the demand for natural gas has been projected by many analysts to be relatively assured but available historical and current market data suggests that it too might better be considered as subject to risk the relationship between risk factors and the viability of an investment decision may be of importance when evaluating whether public policy measures to encourage carrying out of the project are appropriate if the benefits of project are captured in their entirety by the investors there is little reason for active public support however if the completion of the project is judged to include significant public benefits then there may be case made for active support of the project through public support public support for an investment project might occur through loan guarantees direct investment participation price and regulatory guarantees policies which encourage demand for the delivered product and the discouragement of substitute produ cts or services however critics argue that if the market will not support the economic viability of the project neither should the government some of these policy options were discussed in an earlier section of this report

relative to 2004 taking place from 2018 through 2030 the aeo projects this growth in demand to be led by electricity generators demand growth through 2019 with more limited growth in the residential commercial and industrial sectors due to the ef fect of higher projected prices the aeos 45 tcf projected demand increase provides the demandside basis for the construction of an alaskan natural gas pipeline which itself would deliver approximately 15 tcf per year the aeo projects changing mix of supply sources which might meet us demand conventional onshore production of natural gas in the lower 48 states is projected to decline by about 10 from 2004 to 2030 to 42 tcf production from the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico is also projected to decline by about 25 from 2004 to 2030 to 18 tcf onshore production from unconventional sources in the lower 48 states is projected to increase by about 27 from 2004 to 2030 to 95 tcf while deepwater production from the gulf of mexico is expected to increase by about 78 from 2004 to 2014 and then decline by about 35 from 2015 to 2030 61 over the period 2004 to 2030 deepwater gulf of mexico production is expected to increase by about 17 to 21 tcf in 2030 alaskan natural gas production is projected to total about 21 tcf this mixture of decreasing and in creasing supply sources provides the supplyside basis for the construction of an alaskan natural gas pipeline imports of natural gas by pipeline from canada are projected to decline by about 44 from 2004 and 2030 to 18 tcf net imports of lng are projected to increase by about 42 from 2004 to 2030 to 44 tcf in the aeo reference case both the alaskan natural gas production and the lng totals are dependent on major capital investments taking place over the next ten years pipeline in the case of alaska and receiving terminals in the case of lng while variety of factors including personal income levels industrial structure technology and environmental considerations are likely to affect the demand and supply of natural gas in us markets in the future the key element is price the aeo projects the price of natural gas to decline from the 2004 levels to an average of 446 per thousand cubic feet mcf by 2016 rising to 592 per mcf by 203062 prices at these projected levels are likely to encourage the construction of an adequate number of new lng terminals in the united states as well as providing incentive to build an alaskan natural gas pipeline according to the aeo

though the aggregate totals have not changed greatly consumers of natural gas fall into four major groups residential commercial industrial and electric power generators 63 while the aggregate demand for natural gas is frequently estimated to be relatively inelastic or unresponsive to changes in price this may not be equally true for all sectors and may have contributed to sectoral shifts residential consumer demand has declined since 1998 by about 3 probably in response to residential gas prices that were over twice as high in 2006 as in 199864 the effect of higher prices was likely offset by the trend toward more and larger homes as well as higher consumer incomes residential consumers may not have tied home heating decisions to the cost of natural gas due to the lack of realtime metering and this might also have supported demand commercial demand has decreased since 1998 by bout 5 in response to commercial gas prices that also were more than twice as high in 2006 as in 1998 industrial demand for natural gas has declined by 23 since 1998 in response to increases in industrial prices for natural gas since 1998 industrial consumption of natural gas either for production process heating or as raw material may be more price responsive than that of the other consuming sectors cost increases might be passed on to consumers or they might be absorbed as lower profits depending on the nature of the market for the industries products for example an industry that is large consumer of natural gas as raw material and has suitable substitute is nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturing 65 also the us fertilizer industry is open to foreign competition which prevents an easy passthrough of cost increases to consumers it is capable of moving production overseas where natural gas prices are generally lower likely accounting for part of the reduced demand from the industrial sector66 63 each of these consumer groups pay different price per unit for natural gas generally large scale consumers pay less per unit than smaller consumers for example the eia reported that in june 2006 residential consumers paid 1495 per mcf while industrial consumers paid 687 per

increased by about 36 from 1998 to 2006 since the early 1990s technology emissions performance the availability of long term contracts and low prices for part of the period have favored natural gas as the fuel of choice for new generating capacity household and commercial demand for electricity is relatively price inelastic because of the nature of its use in the home and in businesses as well as the lack of real time metering to allow users to determine the true cost of their electricity use decisions an important question in the evaluation of an alaskan natural gas pipeline is whether its role will be to allow demand growth for all or part of the 269 tcf projected demand in 2030 or whether its role will be to replace diminished production from currently existing sources or both one scenario could begin with the assumption that dema nd patterns observed over the past nine years will continue in the future this approach would have residential and commercial demand nearly flat electric power demand increasing and industrial demand decreasing industrial demand decreases have been large enough to offset growth in electric power generation because among the sectors industry is the largest user of natural gas another scenario might be that those uses of natural gas in the industrial sector that are price responsive will be exhausted at some level and after that usage level is attained industrial demand would not decline as rapidly in response to price as in the past thus demand would rise over the next decades on balance reviewing the period since 1998 it is not clear whether aggregate us demand growth could provide the major justification for an alaskan pipeline g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g138g151g141g561g11g150g153g152g155g157g156g561 production data for us natural gas production shown in table 1 indicates that although yearto year variations exist there does not appear to be clear upward or downward trend us production decreased by about 5 between 2000 and 2005 but by only by 26 over the period 1998 to 2006 peak us production levels were attained in 2001 near the beginning of the period of volatile escalated prices production is likely related to price but technology and the geological characteristics of the gas fields also play an important role in determining output the difference between us production and us consumption is made up by imports mostly by pipeline from canada the natural gas market unlike the crude oil market is regional rather than global in scope extending along pipeline systems it is possible that the geographic scope of the us natural gas market may expand in the coming decades through the expansion and maturation of the lng market imports from canada increased by approximatel 18 over the period 1998 to 2006 imports of lng increased by about 585 over the period 1998 to 2006 but still accounted for less than 3 of us consumption in 2006 imports from canada are expected to decline in the coming decades as canadian domestic consumption increases more natural gas is used in the production of oil from oil sands and canadian fields continue to deplete these trends could be moderated by the opening of new supplies especially those deliv ered through the proposed construction of the mackenzie river natural gas pipeline or through technological improvements the united states currently has four operational lng receiving facilities plans for expansion at existing facilities coupled with the construction of new facilities could increase the us consumption of lng considerably however the s

production current production draws down the level of proved reserves and new discoveries increase or maintain the level of proved reserves data in table 1 show that the level of us proved reserves of natural gas has increased by approximately 24 over the period 1998 to 2005 another key measure of the production base is the reservetoproduction ratio in 1998 this ratio was 86 implying that at thencurrent production rates the reserve base could sustain production for 86 years by 2005 the reserveto production ratio had increased to 112 implying that the reserve base could sustain us production levels longer than in 1998 69 this increase came after the production of over 133 tcf from the us reserve base during the period 1998 to 2004 natural gas discoveries have more than replaced production draws during this period as noted by the eia in the aeo the sources of us gas production are moving away from conventional onshore to more costly unconventional and deep offshore supplies which may imply an upward trend in the price of natural gas but also suggests that availability is not likely to be sharply reduced relative to current levels

natural gas prices and financial trading patterns he does not carry out statistical analysis that might demonstrate more conclusively causal links between the two sets of data irrespective of the

conditions to the actual performance of the market over the past nine years yields diff ering pictures of the market itself as well as conditions for an alaskan natural gas pipeline this report has identified the future natural gas price the quantity demanded and the output levels of existing gas production sources as key risk factors in evaluating the economic feasibility of an alaskan natural

existing production sources do not decline or are replaced with gas from other more technically or economically viable sources the 45 billion cubic feet of gas per day the pipeline will be capable of delivering could depress the market price in this scenario the economic viability of the pipeline would be in danger as well as that of other relatively high cost sources of gas lng imports also have

term capital projects in the industry the marketfundamentalbased value of natural gas in the short term is determined by the interaction of consumption production and stored quantities since production is relatively constant during any year and consumption tends to be seasonal stored quantities of natural gas balance the market the primary short term direct determinant of consumption and indirect determinant of stored quantities is the weather exceptionally cold weather during the winter heating season can cause demand to surge exceptionally warm weather during the summer season can cause electricity demand much of which on the margin is natural gas generated to surge storage injections typically occur during the spring and summer storage draws typically occur during the winter heating season if cold winter large withdrawals from storage is followed by very warm summer below expected injections into storage it is likely that the price of natural gas will experience upward volatility however this upward price movement may not be permanent or even indicative of long term trends cold winter might be followed by more temperate conditions reversing the natural gas price pressure longterm economic decisions such as the construction of an alaska natural gas pipeline are usually based on expected outcomes over time period commensurate with the economic life of the project favorable or unfavorable short run conditions on the commodity market are often discounted

1000 per ton with plate now more than 750 per ton accounting for the increase by mid2006 the price of pipe was approaching 1200 per ton with the cost of coiled plate close to 800 moreover availability of plate for outsidediameter pipe wider than 36 is limited in the us market to one integrated mill or possibly only to import sources this has resulted in 2006 price quotes above 1050 per ton or three times the price quoted for similar product in 200386 the increased cost of steel could account for substantial share of the increase in cost estimates for the alaska natural gas pipeline actual prices for large quantities of steel pipe for major projects are negotiated by the steel supplier and seller and are not made publicly available but average monthly transaction prices are reported in preston pipe tube report the only data source for largediameter steel pipe prices in pr evious section of the report it was noted that producers study in 20022003 estimated total pipeline cost of 18 billion to 196 billion for the alaska highway route and that more recent timates were at least 25 billion an informed 2006 estimate for the tonnage of pipe needed is at least four million tons which is also the midpoint of the estimate quoted earlier by aisi87 the data in figure 3 show an increase in the average price of steel from about 300 to about 750 per ton and for largediameter pipe from around 600 to about 1100 per ton but pipe for use in arctic conditions would probably require the highest grade of steel available see below so the increase in price since the earlier project estimates were produced may be on the order of at least 500600 per ton that would imply an increased cost of steel pipe for the project of about 2025 billion which alone could account for half or more of the increase in overall project cost estimates 83 based on data from purchasing magazine driwefa steel industry review 4th qtr 2001 p 18 and table 16 84 global insight steel industry review 2nd qtr 2006

of the 2004 alaska natural gas pipeline act expresses the sense of congress that as an alaska natural gas transportation project would provide specific significant economic benefits to the united states and canada its sponsors should make every effort to use steel that is manufactured in north america 88 the relative capabilities of us and canadian industries to supply steel for the project would depend on number of variables including the time frame for completing the project the final route chosen and the pipeline specifications the north slope natural gas producers have indicated that they would require pipe of maximum capacity to ensure the ability to transport high enough volume of gas to earn an adequate return on privately financed system when the 800mile trans alaska oil pipeline was built in the 1970s it used 500000 tons of special coldweather steel 48inch diameter pipe imported from japan 89 there are number of questions today about the capacities of the north american industry to supply the steel that might be required to construct an alaska natural gas pipeline the increase in oil and gas prices in 200506 has encouraged north american drilling activity and increased demand for all steel products used in the oil and gas industry including largediameter pipe for longdistance gas transmission but there are currently only few largediameter pipe producers active in north america90 ipsco inc originally canadian company which now has more of its assets in us mills and its operational headquarters in illinois is the largest north american producer of largediameter pipe it operates pipe mill in regina saskatchewan with an annual capacity of 350000 tons and capability to make pipe up to 80 inches wide plate is supplied from mill there

expand with second mill along the gulf coast but this would be for pipe of lesser diameter ipsco and oregon both operate minimills that supp ly plate for making pipe nucor the largest operator of minimills in north america makes plate at two mills in north carolina and alabama and also can supply plate to customers for pipemaking operations 92 among the large integrated companies both us steel and bethlehem steel have closed some steel pipemaking operations in recent years though us steel makes smaller diameter pipe and tubing for octg applications93 us steel has not in recent years been major market force in plate in 2003 it agreed to trade its plate operation at gary indiana to bethlehems successor mittal steel for different type of operation in the same vicinity 94 according to its corporate website mittal produces plate at its large integrated mill in burns harbor indiana as well as rolling plate at two plants in pennsylvania some of which may be supplie d to makers of larger diameter pipe95 both minimills and integrated steel mills since 2003 have faced much higher input costs which have driven the price of plate higher along with increased industrial demand96 these data portend limited north american capacity in the face of dramatic recent increase in demand for steel in pipelines james declusin then ceo of oregon steel stated that when his company decided to proceed with the new largediameter pipe mill it projected total ongoing demand for about 25 million tons per yearand since then there have been even more projects on the drawing board his largediameter pipe facilities are booked through mid2008 and there are reports of demand remaining at high level through 200910 97 john tulloch senior executive at ipsco noted that largediameter pipe historically accounts for 1020 of us steel plate usage though we had been at 10 or lower for while there now we are at the higher end of that range much closer to 2098 the potential shortage of largediameter pipe has led to number of projects to expand capacity in addition to the oregon steel and berg pipe projects mentioned above plans have been announced by lone star technologies of texas and welspun group of india to build joint venture project somewhere in the south two korean companies posco which already operates jointventure rolling mill with us steel in california and seah steel have announced plans for largediameter pipe mill with capacity of more than 300000 tons 92 see nucor steelhertford and nucor steel tuscaloosa inc on nucor corp website aisi confirmed that nucor does supply plate for

that eia estimates that by 2008 us largediameter pipemaking capacity could total 56 more than in 200799 these additional mills will all use spiralweld technology which is newer and more efficient than straightseam welding of large pipes but which also may not be suitable for the special requirements being contemplated for an alaska natural gas pipeline globally the ipsco report also counts about three million tons of annual capacity in large diameter steel pipe outside north america this is divided roughly equally between the europipe consortium in germany bergs parent company at 16 million tons and three major japanese steelmakers nippon steel sumitomo and jfe at about halfmillion tons each100 steel industry sources emphasize that the capability of the industry to supply pipe for the alaska natural gas project will also depend on the timing and specifications for the pipe the maximum diameter being considered is 52 inches capable of delivering 60 billion cubic feet of gas per day bcfd as indicated in data provided by aisi but 52inch pipe has only been produced in very limited amounts in north america or anywhere else moreover the alaska natural gas producers in the pipeline consortium have indicated that they want to specify measure of strength x100 or x120 grade pipe that is beyond the x80 gradecurrently the highest available in its report ipsco flatly stated that nort h american producer can currently supply the pipe proposed for the alaska pipeline pipeline operating uses these specifications if the line is as specified today 4852 diameter x 080 thickness x x100 we are not able to supply the pipe without major capital expenditures and lead time the company added that it was proceeding with x100 trials but that the spec ifications would require designing out of market capability moreover due to extremely large volume it is very unlikely that it will be supplied by one supplier and the proposed gauge and grade requirements will necessitate capital investment by any potential supplier throughout the world 101 use of this size and grade of pipe would create logistical complexities in pipeline construction and operation requiring for example 48 compressor stations along the alaska route using 48 inch pipe might reduce operational and construction difficulties somewhat and it could be made from x80rated steel but would reduce capacity to 40 bcfd downsizing to 42inch pipe would substantially reduce pipe manufacturers retooling costs but would also reduce capacity to 20 bcfd 102 by comparison construction and operational difficulties would be much less along the mackenzie river route only 10 compressor stations would be required along the river valley route and total of only 465000 tons of 30inch mainline pipe which for example ipsco states it could now provide commercially ipsco was also the largest supplier of pipe for the alliance pipeline cited by aisi and delivered 716 miles of 36inch x70 pipe 103 99 ibid strong demand spurs

to thensenator frank murkowski that north american steel and pipe industries stand ready to work with all other interested parties to arrive at the best pipeline design necessary to accomplish the objective he further advocated that north american steel suppliers be fully included in the design of pipeline and be given an opportunity to compete for steel procurement 104

an alternative type of pipe to that supplied from currently available sources has been advanced by one of the three producers of alaska oil and gas the exxonmobil corporation it hopes to achieve substantial cost reductions by using innovative technology in building the pipeline in seeking to achieve such technology breakthrough exxonmobil representatives on april 22 2003 signed letter of intent with two japanese companies nippon steel corporation nsc and mitsui co ltd to commercialize jointly developed new steel which is 2050 stronger than alternative pipeline steels in use today the agreement includes possible upgrades to an nsc pipe mill the announcement also noted that the formulation for the steel had first been developed in exxonmobil upstream research laboratories and that further work to make commercial production viable has already occurred jointly with nippon steel105 the technical announcement indicated that the new steel would be rated x100 and x120 grades that hitherto have not been manufactured anywhere106 press commentary on the exxonmobil announcement stated that pipe made from the new grade of steel would be lighter in weight and therefore easier to handlemeaning significant potential reductions in construction costs in addition to production and longdistance pipeline interests in alaska and the mackenzie delta exxonmobil also has interests in sakhalintojapan gas pipeline project and the westeast pipeline project being considered to bring gas from central asia to china 107 crs contacted exxonmobil in august 2006 regarding further progress on the highstrength steel project in response company representative replied technical and developmental aspects of the x120 highstrength steel pipeline continue to be studied by exxonmobil and there is new information that we can convey at this time regarding its applicability to specific projects or the timing of its commercial availability 108 the exxonmobil proposal for technologically innovative grade of steel for pipeline construction would not rely on us or canadian steel indust ry technology the new grade of steel could be produced under license although tooling and setup costs

pipeline would be major capital investment if or when it is built the investment decision will depend on complex set of factors that will determine its potential profitability those factors on the expected revenue and cost sides are linked to conditions in two markets natural gas and steel if pipeline is to be constructed estimates provided in this report suggest that its throughput of natural gas might equal about one third of potential us future demand growth for natural gas lng term inals will be the primary competition for the pipeline in filling this potential demand should the expected demand growth fall short of projections natural gas prices will likely decline affecting the potential profitability of both the pipeline and the lng terminals on the cost side the pipeline could generate major steel order for the north american industry however the size of the pipe as well as other required specifications suggest that it will be expensive steel prices have been rising over the past several years resulting in substantial increases in the estimated materials cost of the pipeline additionally innovative production capacity to produce the required pipe might have to be constructed first particularly since one anywhere has yet produced pipe with the dimensions and grade specified to date further affecting the economics of the project the joint venture between exxonmobil and the two japanese steel companies appears to present an option that could spur debate with respect to whose technology and whose steel would be used in this major investment project
