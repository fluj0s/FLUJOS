updated october 30 2006 valerie bailey grasso analyst in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress demilitarization of significant military equipment summary this report examines the process and problems associated with demilitarizing significant military equipment in the united states the demilitarization of military equipment is an important issue today evidence has shown that because of some failures in enforcement potentially harmful weaponry and parts are finding their way into the hands of private citizens as well as possible enemies of the united states the effort to dispose of and demilitarize surplus military equipment dates back to the end of world war ii when the federal government decided to reduce massive inventory of surplus military equipment by making such equipment available to civilians the department of defense dod identifies and disposes of approximately 20 billion of military surplusexcess materiel annually items ranging from desks and chairs to full weapons systems recently at july 2006 hearing before the house government reform committee subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations bennie williams the defense logistics agency dla director of logistics operations identified four target areas for managing the collection inventory and access to surplus and excess military equipment 1 processing controls for batch lot items and materials requiring demilitarization 2 processing of items received at the defense reutilization and marketing service drms coded with local stock numbers 3 improved controls regarding access to drms inventory assets and 4 reducing the concurrent procurement of items available at drms multiple agencies are involved in the control of excess and surplus defense equipment and weapons because dod does not have the authority to fully enforce all demilitarization standards even the dod demilitarization policy in place is regarded as ineffective and incomplete there is centralized federal authority to manage the program as each federal agency has its own policy and internal regulations which govern the acquisition use and disposal of demilitarized property proponents who argue for the demilitarization of military equipment say that it is necessary to prevent accidental injury and death while avoiding the unnecessary transfer of potentially harmful technology or military capability to domestic or foreign sources opponents however argue that the demilitarization issue is an attempt by the federal government to usurp the legal rights of lawabiding citizens and groups to own or possess firearms in the future congress may consider several demilitarization options ranging from 1 permitting selective exemption 2 appointing one agency as executive program agent for all agencies 3 convening an independent panel 4 conducting hearings or 5 taking action this report will be updated as warranted contents introduction 1 the process and the problem 2 recent congressional hearings on dod demilitarization and disposal policy 5 government accountability office investigations 9 recent legislative developments 9 current issues on demilitarization 11 policy options for congress 14 permit selective exemption 14 establish one agency as executive agent for all federal agencies 14 convene independent panel 15 conduct hearings 15 take action 15 list of figures figure 1 disposition of dod surplus weapons and equipment 3 demilitarization of significant military equipment introduction the effort to dispose of and demilitarize surplus military equipment dates back to the end of world war ii when the federal government decided to reduce massive inventory of surplus military equipment by making such equipment available to civilians1 through the establishment of the defense surplus program the public was able to purchase military goods and supplies as well as scrap metal the federal government created program to loan and donate equipment to private organizations some equipment has become part of historical collections andor is used for military exhibitions and war reenactments before military equipment is released to individuals or groups it is supposed to meet certain demilitarization standards according to the department of defense dod to demilitarize military equipment is to destroy its inherent military offensive or defense capability the demilitarization process itself may include scrapping melting burning or alteration of the material to prevent further use of its originally intended military or lethal purpose demilitarization applies equally to equipment that may be in serviceable or unserviceable condition and to equipment that has been screened and rendered to be excess equipment once properly demilitarized the equipment or materiel may be rendered inoperable2 as an example of what can happen when incorrect codes are assigned an article in newsweek revealed how sensitive air force communications parts which required total destruction or code d when demilitarized wound up in worldwide auction on ebay3 1 this report focuses primarily on the demilitarization of military equipment however the disposal of surplus equipment is closelyrelated issue which affects the demilitarization process at the end of world war ii the united states had approximately 34 billion of surplus weapons equipment and supplies on hand in order to reduce equipment inventories and raise monies to repairreplace aged equipment and purchase modern weapons the federal government increased the size and scope of its defense surplus program and sold or gave away weapons and equipment to individuals and groups the more surplus equipment and weapons available to individuals and groups the greater the need for equipment demilitarization 2 demilitarization manual dod 416021m1 chapter 26k demilitarization and disposal certain military equipment is classified as significant military equipment sme and is defined in the code of federal regulations 22 cfr 1207 as articles for which special export controls are warranted because of their capacity for substantial military utility or capability 3 carem ed hot deal on spy gear newsweek june 10 2002 p 8 crs2 this report examines the process and problems associated with demilitarizing significant military equipment in the united states the demilitarization issue is an important one today because evidence has shown that due to failures in enforcement potentially harmful weaponry and weaponry parts are finding their way into the hands of private us citizens as well as potential enemies of the united states the process and the problem the demilitarization of significant military equipment can be best understood through an examination of the dod surplus property disposal process the disposal of defense surplus property is delegated to dod from the general services administration gsa the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 authorizes gsa to dispose of government real and personal property and dod is delegated responsibility for the supervision direction sale and final disposition of dod property4 dod further delegates this responsibility to the defense logistics agency dla and dla authorizes component group the defense reutilization and marketing service drms to carry out the disposal activity5 prior to 1972 each branch of military service had its own independent surplus equipment program after 1972 the army was assigned exclusive control6 4 dod 41401r defense materiel disposal manual specific guidance for property identified as munitions list items mlicommercial control list item ccli can be found in dod 416021m1 defense demilitarization manual for complete explanation of definitions interpretations acronyms and other terms of reference used in this report see appendix 2 of the defense materiel disposal manual 5 10 usc 2572 the demilitarization of military equipment and materiels is one of four managerial responsibilities under the dod donation program the dod donation program is under the auspices of the defense reutilization and marketing service drms which is part of the defense logistics agency dods principal combat logistics support organization drms is charged with the administration of the defense materiel disposition program worldwide in the role of the integrated program manager 6 see httpdocsusapabelvoirarmymiljw2xmldemor700144mainasp although the army was the lead agency prior to 1998 there were us army regulations which governed the demilitarization policy thus the military services operated under the broad guidance of title 10 united states code usc section 2572 and each program interpreted the rules differently for example the center for military history often waived the demilitarization requirements for certain organizations under this provision the center was able to give away fully operational cobra helicopters to private citizens citing lack of funding to support helicopter restoration the center offered helicopters in exchange for having private citizens assume the restoration costs and granted waivers to certain organizations to exercise control over property for example one museum moved its property from state to state without dods knowledge or permission in 1998 then secretary of the army togo west issued regulation on army demilitarization policies under the new regulation the center would be responsible for the historical collection of military property while the army materiel command would assume responsibility for all other property crs3 drms was formed in 1972 largely to fix the problems with the defense surplus equipment program headquartered in battle creek michigan drms has total work force of 1328 civilians and 11 active duty military personnel drms has offices in 37 states and 14 countries including iraq and afghanistan providing support at major us military installations around the world7 in fy2005 drms processed 34 million line items with an original acquisition value of over 20 billion8 surplus and excess items can be large and small and can range from baby bottles and desks to automobiles and full weapon systems dod identifies and disposes of approximately 20 billion dollars acquisition value of excess and surplus property annually excluding ammunition small arms chemical weapons nuclear weapons or classified materials9 excess defense property goes to drms for redistribution within dod or transfer to other federal agencies property not transferred or redistributed is deemed surplus and donated to eligible state and local governments as well as among other qualified organizations figure 1 disposition of dod finally property that remains is sold to the 10 surplus weapons and equipment general public some as scrap metal figure 1 illustrates that less than 1 donations of all weapons and equipment designated as surplus is transferred within dod to to dod other agencies or to the military services services approximately 50 of weapons and equipment are designated for the foreign military sales program while the remaining 50 of weapons and equipment are designated for provisional transfer to qualified organizations through the dod surplus equipment

foreign military sales program is not the focus of this report however the defense science board identified foreign military sales as significant potential for property leaks that slipped through the dod demilitarization process for general discussion of the continued crs4 according to drms policy when surplus and excess items requiring demilitarization are transferred within dod to the military services or other dod agencies the responsibility for accomplishment of demilitarization is also transferred however when surplus and excess items requiring demilitarization are transferred or donated to qualified individuals and groups such as state agencies museum owners and foundations provisional title transfer is granted meaning that those qualified agencies individuals or groups must return the items when they are longer in possession of them therefore they are prohibited from selling or leasing the items to third party not specifically authorized to possess them property released through public sale is not considered sold until the demilitarization process is completed since demilitarization is condition of sale dod maintains that if there is demilitarization there is sale under these circumstances dod maintains that private owners or those in possession of dod equipment cannot pass on ownership to subsequent owners12 each item of property is assigned demilitarization or demil code13 codes are assigned when items are first manufactured for or purchased by dod each of the military services sets the demilitarization code for each item it owns in the dod inventory the defense logistics agency dla has the ability to challenge the demilitarization code on an item if it appears an error was made but each military service retains ultimate decisionmaking authority over demilitarization codes for its items the military services assign the codes for spare parts for new aircraft ships weapons supplies and other equipment the code determines whether the item contains military technology or capability and establishes what must be done to an item before it is sold to the public codes are reviewed and revalidated every 5 years there are nine code categories depending on whether the item is part of the united states munitions list items usmli or commerce control list item ccli codes range in severity items coded with the letter require demilitarization14 while items coded with the letter d require total destruction of 11 continued foreign military sales program see crs report rs20428 excess defense articles grants and sales to allies and friendly countries

property which must be completed by all applicants for mliccli property prior to acceptance by the federal government this document is required by the dod trade security office prior to the propertys removal from dod the applicant certifies hisher status as 1 citizen of the united states of america 2 lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence and maintains such residence under the immigration and nationality act as amended 3 citizen of another country or 4 an official of foreign government entity in the unites states 13 see httpwwwdemilosdmildocumentsapp3_99pdf for complete list of military equipment demilitarization codes and coding guidance 14 according to bennie williams dla director of logistics operations dla manages over 70 of the code line items received by drms of particular concern is that many of these items were in excess yet in serviceable condition to increase reutilization with dod continued crs5 item and components so as to preclude restoration or repair to usable condition by melting cutting tearing scratching breaking punching neutralizing etc15 demilitarization rules vary according to the type of organization that is gaining possession of the property prior to 1998 the demilitarization policy allowed museums to receive fully operational tanks dod is aware of one museum that has m60 tanks fully operational but the guns on the tanks have been rendered inoperable recent congressional hearings on dod demilitarization and disposal policy during the 109th congress several hearings and related investigations were held to reexamine the dod surplus and excess property system new investigation revealed that many of the problems uncovered during previous congressional hearings were still present sensitive military equipment continued to be sold andor donated to the public at the july 2006 hearing before the house government reform committees subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations the government accountability office gao testified that from fy2002 through fy2004 dod disposed of 33 billion in excess property of which 4 billion was reported to be in new unused or excellent condition of the 4 billion approximately 12 or 495 million of this property was used within dod the remaining 35 billion in property was transferred or donated outside of dod sold to the public or destroyed as part of the probe into the inventory control process investigating gao staff purchased sensitive military equipment items that were improperly sold to the public at the same time dod continued to purchase many of the same items16 at the july hearing bennie williams dla director of logistics operations discussed dods efforts to improve the performance of the surplus and excess property inventory management and control system mr williams identified four target areas for managing surplus military equipment 1 processing controls for batch lot items and materials requiring demilitarization 2 processing of items received at the defense reutilization and marketing service drms coded with 14 continued there is now greater coordination of effort among osd dla and the military services 15 dod

forensic audits and special investigations july 25 2006 10 pages crs6 local stock numbers 3 improved controls regarding access to drms inventory assets and 4 reducing the concurrent procurement of items available at drms17 during the 106th congress congress had directed dod to submit plan to address problems associated with the disposal of surplus and excess defense materials18 in floor debate on the fy1999 defense authorization bill senator charles grassley compared the equipment demilitarization and disposal problems as similar to the problems identified some 25 years earlier at senator john mcclellans 1972 committee hearing on the same issue19 senator grassley observed that the problem with lax disposal isnt new the first congressional hearings on this topic were conducted in the early 1970s at that time congress received testimony that the pentagons program for ensuring the disposal of surplus items was in shambles under current practice the pentagon has decided the answer to the question of what to do with surplus parts is to sell them to the highest bidder with practically controls in placemr president the depots which sell sensitive military surplus have become thriving terrorist flea markets in fact the pentagon even has world wide web homepage to advertise military surplus for sale some of it classified who knows right now some of saddam husseins henchman could be browsing this homepage looking for spare parts or new weaponsfinally id like to sum up the situation we have here despite congressional oversight going back to senator mcclellans 1972 hearings nothing has really changed therefore its clearly time for congress to step up to the plate and take action thats why im offering this amendment to the dod authorization bill to give law enforcement an enhanced ability to catch arms smugglers who are targeting military surplus20 on july 8 1997 senator grassley as chair of the senate judiciary subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts called for an investigation into the disposition of government surplus items citing media reports that indicated that disposal procedures were unacceptably loose21 at the hearing 17 statement of bennie williams before the house government reform committee subcommittee on national security emerging threats and international relations july 25 2006 the hearing was titled dod excess property

defense disposition of government surplus items senate hearing 105227 judiciary hearing 105 continued crs7 the chief witnesses were dave barrington and jack blackway mr barrington was former dod criminal investigator with the dod trade security control office who had been interviewed as part of threemonth media investigation into the surplus weapons program he had resigned from his position in protest over the poor enforcement procedures mr blackway was the head of the dod trade security controls office both mr barrington and mr blackway testified to the existence of many program deficiencies including lack of resources and staff mr blackway expressed the opinion that the current staff and resources were insufficient to handle the broad range of demilitarization program responsibilities senator grassley noted in his remarks before the hearing that mr barrington has been fundamental in alerting the public to the demilitarization problems and has been interviewed many times on the subject you may have read about his interviews with us news and also 60 minutes22 according to transcripts of the hearing the 1996 media investigations were major factor in the decision to conduct the congressional investigation and hold the 1997 hearings the media investigation referred to was threemonth joint investigation by journalists from the television news program 60 minutes along with journalists from the periodical us news and world report which uncovered significant problems in the military surplus weapons program23 the investigation examined pentagon records and us customs service documents and conducted interviews with many federal officials the investigation identified three major deficiencies dod had incorrectly coded many weapon components in the military equipment inventory as result of the push for reducing the size of the surplus military weapon and equipment inventory at the end of the cold war as well as to generate cash for new equipment and modernized weapons dod held weapon and equipment auctions at over 170 military installations in so doing dod inadvertently mislabeled many military parts that should have been earmarked for total destruction as result these parts were made available for sale at auctions where scrap metal dealers could purchase them cheaply and by the pound at the hearing it was reported that some dealers would sort through the mountains of 21 continued 30 july 8 1997 several witnesses with direct responsibility for aspects of surplus and demilitarization policies gave testimony at the hearing they included dave barrington former investigator defense logistics agency bonnie tischler assistant commissioner for the office of investigations us customs service john hensley special agent us customs service lee dolan senior special agent us customs service capt randle bales associate executive director defense logistics center and jack blackway chief of dods demilitarization policy 22 excerpts from the

scrap metal to find precious metals and sell them for modest profit other dealers learned that many mislabeled parts were functioning pieces from sophisticated weapons systems that when assembled would produce fully engaged weapon of military capability many of these parts were discovered through the practice of dumpster diving24 as result many buyers purchased technologically advanced military components dod made available large quantities of usable military weapon components according to the investigation federal task force investigating leaks in the military surplus system seized some 75 tons of usable parts from cobra attack helicopters parts it said that dod should never have released in another case reporter from us news and world report purchased for 325 the component which guides the hawk missile to its target in this case the dealer who sold the item was unaware of the sensitive nature of the weapon components dod was ineffective in staffing supervision and exercising program controls in the operation and management of the program according to dave barrington former dod investigator dod personnel suffered from lack of proper training in identifying and classifying military surplus equipment the sheer quantities of equipment received on weekly basis meant that some equipment that should have been completely destroyed was sold in perfectly good working condition for example dod regulations called for the complete destruction of cobra helicopter parts on the one hand investigators saw cobra helicopters being destroyed at one outlet on the other hand at another surplus outlet in different state two fully functioning cobra helicopters were built with surplus parts and sold as result of the hearings dod designated one new staff position for the trade security controls office currently the dod trade security controls office is comprised of the demilitarization policy program manager the dod trade security controls program manager and demilitarization and trade security controls specialist despite the addition of one new staff position mr blackway states that the demilitarization policy and procedures remain largely unchanged today that despite efforts to improve the program many of the same problems identified in the congressional hearings in both 1972 and 1997 continue to exist today25 24 see

securitycompromising information or raiding the dumpsters behind buildings where producers andor consumers of hightech equipment are located with the expectation of finding discarded yet still valuable equipment 25 views and comments attributed to dod were offered by mr jack blackway dod demilitarization program manager and his staff during an interview conducted at his office continued crs9 government accountability office investigations prior to 2006 gao had conducted several investigations into the dod surplus and excess property program as early as 1990 gao had identified the dod surplus property program as high risk program because of the potential for waste fraud abuse and mismanagement the senate committee on governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform supported gaos efforts and gao conducted series of investigations into various aspects of the surplus property program management26 recent legislative developments section 8016 of the fy2007 dod appropriations act hr 5631 prohibits the use of dod funds to demilitarize or dispose of m1 carbines m1 garand rifles m14 rifles 22 caliber rifles 30 caliber rifles or m1911 pistols section 8069 of the same bill prohibits the transfer of certain ammunition such as centerfire cartridge and armor penetrating or armor piercing except under contract with dod to perform demilitarization such contract would require the contractor to demonstrate that the equipment is rendered incapable of reuse by the demilitarization process or is used to manufacture ammunition subject to contract with dod or the manufacture of ammunition for subject to department of state license for permanent export of unclassified military articles during the 107th congress several bills were introduced that passed would require change in dod demilitarization policy two provisions of hr 5010 the fy2003 dod appropriations required the demilitarization of surplus firearms and made it unlawful for dod to transfer certain armorpiercing ammunition to any 25 continued on december 3 2001 26 since 1990 gao has conducted number of investigations into the operation of the dod surplus and disposal programs as discussed in the

authorization bill would have made it unlawful for any person to possess equipment not fully demilitarized that legislation became provision known as section 1062 of senate bill 1438 the senateversion of the fy2002 national defense authorization bill section 1062 was defeated in the conference committee in 1998 congress directed dod to draft proposed legislation designed to clarify the authority of the federal government to recover significant military equipment released without adequate demilitarization29 dods legislative proposal eventually became known as section 1062 section 1062 would have required the secretary of defense to establish regulatory standards to govern the demilitarization of equipment not covered under current demilitarization policy and do the following 1 define classes of military equipment requiring demilitarization before disposal and what constitutes demilitarization for each class of significant military equipment 2 ensure that the demilitarized equipment would not pose significant risk to public safety and have uniquely military capability or significant capability for use as weapon 3 place the burden of proof of ownership of such military weapons and equipment on the person in possession of the equipment and not on the federal government 4 provide compensation to those persons whose property was confiscated by the federal government 5 grant the secretary of defense the authority to delegate broad powers to the attorney general to investigate suspected violations including inspection and seizure of the property according to dod the senate armed services committee made some changes to its original legislative proposal by incorporating the recommendations of the defense science board task force the task force studied the issue and issued report titled control of military excess and surplus materiel30 in the report the 27 pl 107248 sections 8019 and 8090 28 section 8020 of hr 3338 29 section 1051 plan for improved demilitarization of excess and surplus defense property fy1999 defense authorization act hr 3616 pl 105261 october 17 1998 30 control of military excess and surplus materiel report of the defense science board task force office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology december 1998 62 p defense science board report p 32 the task force recommended that congress give dod the authority for the entire demilitarization of military equipment as the majority of property in question is property that dod owns or formerly owned the report concluded that dod should be the final decision authority for all dod demilitarization and control items and thus should negotiate memorandum of understanding with gsa giving dod final approval for distribution of demilitarization and controlled items or initiate legislation to establish dod decision authority for all demilitarization and controlled items as well as for equipment like tanks that is not covered by the current regulation the report recommended that given the overlaps and gaps in control of property due to the involvement of multiple agencies dod should adopt cradle to grave principle in the vigorous enforcement of demilitarization laws non continued crs11 task force identified six sources of potential leaks of materiel requiring demilitarization and control and found that privatelyowned museums constituted the most significant source of leakage the task force concluded that single agency had the lead authority or responsibility for controlling such equipment which resulted in overlaps and gaps in coverage that law enforcement efforts were largely resourcedependent and that the demilitarization coding process was too complicated31 current issues on demilitarization views expressed by dod and various public interest groups are in stark contrast to each other dod officials believe that the passage of the proposed but deleted section1062 of the fy2002 dod authorization bill would have allowed dod to correct past demilitarization errors and write new rules to address the demilitarization of all items32 in contrast however several groups of military equipment enthusiasts spoke out against the bill including its use of the term significant military equipment dod has reportedly sought to gain control over military equipment in the possession of individuals or groups and has long advocated for tighter military equipment demilitarization policies however the dod demilitarization program manager ddpm maintains that the program lacks authority staff and resources the ddpm could not estimate how much it would cost to implement fullscale demilitarization program as it cannot estimate the large number of items that fall under the category of significant military equipment more specifically the ddpm believes that the program lacks resources to implement lifecycle from cradle to grave management program three staff members administer demilitarization and trade security control policy eleven criminal investigators make up the dods trade security controls office whose job is to ensure that nothing is released from dod without proper controls due to the sheer volume of the materiels received they can only investigate the most egregious cases dod maintains that efforts to investigate and recover this property have been less than successful when dod officials have referred suspected cases to the 30 continued dod agencies could then continue to distribute excess materiel with dod approval of demilitarization and controlled items gsa disagreed with this recommendation 31 the defense science board task force concluded that in some cases dod property was destroyed that could have been sold resulting in lost revenue from sales while some dod property was sold which should have been demilitarized resulting in an increase in the potential threat for acts of domestic or foreign terrorism for further discussion see wichner david bin laden jet trainer was stored in tucson arizona daily star web version november 18 2001 32 views and comments attributed to dod were offered by mr jack blackway dod demilitarization program manager and his staff during an interview conducted at his office on december 3 2001 crs12 department of justice action has been taken according to mr blackway doj has cited lack of definitive authority to take action33 in addition dod does not always know where its military equipment loaned to museums is located according to dod there have been instances where museums have moved traded and sold property without dods permission dod has maintained that equipment loaned to private museums is given for conditional display meaning that the museum does not have full ownership of the property museum has clear title to the property dod maintains ownership as in the case of property released through public sale property is not considered sold until the demilitarization process is completed another issue is the different agency authorities for demilitarization policies the responsibilities for both the surplus weapons program and the demilitarization of military equipment are dispersed and thus create some jurisdictional problems the gsa and the departments of commerce defense justice34 state and treasury all have separate rules governing the disposal of demilitarized property for example materiel that is classified as significant military equipment is listed on the united states munitions list usml which is under the jurisdiction of the department of state35 the state department is also responsible for direct commercial sales and transfers the department of commerce is responsible for items on the commercial control list items ccli36 in contrast dod surplus disposal falls under the jurisdiction of the dod trade security controls office which has limited authority for the demilitarization of military equipment the task force concluded that while dod had strengthened its control and monitoring of surplus and donations gsas more generous management control guidelines needed considerable improvement 37 33 the ddpm believes that doj does not place high priority on these cases and that there is some reluctance on dojs part to investigate such cases due to its past missteps in some civil law enforcement situations such as ruby ridge and waco 34 under section 1111 of hr 5005 the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms formerly the atf will be transferred from the department of the treasury to the department of justice and renamed as the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives 35 the following explanation was provided by jack blackway director dod trade security controls office the united states munitions list usml 22 cfr 120130 international traffic in arms regulations itar lists and defines materiel that is militarily unique sme and therefore requires special export controls the remainder of the materiel on the usml that is not designated as sme is afforded special conditions for release from dod control including enduse certification and clearance of recipients additionally dod requires these same controls on dualuse materiel listed in 15 cfr 774 commerce control list which is under the jurisdiction of the department of commerce for export control 36 control of military excess and surplus materiel report of the defense science board task force office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology december 1998 p 31 37 ibid p 42 crs13 number of groups including some veterans groups and military weapons enthusiasts were opposed to the proposed section 1062 they take great pride in owning the relics of war some have channeled their affinity for military weaponry into attending war reenactments military air shows and expeditions and owning private gun collections others have organized private museums of military weapons and artifacts some groups were concerned that if the proposed section 1062 had been enacted into law dod would have been able to confiscate the item from whomever had possession of it and be required to reimburse the owner for the fair market value of the item or scrap metal in the event that dod found demilitarization costs to be prohibitive according to the provisions of section 1062 dod would have been required to develop both policy and process for implementation of the new policy and notification process would have been made public38 the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa had strongly opposed the passage of the proposed section 1062 in letter to the chair of the house armed services committee aopa president phil boyer acknowledged that section 1062 was proposed largely due to the discovery that some surplus military equipment was improperly coded resulting in sensitive military technology having found its way into the public sector he believed that section 1062 served valid military purpose but argued that the definition of what is considered significant military equipment was broad ambiguous and might lead to an unnecessary destruction of military aircraft39 mr boyer offered to work with the conference committee members to draft an alternative piece of legislation that would narrow the scope of section 106240 mr boyer stressed that certain aircraft possibly aircraft not demilitarized had been carefully maintained over the years and were now serving useful purposes in joint letter to the house armed services committee aopa and the experimental aircraft association eaa stressed that the nation faced serious pilot shortage and that having historical aircraft visible at public air shows would encourage youth to consider careers in military or commercial aviation in letter to the senate armed services committee members eaa also described the terms significant military equipment and demilitarization as broad and ambiguous stating that legitimately acquired exmilitary aircraft from many eras commonly known as war birds pose threat to the public but instead are used to display our history as living aviation heritage41 38 section 1062 would have required those in possession of such equipment to prove that they legally owned it ultimately the issue of who lawfully owns an item would be matter for the court 39 in response the ddpm offered the following however sme is clearly defined in 22 cfr and while broad is not ambiguous merely removing the guns from military attack aircraft does not negate its military capability over civilian aircraft nor preclude replacing those guns obtained from different source 40

available to congress to reexamine the current united states demilitarization policy they include 1 permit selective exemption 2 appoint one agency as executive program agent for all federal agencies 3 convene an independent panel 4 conduct hearings and 5 take action permit selective exemption congress may introduce revised version of the previously proposed section 1062 but make certain types of military equipment and weapons exempt from the demilitarization process as an example congress may exempt any equipment that is commercially available or exempt specific types of equipment congress may also seek to set specific time frame for dod to develop regulatory policy establish one agency as executive agent for all federal agencies congress may introduce legislation to give one federal agency the statutory authority for the demilitarization of all military equipment given dods responsibility to protect public safety and provide for national security some argue that dod should be in charge of all demilitarization policies42 another option would be to make the department of homeland security the executive program agent some would argue that the department of homeland security is logical choice given its mission to coordinate domestic security law enforcement border security emergency management intelligence and the anti terrorist activities of the federal government by firmly establishing the federal governments military equipment demilitarization policy under the department of homeland security congress might help overcome turf war and avoid crossing political and institutional lines among older more established federal agencies43 the drawback is that the demilitarization policies of several federal agencies overlap with dods and congress would likely meet resistance from federal agencies unwilling to cede authority congress would need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each agency in doing so congress could create new accountability to govern future demilitarization and trade security controls policy 41 continued functioning armament systems have been removed from each aircraft prior to receiving its airworthiness certificate from the federal aviation administration faa furthermore the faa mandates an annual inspection to ensure ongoing compliance with this and other safety requirements 42 control of military excess and surplus materiel report of the defense science board task force office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology december 1998 62 p 43 peckenpaugh jason bush proposes massive overhaul of homeland security agencies government executive june 6 2002 crs15 convene independent panel congress may convene an independent panel on demilitarization activities with panel members representing various constituencies federal government agencies and the general public the panel could be directed to study the issue and to develop policy and process for future demilitarization activities in the past congress has generally accepted and implemented the recommendations of such independent groups44 however by their very nature their conclusions may not have popular support with some members of congress or the public conduct hearings in an exercise of its oversight function congress may want to reexamine the final report of the defense science board task force on the control of military excess and surplus materiel and hear testimony from panel members as well as demilitarization experts from both defense and law enforcement communities by conducting hearings congress may invite testimony from individuals or groups that may not have surfaced during the debate over the proposed section 1062 such public forums can generate new information as well as more intense look at any unintended consequences of actions congress may consider hearings might assist members who are unfamiliar or uncommitted to any particular point of view take action congress may elect to take action by taking action some might argue congress can preserve the citizens right to bear arms and the right to privacy congress may also avoid difficult battle with veterans groups that represent strong base for political support taking action might be difficult position to support if any undemilitarized equipment formerly owned by dod is used offensively against the united states 44 in response the ddpm believes that the convening of an independent panel is unnecessary as the demilitarization program has been fully studied in the past for other versions of this document see
