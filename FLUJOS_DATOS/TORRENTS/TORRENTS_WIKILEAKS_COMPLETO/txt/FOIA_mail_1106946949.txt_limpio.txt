from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to dirkverschurengfzpotsdamde subject re dirk date fri jan 28 161549 2005 cc stephenjugginsnewcastleacukvalerie massondelmotte massonlscesaclayceafreysteinjansengeouibno sandy tudhope sandytudhopeedacukdancharmanplymouthacuk dear dirk good news re your not dropping out we are happy to have you and if you can do what you can in the time available this would be good valerie and i will send general message monday am to all wp1 folk to say what is needed now but we thought it best to to get back to you straight away re specific points raised in steves message first i hope you will be responsible with dan and help from sandy tudhope for coordinating task 14 of wp1 following the concept as we saw it in the preliminary proposal of course you would focus on north african and north and south of this area work on the collection comparison integration interpretation of the high and lower resolution records that relate to hydrology i see dan as taking the strain regarding the more northern areas with obvious attention to wetlands and sandy helping with dynamic links and enso of course there are other records and there will be need to restrict new collectionlaboratory analyses to very specific justified and accepted by sc situations but the high resolution cores you told of would be relevant i suggest you think in terms of person to work on this and data compilation perhaps cheap postdoc for 3 years and money for internal wp1 meetings say 250keuro for now we need you to liaise with dan and sandy to produce what you can for the task 14see attached old version of proposal to start from we will need state of the art scientific objectives and approach details your whole task 14 section can only be 1 page a4 single spaced max after long discussion in london it was decided that this task would now not include the paleoflood work and eystein will be communicating with bennitto to regretfully to inform him that we have had to remove his contribution please do not contact him until eystein has done this we will not put specific focus on floods though of course some work can be done using existing european flood data because of rudolf brazdil and we hope he will accept to be part of wp1 but put some of his requested funds into wp6 hence you 3 can concentrate more on the concept of large scale hydologic variability monsoon changes north south linkages etc the problem with enso persists i know you sandy want to focus entirely on this but we could compromise perhaps and you do part this and part europe it was decided that we will somewhere include datamodel comparison with us droughts but this does not require effort on out part other than minor data compilation of existing records eystein we therefore need to ensure cook is one of the associated americans we will put together an appendix of preliminary records to be used in each task just to show impressive new potential integration but not priority for now you do not need to sign any forms officially at this stage just get approval presumably from your department internally if we ever get there forms will be handled at contract negotiation so get in touch with each other resend ideas do not assume your previous emails went to each other get exchanging ideas and draft what you can on monday the specific letter to all people will come round with requested timeline task deliverables re budget and precise format of science writing that we need to assemble the proposal then valerie and i will have to look at the whole thing in the context of our total 37 m budget it will all seem worth it in 2006 all the very best keith and valerie keiths home number is 441953 851013 mobile 0776 9732 685 at 1237 28012005 stephen juggins wrote hi keith copy to eystein oyvind just had long chat with dirk its ok hes not in millenium the reason he was pulling out is over committment this year anyway i managed to persuade him to change his mind the project wont start until jan 2006 at the very earliest so any input wont be needed until next year he was also unsure what to ask for i suggested he should cost in postdoc for 3 years and 2 meetings per year plus some data workshops keith can you give him some guidance on costing these so they are in line with what others are asking for i told him that you would look at the overall budges for wp1 and adjust if necessary to meet the target his only short term problem is revising any text for the proposal he leaves for kenya next thursday i realised that eystein has only sent the documents to the ssc people so keith can you forward these to dirk and let him know exactly what you need from him for the text and budgets finally dirk was worried that he wouldnt be able to get any paperwork signatures from his uni but as i understood from the meeting yesterday this was not needed is this right if there are any forms to fill in we had better get these to him asap cheers steve steve juggins school of geography politics sociology university of newcastle tel 44 0191 222 8799 newcastle upon tyne fax 44 0191 222 5421 ne1 7ru uk mobile 44 07740054905
