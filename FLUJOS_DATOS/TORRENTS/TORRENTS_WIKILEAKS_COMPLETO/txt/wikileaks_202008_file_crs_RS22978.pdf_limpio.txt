disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 pl 110329 division of this law is continuing resolution and provides funding through march 6 2009 unless superseded by further congressional action for agencies and programs normally funded by nine of the 12 regular appropriations bills the same law also includes the other three fy2009 appropriations acts one funding the department of defense division c of pl 110329 one funding the department of homeland security division d of pl 110329 and one funding military construction the department of veterans aï¬€airs and related agencies division of pl 110329 the continuing resolution funds most other agencies and programs at fy2008 presupplemental levels the continuing resolution generally prohibits agencies from beginning or resuming programs that did not receive appropriations in fy2008 thus new civilian research and development programs and funding increases for existing activities will be delayed until further appropriations bills have passed for many research and development programs fy2008 funding was provided under the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 which largely extended fy2007 funding levels fy2007 funding was provided under continuing resolution pl 1105 based on fy2006 appropriations therefore some programs are operating in fy2009 with budgets similar to those of

by both congress and the administration though programmatic priorities often differ1 the bush administration states that it has requested 147 billion in federal rd funding for fy2009 approximately 27 more than the estimated fy2008 appropriation of 143 billion2 the bulk of the proposed increase would come from continuing the american competitiveness initiative aci and treating the new availability of previously appropriated funds for purchasing biodefense countermeasures through project bios hield as research and development funding 3 the president proposed the aci in response to growing concerns about americas ability to compete technologically in the global marketplace as part of the aci the president called for doubling over 10 years the aggregate funding of the national science foundation nsf the department of energy doe office of science and the core programs of the national institute of standards and technology nist the main focus of the increases would be to support basic research in the physical sciences and engineering the fy2009 request would increase rd funding for nsf by 701 million for the doe office of science by 749 million and for nist core programs by 33 million relative to fy2008 appropriated levels 4 the presidents request shifts the funding balance between research and development despite the presidents continued support for the aci total funding for basic and applied research would decrease by 03 in 2009 compared to 2008 while some specific agency basic and applied research budgets would increase these increases are more than offset by decreases at other agencies in contrast funds for development would increase by 19 this increase in support for development more than offsets the decrease in support for research thus total rd funding would increase under the presidents proposal

the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations act 2008 divis ion of pl 110329 since the beginning of fy2009 on october 1 2008 funding for all other agencies and programs has been provided through continuing resolution division of pl 110329 the continuing resolution maintains current funding levels through march 6 2009 or until superseded by subsequent appropriations law for

for fy2009 signed into law the continuing resolution provides funding at the same level they received in fy2008 funds are provided on prorated basis for the duration of the continuing resolution the continuing resolution also generally prohibits agencies from using these funds to initiate or resume any project or activity for which appropriations funds or other authority were not available during fiscal year 20085 the current status of fy2009 funding for rd is summarized by agency in table 1 the three major crosscutting multiagency rd initiatives are all funded largely by agencies operating under the continuing resolution the fy2009 request for the national nanotechnology initiative nii is 1532 billion 2 increase from 1497 billion in fy2008 approximately 72 of this request is at agencies operating under the continuing resolution the fy2009 request for the networking and information technology rd nitrd program is 3566 billion 6 increase from 3372 billion in fy2008 approximately 65 of this request is at agencies operating under the continuing resolution the fy2009 request for the climate change science program ccsp is 2105 billion 10 increase from 1838 billion in fy2008 more than 99 of this request is at agencies operating under the continuing resolution 6 g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 if the federal government continues to operate under continuing resolution most existing nondefense rd programs would continue to re ceive funding at the fy2008 level to some extent this funding mechanism is likely to cause federal agencies to continue to support existing rd priorities rather than shifting to new ones since only existing programs retain funding in addition because of inflation even funds provided at the fy2008 level represent reduction in actual purchasing power 7 for rd programs in some agencies fy2008 funding is close to the level appropriated in fy2006 for these programs th loss of purchasing power and the difficulty of adjusting policy goals and priorities may be especially challenging most new nondefense rd programs planned for fy2009 would not be allowed to start even once regular appropriations for fy2009 become law allowing new programs to begin agencies may have difficulty meeting their projected rd milestones and goals because of the shortened time frame for obligating funds for these programs expected completion times for research programs may need to be revised and new research performers identified also agency plans for 5 pl 110329 sec 104 6 office of management and budget the

delayed or prevented under the continuing resolutions for new rd programs milestones planned to occur in the first half of fy2009 are unlikely to be met since if the continuing resolution extends through march 6 2009 the first half of the fiscal year will be almost completed another issue for new programs is whether agencies will be able to obligate whatever new appropriations they receive most agency appropriations for rd expire at the end of the fiscal year for which they are appropriated because most new programs cannot be started under continuing resolution even if appropriations for them are eventually received agencies will have less time than the full fiscal year to establish these programs and obligate the funds for them t able 1 estimated f ederal rd appr opriations for
