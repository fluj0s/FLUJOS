authorized an array of agricultural rural and nutrition programs many provisions of th 2002 farm bill were scheduled to expire in 2007 if new farm bill or yearlong extension were not enacted before the 2008 harvest permanent law woul d have taken effect unde r permanent law eligible commodities would be supported at levels much higher than they are now and many of the currently supported commodities might not be eligible including soybeans and peanuts permanent law for the commodity programs is so radically different from current policy and inconsistent with todays farming marketing and trade agreements as well as costly to the federal government that congress was unlikely to let it take effect lack of new legislation would have reduced or eliminated some conservati on domestic nutrition assistan ce trade and foreign food aid and rural development programs six temporary extensions continued the authority of most programs in the 2002 farm bill until may 23 2008 new farm bill

bill is presented in crs report rl34228 comparison of the 2008 farm bill conference agreement with the house and senate farm bills background what were the consequences of congress not having enacted new farm bill before the end of fiscal year 2007 the commonly reported expi ration date of many of the provisions of the 2002 farm bill what might have ppened if new farm bill were not enacted in early 2008 woul d programs authorized by the expiring legislation have ceased to operate or would they have continued under nonexpiring provisions of permanent law where there is permanent law would the design and funding have changed2 the 2002 omnibus farm bill pl 107171 included wide range of program authorities some of which were mandatory and others discretionary mandatory in this context means that the authority to spend necessary funds is provided by statute3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34154crs2 4 crop insurance is an important farm progra m with mandatory funding that does not depend on periodic renewal through farm bills because it is authorized by its own permanent law 5 the vetoes in 2008 were the second and third presidential veto of complete standalone continuedthis mandatory category includes th commodity support programs export programs some conservation programs and food stamps4 discretionary programs are authorized but annual funding is subject to congressionally approved appropriations discretionary programs in the farm bill include some conservation programs federal farm loan programs rural development programs agricultural research and some foreig n food aid among others in nearly all cases farm bill supersedes permanent authorizing law for period of four to six years the farm bill is important because it ma substantially change program design from what is in the permanent law as is the case with commodity support programs typically with regard to appropriated programs the farm bill sets policy paramete rs and upper l imits on program activity levels and appropriations authority without an extension most appropria ted programs also referred to as discretionary programs in the 2002 farm bill and some mandatory programs such as food stamps would have faced the prosp ect of not having statutory authority for the appropriations committees to provide funding in fy2008 and subsequent years the lack of authority to appropriate funds for authorized programs and even for some programs not authorized has not b een barrier for appropriations in past congresses temporary extensions fy2007 came to close on september 30 2007 without either new farm bill or an fy2008 appropriations act hence congress adopted several continuing resolutions pl 11092 pl 110116 pl 110137 and pl 110149 last fall that provided stopgap funding for most nonde fense discretionary spending until the consolidated appropriations act of 2008 pl 110161 was enacted on december 26 2007 for the farm bill specifically six temporary extensions were enacted the first extension was in the consolidated appr opriations act of 2008 it extended the authority for many expiring farm bill programs for nearly three months until march 15 2008 pl 110161 division sec 751 the second extension in pl 110 196 lasted for about one month until ap ril 18 2008 then pl 110200 continued the extension for one week until apr il 25 2008 and pl 110205 for another week until may 2 2008 the fifth extension in pl 110208 lasted for two weeks until may 16 2008 the sixth extension in pl 110231 continued for one week until the earlier of may 23 2008 or the date the 2008 farm bill was enacted all but one title of the 2008 farm bill except the trade title which was mistakenly missing from the enrolled versi on were enacted on may 22 when the house and senate overrode the presidential veto5 of hr 2419 and the 2008 farmhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34154crs3 5 continued farm bill president eisenhower vetoed hr 12 the first version of the agricultural act of 1956 the overrides in 2008 were the first time farm bill was enacted by overriding veto budget reconciliation package that included 1995 farm bill was vetoed in 1995 but the farm bill was not necessarily the basis of the veto see footnote 7 6 this section on commodity support programs is written by jim monke specialist in agricultural policy crs it was initially composed by jasper womach 7 the situation surrounding delayed enactment of 1995 farm bill until 1996 was complicated by several factors first so support provisions for some commodities had been extended through 1997 by budget savings action taken in the agricultural continuedbill became pl 110234 because furthe r temporary extension was passed the trade provisions in title iii of the 2002 farm bill expired to deal with the omission of title iii both chambers repassed the farm b ill conference agreement including the trade title as hr 6124 the president vetoed the measure on june 18 2008 and both chambers again overrode the veto which made hr 6124 law as pl 110246 superseding pl 110234 while the 2008 farm bill was being comp leted in congress the temporary extensions stated that unl ess otherwise excepted 2002 farm bill provisions in effect on september 30 2007 shall continue until th new expiration date the extensions funded three conservation programs at sp ecific levels farmla nd protection program at 97 millionyear ground and surface wate r conservation at 60 millionyear and wildlife habitat incentives program at 85 millionyear for the commodity title the dairy and sugar programs were include d in the extension as were price support loan programs for wool and mohair programs that specifically were not extended included the direct countercyclical and marketin g loan programs for the 2008 crop year for all other supported commodities eg feed grains ilseeds wheat rice cotton and peanuts peanut storage payments agricultural management assistance for conservation community food projects in the food stam p program the rura l broadband program valueadded market developm ent grants federal procur ement of biobased products the biodiesel fuel education program nd the renewable energy systems program commodity support programs6 the mandatory commodity support progra ms authorized in the 2002 farm bill cover the 2007 crops so all subsidy oblig ations related to 2007 crop production are covered by the law even if spending occurs in fy2008 for commodity support programs there was little reason to enact farm bill before the end of calendar year 2007 in fact past farm bills generally have been enacted late in the year after the end of the fiscal year the 1981 and 1985 fa rm bills were enacted in late december and the 1990 farm bill was enacted in late november what was expected to be 1995 farm bill was not enacted until apr il 4 1996 another case of belated action even in that case payments were ma on the 1995 crops and farmers went ahead with planting operations for their 1996 crops7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34154crs4 7 continued reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 sections 1101 1111 sec ond 1995 farm bill was included in large budget reconciliation package hr 2491 that was vetoed on december 6 1995 by president clinton 8 under the 2002 farm bill farmers receiving direct payments have the option of receiving them in the calendar year prior to the applicab crop year this provision allows farmers to possibly achieve tax savings the delay of the farm bill til 2008 precluded the possibility for farmers to receive part of their 2008 direct payment in calendar year 2007 9 milk is commodity that required attention before the end of 2007 because the dairy price support program was scheduled to expire on december 31 2007 the temporary extensions avoided the reversion to permanent law wher eby the government would have been obligated to purchase surplus cheese nonfat dry milk nd butter at prices substantially higher than current support prices 10 parity is price relationship that gives unit of the commodity the same purchasing power it had in the 19101914 time period average prices received by farmers and commodity parity prices are reported monthly by the usdas national agricultural statistics service report agricultural prices policy officials and the agriculture co mmunity expected 2007 farm bill to be enacted before the end of calendar year 2007 however lack of new commodity support legislation before rvest in 2008 did little harm other than leaving producers of covered commodities uncer tain about the size of payments they might receive8 the uncertainty about future policy could have affected some farmers ability to acquire production loans fro m commercial lenders bu t even if congress had deemed one or twoyear extension n ecessary for the commodity support programs beyond the 2007 crop year that action lik ely could have wa ited until june 2008 when winter wheat the first of the 2008 crop year commodities was harvested9 possible reversion to permanent law if congress had not enacted the 2008 farm bill before the beginning of the 2008 harvest then the nonexpiring provisions of primarily the agriculture adjustment act of 1938 and the agriculture act of 1949 would have taken ffect provisions of these permanent laws are temporarily supe rseded by each farm bill the commodity support provisions of permanent law are so radically different from current policy and inconsistent with todays farming marketing and trade agreements as well as potentially costly to the federal government that congress was unlikely to let permanent law take effect permanent law provides mandatory suppor t for basic crops through nonrecourse loans but without the option of settling th loan obligations at posted county prices or receiving loan deficiency payments the only settlement options in permanent law are forfeiture of the commodities used as loan collateral or full repayment of the loans permanent law does not authoriz countercyclical payments or decoupled direct payments also nonrecourse loan rate s could be as high as 90 of parity but not less than 50 of parity for corn wheat and rice and 65 of parity for cotton10 acreage allotments and marketing quotas could be implemented for wheat and cotton milk support would be between 75 and 90 of pa rity support for soybeans other oilseeds and peanuts would not be mandatory other commoditieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34154crs5 11 in fact usda issued press releases on april 5 2007 fsa ne ws release 143907 and september 25 2007 fsa news releas 152607 stating there would be national acreage allotments or marketing quotas for respectively crop year 2008 wheat and cotton under the 1938 actnow receiving mandatory support but not id entified in permanent law are sugar beets sugar cane wool mohair small chickpeas dry peas and lentils for wheat and cotton permanent w requires usda to announce acreage allotments and marketing quot as during the prior crop year and to hold producer referenda on whether to implement mark eting quotas twothirds or more affirmative producer vote for marketing quot as results in the highest levels of support but also mandatory restrictions on planted acreage and therefore on the quantity eligible for support for this an alysis it is assumed the secretary announces marketing quotas and thus producer referenda therefore the only requirement is to announce wheat acreag allotments prior to the 2008 harvest11 table 1 summarizes the support estimate s based on these assumptions as shown in table 1 not all commodities currently receiving federal support would be covered by mandatory provisions in permanent law the commodities losing mandatory support include peanuts wool mohair sugar beats and sugar cane soybeans and other oilseeds dry peas lentils and small chick peas any and all of these commodities could receive s upport under discretionary authority given the secretary of agriculture in the agriculture act of 1949 and the ccc charter act for budgetary and other reasons that discre tionary authority has been seldom used and was unlikely to be applied in 2008 impor tant to this supposition is the fact that with few exceptions market prices for agricultural commodities are high and there would be little economic jus tification for federal s upport to be implemented milk is supported currently and in pe rmanent law through the offer of usda to purchase manufactured da iry products nonfat dry milk cheddar cheese and butter at prices equivalent to the ma ndated support price for manufacturing grade milk under permanent law those purchase prices based on january 2008 data would be about three times as high curre ntly mandated and nearly 50 higher than market prices such high usda purchas prices could result in the government outbidding commercial markets for sizeable share of processor output under the 2002 farm bill permanent law would have taken effect on january 1 2008 however temporary extensions tinued the dairy price support program under permanent law nonrecourse loan rates for wheat corn and other feed grains and cotton function as usda purch ase prices unless commercial markets pay more than the nonrecourse loan prices farmers simply put their crops under loan and forfeit the commodities to usda when the ninemonth loans come due thus loan prices effectively are government pur chase prices when market prices are lower than the nonrecourse loan rates co mmercial buyers have to raise their prices to outbid the usda to acquire wheat feed grains and cotton these crop subsidy programs were not extended beyond the 2007 crop year by the temporary extensionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34154crs6 table 1 average prices received and parity prices for farm products and

this table it is assumed permanent law is implemented without time to hold producer referenda on national quotas and so mandatory support would be implemented without marketing quotas conservation programs12 many of the usda conservation prog rams administered by the natural resources conservation service nrcs deal with evaluating the causes and severity of resource problems developing physical and management syst ems to address the problems and providing tec hnical and financial assistance to farmers implementing preventive and remedial practices the cost of these programs largely relates to agency personnel who provide specialized technical training costsharing with farmers and administrative overhead c onservation program spending recently has averaged about 5 billion annually while most of the larger conservation programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill and would have expired the end of fy2007 several mos tly older programs with total spending about 1 billion are permanently authoriz ed and appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34154crs8 committees are to provide such sums as n ecessary to meet program needs thus there is constraint on appropriators in fu ture years as with most appropriated discretionary programs funding depe nds heavily on budget requests from the administering executive agency so the future of these programs short of change in the permanent authorizing law largely is in the hands of the appropriators these programs are listed at the top of table 2 the food security act of 1985 pl 99 198 and subsequent amendments have become the legal foundation fo r another set of programs that now account for almost 4 billion 80 of usda conservation spending most of these programs are administered by nrcs while the largest the conservation reserve program crp is administered by usdas farm service agency fsa with support from nrcs the original authorizing legislation ex pired in 1990 but has been extended and amended by periodic farm bills many of these programs were extended by the 2002 farm bill and most of the programs expired september 30 2007 however the temporary farm bill extensions continued these programs the absence of new mandatory program authority likely would mean that new contracts could be signed with farmer s all existing contracts would stay in force for their specified lives and paymen ts would continue to be made on the existing contracts three mandatory cons ervation programs were funded at specific levels by the temporary extensions the farmland prot ection program 97 million the wildlife habitat
