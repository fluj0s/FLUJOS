delay of physically transporting mail to the former delivery post office for flagging and forwarding under local change of address request for the current situation usps is urging all postal patrons who have been relocated to file change of address form at their new location the form can be filed at post office by tollfree telephone 1800askusps or on the internet at httpwwwuspscom the form will enable usps to direct mail to new address from its point of origin whether the new addr ess is relatives home red cross shelter or temporary rental quarters recognizing that many of the displaced customers will move again before long usps has made it clear that multiple changes of addresses cause problem since the ncoa is an electr onic system and can easily be updated in addition usps has waived indefinitely for those affected by the hurricane the usual 30 day limit on forwarding mail to new address10 all of this is dependent however on the usps having change of address on record usps has r eached out to shelters to urge that the forms be filed postal representatives have appeared in countle ss media and the pos tmaster general has appeared on national television to make the same point by september 10 usps reported that more than 87000 households of affected residents had filed change of address forms11 by the end of october 325000 househol ds had filed mailfo rwarding requests12 paying the costs of recovery as of september 7 usps estimated that its physical losses would be well over 100 million13 but later revised the figure downw ard below 100 million because damage to the new orleans processing facility had not been so extensive as feared still it will take at least three years to fix all the damage from the hurricane according to thomas day senior vice president for government relati ons while some in congress had anticipated that usps would request appropriations to cover some or all of its unanticipated costs mr day recently said that u sps does not intend to do so th postal reorganization act codified in title 39 united states code charges usps with covering its costs through the revenues it collects from the mailing public and usps has been reluctant to seek appropriations and the cong ressional controls that sometimes accompany them for support of its delivery operations
