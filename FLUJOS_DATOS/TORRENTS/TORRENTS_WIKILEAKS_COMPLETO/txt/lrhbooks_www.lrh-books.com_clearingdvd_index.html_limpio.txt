l ron hubbard clearing congress dvds we did it clear person at willing and knowing cause over his own life his body and his surroundings and without reactive or subconscious mind l ron hubbard t was to be an event like other and in evidence of that fact crew of professional cameramen were on hand in washington dc at the shoreham hotels west ballroom on the 4th of july 1958their cameras about to immortalize in full sound and color monumental series of lectures by l ron hubbard the setting was spring of 1958 and there was one word spreading like tidal wave across the scientology world clear yet the accomplishment they were talking about was far more profound than the first individual attainment of that state factually ron had been making clears beginning in 1947 and right through 1949 prior to the release of dianetics the modern science of mental health indeed the entire purpose of book one was to make the breakthroughs and technology broadly available so that others could do the same yet while ron continued to make clears through his own personal auditing of others the same could not be said for others that is why for eight solid years he continually refined processes yes he did so to provide greater workability with processes that reached deeper with faster gains for preclears but also to find processes which other auditors could apply and so fully half of rons research had been devoted to training while the story was one of steady advance the breakthrough came in 1957 with the development of auditor training drills trs which quite literally revolutionized auditor training freedom congress in full evidence of that fact came an achievement extending far beyond those eight years indeed it was the watershed accomplishment of 2500yearold goal in december of 1957 the first clear was made by another than myself this was the gain this was the fruit of the years now we can have many clears we can have thousands of clears and if we can have that we can have civilization so this was the bottleneckother auditors couldnt really clear people and this bottleneck is splintered to diamond bits other people can clear others and so were on our way it was period of mounting anticipation as through the first six months of 1958 scientologists were reading articles entitled the attainment of clears how to test for clear and learning how to clear and therein lines an even more dramatic story for while every scientologist can look back with reverence to that first historic moment of accomplishment the more epic tale is contained in all else 1958 brought that is scientology today the final componentin addition to those training drillswith which ron trained those auditors and which is the integral tool of every auditing session today the development manufacture and use of the first hubbard electrometer emeter the magic button he discovered and provided to those auditors to put people in session who formerly werent vaguely auditable which splits valences heals psychosomatic illnesses moves ridges out of heads and exteriorizes preclears in fact one which not only opens cases on the first dynamic but which is the watchword of scientologists that makes possible planetary clearing help and all of it contained in the full anatomy of the prerequisites of auditingfrom present time problems to arc breaks to the factors of clearthetan mind body and universes to the full description of the freedom of clear then again as for the permanence of that accomplishment there was something else every scientologist recognizes today rons personal design and manufacture of the first clear bracelet while even more embracivehere was the very answer for every scientologist in responding to the question what does scientology do and its all summed up in single sentence well it clears people which also explains why that very definition of clear was emblazoned on the placard outside the shoreham hotels west ballroom and why by the time it started more than few lucky hotel guests attracted by that placard had signed up and were in attendance for congress unlike any other and so it was in july of 1958lights flooding the room cameras rolling with colorwhen ron stepped to the stage with the fact of clearing and while ron would continue to work for more than quarter century to make it easier and faster for us here is the legendary congress where
