approximately 264 million acres of public land primarily in the west the agency manages an additional 300 million acres of minerals underlying federal and private lands throughout the country and handles wildfire management and suppression on 388 million acres the management of public lands has been controversial in recent years particularly with respect to grazing mining logging recreation access across public lands and wild horses and burros for fy1999 the omnibus consolidated appropriations law pl 105277 contained total of 1191 billion for the bureau of land management this figure crs5 is 547 million higher than the amount appropriated for fy1998 but 430 million lower than the sum requested by the president for fy1999 the total blm appropriation is divided among ten activities as described below about half the total6193 millionis provided for management of lands and resources the appropriation funds blm land activities including protection use improvement development disposal cadastral survey classification acquisition of easements and other interests as well as other activities such as maintenance of facilities the assessment of the mineral potential of public lands and the general administration of the agency the figure is 372 million higher than the amount appropriated for fy1998 but 410 million lower than the amount requested by the president for fy1999 approximately another quarter of the blm appropriation2869 millionis provided for wildland fire management this appropriation supports interiors fire activities including preparedness suppression emergency rehabilitation and hazardous fuels reduction the appropriation is 68 million higher than the appropriation for fy1998 but 115 million lower than the presidents fy1999 request the next largest portion of the blm appropriation 1250 million is for payments in lieu of taxes pilt under the pilt program local governments are paid under complex formula for certain federally owned land because the federal government does not pay taxes on land it owns the pilt money may be used for any local government purpose including schools firefighting and law enforcement the appropriation is 50 million more than both the sum enacted for fy1998 and requested by the president for fy1999 for more information on pilt appropriations issues see crs report 98574 pilt payments in lieu of taxes somewhat simplified june 24 1998 for the oregon and california grant lands the law provides 970 million which is 19 million lower than both the fy1998 enacted amount and the presidents request for fy1999 the appropriation is used for activities on the revested oregon and california railroad grant lands and related areas including for land improvements and the management protection and development of resources on these lands smaller portions of the blm appropriations support other activities for land acquisition total of 146 million is provided the funding is to be derived from the land and water conservation fund lwcf the principal source of funds for acquiring recreation lands for more information on the fund see crs report 97 792 land and water conservation fund current status and issues march 6 1998 the sum is 34 million higher than that enacted for fy1998 but 04 million lower than the presidents fy1999 request the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the omnibus funding measure explains that most of the 146 million is to be distributed among 12 projects for construction the law appropriates 110 million which is more than double both the amount enacted for fy1998 51 million and requested for fy1999 42 million the law also specifies the portion of the blm appropriation allocated for the central hazardous materials fund 100 million range improvements 100 crs6 million miscellaneous trust funds 88 million and service charges deposits and forfeitures 81 million some of the general provisions in the omnibus law affect blm activities with handful pertaining to mining and mineral claims for instance the omnibus law continues the moratorium on patenting mining claims under the general mining law of 1872 with certain exceptions section 312 it postpones for one year the revision of hardrock mining regulations 43 cfr 3809 pending study by the national academy of sciences section 120 the law reauthorizes through fy2001 the annual hardrock claim maintenance fee at 100 per claim or site and provides for 60day period to correct any defects to small miner waiver applications administrative provisions to the blm section general provisions also affect other issues for instance one provision directs the blm to reauthorize grazing permits prior to completion of reviews under applicable laws such as the national environmental policy act section 124 number of provisions of the omnibus law cut across agency jurisdictions one such provision prohibits the interior secretary from purchasing land in alaska without first attempting to acquire such lands through exchange of unreserved public land section 127 because it addresses land purchases by the secretary of the interior the provision could affect the national park service nps and the fish and wildlife service fws in addition to blm although it is likely that the lands involved in the exchange would be blm lands other crosscutting provisions affecting blm such as that extending the recreation fee demonstration program section 327 are included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the recreation fee demonstration program in particular see the section on the national park service site specific provisions which do not deal with general policy issues generally are not discussed in this report still other crosscutting provisions were dropped from the omnibus measure before enactment for example the law did not include earlier bill language that would have terminated the interior columbia basin ecosystem management project icbemp joint blmforest service effort to provide coordinated longterm management direction for 72 million acres of forest service and blm land the development of the blm appropriation for fy1999 began with the administrations fy1999 request for 123 billion 977 million more than enacted for fy1998 114 billion the largest increases were for management of lands and resources 782 million and wildland fire management 182 million the house appropriations committee recommended 116 billion for the blm for fy1999 781 million less than requested and 196 million more than enacted for fy1998 the house committee recommended 5964 million for the management of lands and resources 639 million less than requested but 143 million more than enacted for fy1998 for wildland fire management the committee recommended 2869 million 115 million less than requested but 68 million more than enacted for fy1998 for the payments in lieu of taxes program pilt the committee recommended 120 million the same amount was requested for fy1999 and was appropriated for fy1998 crs7 the senate appropriations committee reported an appropriation of 120 billion for the blm in fy1999 approximately 33 million less than requested and 647 million more than enacted for fy1998 the senate committee recommended 6331 million for the management of lands and resources approximately 367 million more than the house bill the committee recommended approximately 289 million for wildland fire management 94 million less than requested but 89 million more than enacted for fy1998 the house and senate committeereported versions also addressed blm policy issues in title iii the general provisions title for instance sections in both bills continued the moratorium on patenting new mining claims under the general mining law of 1872 with certain exceptions in the house bill and limited the use of funds for continuation of the icbemp in the pacific northwest the housepassed bill contained 118 billion for blm functions 396 million more than enacted for fy1998 but 581 million less than requested as passed the measure retained the amounts recommended by the house appropriations committee except that floor amendment increased the funding for pilt by 20 million to total of 140 million during house floor consideration the house also considered but rejected several key amendments these amendments proposed to 1 strike language terminating the icbemp 2 strike language extending the recreational fee demonstration program for another 2 years and 3 increase funding for the land and water conservation fund as noted earlier in this report the senate did not pass freestanding bill appropriating funds for blm and other interior agencies for further information on the bureau of land management see its world wide web site at httpwwwblmgov for current information about the blm on the world wide web see blms media alert at httpwwwblmgovnhpnewsalertshtml fish and wildlife service the administration recommended 8182 million1 for fwsan increase of 457 million 59 over fy1998 congress appropriated 8022 million an increase of 38 the increase falls almost entirely within resource management which includes the endangered species program fisheries and refuge management among other things which would go from 5946 million to 6611 million the endangered species program increased overall from 962 million to 1248 million an amount close to the presidents request as the following table shows the detailed distribution is quite different of the congressional increase 20 million is for salmon and steelhead recovery in washington state and smaller increases were provided for programs to conserve candidate species thereby obviating the need to list some of them and for consultation with other federal agencies whose actions might affect listed species 1 the administrations budget estimate also includes 81 million in reallocated funds for the natural resource damage assessment fund this reallocated funding will not be considered here crs8 funding for endangered species programs fy1998fy1999 millions of dollars program fy1998 presidents omnibus bill request candidate conservation 57

initiative in recovery the administration proposed continuing language that would cap the money spent on listing congress accepted this language and cap the language limits the discretion of the agency to transfer funds for additional listings eg if lawsuits mandate agency action on listing certain species it exempts steps to delist or downlist species from the cap without cap funding would either have to be transferred away from ongoing listing activities to meet the additional requirements of lawsuit or from other programs within the agencys resources management function with the cap court order to carry forward listing decision on particular species makes listing into zero sum game at least at fiscal level the listing of some species or designation of their critical habitats would preclude the listing of others fws supported this change to protect the budgets of other programs in related subject the administration proposed transferring delisting and downlisting activities from the listing function to the recovery function the step did not require congressional action but combined with the above limitation only new listings or new designations of critical habitat will be affected by the limitation on the funds the administration proposed 100 million 72 for the national wildlife refuge fund which provides payments to local governments in recognition of reduction of the local tax base due to the presence of federal land congress appropriated 10779 million the fy1998 level the payment levels have been controversial since the small additions of land to the national wildlife refuge system over the last several years mean that reduced dollars must be spread still further the situation has produced calls for congress to increase the appropriation especially since local governments often incorrectly view the payments as entitlements even though they are actually subject to annual appropriations land acquisition was proposed to decrease to 605 million 34 relative to fy1998 congress cut the amount still further to 480 million decrease of 234 for further information on the fish and wildlife service see its world wide web site at httpwwwfwsgov crs9 national park service the national park service nps currently manages the 376 units that comprise the national park system including 56 full or actual national parks the premier units of the system in addition to the national parks the diverse park system includes national preserves recreation areas reserves monuments battlefields seashores and number of other categories the system has grown to more than 80 million acres in 49 states and the district of columbia in recent years over 270 million visitors have visited the parks annually the nps has the often contradictory mission of facilitating access and serving park system visitors while protecting and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to it for nearly two decades the park service has operated with tight budgets during this period congress restricted appropriations to operate and maintain the park system while continuing to add new units to the system combined with increased visitation the essentially static funding had stretched personnel impaired operations and generated multibillion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance however spending for the nps now appears to have higher priority temporary closure of nps units part of federal governmentwide shutdown during the budget debates of late 1995 and early 1996 helped galvanize public support for increasing nps operations and maintenance funding in fy1997 fy1998 and fy1999 the administrations operations budget request for the nps for fy1999 totals 1321 billion the house recommended 1333 billion and the senate recommended 1288 billion the conference agreement provides 1286 billion for operation of the national park system deferred maintenance the park system has formidable maintenance burden with thousands of permanent structures roads bridges tunnels employee housing units water and waste systems etc the nps has valued these assets at over 35 billion but they would deteriorate without adequate care and maintenance in fy1999 the administration proposed attacking the deferred maintenance backlog with 62 million increase in nps maintenance from fy1998 with total request for 446 million the house committee recommended slightly larger increase 64 million and the senate committee recommended smaller increase but still 18 million 5 above the fy1998 level the conference agreement provides 412 million for maintenance mounting concerns about the buildup of unmet maintenance needs has prompted congress to seek new funding sources congress and the administration have generally agreed to address problems and adequately fund the operation of the park system and to aggressively attack the maintenance backlog in the fy1999 budget request the administration had proposal that would add more than 25 million annually for nps management purposes from park concessioners franchise fees number of large concession contracts are due for renewal and the trend has been for substantial increases the proposal is to keep the concession fees for the park system rather than having them returned to the general fund of the treasury as is current practice recreation fee demonstration program the administrations proposal for maintenance parallels the recreation fee demonstration program being tested by the nps and three other federal land management agencies the recreation fee program crs10 began in fy1996 to allow higher entrance and recreation user fees with the added fees being retained by the unit where the money is collected it was hoped that the additional fees would be incentives to agency managers to be more aggressive in pursuing selffinancing for operating and maintaining their units the nps is expecting to collect 1365 million under this program in fy1999 the omnibus appropriations bill extended the fee demonstration program for 2 additional years urban park and recreation fund the house had approved an amendment to the bill to fund the urban park and recreation recovery uprr program at 2 million the administrations request although the program was last funded in fy1994 previous appropriations were about 5 million annually with communities competing for many more grants than there was money available for the highly popular matching grant program had helped local governments rehabilitate playgrounds recreation centers ball courts and playing fields in urban areas the conference agreement did not provide the proposed 2 million stating that the committee determined that this effort could not be accommodated with the limited resources available this year related legislation congress approved bill s1693 the national parks omnibus management act of 1998 under expedited procedures at the end of 105th the bill provides for long anticipated park criteria and management reforms and an overhaul of the park services concessions policy to allow revenue generated from concession contracts to be returned to appropriate national park units without annual appropriations other provisions calling for new fee authorities and higher fees from film makers were dropped from the final version of this bill in another collateral initiative national park roads considered an important maintenance priority will receive substantial boost 31 million in fy1998 and 81 million annually for the next 5 fiscal years nearly double previous funding under the new surface transportation law

treasury and administered by the national park service provides grantsinaid to states and outlying areas for activities specified in the national historic preservation act these preservation grants are normally funded on 60 federal40 state matching share basis the administrations fy1999 budget estimate would have provided 10061 million for the historic preservation fund 5061 million for the historic preservation fund grantsinaid program compared to 40812 million total for the fund in fy1998 and 50 million for new initiative by the administration save americas treasures part of the proposed environmental resources fund for america this initiative would make preservation of americas treasuresa priority including documents artwork manuscripts photographs sound recordings and historic structures twentyfive million dollars of americas treasures funding would provide grants to states and indian tribes who would receive funds based upon submission of proposals for preservation and subject to matching provisions except to indian tribes who are not required to match funds the remaining 25 million would be for priority preservation projects in federal agencies the administrations budget for the historic preservation fund included crs11 154 million in grants targeted to specified historically black colleges and universities hbcus for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures on their campuses funding in fy1998 4 million provided preservation funds for the most needy historically black colleges including knoxville college tn selma university allen university sc tougaloo college ms and fisk university tn chartered by congress in 1949 the national trust for historic preservation is responsible for encouraging the protection and preservation of historic american sites significant to the cultural heritage of the us although private nonprofit corporation the national trust receives federal funding through the authority of the national historic preservation act historic preservation fund federal assistance has enabled the national trust to support historic preservation work in local communities the administrations fy1999 budget estimate does not specify funding for the national trust in keeping with congress plan to replace federal funds with private funding and to help the trust become selfsupporting by fy1999 the national trust received 35 million in fy1998 in keeping with the efforts to privatize funding within period of transition there is specific appropriation mentioned in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act for the national trust on june 25 1998 the house appropriations committee reported the fy1999 interior appropriations bill that would provide total of 40812 million for the historic preservation fund with 0 for the national trust for historic preservation and 0 for the millennium initiative save americas treasures statement was included in house report language that priority

scientific information concerning natural hazards biological and environmental issues as well as water land and mineral resources after debate in 1995 about its future the us geological survey had its responsibilities increased with consolidation into it of activities formerly conducted by other agencies within doi national biological service and bureau of mines this consolidation maintains programs for biological research and minerals surveys and information activities currently the usgs crs12 conducts surveys investigations and research through four major program activities these include the national mapping program geologic hazards resources and processes water resources investigations and biological research the administration has requested 80688 million for fy1999 this is an increase of 4772 million over the 1998 enacted level comprised of 3023 million in program increases and 1750 million in uncontrollable and related changes program increases include 1426 million for water resources investigations 1358 million for the national mapping program and 973 for biological research these increases will be partially offset by decreases in the geologic hazards resources and processes program by 623 million and by 112 million in general administration change in ftes which number 6487 is requested the fy1999 budget request for the usgs water resources investigations program activity includes two proposed program increases totaling 175 million and four proposed program decreases totaling 324 million the major increases proposed for the fy1999 budget for the usgs water resources programs are related to water quality information program increases are proposed of 105 million for the administrations clean water and watershed restoration initiative with funds being added to four programs and of 70 million for the water quality information initiative with funds being added to three programs proposed program decreases include three reductions to the hydrologic networks and analysis program totaling 271 million and one reduction of 526000 to the toxic substances hydrology program the fy1999 budget request for the national mapping program includes 185 million in three proposed program increases and 492 million in two proposed program decreases the proposed increases are in the earth science information management and delivery subactivity 15 million for the disaster information network and 25 million for satellite data archive and the geographic research and applications subactivity 1 million for the clean water and watershed restoration initiative the proposed decreases are in the mapping data collection and integration subactivity 3 million reduction to eliminate funds appropriated in fy1998 for highperformance computing and communications 192 million reduction to be achieved by planned savings from increased efficiencies additional program highlights for the usgs national mapping program include changes in how it carries out its efforts and an increased emphasis on the civilian applications of classified data the fy1999 budget request for biological research includes three proposed increases totaling 12 million and two proposed decreases totaling 227 million the three program increases are proposed within the biological research and monitoring subactivity for the species and habitat initiative 9 million the clean water and watershed restoration initiative 2 million and to replace two infectious waste incinerators that are not in compliance with state air quality regulations 1 million the two proposed

in revenues in fy1999 revenues from onshore leases are distributed to states in which they were collected the general fund of the us treasury and various designated programs revenues from the offshore leases are allocated among the coastal states land and water conservation fund the historic preservation fund and the us treasury crs14 the administrations fy1999 request of 1285 million would provide 1224 million for royalty and offshore management program and 61 million for oil spill research 15 million less than the fy1998 appropriation but use of offsetting receipts would grow from 65 million in fy1998 to 94 million in fy1999 the offsets would come from outer continental shelf ocs revenues increased revenues from the recent record breaking lease sales in the gulf of mexico are expected to continue for the next several years exploration activity in the ultradeep waters below 800 meters has increased significantly the house approved 1225 million to include 1164 million for the royalty

how well mms carries out its functions and whether some of its responsibilities should be vested with the states critics of the agency pointing to reported discrepancies between posted prices and fair market value prices that are the basis for royalty valuation argue that the us treasury is being underpaid mms has proposed rule change for crude oil valuation that would rely less on posted prices and more on an index price to better reflect fair market value oil industry officials have criticized using index prices as benchmark and have offered number of other options for benchmarks the mms extended its comment period on the valuation rule twice in july 79 724 and 724 731 to allow for additional industry and congressional input industry representatives believe that the extension was necessary to make further improvements to the proposal while critics of the extension argue that enough has been said on the proposed rulemaking and that extension is necessary details on the oil valuation rule were provided to house and senate committees on august 31 1998 language in the senate appropriations report s rept 105227 for fy1999 postpones the rules release until october 1 1999 further they would like the mms to use the royalty in kind rik approach that would allow mms to receive royalties in the form of oil produced then resell the oil for cash however as part of the fy1999 omnibus appropriation act pl 105277 congress and the administration reached compromise which postpones the new oil valuation rule 8 months june 1 1999 instead of one year house and senate negotiators believe that the delay will allow for rule that is fair to industry and the us government however critics argue that the delay will continue to cost taxpayers millions of dollars in underpaid royalties an rik feasibility study concluded that rik could be workable and generate positive revenue for the us treasury the mms is preparing to conduct second pilot study on rik process that includes natural gas production in the gulf of crs15 mexico oil production in wyoming and texas offshore 8g natural gas this pilot will take several years to complete separate legislation enacted in the 104th congress pl 104185 authorized interested states that demonstrate competence to collect royalties from federal oil and gas leases the mms functions that could be delegated to the states include reporting of production and royalties error correction and automated verification ocs moratoria during fy1996 as the 104th congress revisited many regulatory programs the ocs outer continental shelf moratorium on leasing activity was debated in some depth but was extended in several areas the extension was continued through fy1998 in previous appropriations since the early 1980s the moratoria had been approved annually without extensive discussion each year congress banned the expenditure of appropriated funds for any leasing activity in environmentally sensitive areas of the ocs in 1990 president bush issued directive which parallels the moratoria essentially banning ocs leasing activity in places other than the texas louisiana and alabama offshore the executive branch ban remains in effect the moratoria apply only to environmentally sensitive areas with the exception of the california ocs little hydrocarbon production has occurred in these regions lease sales in the gulf of mexico leasing continues in the central and western gulf of mexico where recent lease sales have been quite robust during 1996 the spring central gulf sale resulted in 606 tracts leased for total bonuses of 352 million the fall western gulf sale resulted in 902 tracts leased for 512 million and the central gulf auction held march 5 1997 set an all time record attracting 1790 bids for 1032 tracts high bids totaled 824 million this was the last sale under the 19921997 leasing plan fy1996 and fy1997 included four record breaking sales which produced over 24 billion in bonuses the ocs leasing plan for the 19972002 period included western gulf auction that took place in august 1997 this record breaking august sale 680 million was 33 larger than the western gulf sale held year earlier two additional sales in the gulf of mexico were also record breakers the new plan embodies the congressional moratoria but envisions continued annual lease sales in gulf coast planning areas where lease sales have attracted great interest during 1996 and 1997 as the nations oil imports rose to half of total consumption in addition to the central and western gulf sales are planned in the beaufort sea chukchi sea hope basin cook inletshelik of straight and the gulf of alaska the timing of these lease sales is several years off and the level of interest and the amount of revenues that might accrue to the government are uncertain since these are relatively untested tracts the development of deep water wells is expanding rapidly as several new deep water discoveries have been made over the past couple of years mms is proposing to increase its effort in technological needs and potential environmental issues associated with deep water drilling currently the gulf of mexico accounts for over half of the worlds drilling rigs operating in deepwater crs16 office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 smcra pl 9587 established the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm to ensure that land mined for coal would be returned to condition capable of supporting its premining land use smcra also established an abandoned mine lands aml fund with fees levied on coal production to reclaim abandoned sites that pose serious health or safety hazards congress intention was that individual states and indian tribes would develop their own regulatory programs to enforce uniform minimum standards estab lished by law and regulations as reliance upon the state agencies has increased the regulatory part of osms budget has decreased and the agency has been downsized osm is required to maintain oversight of state regulatory programs the administration request for fy1999 at 2766 million is again essentially level with prior year funding of this total 935 million is for regulation and technology programs decrease of 17 million from adjusted fy1998 levels the administrations aml request for fy1999 is 1834 million an increase of 26 million over adjusted fy1998 levels requested increase of 20 million for acid main drainage remediation and prevention partly accounts for the increase senate appropriations reduced the request for the abandoned mine land slightly 360000 while the house added 2 million to raise the authority for the appalachian clean streams initiative to 7 million and the total request for the aml to 1854 million which was the level approved in the omnibus spending package both house and senate appropriations committees modestly reduced the request for regulation and technology the house approved 2788 million the senate appropriations committee recommended 276 million for the osm for fy1999 the final total approved by the 105th congress was 2788 million including 934 million for regulation and technology appropriations for aml activities are based on states current and historic coal production minimum program states are states with lower coal production that nevertheless have sites needing reclamation the minimum funding level for each of these states was increased to 2 million in 1992 however over the objection of these states congress appropriated 15 million to minimum program states in fy1996fy1998 the administration budget proposed to keep minimum program state funding at this level in fy1999 and the report from senate appropriations explicitly recommended keeping the current level as well for further information on the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement see its world wide web site at httpwwwosmregovosmhtm bureau of indian affairs the bureau of indian affairs bia provides wide variety of services to federally recognized american indian and alaska native tribes and their members and has historically been the lead agency in federal dealings with tribes programs provided or funded through the bia include government operations courts law enforcement fire protection social programs education roads natural resource and real estate management economic development employment assistance housing repair dams indian rights protection implementation of land and water settlements and partial gaming oversight among others crs17 the key issues for the bia are reorganization and downsizing the movement toward greater tribal influence on bia programs and expenditures and the equitable distribution of bia funding among tribes additional significant issues raised by proposed provisions of previous interior appropriations bills include taxation of certain indian businesses and tribal sovereign immunity from suit the bia is under intense pressure to reorganize from tribes the administration and congress but proposals from the three sources have not always been in agreement under the administrations national performance review reinventing government initiative the bia had planned to pursue restructuring and downsizing through the tribal shares process in which tribes and the bia determine first which bia functions are inherently federal and which are available for tribal management and second what each tribes share of funds is for the latter functions but the bia states the interior solicitor has advised against that procedure appropriations committee reports for fy1997 and fy1998 directed the bia to develop reorganization plan and consolidate central area and agency offices and the bia states it is developing reorganization plans and consolidation options greater tribal control over federal indian programs has been the goal of indian policy since the 1970s in the bia this policy has taken three forms tribal contracting to run individual bia programs under the indian selfdetermination act pl 93638 as amended tribal compacting with the bia to manage all or most of tribes bia programs under the selfgovernance program pl 103413 and shifting programs into portion of the bia budget called tribal priority allocations tpa in which tribes have more influence in bia budget planning and within which each tribe has authority to reprogram all its tpa funds in fy1998 tpa accounts for 495 of the bias operation of indian programs including most of the bia funding for tribal governments operations human services courts and law enforcement natural resources and community development and for 445 of total bia direct appropriations the issue of the equitable distribution of bia fundingoften referred to as meanstestinghas two aspects one relating to how funds are distributed the other relating to whether tribes other financial resources are taken into account first much if not most bia funding even while serving tribal needs is not required to be distributed on national per capita or other formula basis second tribes own nonbia resources especially business revenues are not always required to be taken into account both the senate appropriations committee and the house interior appropriations committee take note of the issues for both the fy1998 and fy1999 interior appropriations bills the senate appropriations committee has proposed 1 requiring the bia to develop several alternate formulas for distributing tpa funds on the basis of need taking into account tribal business revenues including gaming and 2 requiring tribes to submit tribal business revenue information to bia and in the fy1999 bill proposed implementing the new distribution formula in fy2000 in addition the senate committees fy1999 bill proposed reallocating half of tpa funds from tribes outside alaska in the top 10 of percapita tribal business revenues to tribes in the bottom 20 of percapita tribal business revenues the house committee provided 250000 in fy1999 to continue the fy1998 tpaallocation work group see below to develop needsmeasurement methods directed the bia to develop tpa allocation criteria that address equity in tpa funding and included crs18 an administrative provision assuring tribes who return funds to the bia that the federal trust responsibility to them and the federal governmenttogovernment relationship with the tribes will not be diminished supporters of the senate committees proposals claim that bia funding is inequitably distributed that poorer tribes do not receive adequate funding that tribal tpa funds received per capita do not correspond with indicators of tribal need that only 30 percent of tpa funding is based on formulas and that gao study shows some rich tribes got more tpa funds in fy1998 than tribes with outside revenues opponents respond that almost all tribes are in poverty that bia funding is insufficient to meet tribal needs and that meanstesting tpa funding would penalize tribes who still have severe needs would violate the federal trust responsibility to tribes has not been fully analyzed and would be unfair since it is not required of state or local governments receiving federal assistance in considering similar proposals in the fy1998 appropriations bill congress had dropped the requirements for formula and tribal income data and instead had distributed some fy1998 tpa funds so that each tribe might receive the minimum funding recommended by the 1994 report of the joint tribalbiadoi task force on bia reorganization 160000 per tribe except 200000 per tribe in alaska with allocation of any remaining tpa funds based on recommendation of tribalfederal task force in addition several senators had requested the gao to report on tpa distribution issues the tribalfederal tpa task force made its distribution recommendations january 29 1998 and also recommended creating longterm work group on tpa funding allocation recommendation the bia supported the gao presented its tpa distribution study in april and july 1998 among the gao findings were that twothirds of fy1998 tpa funds were distributed based on historical levels and onethird was distributed based on formulas that tpa distribution per capita varied widely across bia areas and that tribal governments reporting of revenues were inconsistent in including or excluding nonfederal revenues the gao results were used by the senate appropriations committee in developing the fy1999 proposals described above congress in the interior appropriations portion of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act dropped the senate appropriations committees proposed reallocation scheme and dropped the requirement that tribes submit revenue data but retained the requirement that the bia develop proposals for alternative tpa funding methods congress also retained the house provision of 250000 for the tpa work group and the language concerning tribes returning funds to the bia during congressional debates over fy1997 and fy1998 interior appropriations congress considered but did not approve several additional controversial provisions one proposal considered in the house would have prohibited the interior secretary from using his general authority to take land into trust for tribe unless the tribe had agreed with state and local governments on the collection of state and local retail sales taxes from nonmembers of the tribe this proposal has also been put forward in the 105th congress in hr 1168 on which hearings were held june 24 1998 the other provision proposed by the senate appropriations committee would have waived tribal governments sovereign immunity to civil suit in federal court if tribe accepted tpa funding the tribal immunity waiver provision was withdrawn on the crs19 senate floor the senate indian affairs committee held several hearings this year on bill s 1691 introduced february 27 1998 restricting tribal sovereign immunity one of the issues raised at the hearings was the degree to which tribes are insured against torts and other liability claims at the committees markup of s 1691 consideration was postponed on the motion of the bills sponsor who later introduced five new more specific bills neither of these proposals was offered during consideration of fy1999 interior appropriations in the interior portion of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act however congress required the interior secretary to study tribal liability insurance coverage and make report with legislative recommendations in considering the fy1999 bill both the senate appropriations committees and the house took note of several further issues congress addressed most of these issues in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act both the house and the senate committee supported placing biafunded law enforcement under centralized line authority and both made bia lawenforcement funds unavailable for reprogramming congress approved these proposals concerning support costs for selfdetermination contracts and selfgovernance compacts both forbade use of fy1999 funds to pay for unpaid contract support costs from earlier years in spite of court decisions confirming federal responsibility for such costs congress again approved the house recommended oneyear moratorium on selfdetermination contracts and self governance compacts so that bia and tribes can address the contract support costs problem the senate committee directed the gao to conduct study of the issue congress approved both ideas both the house and the senate committee also noted environmental penalties against bia for violations regarding underground storage tanks and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the house provided funds for environmental cleanup congress approved 3 million for this purpose only the senate committee included bill language restricting the huron cemetery in kansas to use as cemetery an oklahoma tribe has at times proposed using it for gaming congress retained this provision the senate committee also prohibited taking lands into trust in scott county in minnesota near minneapolisst paul but congress dropped the provision because the bia asserted it would make decision on such lands in fy1999 the senate committee also directed the interior secretary to develop fiveyear plan for the repair or reconstruction of all bia school facilities and to review indian postsecondary institutions current facility needs congress did not address this issue the senate during debate on the fy1999 interior appropriations bill approved an amendment prohibiting the interior secretary from approving class iii indian gaming compacts without state approval and from promulgating during fy1999 proposed regulations for approving gaming compacts in situations where state invokes its immunity from suit over compact negotiations congress chose only to prohibit promulgation of the regulations and that only for the first half of fy1999 finally congress amended the tribal selfgovernance act of 1994 pl 103413 to extend to selfgovernance compacts the same requirements for repaying misused funds that already cover selfdetermination contracts bias fy1998 direct appropriations enacted to date are 1703 billion for fy1999 the administration proposed 184 billion84 over fy1998including increases of 45 in tpa to 7912 million 58 in bia school operations to 4869 million 184 in aid under the tribally controlled community college assistance act to 354 million and 216 in total bia construction to 1521 crs20 million including 866 million in education construction 59 increase over fy1998 among the new proposals in the fy1999 bia budget were law enforcement initiative to meet the increasing rate of violent crime in indian country and an indian land consolidation pilot program the former would increase bia law enforcement spending by 29 in fy1999 to 103 million in conjunction with department of justice doj spending on indiancountry jail construction and law enforcement that would total 182 million the land acquisition pilot program would provide 10 million to consolidate fractionated ownership of allotted indian trust lands thereby reducing the costs and problems of managing millions of acres broken up into tiny fractional interests the house approved 1714 billion for the bia for fy1999 an increase of 06 while the senate appropriations committee proposed 1702 billion decrease of 01 compared to fy1998 the house recommendation for fy1999 included increases of 142 million 18 in tpa 96 million 2 in bia school operations 04 million 13 in aid to triballycontrolled community colleges 42 million 77 for bia school construction within decrease of 36 million in total bia construction and 10 million for the joint biajustice department law enforcement initiative the senate committee recommended decrease of 623

and 6 million 11 for bia school construction within decrease of 19 million in total bia construction and the transfer of 703 million to another part of the bia budget for the joint biajustice department law enforcement initiative congress in the interior appropriations portion of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act approved total of 1746 billion for the bia an increase of 25 from fy1998

construction to 1234 million for the proposed biadoj law enforcement initiative congress provided 20 million increase to fund the bia portion of the initiative and it transferred bia law enforcement

indian gaming commission nigc was established by the indian gaming regulatory act of 1988 pl 100497 to oversee indian tribal regulation of tribal bingo and other class ii operations as well as aspects of class iii gaming casinos racing etc the nigc may receive federal appropriations but its budget authority has consisted chiefly of fee crs21 assessments on tribes class ii operations the fy1998 interior appropriations act amended the indian gaming regulatory act to increase the amount of assessment fees the nigc may collect to 8 million to make class iii as well as class ii operations subject to fees and to increase the authorization of nigc appropriations from 1 million to 2 million the act also prohibited the commission from amending its definitions of electronic gaming devices but allowed it to gather information on the issue for fy1998 nigc appropriations were 1 million the president proposed appropriations for fy1999 recommending instead that all the nigcs activities be funded from fees the senate appropriations committee and the house interior appropriations subcommittee agreed with the presidents recommendation as did the full house likewise the interior

department claims settlement activities related to the trust funds indian trust funds were formerly managed by the bia but numerous federal tribal and congressional reports had shown severely inadequate management with probable losses to indian tribal and individual beneficiaries indian trust funds comprise two sets of funds 1 tribal funds owned by 338 tribes in approximately 1500 accounts with total asset value of about 25 billion and 2 individual indians funds known as individual indian money iim accounts in 345356 accounts with total asset value of 4637 million figures are from the ost fy1999 budget justifications the funds include monies received both from claims awards land or water rights settlements and other onetime payments and from income from physical trust assets eg land timber minerals as well as investment income in 1996 at congress direction trust fund management was transferred from the bia to the ost the special trustee in 1996 estimated the eventual cost of recommended improvements in trustfund management at 100 million while congressionallyrequired outside audit has been made of noninvestment transactionsdeposits and withdrawalsin tribal trust fund accounts for the 20 year period 19731992 congress did not require that the outside auditors examine transactions in the iim accounts so their reconciliation status has been in doubt on june 11 1996 classaction suit was filed against the federal government on behalf of all iim account owners the suit sought an accounting of the iim funds establishment of adequate management systems and full restitution of any money lost from the iim accounts the case was certified as class action in february 1997 and is scheduled to go to trial on march 15 1999 in april 1997 the ost submitted its

and management and investment of the funds and assets to assist indian crs22 economic growth while considering fy1998 interior appropriations congress noted departmental and some tribal opposition to the strategic plan especially to the proposed new agency congress directed the ost not to implement the proposed new agency but to pursue trust funds systems improvements and ost responsibilities relating to the settlement of financial claims made by tribal and individual beneficiaries before congress and in court because of bia trustfunds mismanagement in august 1997 the secretary of the

american samoa than either the president or the house committee the presidents fy1999 request for these grants was 231 million the same as the fy1998 appropriation the senate committee also provided 15 million for the enewetak support program 04 million more than the presidents request and 03 million more than the house committees recommendation this proposed 15 million in funding for enewetak support included 04 million to improve food selfsufficiency the conference report on the fy1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides 871 million in funding for insular affairs the conference agreement generally follows the house committees recommended funding levels it however provides 16 million in total funding for enewetak support more than the amount recommended by either the house committee and approved by the house or the senate committee that 16 million includes the 04 million in special funding recommended by the senate committee in its fy1999 budget justifications for oia the interior department described brown tree snake control as major priority the department believes that the brown tree snake is significant ecological threat to guam and represents an increasing threat to other areas where it may migrate including the northern mariana islands and hawaii the department requested fy1999 budget increase for brown tree snake control in order to more fully implement plan for coordinated operational and research program involving control and eradication techniques the house appropriations committee report noted that the committee provided substantial increase for the brown tree snake program although not as much as requested by the president another key issue in fy1999 territorial appropriations is the financial condition of the american samoa government in recent years the interior department and members of congress have expressed concerns about the failure of the territorial government to implement financial recovery plan developed by representatives of the department and the american samoa government both the house and senate appropriations committees reiterated concerns about american samoas fiscal problems in their fy1999 reports the senate report noted in particular the territorys failure to pay for medical care provided to its people in hawaii and called for aggressive action by the american samoa government to pay these bills crs24 third issue is the alien labor situation in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi the interior department and other federal agencies participate in joint federalcnmi program established to address labor immigration and law enforcement problems in the cnmi as requested by oia to meet the needs identified by the joint program the bills reported by the house and senate appropriations committees earmarked 50 million of the 110 million in covenant grant funding provided to the cnmi for prison facility and 05 million for crime laboratory the housepassed bill also included these earmarks the senate report directed the interior department to use some of the funds provided for the joint federalcnmi program to establish an ombudsmans office in the cnmi to assist workers the conference agreement endorsed that proposal for further information on insular affairs see its world wide web site at httpwwwdoigovoiaindexhtml title ii related agencies and programs department of agriculture us forest service the administration requested 2657 billion 150 million 6 more than was appropriated in fy1998 most of the increase is 102 million in emergency contingency appropriations for wildland fire management offset by proposed 30 million decrease in annual appropriations for fire operations the house appropriated 2523 billion 43 million less than the fy1998 appropriation and 134 million less than the request but with contingent fire funds the senate appropriations committee recommended 2623 billion 57 million more than fy1998 but 34 million less than the request however this included 102 million emergency contingent fire funds and several other major modifications the omnibus consolidated appropriations enacted 2752 billion including the 102 million contingent emergency fire funds this is 95 million more than the administration requested 126 million more than the house passed and 129 more than recommended by the senate increasing forest service fiscal accountability was the focus of much debate the house shifted maintenance of trails and recreation facilities from the recreation account to the infrastructure account and road maintenance from the infrastructure account to the reconstructionconstruction account the senate committee concurred with these changes the house committee also recommended restricting indirect support activities to 25 of obligations from the knutsonvandenberg fund but this was striken by floor amendment 236182 and replaced with language prohibiting the use of these funds for indirect support activities the senate committee took different approach recommending 0 for general administration 259 million was requested 122 million allocated among the national forest system accounts and 108 million among other forest service accounts for general administration and details in the fy2000 budget request on overhead funding for each account the omnibus consolidated appropriations rejected both of these approaches and instead required further reporting on indirect expenditures to the committees and in the fy2000 crs25 budget request and restricting indirect expenditures from six specific trust funds and special accounts to not more than 20 in fy2000 for further information on the department of agriculture us forest service see its world wide web site at httpwwwfsfedus for information on the government

timber and forest health are likely to continue to dominate debates over forest service budget and authorizing legislation the fy1999 budget request proposed declines both in salvage sales from 1251 billion board feet or bbf to 1083 bbf and in new green sales from 2562 bbf to 2356 bbf the proposed sale program of 34 bbf would be the lowest level since fy1950 the house committee recommended timber sales offered of 36 bbf and the bill passed with change in recommended funding the senate committee recommended sales sold not just offered of 3784 bbf an amendment by rep furse to transfer 805 million from the timber program to recreation and watershed improvements was offered and then withdrawn finally in section 334 the house expanded the authorized use of the 10 roads and trails fund to improve forest health conditions and repair or reconstruct roads bridges and trails emphasizing the wildlandurban interface and areas with abnormally high risk from potential wildfires the senate bill contains several additional provisions addressing timber sales section 338 would require the forest service to offer economically viable timber sales of at least 90 of the maximum allowable sale quantity asq under the 1997 tongass land management plan revision this could be enforced through civil suits by economicallydependent persons in addition section 340 contains complicated directions on timber sales and western red cedar shipments to the lower 48 states or for export from the tongass national forest continued from the fy1998 interior appropriations act section 332 would prohibit prescribed burning until every effort has been made to remove all economically viable commercial wood products from the proposed burn area the regional foresters could grant waivers on siteby site basis but this could stifle efforts to improve forest health using prescribed fire to reduce undergrowth section 335 would authorize stewardship end result contracting demonstration projects in each national forest in idaho and montana and in the umatilla national forest wa and or through fy2002 contracts of up to 10 years can be used to achieve land management goals that meet local and rural community needs with the value of the timber removed offsetting the costs of other services the omnibus appropriations bill enacted several but not all of these provisions the complicated provision on timber sales and western red cedar shipments from the tongass were enacted as section 350 but the tongass sale target and the prescribed burning provisions were deleted the stewardship end results contracting demonstration was enacted as section 347 but was modified to authorize 28 projects including 9 in montana and northern idaho finally section 332 enacted the expanded use of the 10 roads and trails fund to allow forest crs26 health improvements activities as well as road bridge and trail repair and reconstruction land management planning management of the federal lands has been controversial for decades increasing conflicts among users in the 1960s and early 1970s led congress to enact the national forest management act of 1976 nfma and the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma to establish and guide land and resource management planning for the national forests and blm lands despite lofty goals the public participatory planning processes have not led to harmonious land management bills to improve planning some emphasizing forest health have been introduced in both houses but none have been enacted both the house and senate appropriations committees recommended that the scientific findings of the interior columbia basin ecosystem management project be incorporated into the land and resource management plans and the project terminated house floor amendment to strike this section was defeated 202221 this provision was not enacted in the omnibus appropriations bill the senate committee recommended several other provisions addressing planning section 321 would prohibit new land management plans for the national forests until the planning regulations had been revised except for forests which had begun revisions before october 1997 or which were operating under court orders and except for the white mountain national forest the report language indicates that plan revisions to incorporate icbemp findings under section 337 are also excepted but the language in section 321 includes reference to the latter section section 329 would direct the agency to continue management under existing plans until the plans were revised under the new regulations despite the provision in nfma requiring revisions within 15 years finally section 322 would prohibit the forest service from spending to complete the rpa program the report language indicates that the rpa program is to become part of the agencys strategic planning under gpra two of these provisions were enacted in the omnibus appropriations the prohibition on new plans with noted exceptions prior to the revision of the planning regulations was enacted as section 321 and the prohibition on completing the rpa program was enacted as section 322 the omnibus appropriations bill also contains two titles affecting specific areas title iv enacts the hergerfeinstein quincy library group forest recovery act this title directs 5year pilot project for managing 3 national forests in california under the plan devised by local group of users environmentalists and others known as the quincy library group the provision excludes certain areas and specifies management activities funding sources and annual and final reporting requirements title v enacts the land between the lakes protection act to transfer this area from the tennessee valley authority to the forest service and manage it as national recreation area similar provisions had been recommended by the senate appropriations committee and passed contingent upon certain energy and water development appropriations by the house forest roads road construction in the national forests continues to be controversial some interests oppose new roads because roads increase access to areas they believe should be preserved in pristine condition because roads are crs27 major source of erosion stream sedimentation and other environmental degradation and because road funding is asserted to be corporate subsidy for the timber industry supporters argue that access roads are needed for forest protection eg from wildfire and for timber harvesting and other onsite uses and maintain that roads can be built without causing significant environmental problems the administration has again proposed to end the use of purchaser road credits to finance road construction this system authorized in section 42 of the 1964 national forest roads and trails act pl 88657 allows the forest service to build forest development roads through requirements on timber purchasers and to compensate those purchasers with credits that can generally be used to pay for timber2 the house approved in section 332 and the senate appropriations committee recommended in section 339 to end the use of road credits make the specified road construction contract requirement to be paid like any other cost the purchaser must incur and to continue the purchaser elect program whereby small businesses may elect to have the forest service build the road and then pay the agency more for the timber to cover the estimated road construction cost such provision was enacted as section 329 of the omnibus appropriations in separate action the administration has also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to revise current regulations governing the management of the national forest system transportation system 63 federal register 99809987 feb 27 1998 at the same time the administration issued proposed interim rule that would temporarily halt road construction into many roadless areas environmental groups objected to the limitations on areas covered by this road construction moratorium while the timber industry and many members of congress decried the moratorium as needless national direction overriding locally

fossil energy research natural gas research would decline by 476 million while coal research would increase by 64 million the senate appropriations committee differs significantly from the house on natural gas research by approving 1122 million however the approved funding level of 117 million for coal research is much closer to the house committee level the difference between the house and senate marks is largely in the senate funding of the natural gas advanced turbine system while the house panel recommended to move and consolidate that program under energy conservation the conference agreement keeps the natural gas advanced turbine system under fossil energy rd the administrations efforts are focused on new technology that would take advantage of natural gas as clean fuel and would reduce or eliminate many environmental problems associated with coal critics question the extent to which fossil fuel rd should be based on current trends and view of natural gas as transition

human services indian health service the indian health service ihs carries out the federal responsibility of assuring comprehensive preventive curative rehabilitative and environmental health services for approximately 13 million american indians and alaska natives who belong to more than 545 federally recognized tribes in 35 states care is provided through system of federal tribal and urban operated programs and facilities that serves as the major source of health care for american indians and alaska natives ihs funding is separated into two accounts indian health services and indian health facilities included in indian health services are such services as hospital and health clinic programs dental health and mental health alcohol and substance abuse programs preventive health services urban health projects and funding for indian health professions the indian health facilities account includes funds for maintenance and improvement construction of facilities sanitation facilities and environmental health support the ihs program is funded through combination of federal appropriations and through collections of reimbursements from medicare medicaid and private insurance for services to eligible patients who have such insurance coverage the omnibus consolidated appropriations bill provides for 2239 billion budget for the indian health service 1950 billion for the indian health services and 289 million for indian health facilities the administration requested 2118 billion for fy1999 budget appropriations to the ihs 1844 billion for services and 274 million for health facilities the senate committee on appropriations recommended fy1999 funding of 2152 billion to the ihs 1889 billion for services and 264 million for health facilities the house proposal recommended 2246 billion for fy1999 for the ihs 1933 billion for services and 313 million for health facilities crs31 the conference agreement does not include statutory language mandating pro rata distribution of contract support costs across all ihs selfdetermination contracts and selfgovernance compacts contract support costs are the costs awarded tribe for the administration and management of program operation costs are awarded separately this language was included in both the house and senate bills but was dropped due to objections raised by tribal organizations and individual tribes the committees have added more than 35 million to the administrations budget request to address the inequity in the distribution of contract support cost funding in fy1999 additionally the committees have instituted oneyear moratorium on new contracts and compacts the population served by the ihs bears higher incidence of illness and premature mortality than other us populations although the differences in mortality rates have diminished in recent years in such areas as infant and maternal mortality as well as mortality associated with alcoholism injuries tuberculosis gastroenteritis and other conditions american indians and alaska natives also have less access to health care than does the general us population with the number of physicians and nurses per indian beneficiary already below that of the general population dropping since the 1980s in fy1996 the ihs per capita health expenditure was 1578 compared to the us civilian per capita expenditure of 3920 the population eligible for ihs services is increasing at an approximate rate of 21 per year according to the ihs the increases in program funding over the past decade have failed to keep pace with inflation many ihs health care providing facilities are reportedly in need of repair or replacement funding for the construction of new facilities has decreased in recent years while funding for

onhir was reauthorized for fy19951997 by pl 10415 the 1974 relocation legislation pl 93531 as amended was the end result of dispute between the hopi and navajo tribes involving land originally set aside by the federal government for reservation in 1882 pursuant to the 1974 act lands were partitioned between the two tribes and members of one tribe who ended up on the other tribes land were to be relocated most relocatees are navajo large majority of the estimated 3455 navajo families formerly on the land partitioned to the hopi have already relocated under the act but the house appropriations committee in 1998 estimates that 510 families almost all navajo have yet to be relocated crs32 including about 71 navajo families still on hopi partitioned land many of whom refuse to relocate negotiations had gone forward among the two tribes the navajo families on hopi partitioned land and the federal government especially regarding hopi tribe claims against the united states the united states and the hopi tribe reached proposed settlement agreement on december 14 1995 attached to the settlement agreement was separate accommodation agreement between the hopi tribe and the navajo families which provided for 75year leases for navajo families on hopi partitioned land the navajohopi land dispute settlement act of 1996 pl 104 301 approved the settlement agreement between the united states and the hopi tribe not all issues have been resolved by these agreements however and opposition to the agreements and the leases is strong among some of the navajo families navajo families with homesites on hopi partitioned land faced march 31 1997 deadline for signing leases an initial hopi report said 60 of the 80 homesites affected had signed the leases the hopi tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against navajo families without leases like the fy1997 and fy1998 interior appropriations acts the fy1999 interior appropriations bill proposed by the president and the bills reported by the senate appropriations committee or approved by the full house as well as the version enacted into law in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act all contained proviso forbidding onhir from evicting any navajo family from hopi partitioned lands unless replacement home is provided this language appears to prevent onhir from forcibly relocating navajo families since onhir has large backlog of other families that need homes the settlement agreement approved by pl 104 301 however allows the hopi tribe under certain circumstances to begin quiet possession actions against the united states in the year 2000 if navajo families on hopi partitioned land have not entered into leases with the hopi tribe congress has for long time been concerned by the slow pace of relocation and by relocatees apparent low level of interest in moving to the new lands acquired for the navajo reservation for relocatee use appropriations committee reports in 1995 1996 and 1997 called on onhir to explore termination of the relocation program and the senate in the 104th congress considered bill phasing out onhir the house fy1998 appropriations committee report directed onhir to stop further development work on the new lands beyond that required to meet relocatee demand for fy1998 onhir received appropriations of 15 million for fy1999 the administration proposed the same amount the senate appropriations committee agreed with the administration figure while the house of representatives approved 13 million 13 reduction from fy1998 in the interior appropriations portion of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act congress approved 13 million for the onhir other related agencies one of the pervasive issues for the programs and agencies delineated below is whether federal government support for the arts and culture is an appropriate federal role and if it is what should be the shape of that support if the continued federal role is not appropriate might the federal commitment be scaled back such that greater private support or state support would crs33 be encouraged each program has its own unique relationship to this overarching issue smithsonian the smithsonian institution si is museum education and research complex of 16 museums and galleries and the national zoo nine of its museums and galleries are located on the mall between the us capitol and the washington monument and counted over 30 million visitors in fy1997 the smithsonian is estimated to be 70 percent federally funded federal commitment was established by initial legislation in 1846 in addition to receiving federal appropriations the smithsonian has private trust funds which include endowments donations and other revenues from its sales stores and magazine the fy1999 clinton administration budget would have provided 4198 million to the smithsonian and 3573 million of that amount would be for salaries and expenses of the total for the smithsonian 16 million and request for an advance appropriation of 19 million for fy 2000 would be provided to complete construction of the national museum of the american indian nmai on the mall the nmai was controversial opponents of the new museum argued that the current smithsonian museums need renovation and repair and maintenance of the collection with over 140 million items more than the public needs another museum on the mall proponents felt that there had been too long delay in providing museum in washington to house the indian collection private donations to the smithsonian and fundraising campaign totaled 37 million required to meet the non appropriated portion of project funding of this amount 15 million came from the indian community directly however the total cost of the american indian museum was estimated at 110 million congress asked that there be an attempt to scale down the plans and cost the final fy1998 interior appropriations provided 29 million for the construction of the american indian museum the fy1999 budget would have included 40 million for repair and renovation of the smithsonian four of the smithsonians buildings account for approximately 30 of the sis public space the national museum of natural history built in 1910 the american art and portrait gallery built between 1836 and 1860 the castle building built 1846 and the arts and industries building 1849 the cost to renew these four buildings is approximately 200 million the smithsonian contends that funding for repair and renewal of sis facilities has not kept pace with need resulting in accelerated deterioration of the physical plant the smithsonian has indicated that it has completed 5 year strategic plan and an associated performance plan for fy1999 under the government performance and results act of 1993 and in keeping with the smithsonians mission on another matter the final report of the latino oversight committee toward shared vision us latinos and the smithsonian institution was released in october 1997 it indicates that although there is significant change in commitment at the top si management toward including latinos in all aspects of the smithsonian some of the implementation of the plan has lagged latinos accounted for only 2 of senior smithsonian personnel and 4 as members of smithsonian boards and commissions those critical of the smithsonian urge that latino representation be addressed in this budget cycle crs34 the smithsonian marked its 150th anniversary in fy1997 and generated public programs associated with it including americas smithsonian traveling exhibit the smithsonian indicated that the traveling exhibit free to the public was too costly and to offset the cost si might institute admission charges for special exhibits in the smithsonian buildings on the mall in view of the trend toward diminished federal support the smithsonian has also begun to use bond issues for some construction projects including the renovation of the national museum of natural history and the dulles national air and space museum extension on june 18 1998 the house interior appropriations subcommittee marked up the fy1999 interior appropriations bill allowing 3975 million for the smithsonian on june 25 the house appropriations committee concurred with the earlier estimate that would provide 397449 million allowing 346449 million for salaries and expenses also on june 25 the senate appropriations committee ordered reported the interior bill providing 404554 million for the smithsonian allowing 352154 million for salaries and expenses and providing 16 million for construction of the national museum of the american indian the full house approved its appropriations committees recommendation the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act provides 347154 million for salaries and expenses of the smithsonian with 16 million for construction primarily for the national museum of the american indian and 40 million for repair and restoration of smithsonian buildings

one of the primary vehicles for federal support for arts humanities and museums is the national foundation on the arts and the humanities composed of the national endowment for the arts nea the national endowment for the humanities neh and the institute of museum services ims now newly constituted institute of museum and library services imls with an office of museum services oms the authorizing act the national foundation on the arts and the humanities act has expired but has been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law the last reauthorization for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities occurred in 1990 and expired in fy1993 authority has been carried through appropriations language since that time the 104th congress established the institute of museum and library services imls under pl 104208 among the questions congress is considering is whether funding for the arts humanities and museums is an appropriate federal role and responsibility the current climate of budget constraints raises questions about the need for such support some argue that nea and neh should be abolished altogether contending that the federal government should not be in the business of supporting arts and humanities they also argue that culture can and does flourish on its own through private support proponents of federal support for arts and humanities argue that the federal government has long tradition of such support beginning with congressional appropriation of funds for works of art to adorn the us capitol in 1817 spokesmen for the private sector say that they are unable to make up the gap that would be left by the loss of federal funds for the arts some argue that abolishing or crs35 any significant reduction to nea neh and imls will curtail or eliminate the programs that have national purposes such as touring theater and dance companies radio and television shows etc the administrations fy1999 budget would provide 136 million for nea and neh and 26 million for oms within the institute of museum and library services for the nea this would include 15 million increase in state partnership funds to allow nea to work with state arts agencies by investing in arts education activities for the neh 5 million in startup funds would support regional humanities centers as part of new special initiative rediscovering america the humanities and the millennium for the imls oms would receive 17 million for general operating support to help museums improve the quality of their services to the publicthey are already popular serving over 600 million visitors annually in the 105th congress elimination of the nea was once again on list of priorities for some house members among the house republican leadership small group was formed called the values action team to coordinate legislative action with conservative groups eg christian coalition focus on the family and the family research council in contrast the congressional member organization for the arts cmo testified in favor of full support for the arts at the fy1999 administration budget request level the presidents committee on the arts released publication creative america that recommends that federal funding be restored for nea neh and imls to levels adequate to fulfill their national roles the goal expressed was for appropriations to equal 200 per person by the year 2000 for all three agencies the controversy involving charges of obscenity concerning small number of nea individual grants remains an issue despite attempts to resolve these problems through statutory provisions to date nea projects have been judged obscene by the courts in addition federal appeals court nov 5 1996 upheld an earlier decision ruling that applying the general standards of decency clause to nea grants was unconstitutional prior to the federal appeals court decision congress eliminated funding for most grants to individual artists and in anticipation of the congresss action nea had already eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline except to maintain literature fellowships jazz masters and national heritage fellowships in the folk and
