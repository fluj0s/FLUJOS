authorize several postmarket activities to ensure that fda has more ability to monitor drug safety in addition it authorizes fda to use funds from user fees to review adverse event reports amends the

structure and reauthorization issues summary in 1992 congress passed the prescription drug user fee act pdufa to speed up the approval of pharmaceuticals in the united states the legislation created sections 735 and 736 of the fede ral food drug and co smetic act ffdca authorizing the food and drug administrati on fda to collect user fees from drug manufacturers in exchange for the faster revi ew of drug and biological products the law stipulated that the additional user fee revenues could only be used for activities necessary to the review of human drug applications it also specified that the revenues raised under the prog ram had to be in addition to baseline monies already dedicated to drug approvals as congre ss decides the agencys annual appropriation each year it sets out the total amount of us er fees that can be assessed during the upcoming fiscal year to go with the us er fee authority but separate from the law the fda drug and biotech industries settled on specifi c annual performance goals that were laid out in letters of agreement between the agency and congress to meet these goals fda hired nearly 600 new re viewers and upgraded its information system for tracking pending drug applications congress authorized the first user fee program referred to as pdufa i to run for period of 5 years the original user fee law was reauthoriz ed by congress as part of the 1997 food and drug administration modernization act fdama under the reauthorized statute known as pdufa ii ag ency and industry representatives agreed to new set of annual performance goals to encourag the timely processing of marketing applications the fda continued to hire more drug reviewers under pdufa ii so that today more than 1000 employees sala ries are supported by user fee revenues the funding for pdufa ii would have expired on september 30 2002 the fda and the pharmaceutical industry generally agree that the user fee program has to large extent been fair ly successful however the program does have its critics who argue that the quicker review process could be compromising drug safety to them the number of pres cription drugs withdrawn in recent years is evidence that speedier approvals may be jeopardizing the health of some patients the 107th congress reauthorized drug user fees in june 2002 as part of the bioterrorism bill pl 107188 known as pdufa iii the legislation extended the law for 5 more years authorized various postmarketing activities to ensure the monitoring of drug safety nd allowed the agency to use user fees to review adverse event reports for drugs approved after october 1 2002 the new law requires fda to announce on its internet site when drug manufacturers fail to co mplete phase iv postmarket studies in these situations the agency may require companies to notify health practitioners who prescribe the drug of that failure and of the questions of clinical benefit and wher appropriate the questions of safety that remain unanswered as result

bernice reyesakinbileje donna vogt and diane duffythe prescription drug user fee act structure and reauthorization issues introduction in 1992 congress passed the prescrip tion drug user fee act pdufa1 the law amended the federal f ood drug and cosmetic act ffdca authorizing the food and drug administration fda to collect from pharm aceutical companies user fees that would be used to speed up the review and approval of drugs and biologics2 at the time congress was growing incr easingly concerned about the sizeable backlog of drug applications waiting for the fdas review and the effect the delay could be having on patients who could benefit from the new therapies up until the user fee agreement the review of appli cations for new drug products was like most other government services paid for with general revenues from the us treasury with pdufa congress intended that the user fees would provide funds to help cover the cost of reviewing marketing applications for pha rmaceutical products under the terms of the 1992 act which is often referred to today as pdufa i funds from user fee collections could only be used for specified activities primarily to hire additional reviewer s to conduct faster reviews and reduce the backlog of pending new drug applications as direct ed by the legislation fda with the drug industry prepared detailed set of performance goals separate from the act that were to be met each year in reviewing new drug marketing applications its plan for meeting these goals was spelled out in letters to the chairmen of the agencys authorizing committees congress had say in preparing these goals but has used its oversight authority to follow the agencys progress toward meeting them in the programs first several years most of the money generated by user fees was spent on hiring additional reviewers and upgrading the agencys computer information system for tracking the status of drug applications encouraged by the success of the user fee program congress reauthorized the act in 1997 as major provision of the food and drug administration modernization act fdama3 with this new author ization congress mandated tighter performance goals more

is known as pdufa iii the us drug pproval process under the ffdca all drugs and biologic s must be proven sa fe and effective before they can be approved by the fda for marketing as first step in this process drug manufacturer once it has come up with drug candidate conducts preclinical ie animal tests to determine whether the new chemical compound is safe enough to undergo further testing in hum an subjects if animal tests confirm that the drug is indeed safe enough to be ad ministered to patients the drug company or sponsor will decide almost always after c onsulting with the fda whether to file an investigational new drug ind appli cation an ind must contain detailed information about how the sponsor intends to test humans in clinical trials by filing an ind the sponsor seeks fdas permission to conduct these studies in general human studies or clinical trials are traditionally carried out in three phases keeping with the testing protocol id out in the ind application in phase i trials the experimental dr ug is evaluated for safety in small group of individuals who generally are healthy in phase ii tr ials the compound is given to larger group of patients in wellcontrolled clinical setting4 to determine the dose needed to elicit the desired pharmacological effect since drugs safety is always of paramount importance investigators monitor for unw anted sideeffects th roughout all phases of testing and finally during phase iii studies the new drug is given to an even larger group of patients also in we llcontrolled clinical setting to further test whether the drug is effective in patients if the results of the clinical studies indicate that the drug is safe and effective for its intended therapeutic usess the manufacturer submits new drug application nda to fda for its review and approval the clinical development and approval ie licensing of vaccines and biological products is quite similar to ot her pharmaceuticals v accines and biologics manufacturers have to file inds before they can conduct human studies and similar to other drugs clinical trials for biologi cal products are usually carried out in three phases if the clinical studies show that th vaccine or biologic is safe and effectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31453crs3 5 for more detailed information on the drug approval process see crs report rl30989 the us drug approval process primer by

submitted to fda for the approval of change to an already approved drug application 7 21 usc section 379g and h 8 the rationale behind the inclusion of estab lishment and product fees was that application fees are not predictable since the numbers of applications vary annually and sponsors cannot know with certainty the dates on which the application would be submitted to the agency therefore the establishment and produc t fees were established to provide the fda with steady and predictable source of revenue essential to keeping the program going holcombe kay pdufa primer unpublished paper summer 1997the sponsor sub mits biologics license application bla seeking agency review all blas filed with the agency must be accompanied by user fee in this report where user fees are mentioned with regard to dr ug applications the reference can apply to the review of either ndas or blas the typical nda includes not only all of th raw statistical data about the drugs safety and efficacy but also technical in formation about its basic chemistry and pharmacology and information about how and where the finished product will be manufactured not until the nda has underg one an evaluation however and the fda is satisfied that the new drug is safe and effective for its intended medical use will marketing approval be granted5 the prescription drug user fee act its implementation under pdufa the fda is authorized to collect three categories of fees fee to cover the review for each drug or biologic application ie ndas and supplements6 an annual fee for each manufacturin g establishment and an annual fee for each product drug company produces manufacturing establishment is defined as the place where at least one prescription drug is produced product fee is also charged for every prescription drug company sells drug companies are required to pay the entire application fee wh it or supplement to an application is first submitted for fda review the tablishment and product fees are paid on an annual basis sections 735 and 736 of the ffdca7 authorize the fda to set the fees each fiscal year so that the fee revenue fro m annual product and blishment fees will equal twothirds of the total revenue received from the user fees and the remaining onethird will come from the amount fda ex pects to collect from drug application fees8 see table 1 note that the fee for supplem ent to an application is onehalf of the fee for traditional ndahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31453crs4 9 other exemptions include large volume pare nterals injectable drugs approved before september 1992 allergenic extract products whole bl ood or bl ood component for transfusion in vitro diagnostic biologic pr oducts and certain drugs derived from bovine blood see footnote 31the amount of the user fee to be charged for the review of typical nda in the upcoming year is based on fdas estimate of the number and type of applications the agency estimates will be submitted in that next year such estimates are based primarily on historical records of how many applications were submitted in previous years the agency also uses estimates of how many of the new applications will contain extensive clinical data and how much time it expects to spend on their review the total amount of revenue that can be collected from the various user fee categories combined is capped each year by congress in fdas annual appropriations act prior to requesting this total cap for the upcoming fiscal year the agency calculates the fees and total fee revenues and adjusts these for inflation using either the average urban consumer price index or the civil service base pay for federal employees in the district of columbia whichever is greater each years inflation adjustment is added on co mpounded basis to the sum of all the adjustments made for prior years in summary the total revenue from user fees collected after adjustments are made consists of one third

these report cards were also delivered to the chairmen of th congressional committ ees named above when it came time to reauthorize pdufa in 1997 congress again did not include the performance goals in the st atute instead in fdama section 101 findings congress stated that the fees were to be used to expedite the drug development and applicati on review process as laid out in performance goals identified in letters sent by the secretary of hhs to the chairman of the two authorizing committees in 1997 after the law wa s enacted it also ordered the goals to be published in the congressional record in addition fdama section 104 annual reports recognized the existence of these goals and required dhhs to send the two annual report cards mentioned above to congre ss the requirement for these

dispute resolution decision within 30 days after the agency receives the appeal and respond to request for an evaluation of clinical trial protocolwithin 45 days of the agency receiving the request 19 the performance goals also required fda to meet new management goals particularly to hold more meetings with drug manufacturers during the ind testing phases of new products velopment the performance goals also included specified time frames for meeting with nd responding to drug sponsors requests for example the agency must within 30 days prepare the minutes of all meetings with drug company personnel outlining agreements disagreements issues for further discussion and action items as be fore the law requires fda to file two annual reports with congress an annual performance report within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year and an annual financ ial report within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year it is these reports that contain the report card on how well the agency complied with the performance goals set by itself and industry performance goals under pdufa iii on march 13 2002 the bush administration released its performance goals for the pdufa iii program the goals worked out during private meetings between fda officials and representatives of the us pharmaceutical and the biotec hnology industries are not significantly different from those agreed to under pdufa ii nor did they have any congressional input these goals are in letters to the chairmen of the aut horizing committees after enactment of the reauthorized pdufa20 the 2002 target for completion times of application reviews would remain the sa with minor change by 2007 the review period for resubmitted efficacy supplements would become 2 months compared to 6 months unde r pdufa ii performance goals the pdufa iii performance goals however contain several provisions that were not included in either pdufa i or ii performance goals21 one new proposal would let biotechnology companies durin g the early development phase of biotechnology product request that fda sel ect an independent consultant paid for by the sponsor to participate in the agency s review of the protocols for the productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31453crs9 clinical studies the basis fo r this proposal is that many new biological products are on the cutting edge of science and fda may not have the expertise to review the application in timely way companies could ask for the outside consultant only if the biotechnology product submitted for approva l offered significant advance in the treatment diagnosis or prevention of dis ease or condition or met some other need requests for an outside c onsultant could come only if the sponsor had never submitted an application for that product befo re if the request was granted then 60day extension for scheduling meetings with fda officials would be given in fy2006 fda will evaluate the costs and benefits of this proposal the agreement on goals also included two pilot programs to test the concept of continuous or rolling new drug appli cation nda according to the fda the purpose of the continuous review of appli cations is to reduce the amount of time it takes to develop and review fast track products both pilots apply to products characterized in section 506a of the ffd ca as fast track products or products for the treatment of serious or lifethreatening conditions under the pilot programs the fda would review defined units or parts of the nda as the manufacturer finishes them rather than waiting until the entire application is submitted the first pilot will look at whether the evaluation of an application in smaller units along with the additional feedback and advi ce that companies will gain during the development phase will actually lead to quicker development and shorter review times for drugs and biologics that qualify for the first pilot the agency will enter into an agreement with the sponsor to accept pr esubmission of one or more reviewable units of the application in advance of the submission of the completed drug application in the second pilot the agen cy will reach an agreement with the drug sponsor to begin formal program of freque nt scientific feedb ack and interactions regarding the drugs development the fda will have to issue guidelines before september 30 2003 describing how it will imp lement the pilot tests also in fy2004 the agency will have to contract with outside consultants to evaluate whether the pilot programs have been effective the new goals also include for the first time an agreement that would allow fda to use user fee money to support post marketing surveillan ce activities under the proposal over the next 5 years the agency would double to almost 100 the number of staff assigned to monitor the si effects of drugs already on the market to aid this heightened surveillance the agency would encourage drug companies to include risk management plans in their prendabla meetings before discussions were held with agency officials about possi ble safety related i ssues that may arise later as part of those discussions wh ich would usually take place between 6 and 12 months prior to the sponsor submitting an nda companies will be allowed to submit summaries of relevant safety information and their risk management plans for agency review for drug and biologic applications or supplements that include clinical data submitted on or after october 1 2002 fda w ill be able to spend some of the pdufa fees to cover the additional cost of reviewing the risk management plans under the new goals fda can also use the fees to pay for the development of databases documenting the use of comme rcial drug for the first 3 years post approval if the agency has safety concerns in addition user fees can be used for risk management oversight for up to 2 years postapproval for most products andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31453crs10 22 the fda also draws distinction between the time it takes to review drug application and the time it takes to approve new drug the agency characterizes the time required to review an application along with related activitie s to be part of the overall review time some of which is paid for from pdufa funds the total approval time is the sum of this review time and any additional time the sponsor of the drug may take to respond to shortcomings in the application identified by the agency correcting these problems can often take several cycles and this back and forth with the agency can add substantially to drugs overall approval time 23 suydam linda us department of health human services federal drug administration hearings before the subcommittee on health house committee on energy and commerce

that the agency has had to spend more of its appropriated funds fro m general revenues on drug review activities than it did in fy1997 this means that the agency has had to shift some of its

whether the program was needed at all the us pharmaceutical industry believed that the pdufa program had been successful and as such was pleased that the legislation passed since the law went into effect in 1992 fda had taken steps to expedite the review process and eliminate the backlog of pending drug and biologic applications by meeting and consulting with agency officials during the earliest stages of development and testing pharmaceutical companies gained better understanding of th kinds of safety and efficacy data the agency was looking for when it evaluated drug applications36

on pdufa generally consumer and patient advocacy groups46 applaud the fact that the additiona l money from pdufa has hastened the availability of new medicine s however some groups expressed concern that fda has become much too dependent on the user f ees and that this could lead to conflicts of interest47 from their perspective the review of drug applications is regulatory responsibility that
