fy2001 us department of agriculture and related agencies summary on october 28 2000 the president signed into law the fy2001 appropriations act pl 106387hr 4461 for the us department of agriculture usda and related agencies the full house and senate had approved the conference agreement on hr 4461 on october 11th and 18th respectively the act contains 748 billion in regular appropriations for programs funded by the annual appropriations bill and 365 billion in fy2001 emergency supplemental spending primarily to compensate farmers for the financial effects of low farm commodity price and natural disasters of the 748 billion in regular appropriations contained in pl 106387 150 billion is for discretionary programs which is above both the house and senate passed levels of 145 billion and 1485 billion respectively but below the administration request for 155 billion regular fy2001 funding for usda mandatory programs such as food stamps and certain farm commodity support programs is 598 billion in the fy2001 act about 1 billion below the house and senatepassed levels mainly because of recent reestimation of food stamp spending much of the cboestimated 365 billion in emergency supplemental assistance provided in pl 106387 is for direct payments to farmers this includes an estimated 16 billion in disaster payments for year 2000 crop losses 490 million in emergency livestock assistance and direct payme nts to dairy farmers in compe nsation for low farm milk prices among many other provisions actual emergency spending under the act could be higher than 365 billion since the crop disaster payments and the market loss payments for dairy farmers authorized by the act are based on payment formula rather than fixed appropriation confer ence committee action on hr 4461 was delayed for several weeks because of controversy over three provisions the exemption of food and medicine exports from current us sanctions against cuba the relaxation of restrictions on the reimportation of prescription drugs from canada and mexico and the amount of emergency assistance to be provided to farmers and rural areas conferees adopted language to allow food and medical sales to cuba but prohibit any private or public financing of such exports by us bank s or federal state or local governments conferees also adopted provision to allow the importation of prescription drugs but with several restrictions the administration had expressed its displeasure with the sanctions and drug reimportation provisions saying that they are both too restrictive but did not issue veto threat among the many other provisions in pl 106387 are an increase in the payment limit for recipients of loan deficiency payments continued prohibitions or limitations on mandatory spending on certain agricultural research conservation and rural programs an earmark of duties collect ed on certain unfair trade practices to assist those industries affected by the trade practice increased funding for food safety activities an easing of restrictions on food stamp recipients with respect to housing and automobile allowances and emergency funding of 200 million for rural economic

president signed into law the fy2001 appropriations act pl 106387hr 4461 for the us depart ment of agriculture and related agencies the house approved the conference report h rept 106948 on hr 4461 by 34075 vote on october 11 2000 the senate approved the measure 868 on october 18th the conference agreement contains 748 billion in regular fy2001 appropriations and cboestimated 365 billion in emergency supplement spending primarily to help farmers and rural areas recover from continued low farm commodity prices and natural disasters conference action had been delayed for several weeks because of controversy over proposed reforms of cuban trade sanctions the reimportation of prescription drugs from canada and mexico and the level of spending provided for emergency farm assistance usda spending at glance the us depa rtment of agriculture usda carries out its widely varied responsibilities through approximate ly 30 separate internal agencies and offices staffed by some 100000 employees usda is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budge t function hence spending for usda is not synonymous with spending for farmers nor with the agriculture appropriations bill which includes funds for nonusda programs notably the food and drug administration fda usda gross outlays for fy1999 the most recently completed fiscal year for which data are currently available were 675 billion by far the largest outlay within the department 330 billion or just under onehalf of total fy1999 outlays was for its food and nutrition programs primarily the food stamp program the costliest of all usda programs various child nutrition programs and the women infants and children wic program fy1999 gross outlays also include 236 billion or just over onethird of total outlays for farm and foreign agricultural services within this missi on area of usda are the programs funded through the commodity credit corporation eg commodity support programs the conservation reserve program and certain trade programs crop insurance farm loans and foreign food aid programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs2 another 47 billion 7 was spent in fy1999 on an array of natural resource and environment programs nearly threefourths of which funded the forest service which is funded through the interior appropriations bill and the only usda agency not funded through the agriculture appropriations bill and the balance for number of conservation programs for farm producers usda programs for rural development 25 billion in gross outlays for fy1999 research and education 19 billion marketing and regulatory activities 818 million meat and poultry inspection 604 million and departmental adminis trative offices and other activities 362 million account for most of the balance of usda spending mandatory vs discretionary spending approximately threefourths of total usda spending is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs outside the control of annual appropriations eligibility for mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law currently accounting for the vast majority of usda mandatory spending are the food stamp program which accounts for nearl onehalf of total usda mandatory spending child nutrition programs the farm commodity price and income support programs the federal crop insurance program and the conservation reserve program crp although they have mandatory status the food and nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs supplemental appropriations generally are made if and when these estimates fall short of required spending an annual appropriation is also made to reimburse the commodity credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs3 corporation for losses it incurs in financing the commodity support programs and the various other programs it financ historically spending levels among these programs has been erratic and unpredictable making total usda spending highly variable some of this unpredictability was lessened by the enactment of the 1996 farm bill which fixes the level of spending on direct payments to program crop producers and longer ties these payments to market conditions however emergency provisions in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 the fy2000 agriculture appropriations act pl 10678 and various supplemental spending acts have made available total of nearly 16 billion in additional funding to farmers to help them recover from low commodity prices and natural disasters most of this emergency funding was provided through the commodity credit corporations ongoing borrowing

programs normally funded by the annu appropriations bill and 365 billion in emergency supplemental spending for various usda programs the 745 billion in regular appropriations is approximately 800 million below the 753 billion provided in both the house and senate versions of the bill passed in july by their respective chambers much of the difference in regular spending between the final law and the house and senatepassed levels is explained by downward reestimation of the funding requirements of the food stamp program the 365 billion in emergency funding for fy2001 is higher than the approximately 2 billion provided in the original senatepassed bill the original housepassed bill contained emergency spending provisions for fy2001 conference action on the measure had been delayed for several weeks because of controversy over three issues the exemption of food and medicine from unilateral sanctions against cuba and other countries relaxation of restrictions on the importation

the senate and compares it with the original housepassed and senatepassed versions of the bill the administration request and fy2000 funding levels also included is discussion of the estimated 36 billion in supplemental usda spending adopted in the conference agreement trade sanctions pl 106387 includes house republican leadership language to exempt agricultural and medical products from current and future us unilateral economic sanctions its immediate effect would be to allow commercial sales of such products to cuba and to codify administration decisions to allow such sales to four other sanctioned countries iran libya north korea and sudan sales of exemptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs5 products could not be made to these five countries using any us government assistance program such as foreign aid credit or guarantees and export assistance the president though is granted authority to waive this prohibition if he determines it is in the national interest with respect to iran libya north korea and sudan or for humanitarian reasons this waiver authority does not extend to cuba various provisions affect the terms of the foodmedical exemption that would apply to cuba in addition to the prohibition on federal financing of sales financing of agricultural exports to cuba by us banks or by state and local governments also would be permanently prohibited sales to cuba could only occur on cashinadvance basis or if financed by third country bank these payment and financing conditions are nearly similar to those that apply under current treasury regulations on sales now permitted to iran libya and sudan also us exporters of agricultural and medical products would be required to meet specified export licensing requirements other language would codify current cuban embargo regulations by prohibiting 1 merchandise imports from cuba and 2 travelrelated transactions that treasury regulations in effect on june 1 2000 did not expressly allow such as for tourism other than travel related to selling agricultural commodities under the new policy other provisions in pl 106387 would require congressional approval before the president imposes future restrictions or prohibitions on sales of these products on target country for foreign policy or national security reasons these also would limit the duration of such approved sanctions to not more than 2 years unless congress approves requested extension some membe rs argue that the adopted provisions are too restrictive in prohibiting the financing of us agricultural sales to cuba and oppo the codificatio n of current travel rules supporters of legislating an opening for prospective food sales to cuba acknowledge that the final language was the best that could be attained under current circumstances though the administration signaled last summer that it might support legislative initiatives to permit food and medical product sales to cuba as long as such efforts did not support castros government president clinton on october 6 criticized the conferenceadopted provisions as big mistake that would do little to facilitate sales to cuba and called the related tourist travel ban unwarranted and unwise the cuban government has criticized the final agreement due to the export financing prohibition and travel provisions analysts project that an exemption under the stated conditions might result in 25 to 50 million in us food exports to cuba within year for more information see economic sanctions and agricultural exports in the crs electronic briefing book on trade and crs issue brief ib10061 exempting food and agriculture products from us economic sanctions current issues and proposals emergency supplemental assistance title viii of pl 106387 provides an estimated 36 billion in fy2001 emergency spending for farmers and rural areas primarily in response to natural disasters and continued low farm commodity prices this follows 15 billion in supplemental spending provided to usda programs in fy2000 and 164 billion already provided in fy2001 most in the form of direct payments to qualified farmershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs6 title viii provides such sums as are necessary to fund the disaster payment formula used by usda in recent years to compensate farmers for major crop losses caused by natural disasters the estimated cost of making quantity and quality loss payments to grower of 2000year crop is 16 billion however the borrowing authority of usdas commodity credit corporation can be used to fully fund the disaster payment formula should more funding be required pl 106387 also includes 490 million in payments to livestock producers to compensate for forage losses caused by disaster the act also provides third consecutive year of market loss payments to compensate dairy farmers for low milk prices it requires usda to use payment formula based on portion of the difference between 2000 farm milk prices and previous years prices which cbo estimates will cost 473 million more recent estimate by usda shows that dairy payments will be approximately 667 million based on the payment formula in the law separate assistance is provided to apple growers to help them recover from low commodity prices and to aid both apple and potato growers who experienced poorquality crops caused by natural disasters title viii of pl 106387 also includes several provisions that modify farm policy but are considered to be budget neutral in fy2001 this includes an increase in the annual limit for loan deficiency payments from 75000 to 150000 per person the law also makes modifications to the sugar price support program by requiring usda to offer nonrecourse loans to sugar processors instead of the current recourse loans this change in effect gives sugar processors minimum price guarantee for their commodity table 3 summarizes all of the provisions in the emergency title of pl 106387 which have an effect on fy2001 spending some of the provisions are expected to affect federal spending in years beyond fy2001 but current estimates for outyear spending are not yet available for more background on emergency farm spending see crs issue brief ib10043

emergency provisions listed in this table include those that have an effect on federal spending in fy2001 not included are numerous emergency provisions that affect policy but are budget neutral in fy2001httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs8 b the agreement provides such sums as our necessary to fund the disaster payment formula and the dairy payments the amounts shown above for these two programs are cbo estimates prior to enactment more recent usda estimate for the amount of dairy payments is for spending of 667 million in fy2001 commodity credit corporation outlays for farm support programs including ongoing commodity support programs and recent emergency assistance to compensate farmers for low commodity prices and natural disasters and various farm export and conservation programs are funded through usdas commodity credit corporation ccc the ccc has 30 billion line of credit with the us treasury therefore the ccc does not require an annual appropriation to fund its spending activities however because ccc outstanding borrowing cannot exceed 30 billion the annual agriculture appropriations bill contains funding for reimbursement of ccc net realized losses so the corporation can repay its debt to the treasury and not exhaust its borrowing authority this reimb ursement is categorized as an indefinite appropriation meaning that the ccc is provided such sums as are necessary it is mandatory expenditure that is not included in the discretionary spending allocation given to the appropriations subcommittees historically the appropriation received by the ccc in any fiscal year would be to reimburse the corporation for actual losses in the previous fiscal year over the last couple of years ccc annual spending has been at or near historically high levels 192 billion in fy1999 and an estimated 28 billion in fy2000 mainly because of the large amounts of cccfunded financial assistance provided in recent emergency supplemental appropriations acts but initially funded through ccc s borrowing authority with the treas ury coupled with rising cost of ongoing farm income assistance programs consequently in fy2000 and fy2001 usda requested an appro priation to cover the cccs expected current year losses as well as unreimbursed past losses without such an appropriation usda feared that the ccc would exhaust its 30 billion credit limit with the treasury when the fy2000 agriculture appropriations act pl 10678 was being debated last year usda had estimated that the ccc would require an appropriation of 14368 billion for its fy2000 and prior years unreimbursed losses however because of the 9 billion in emergency assistance authorized in fy2000 most of which is funded through the ccc and increased spending for the ongoing commodity support programs the estimated fy2000 appropriation has been revised to 30037 billion 157 billion increase over the initial estimate usdas fy2001 estimate for ccc appropriations is 27771 billion which is provided in the fy2001 agriculture appropriations act pl 106387 crop insurance the federal crop insurance program is administered by usdas risk managem ent agency rma it offers basically free catastrophic insurance to producers who grow an insurable crop producers who opt for this coverage have the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage at subsidized rate most policies are sold and completely serviced through approv ed private insurancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs9 companies that have their program losses reinsured by usda the annual agriculture appropriations bill makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program it provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expenses of the rma and also provides such sums as are necessary for the federal crop insurance fund through which all other expenses of the program are funded including premium subsidies indemnity payments and reimbursements to the private insurance companies the administrati on requested 677 million for the fy2001 salaries and expenses of the rma up 37 million from the fy2000 level pl 106387 concurs with the senatepassed level of 656 million small er increase than what was requested and in the housepassed bill the senate appropriations committee report says the amount provided is adequate to meet mandatory pay cost increases funding provided to the federal crop insurance fund is classified as an indefinite appropriation that can only be estimated until final participation rates and actual crop losses are known therefore pl 106387 provides such sums as are necessary for fy2001 which the administration estimates will be 1728 billion separate provision in the emergency title of pl 106387 provides 13 million to the federal crop insurance program to cover shortfall in the additional premium subsidy given to participating farmers in the 1999 crop year an earlier supplemental act pl 105277 provided usda with 400 million to offer addit ional premium discounts to attract more farmers to the program usda estimated that the funding would allow for 30 discount on farmerpaid premiums after signup they estimated 13 million shortfall in funds necessary to provide the full 30 discount earlier in 2000 separate legislation was enacted making permanent changes to the federal crop insurance program the recently enacted measure pl 106224 significantly increases the portion of the premium paid by the government on behalf of the farmer provides improved coverage for farmers affected by multiple years of natural disasters authorizes pilot insurance programs for livestock producers and gives the private sector greater representation in policymaking new funding provi ded by this law did not have to be offset because the final fy2001 budget resoluti on hconres 290 made room in the budget for 817 billion in new spending for the crop insurance program over 5year period fy200105 for more information on the crop insurance legislation see crs issue brief ib10033 federal crop insurance issues in the 106th congress farm service agency while the commodity credit corporation serves as the funding mechanism for the farm income support and disaster assistance programs the administration of these and other farmer programs is charged to usdas farm service agency fsa in addition to the commodity support programs and most of the emergency assistance provided in recent supplemental spending bills fsa also administers usdas direct and guaranteed farm loan programs certain conservation programs and domestic and international food assistance and international export credit programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs10 fsa salaries and expenses this account funds the administrative expenses for program administration and other functions assigned to the fsa these funds consist of appropriations and transfers from ccc export credit guarantees from pl 480 loans and from the various direct and guaranteed farm loan programs all administrative funds used by fsa are consolidated into one account for fy2001 pl 106387 provides 8284 million for this account which is 34 million more than the fy2000 level excluding supplementals and equal to the administrations request not included in this total is an emergency supplemental appropriation of 50 million within pl 106387 for fsa salaries and expenses to fund the agencys implementation of the disaster payments and other emergency farm assistance programs in the bill recent administration proposal to collocate more than two dozen fsa natural resources and conservation service nrcs and rural development state offices came under criticism in house report language concern is expressed in this report that the process used by usda to select collocation of statewide headquarters should be supported by rigorous analysis show reductions in services available to the public and demonstrate costeffectiveness fsa farm loan programs through fsa farm loan programs usda serves as lender of last resort for family farmers unable to obtain credit from commercial lender usda provides direct farm loans and also guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest on qualified loans to farmers from commercial lenders fsa farm loans are used to finance the purchase of farm real estate help producers meet their operating expenses and financially recover from natural disasters some of the loans are made at subsidized interest rate an appropriation is made to fsa each year to cover the federal cost of making direct and guaranteed loans referred to as loan subsidy loan subsidy is directly related to any interest rate subsidy provided by the government as well as projection of anticipated loan losses caused by farmer nonrepayment of the loans pl 106387 provid loan subsidy of 117 million to support an fy2001 direct and guaranteed fsa farm loan level of 1218 billion the amount provided in pl 106387 is closer to the level in the original senatepassed version of the bill 107 million in loan subsidie s to support 3083 billion than the housepassed version which concurred with the administration request for 455 million in subsidy to support 4558 billion in loan volume the final fy2001 act provides funding that will support 1 billion less in unsubsidized guaranteed loans and 125 million less in emergency disaster loans than the amount requested by the administration for these programs the amount provided supports total fy2001 loan volume that is close to the loan authority provided in the regular fy2000 appropriations act however supplemental funding was enacted in fy2000 to increase the total loan volume by 25 billion contributing to the need for supplemental funding were widespread natural disasters and the continued weak state of the farm economy which caused more farmers to qualify for federal credit programs several emergency provisions in pl 106387 affect federal farm credit programs one provision allows farmers who owe money to usda as part of shared appreciation agreement to finance their payment through fsa over 25 year period at belowmarket interest rate since the late 1980s many farmers havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs11 1 in addition to the regular appropriation fy2000 spend ing for pl 480 of 9427 million was augmented by 648 million transfer from the commodity credit corporation for title i concessional loans to russia for purchases of food commodities according to the administration additional ccc transfers to pl 480 are not anticipated in fy2001 entered into shared apprec iation agreements with usda whereby delinquent borrowers are forgiven portion of their indebtedness as long as they share portion of any appreciation in their collateral real estate values with usda ten years after the agreement is signed many of these 10year agreements are now maturing and at time when the farm economy is weak and many producers lack the financial resources to make payment to usda another emergency provision allows disasterstricken poultry farmers who could not obtain hazard insurance to qualify for fsa emergency disaster loans to rebuild their chicken houses pl 106387 also gives usda the authority to transfer funds among the direct and guaranteed farm loan programs as needed with the advance consent of the house and senat appropriations committees agricultural trade and food aid discretionary appropriated programs for the international activities of usda subject to annual appropriations in fy2001 the fy2001 agriculture appropriations act pl 106387 contains budget authority of 1092 billion this level of spending is 37 million above the fy2000 enacted spending level and virtually identical to the levels requested by the administration in its budget request and the senatepassed bill the only difference is that the conferees included 2 million for fas to administer emergency international and other food aid programs pl 480 food aid the salaries and expenses of the foreign agricultural service and administrative expenses of the ccc export credit guarantee programs are the usda international activities that require an annual appropriation pl 480 is the main channel for us foreign food aid and the largest appropriated international usda program pl 106387 contains budget authority for pl 480 of 9734 million about 31 million more than enacted in fy20001 for the foreign agricultural service fas which implements usdas international programs pl 106387 provides an appropriation of 1134 million 42 million more than in fy2000 final fy2001 budget authority for administrative expenses of the ccc export credit guarantee program are identical to the fy2000 appropriated level of 38 million the only differences between the original house and senatepassed versions of the fy2001 appropriations bill were in funding levels for pl 480 title ii and for the foreign agricultural service the house provided 1092 million for fas and the senate bill contained 1134 million for title ii funding within pl 480 the senate provided 837 million compared with 770 million in the house bill in both cases conferees agreed to the higher

credit corporation ccc for example the 38 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs12 budget authority for administrative expenses of the ccc export credit guarantee program would support export credit guarantees for an estimated 38 billion worth of us agricultural exports the fy2001 estimated program level for ccc export credit guarantees is unchanged from the fy2000 estimated level two other usda programs funded through the ccc help to develop markets for agricultural exports for the market access program map which aims to develop overseas markets for us agricultural commodities the administration estimates spending of 90 million the maximum allowed under the 1996 farm law map has been frequent but unsuccessful target of budget cutters who label it corporate welfare and of some members in search of funds to offset increased spending for other programs an amendment reflecting that point of view which would have effectively prohibited spending on map was defeated on the house floor provision in the committee reported version of the bill that would have restored map funding for mink pelts was struck from the housepassed bill on point of order the foreign market development program fmdp or cooperator program another export market development activity previously funded as discretionary program but now financed by the ccc would entail spending of 275 million in fy2001 the export enhancement program eep and the dairy export incentive program deip also funded by the ccc are usdas current direct export subsidy programs the budget proposes eep spending at 478 million the maximum level authorized in the 1996 farm law and under the 1994 world trade organization wto agreement on agriculture eep subsidies have been little used in recent years only 1 million in fy1999 because according to usda global suppl and demand conditions do not favor its use for deip the adm inistration proposes program level of 66 million reduction from the fy2000 estimate of 119 million the proposed reduction reflects limits imposed by commitments in the wto agricultural agreement and an end in june 2000 of rollover authority in the agricultural agreement which had allowed countries to exceed their annual export subsidy limits by drawing on unused subsidy authority from previous years section 416b commodity donations and food aid under the food for progress program also are funded by ccc food for progress also can use title i appropriated funds or commodities in ccc inventories to carry out its programs for section 416b commodity donations which were valued at more than

21 billion less than the administrations original fy2001 request and 9275 million less than fy2000 budget authority for these programs with most of the difference in spending for the food stamp program it does not reflect additional funding expected to be needed because of provisions added to the conference agreement that will increase food stamp eligibilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs22 2 the midsession review predicted greater economic growth and lower unemployment than originally predicted and therefore lower likely participation in the food stamp program and less federal spending needs 3 section 32 of the act of august 24 1935 provides that 30 percent of gross customs receipts be placed into an account each year to among other things promote domestic food consumption remove agricultural surpluses and assist the food needs of the poor each year 8090 of the funds in this account are transferred to the child nutrition account

reserve fund 1 billion than that normally provided by the congress 100 million pl 106387 reflects downward adjustment in the amounts contained in the house and senatepassed fy2001 appropriation bills because of more optimistic projection of program spending needs in the midsession review by the office of management and budget omb2 this level is expected to provide sufficient funding to fully cover food stamp eligibility and benefits for fy2001 not included in the final amount is additional spending that most likely will be needed because of provisions added to the final law that expand food stamp program eligibility ie higher housing allowance and more flexible auto value limits pl 106387 requires that the administration submit request for the entire amount needed to pay for this expansion and to request this as emergency funding and thus does not require offsetting reductions meanwhile the administration did not follow up on its plans described in its original budget submission that would have restored food stamp eligibility to some 210000 legal aliens made ineligible by the 1996 welfare reform law child nutrition pl 106387 funds fy2001 child nutrition programs at

the program was serving considerably fewer participants 716 million versus 733 million in fy2000 than previou sly had been reported indicated that greater than expected carryover funds would be available this is expected to lessen the amount of funding needed to maintain or increase fy2000 program caseload in fy2001 an administration proposal to separate fmnp funding from the wic account and fund this activity separately under the category of commodity assistance programs caps was rejected by congress the fmnp operates in certain areas where wic recipients have access to farmers markets

bulk of the funding under this category 140 million out of 1411 million in fy2000 provides commodities or cashinlieu of commodities for meal programs for the elderly operated under the older americans act commodity assistance also is provided for pacific islanders and for disaster aid under this category pl 106387 provides total of 1511 million for these program s for fy2001 the same amount

regulations requiring marketers of dietary supplements to submit health claims to the agency for approval within 6 months of enactment fda must report on how the agency has implemented the dietary supplement health and education act during fy2000 and the cost of implementing the dietary supplement strategy 10year plan the act recommends an increase of 1 million of fdas food program funds be used for research on dietary supplements by both the national center for natural products research in mississippi and fdas food program drug and medical device issues recently consumers have noticed the sizable differences between the prices charged in the united states and in foreign countries for the same drug in conference two new sections were added to the federal food drug and cosmetichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs26 act to address this issue the first section called the medicine equity and drug safety act of 2000 based on jeffords amendment requires fda to establish new regulations governing the importation of fdaapproved prescription drugs by pharmacists and wholesalers among other things these new regulations would require that the imported drugs be manufactured in an fdaapproved facility have documented chain of custody be tested by qualified laboratories and have brand name attached that is identical to the drugs produced in the united states this section also includes fiveyear sunset provision and restrictions on the countries from which the drugs can be imported it also restricts reimporting certain classes of drugs including controlled substances the conferees made available 23 million to implement this first section second new section called the prescri ption drug import fairness act of 2000 will allow individuals to import prescription drugs for their own use without fda sending warning letter to the drug recipient unless fda can specify what is wrong with the imported drug see crs report rl30678 prescription drug imports issues raised by amendments to the fy2001 agriculture appropriations bill the conference committee report expressed concern about improving the timeliness of product reviews the agreement gives fda more than 23 million for premarket application review activities and specifies how some of this funding is to be used for example 1 million of the increase is to be added to orphan drug grants making the total 125 million for the grant program for fy2001 orphan drugs are class of drugs used to treat rare diseases but are not considered comme rcially viable it also recommends that with this increase 22 million

drug distributors and allows blood centers that meet the definition of health care center to distribute whole blood but not blood derivatives report language requests report from fda by january 15

veterinary medicine cvm for work on antibiotic resistance the conferees believe that fda should establish gene therapy patient tracking system to measure short and longter m effects of gene therapy treatment the conferees note that although fda has developed pilot system they request withinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30501crs27 3 months of enactment report from fda that includes plan and budget for implementing patient tracking system and how the agency will integrate the new system within the next 12 months with the current adverse events tracking system the conference agreement report contains language concerning the international harmonization of regulations for pharmaceuticals medical devices and food the conference agreement requires fda to report by january 1 2001 on how the agency will promote mutual recognition and international harmonization of approval systems and product surveillance the conference report recommends fda use 18 million of the fsi funding to support activities of the codex alimentarius an international organization designed to protect the health of consumers globally and to facilitate international trade in foods because common allergenic contact dermatitis costs the us economy more than 1 billion annually and because fda has approved only 24 patch test kits for allergenic chemicals the conference report recommends fda expedite the approval of over 400 allergen tests used already in europe and canada the conference report also directs fda to return to the center for devices and radiological health cdrh the regulatory authority to approve patch test
