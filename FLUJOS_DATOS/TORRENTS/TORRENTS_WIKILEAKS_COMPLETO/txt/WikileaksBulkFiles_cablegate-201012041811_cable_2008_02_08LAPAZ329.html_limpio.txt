bolivian government attempted to renew and in some cases repackage old allegations against the us february 1618 bolivian president evo morales threatened to show usaid the door if it continues undermining his administration as proof morales provided the example of political organization that was allegedly turned down for usaid assistance due to its promorales stance he also cited unnamed groups that were asked to work against the government as condition for assistance morales also argued against free trade agreement with the us and charged the us of involvement in the disappearances of bolivians during drugrelated conflicts in the region of chapare morales assertion that progovernment groups were prepared to take up arms to defend his agenda were rebuffed by widerange of social and labor groups government minister alfredo rada continues to accuse the us of involvement in police spying scandal to deflect from his role in the unauthorized surveillance of opposition politicians and reporters the bolivian governments refusal to sign cooperation agreement concerning us military aid and the impact of that refusal on disaster assistance was made public february 18 foreign minister david choquehuanca explained the government did not want to sign an agreement with its eyes closed and was only reviewing the agreement despite public assurances that they want better relations with the us the relentless public spinning of the bolivian governments complaints against the us at the expense of diplomatic channels suggest the bog has another agenda discredit the us and distract the bolivian public end summary lights camera allegations 2 u bolivian president evo morales made several references to ongoing political problems with the us february 15 although he clarified diplomatic and commercial relations would be maintained morales rehashed the argument that usaid is supporting opposition groups and that the us embassy is making politics at the expense of diplomatic work such as advancing commercial ties morales asserted during recent months usaid has been convoking groups through implementing ngos and offering them money with the stipulation that they work against the bolivian government morales claimed leaders from the federation of ayllus indigenous local government units of potosi told him an usaidsupported ngo denied their groups request for 20000 because the organization supports evo morales morales urged citizens to report ngos that are bought by usaid to distribute funds to make politics against the government he added the government will not allow ngos to work against the executive power faced with these provocations from usaid we will ask them to go home morales saluted us citizens that are denouncing both usaid and the embassy for practicing politics but offered details on who he was referring to 3 u although most of his criticisms were respun from old charges morales added new spin on some existing allegations morales asserted embassy bolivian police guards act like embassy workers at the side of the us government morales claimed he learned of this strange police arrangement through fulbrighter van schaick who accused assistant regional security officer vincent cooper of asking him to spy on cubans and venezuelans in bolivia last week reftels and b though not directly associated with recent charges the us is behind bolivian police spying on politicians and reporters this mischaracterization of our bolivian guard force feeds into the morales administrations allegations of undue us influence on bolivian police units evo on fta drugs and cooper expulsion 4 c morales rejected free trade agreement with the us as return to the days of formerpresident gonzalo sanchez lozada when morales alleges the government made deals with us businesses at the expense of bolivians morales characterized the embassys decision that arso vincent cooper would not return to bolivia as the expulsion of man who conducted north american espionage morales repeated his opinion that the war on drugs has been failure because it targeted coca leaf instead of cocaine he alleged the dea us military and bolivian national police headed bolivian antinarcotics efforts from us military base in cochabamba department when there were demonstrations and disappearances implying us involvement note the us supports bolivian antinarcotics efforts at the chimore airport and has offices there but there are us military bases per in bolivia despite morales intermittent calls to dismantle such nonexistent bases this issue is misunderstanding or straw man end note call to arms disconnected 5 u while railing against oligarchic groups and particularly efforts to convoke an autonomy referendum in the oppositionled department state of santa cruz morales claimed progovernment groups would defend his administration with arms morales said february 14 that sympathizers in santa cruz had told him they would take up arms to ensure the opposition showed morales the proper respect however leaders from masaligned social and union groups rejected any attempt to resort to arms february 16 calling instead for an electoral solution to settle bolivian differences spin doctor radas dizzying spy accusations 6 u on february 15 the ambassador met with government minister alfredo rada to discuss the usgs support to the polices special operations command copes police unit unit that rada has stated was likely behind growing domestic surveillance scandal following their meeting the ambassador issued public statement which reiterated that the usg was never involved in domestic spying and explained that usg would longer fund copes because the unit had been disbanded on january 29 7 u in an interview with the paz newspaper prensa following the february 15 meeting rada continued to insinuate as he has done publicly on various occasions that copes was responsible for internal surveillance against political officials and journalists rada once again called copes parallel intelligence organization that conducted political intelligence argued it reported directly to the usg and not to the national intelligence directorate dni and that it exceeded the scope of its mandate rada explained that since september 11 2001 the us government had directed copes to gather intelligence on terrorist organizations which violated copes mission to conduct surveillance only on narcotrafficking organizations rada stated that terrorism is fundamentally political phenomenon therefore copes conducted political intelligence all of this function of the state departments priorities note according to the copes memorandum of understanding between the bolivian and us governments conducting surveillance on both illegal narcotics and terrorist targets is part of its mission end note 8 u throughout the interview minister rada engaged in double speak at times strongly insinuating the usg was behind the domestic spying scandal at other times acknowledging there was little information tying the usg to the case it would be irresponsible to affirm they the embassy were behind these domestic spying operations rada stated he followed with the fact that intelligence personnel from the embassy received reports from odep copes official name since 2001 makes us believe that they were aware of these things domestic spying despite earlier statements in the interview that copes responded to the usg rada closed the interview with the statement that odepcopes followed direct orders from the embassy we cannot yet demonstrate but we are investigating but there was direct economic link and it has been demonstrated that they worked on priorities designed by washington rada also tried to link fulbrighter van schaick case to the domestic spy scandal arguing his van schaicks sworn statement is the first piece of concrete evidence that links the usg to espionage within bolivia eyes wide shut on milgp assistance 9 c the bolivian press reported february 19 that the bolivian government had frozen military humanitarian assistance by not renewing our humanitarian assistance diplomatic note which acts as sofa or status of forces agreement for us military personnel in bolivia the article stressed that nonmilitary aid usd 600000 to flood victims is not affected however it highlighted that our milgrp has provided humanitarian assistance include medical dental and eye treatment since 1996 and has already prevented aid from arriving for flooding victims foreign minister david choquehuanca responded that the government had not canceled any agreement but was simply reviewing it choquehuanca stated we now do not sign agreements with the united states with our eyes closed like what happened in the past especially with antidrug assistance note the humanitarian assistance agreement has nothing to do with our counternarcotics aid bolivian diplomatic note suspended renewal of the assistance agreement january 29 citing the need for dialogue to bridge gap of understanding reftel c end note comment 10 c although charges that usaid is undermining the bolivian government are nothing new minister of the presidency juan quintana originally laid out the charges in august and officials have drummed them up periodically since morales call for bolivians to help the government identify these ngos ostensibly working to undermine his administration is troubling development using morales example of the potosi group that was denied 20000 any person or organization that asks for usaid funding and does not receive it could allege political motive we will continue to counter misunderstandings about usaids transparency and apolitical nature with reality however the bolivian government is unlikely to back off from its usaid assault any time soon as it enjoys the propaganda value of creating an external enemy to distract from domestic problems likewise although government officials have privately admitted to us they do not believe the us was involved in the police spying scandal they are not disengaging from insinuations of us involvement radas accusations are designed not to lead to formal process that would prove or disprove them but rather to create the appearance of us impropriety to distract the bolivian public from very real and potentially damaging charges against him as such they are success the incongruity of the government accusing us of being in cahoots with the opposition and at the same time spying on them seems largely overlooked in the public discourse unfortunately the bolivian press does not consistently apply critical analysis to these incoherent vague and sometimes contradictory charges before distributing them to the bolivian and international public 11 c comment continued although they may not always believe in the merits of some of their specific accusations government leaders from evo down appear to genuinely believe the embassy is working to undermine the morales administration given his proclivity to view the embassy as separate from the us government and people we expect morales to bring the gobs vague litany of accusations against the embassy to both the visiting congressional delegation and to the us public during his planned february 2527 speaking tour in the us end comment goldberg
