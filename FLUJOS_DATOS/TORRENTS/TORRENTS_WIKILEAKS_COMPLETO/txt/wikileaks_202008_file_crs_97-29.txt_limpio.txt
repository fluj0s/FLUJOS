major parties are the labour party and the national party the national party conservative and moderately rightwing took office in october 1990 and was narrowly reelected in 1993 and 1996 national is led by prime minister jenny shipley and has traditionally been sympathetic to agricultural and business interests labour which governed from 1984 to 1990 is an unlikely coalition of pragmatic leftwing politicians and radical activists most notably represented by trade union members helen clark labours leader since 1993 has transformed the party into cohesive opposition that currently is favored to win parliamentary elections scheduled for november 1999 2 popular dissatisfaction with both major parties in the early 1990s resulted in the formation of several splinter parties the most important splinter parties are the new zealand first party nzf formed in 1993 and the alliance party forged in 1991 from coalition of five small parties including the environmentalist greens another party act new zealand emerged from the association of concerned taxpayers they espouse radical centerright agenda of tax and spending cuts and are currently junior partner in the national government these splinter parties have appeared attractive to those who have suffered from the economic policies of the labor and national party governments over the past decade both parties have advocated economic nationalist themes such as restrictions on foreign investment and imports new zealand first also supports immigration restrictions as well3 new zealands wage rates today are much more differentiated by skill level than they were in the mid1980s and there is growing gap between the wealthy and the poor decade of restructuring and downsizing both in the government and private sector has increased the insecurity of many workers the perception that reforms have benefitted the wealthy has created resentment against immigrants particularly asians that make up the new business and financial elite 1993 referendum changed new zealands electoral system to mixedmember proportional system mmp this method provides more opportunities for smaller parties to win seats in parliament noting current public and business dissatisfaction with mmp as source of government instability the national party has pledged referendums on alternative suffrage systems or return to the previous firstpastthepost system the october 1996 general election the first to be held under the new electoral system failed to produce clear winner 4 as result of this electoral deadlock national and nzf 2 mps chipper in the

inexperience of nzf ministers and alarmed by nzfs sagging popularity discontent with the coalition also led to party coup orchestrated by then transport minister jenny shipley which ousted jim bolger as prime minister in december 19975 national has governed alone since that time by forming alliances with act new zealand maori pacific itself splinter of nzf and independents economic developments6 with small population of just 37 million and located 2000 miles away from australia its nearest neighbor new zealands economy historically has been predominantly agrarian blessed with fertile land mass approximately the size of the british isles and temperate climate the country has been major producer of livestock dairy and forestry products as well as grains in the early 1950s new zealand enjoyed one of the highest living standards in the world during this period between 6070 of its exports of primary products mostly lamb mutton wool and dairy products were sold to the united kingdom on preferential basis generous and comprehensive government programs at the time covered social security education and health services in the 1970s the new zealand economy was confronted with several shocks the loss of its preferential access to the united kingdom when london joined the european community and the oil price shocks of 1974 and 1979 these events convinced government policymakers of the necessity to encourage the development of more diversified economy both in terms of the range of its products and its export markets in support of that objective the government pursued very interventionist economic policies that included statefunded investment programs agricultural subsidies rigid trade and investment protection and wage and price controls however by the early 1980s the results of these policies high inflation rising budget deficits declining productivity and stagnating economy created political support for moving new zealand from protected interventionist lowgrowth economy to an open unregulated and more productive one labour party economic reforms and results 19841990 labour party government elected in 1984 and reelected in 1987 commenced new zealands liberalization program the main reforms pushed through parliament by the labour government entailed unilateral reduction in tariffs removal of controls on foreign direct 4 continued 5 seats united new

period during this period gdp growth averaged from 1 to 15 and overall unemployment increased to over 7 by 1990 up from 45 in 1984 given that the population was increasing at 1 annual rate during this period new zealanders experienced nearzero growth in per capita income for eight years this economic record combined with continuing internal divisions within the labour party concerning the reform program contributed to the election of national party government in 1990 national party economic reforms and results 19901996 with its election in october 1990 the more conservative national party not only maintained the reforms introduced by the labour government but moved to extend them into the area of labor markets and social services in 1991 the new government acted to curb the power of trade unions to act as sole bargaining agent for workers and to reduce expenditures on social services the economy did not begin to respond positively to the reforms implemented until almost decade after

turnaround new zealand has received widespread international praise in addition the heritage foundation in 1999 ranked new zealand as the 4th most open and unregulated economy in the world7 ironically

election manifesto to reverse cuts in pension rates health care and higher education funding labour has also vowed to restore income based slidingscale rents for state owned housing labour is expected

generator further reforms of business regulation and an overhaul of the university education system8 relations with the united states domestic opinion and new zealands close identity with the south pacific region were major factors in the countrys decisions in the 1980s to reorient its security policy in decidedly antinuclear direction up to that point new zealand had been close partner with australia in the anzus alliance with the united states it benefitted from close intelligence sharing arrangements access to advanced us military equipment and access to highlevel us officials in return new zealand cooperated closely with the united states on regional and global security issues and sent forces to fight along side the americans in major conflicts including the korean and vietnam wars taking stand strongly opposed to us and other states nuclear weapons in the south pacific the labour party government in 1987 pushed through legislation banning nuclear weapons and nuclearpowered warships from new zealand in response the united states suspended military alliance relations and reduced other government contacts to low level president bushs decision in late 1991 to remove nuclear weapons from us ships except ballistic missile submarines may have helped to ease usnew zealand differences new zealand is willing to welcome us warships that are not nuclear powered and do not carry nuclear weapons but over 40 of us naval combatant ships are nuclear powered the clinton administration in february 1994 resumed highlevel contacts with new zealand but security and intelligence ties remain on hold new zealand has also taken leading position in the south pacific forum regional organization instrumental in advocating the treaty that resulted in the south pacific

environment in antarctica both australia and the united states have been concerned in recent years about the level of new zealands defense spending these fears have been assuaged by the governments
