provides agricultural producers with imp roved profitmaking opportun ities they offer other benefits as well the resources for farmers markets website assert s farmers markets provide communities with fresh nutritious affordable and local farm products and enable farmers to increase profits by selling directly to consumers consumers enjoy the opportunity to buy highquality fresh products directly fro m the farmers at competitive prices such markets also foster commun ity and food linkages by bringing neighbors together helping children to learn where th eir food comes from and allowing families to talk directly with the farmer s and ranchers who grow their food also advocates assert the wic and senior farmers market programs put more fre sh fruits and vegetables into lowincome diets farmers markets sometimes are planned as an integral element of an overall community redevelopment project as way of drawing shoppers back to declining downtown areas for example some contend that many farmers have difficulty starting or joining market at least partly because public support s been inadequate for exam ple advocates contend that although ams is involved in direct marketing much of its work is reactive and not well coordinated they add that ams has rela tively short history with farmers markets until fairly recently it has emphasized wholesal markets ams and other agencies lack coherent strategic plan for assisting localities with planning and establishing markets or for helping farmers learn about access or start markets these advocates contendhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21652crs6 5 blalock phil executive direct or national association of farmers market nutrition programs january 3 2006 telephone communicationadvocates argue that little if any money is available to finance needed infrastructure for markets such as buildings parking mark eting space etc another lack is money for the local staffing which is needed to organize promote and operate successful markets they believe advocates also assert that access to markets by lowincome consumers has been hampered by inadequate fina ncial support for programs that use wic and food stamps as vehicles for example total requests for the two farmers market nutrition programs have ex ceeded available funding5 although supportive of farmers markets so governmental nd private marketing experts question whether additional federal intervention is needed they note for example that even with arguably limited federal programs and funding the number of farmers markets increased by 111 from 1994 to 2004 they contend that farmers markets have succeeded precisely because they have been conceived planned and launched locally by producers themselves often with the assistance of local agencies usda noted in its 2000 study that markets have become more popular mostly due to growing consumer interest in obtaining fresh products directly from the farm skeptics of expanded government intervention say this is evidence that the private market ie consumer demand can create the most auspic ious conditions for new farmers markets and that in fact is what is occurring amss 2000 survey also documented that most markets were selfsustaining fees charged covered all expenses skeptics note adding that only 18 were not selfsustaining they were primarily supported by various government agencies city county stat and federal bus iness groups nonprofit organizations individual donations and grants if congress or the administration were to increase the amount of funds devoted to farmers markets the money would have to be redirected from other priorities and programs analysts note further some policymakers and antihunger advocates have questioned whether the administrative costs of operating farmers market nutrition programs are justified by the relatively low level of benefits lowincome persons receive through these programs they have suggested that the money might be better spent by improving traditional food assi stance program benefits under food stamps and wic put another way should the emphasis of added re sources if any be on developing market infrastructure or on providing improve d benefits for those who shop there it might be argued that the level of suppor t for farmers market s is modest relative to the annual spending congress devotes to traditional food assist ance programs and to farm commodity support moreover the farmer s market nutrition programs have broader goals than simply feeding lowincome pe ople supporters point out proponents believe that relatively small amount of additional funding for thes programs and for promoting farmers markets generally could constitute valuable public investment in smallersized farm businesses nonetheless skeptics argue compelling case has been made that more legislative authority new administration initiatives or additional money would significantly improve the progress that already is being made in direct marketing such skeptics say they are concerned that more federal intervention mig ht instead undermine the local and market dynamics that have fueled the markets success
