raja rogers meeting notes may 1 2007 raja rogers its been 2 weeks since we met any questions regine david lynch founda tion policy is to teach children age 12 and up at the local school that is interested in introduc ing tm there are 6th 7th and 8th graders so some children are unde r 12 principal doesnt want to change whole school setup in order to introduc tm raja rogers policy is that children need to be 12 to start dr hagelin is trying to check on this regine ray thought that that age group middle school age was more openminded and has fewer diversions than teenagers raja rogers the whole push is to have more sidhas m considers that the phys iology is such that 12 years is the age when they learn tm and then in yr or so pick up the sidhi program regine we would like whole school approach there are 6 7 and 8th grades raja rogers raja kingsley has had success they only have 15 of the school meditating so far but the results have been amazing they will teach more kids at faster pace next yr due to changes being made in the schedule carol the age cutoff is concern for number of us working on this project when we have to cutoff an entire grade we may not have enough numbers to start program the projects are moving slower than expected due to the fact that the ground is not as fertile as we expected so adding more age groups would help the success of the projects raja rogers will work on it david lynch and donova n are in ny we had wonde rful event at 70 broad st they gave 125 hr presentation we have huge banners global financial capital of new york many investment bankers financiers etc have come by in the adjacent building well be opening health spa and mapi store and offering vaidya consultations and mvvt and tm i was so overwhelmed with the wonde rful gift everyone contributed to new iphone whenever i use it i will think of you maharishi has been very very strong in the past two weeks on mecs hes reemphasizing the maharishi enlightenment centers hes going to be calling the peace palaces invincibility centers we may even be calling the mecs invincibility centers hes interested in finding locations and we are interested in establishing mapi storage areas in the field if you happen to see properly oriented space call jeff murphy we had nice birthday celebration for lakshmi couple of weeks ago we took her and dr rao to the local hindu temple then that evening we had our monthly gathering of meditators and we all met with her in the brahmastan of the peace palace she said that one had celebrated her birthday like that wed like to have them be busier or have people come here for at or mvvt raja rogers lets think about that with elaine elaine international talked with dr rao and said that now is good time to travel and do mvvt there doesnt need to be 56 ats in order to have tour you just need to have good numbers of ats and mvvts please call if you want tour raja rogers maharishi was really really excited when he talked with the raos and heard about the results with mvvt i want to encourage everyone to take advantage of the raos maharishi really wants to promote mvvt as consciousness rises it is becoming more and more effective due to the suppor t in the environment stuart one of the people we taught this weekend wants to join the cic hell be our 4th person the course will start the last weekend in september and the first two weekends of october anyone who has meditator interested in the sidhis please contact us raja rogers our call center has been overwhelmed with leads so we will have some more people answering phone s week and half ago bobby roth put the tm book online at wwwtmorg people can download the tm book but they have to enter their email address and phone number so we can contact them anyone that you can encourage to come to the recertification course would be really great stuart it is very good that all of the people at the call center are collecting the callers email addresses that makes it easier to keep in contact with them dori i taught 3 people last weekend in atlanta one of them wants to get school program going when linda and mark are in atlanta to teach the sidhas would like to get group program organized raja rogers one of maharishis primary goals is to create new sidhas so they can fly in coherence creating groups its important to inspire everyone to join the cic in boca raton in sept stuart may 1113 there will be residence course in ray beach at the duncan center people would fly into west palm beach or ft lauderdale jeff murphy lexington will have rc over labor day in sept raja rogers thank you again for the birthday gift there was celebration on the global family chat doris birthday was on the same day today it is raj rajeshwari lindsays birthday raja rogers sisterinlaw jai guru dev
