divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406energy tax policy an economic analysis summary this report provides background on the theo ry and application of tax policy as it relates to the energy sector particularly with respect to the theory of market failure in the energy sector and suggested policy remedies economic theory suggests that producers of energyrelated minerals be taxed differently than nonmineral producers expl oration and development costs and other investments in deposit including geol ogical and geophysical costs and delay rentals should be capitalized in genera l competitive mineral producers subject to pure income tax would not exploit resour ces as fast compared with the rate of exploitation under the present system of subs idies over the longer term depletion of fossil fuels and mineral resources leads to higher real energy prices which would eventually promote the optimal amount of investment in energy efficiency and alternative fuels supply under principles of neutrality of tax policy there is purely economic rationale for energy taxes or tax subsidies to 1 raise revenues 2 conserve energy with one exception 3 promote alternative fuels 4 compensate for any extra market risk or 5 promote as an industr ial policy specific industries such as the fossil fuels industry however even unde r pure income tax economic efficiency suggests system of energy taxes in addition to the income taxes to correct for any environmental externalitie s caused by the production importation and use of each fuel and energy taxes in the form of user charges for benefits received such as the highway trust fund in the case of energy conservation market failures in the use of energy in rental housing provide an effici ency rationale for the current gross income exclusion for conservation subsidies provided by electric utilities there are other market failures in energy use that suggest efficiency standards energy labeling or governmentprovided information but not necessarily tax subsidies tax subsidies for domestic oil producti on tend to stimulate domestic supply of petroleum and reduce demand for petroleum imports this may enhance national and economic security in the short run but it might damage national and economic security in the long run as domestic energy resources are depleted faster than they otherwise would be the economically effi cient policy to redu ce import dependence would impose tax or tariff on imported petroleum based on th perbarrel estimate of these costs the socalled oil import premium the problem of vulnerability to embargoes and price shocks which relates to depende nce on imported oil from the organization of petroleum exporting c ountries opec and other potentially unstable or unfriendly foreign countries is more effectively addr essed in policy of stockpiling oil as is being done w ith the strategic petroleum reserve in terms of environmenta l protection and management energy taxes can be costeffective and efficient marketbased instrument and they are economically superior to the command and control approach in sum energy taxes are generally distortional except to correct for externalities or when imposed as user fees for benefits received and regressive and may have adverse macroeconomic consequences particularly sizeable taxes on energy production or oil

washington gpo 2004 pp 7783 2 in 2002 the energy tax provisions were part of comprehensive energy bill hr 4 107th continuedenergy tax policy an economic analysis introduction energy tax policy involves the use of the governments main fiscal instruments primarily tax subsidies tax credits deductions exemptions and lower tax rates as financial incentives and increased taxes as financial disincentives to alter the allocation or configuration of energy resources and thereby achieve policy objectives the idea of applying tax policy instrument s to the energy markets is not new but until the 1970s energy tax policy had been little used except to promote oil and gas development1 recent actions in energy tax policy recurrent energyrelated pr oblems since the 1970s oil embargoes oil price and supply shocks wide pe troleum price variations and price spikes large geographical price disparities tight energy supplies rising oil import dependence as well as increased concern for the environment have caused policymakers to look toward energy taxes and subsidies with greater frequency in typical congress hundreds of bills are introduced that propose to amend energy tax policy directly and hundreds of others have indirect effect s that either reduce costs energy tax incentives or increase costs energy taxe s in the energy industry in the 108th congress over200 such bills were introduced more recently energy tax incentives and subsidies and also some reductions in energy taxes have been the dominant part of comprehensive energy policy legislation dominant in the sense that the changes in taxes resulting from the incentives produce the greatest economic effects in terms of cost reductions or increases in the 107th and 108th congresses an emerging energy crisis fluctuating oil prices spiking petroleum pr oduct prices the california energy crisis spiking natural gas prices the collapse of enron in 2001 the northeast electricity blackout on august 14 2003 led to severa l comprehensive energy policy reform bills these bills proposed to among ot her things stimulate additional production of oil and gas and reduce petroleum impor t dependence expand electricity supply and infrastructure promote energy cons ervation and efficiency and expand the supply of alternative renewa ble and unconventional fuels2 sizeable energy taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs2 2 continued congress hr 4 was dropped on november 13 2002 due to controversy over anwr development and fuel economy standards in 2003 and 2004 the 108th congress these provisions were part of hr 6 on november 24 2003 the conference report failed to secure the necessary 60 votes to overcome democratic filibuster before congresss adjournment for the holiday season this represented the third attempt to pass comprehensive energy legislation top prior ity for republicans and for president bush 3 crs report rl32402 energy tax incentives in hr 6 the conference agreement as compared with the house bill and senate amendment by salvatore lazzari 4 see crs report rl30497 suspending the gas tax analysis of s 2285 by salvatore lazzarisubsidies tilted more toward fossil fuel supply were part of hr 6 the comprehensive energy policy bill of the 108th congress the conference version of that bill proposed 235 billion ten year energy tax cut3 failure of the comprehensive energy legislation caused several energy tax incentives to expire in 2003 so the 108th congress enacted retroactive extension of several of the provisions as part of the working families ta x relief act of 2004 pl 108311 those provisions which re duced revenues by about 13 billion over ten years were enacted on enacted on october 4 2004 about 5 billion in energy tax incentives mostly from the expansion and liberalization of the renewable electricity tax credit were part of th american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 enacted on october 22 2004 that l eaves roughly 17 billion in tax breaks embodied in the failed comprehe nsive legislation hr 6 108th congress that have not been enacted many of the energy tax incentives that have not been enacted over the past four or five years have been repackaged as hr 6 109th congress which the house approved with its tax title on april 13 2005 the tax provisions provide about 81 billion of energy tax cuts over ten years as compared with 235 billion in hr 6 in the 108th congress and 335 billion in house version of hr 4 in the 107th the senate is expected to vote on an senate finance committee approved bill that provides about 17 billion in energy tax subsidies this bill is tilted less toward fossil fuel production and more toward ener gy conservation and alternative fuels than the 8 billion tax incentives package in the housepassed energy bill president bushs fy2006 budget request proposed 67 b illion tenyear energy tax incentives package finally not all of the recent actions in the area of energy tax policy have involved tax subsidies or incentives so have involved taxation for example during the spike in gasoline and diesel pr ices of spring 2000 there were several proposals eg s 2285 106th congress to suspend the motor fuels excise taxes to relieve consumers the burden of high and spiking prices4 more recently there are bills to reinstate the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980 to reduce the windfall profits allegedly being earne d by oil companies from high crude oil and petroleum product priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs3 issues raised by ener gy policy proposals proposals to amend the current federal tax trea tment of the energy industry and to either impose energy taxes or provide tax subsidies raise several important economic and other pub lic policy issues the nature and seriousness of the nations energy problems and the appropriate policy instruments to deal with them what exactly are the problems in us energy markets is the problem one of excessive demand for and consump tion of energy is it insufficient supply or is it both moreover are the problems an inherent part of the market system that need government solution or does government interference worsen the situation are there market failures or just simply barriers th at could be overcome by the market itself if the economic variables were aligned just right more specifically what are the various problems in each of the energy markets the petroleum natural gas and electricity markets how serious is growing petroleu m import dependence and what are the tax policy instruments that may be effectively used to address this problem assuming that energy tax policy instruments are the recommended policy choice how should the spec ific change in tax burdens be achieved should energy tax burdens be changed by tax credit tax deduction or exemption or by reduc ing some energy tax rate what is the relative effectiveness of each of these tax subsidy instruments in achieving policy effectiveness the most bangforthebuck what is and what should be the fe deral tax treatment of the energy industry including the tax treatment of investments in oil and gas wells and coal mines and the tax treatment of other expenses such as exploration and development cost s does the oil and gas industry receive federal tax subsidies and if so how much do these subsidies adversely affect the production consumption and importation of energy do they also inhibit the development of renewable energy such as solar wind and bioma ss and investments in energy efficiency should federal tax s ubsidies for oil and gas and other fossil fuels be increased to stimulate exploration and supply to address our energy problems or w ould budgetary resources be better used to reduce energy demand by providing tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy how should the tax code allow for pletion of mineral reserves and other mineral production expenses for example should it use cost depletion adjusted cost depletion percentage deple tion or complete expensing how would the va rious tax reform proposals for example cashflow tax or consumption tax affect the treatment of the oil and gas and other energy sectors httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs4 5 while there may be other factors this report addresses those problems and solutions grounded in economic efficiencyis there an economic or policy rationale for energy taxes to raise revenue or energy tax subsidies to encourage greater energy conservation or increased supply of alternative fuels further assuming the policy objective is to promote fossil fuel conservation would the more effective incentives target energy efficiency or the supply of alternative including renewable forms of energy what are the economic effects the effects on allocational efficiency distribution of income macroeconomic effects effects on energy supply demand and imports of taxing or subsidizing energy purpose of the report this report provides background on the theo ry and application of tax policy as it relates to the energy sector particularly with respect to the theory of market failure in the energy sector and the possible po licy remedies more sp ecifically it provides an overview for policymakers on the types of energy tax policy interventions that are likely to improve the functioning of energy markets and the efficiency with which the general economic system allocates resources ie the general welfare table 1 summarizes the market failures discussion in the report it lists the types of energy market failures likely to cause economic inefficiencies and the tax policy remedy suggested by economists it also cites examples in current law that are consistent with this theory energy tax provisions that enhance economic efficiency the text following the table discusses each of these failures in detail5 energy as commodity at the outset it is important to address the notion that there is something inherently different about energy or fuels from various energy resources that requires government interven tion through the tax code often energy tax proposals are premised on such arguments that energy is too important to be left to the unfettered private market systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406 crs5 table 1 energy market failures and energy tax policy remedies type of

1989httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs6 according to economists energy is commodity that is produced to provide utility to consumers or end users and in general is different than any other economic good three f eatures of energy as an economic good however differentiate it from other commodities first most energy is derived from depletable mineral resources petroleum products are derived from crude il natural gas resides in depletable reservoirs or deposits such as coal mines and electricity is currently mostly derived from coal while this does not necessarily impede the smooth functioning of the competitive market sy stem it does mean that production decisions have to be made f unctioning of the competitive market system it does mean that production decisions have to be made in an intertemporal framework that raises the important intergenerational question do markets optimally deplete resources over time or do they exploit them for short r gain at the expense of the longterm benefits of the future generation of consumers the second distinguishing feature of ergy is that the activities required to produce it generate adverse nvironmental effects and th process of transforming it to do work involves combustion which also generates pollution from emissions in the presence of such pollution or externalities as discussed below markets generally fail to produce and use the optima l quantities of energy they produce and use too much energy ie more than th optimal amounts that maximize social well being finally energy is different from other commodities say eg food clothing or housing in that both at the micro and m acroeconomic level it enters the production process of many firms and i ndustries in an important exte nt it is major factor of production just as are labor capital and managerial ability this has important implications for the macroeconomy it m eans that changes in energy prices particularly crude oil prices which are benchmarks for ll energy prices have the potential to move the markets and the macr oeconomy in major way fluctuations in energy prices could have major effects on the business cycle affecting aggregate output gdp employment inte rest rates and prices ie inflation two examples of this are the recession of 197475 whic h was caused by the 1973 oil embargo and the stagflation of the late 1970s which wa s caused by the sharp runup of crude oil prices of the 1970s neutral income tax treatment of fossil fuel producers under generally accepted economic nd accounting principles producers of depletable resources such as oil gas or coal who attempt to maximize profits over finite stock of resource should be taxed in the same manner as nonenergy producers not subject to the finite res ource constraint under pure income tax depreciation deductions woul d be based on economic depr eciation exploration and development drilling expenditures would be subject to cost depletion capitalized instead of expensed entirely deducted from currentyear taxable income as is currently done and depleti on allowances would be based on the actual decline in economic value of the mineral deposit or approximated by inde xed cost depletionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs7 6 an income tax is only neutral if with equ ityfinanced projects the cost of capital goods is expensed rather than depreciated howeve r as long as depreciation is consistently applied to all sectors then economic depreciation would not distort resource allocation among sectors 7 the only exception to the efficiency of competitive market in energy production is the case of production externality arising out of common property resource if oil and gas reservoirs lay beneath the property of several different owners each one has the incentive and the legal right to open wells on his property and extract as much oil and gas as he can before the other owners do so this leads to excessive production and resource depletion which may suggest some type of regulatory or perhaps tax policy if the problem were of sufficient national magnitude 8 see eg us senate tax expenditures compendium of background material on individual provisions pp 7189instead of percentage depletion6 neutral tax system would also generally capitalize dry hole costs the intangible co sts of drilling unsuccessful wells as such expenses may be viewed as part of th cost of developing successful wells essentially the costs of creating an asset of value in the event that there are successful wells then deduction for such costs in the year incurred is appropriate under neutral income tax system such an income tax would be neutral ie it would not distort resource allocation the optimal allocation that would otherwise result in competitive market7 the current tax treatment of mineral producers which permits expensing of intangible drilling costs and dry hole costs percentage rather than cost depletion for smaller companies and for some royalty owners exemption from passive loss limitation rules that apply to other i ndustries and special tax credits and other subsidies such as the tax credit for oil and gas produced from marginal wells differs from this neutral tax treatment in that it provides several tax subsidies for oil and gas8 while the magnitude and value of the subsidies in the aggregate are not large relative to the size of the oil and ga s industry this can still lead to increased investments in locating rese rves increased explorati on more profitable production and some acceleration of oil and gas production increased rate of extraction and excessively rapid depleti on of the resource ie they provide an unambiguous incentive to deplete sooner rather than later it also would lead to channeling of resources into these activities that otherwise would be used for oil and gas activities abroad or for other economic activities in the united states while change from the present tax system of tax subsidies to neutral tax system would have heavy adverse effect on many smaller oil and gas companies particularly those that concentrate on onshor exploration if the theory is correct it would be more than offset by the positive welfare effect on the country generally as market distortions are reduced and resour ces would be allocated more efficientlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs8 9 co2 linked to possible

compounds creates smog which is linked to lung and other health problems nd mercury contamination that pollutes lakes rivers and streams and harms wildlife and human healthexternalities and other market failures and the rationale for energy taxes and subsidies perhaps more than other markets the energy markets have characteristics which can lead to market failure and thus misallocation of resources production importation and use of energy frequently ge nerate nonmarket co sts or benefits not accounted for by the producers importers or consumers and therefore not measured in the marketplace that spill over to peopl who are not party to the transaction these spillovers or externalities are an energy market shortcoming because they are uncompensated not reflected in the equilibrium market prices for the fuel because without government intervention there are economic incentives to do so with externalities operating markets can fail to establish energy prices equal to marginal costs of supply with inaccu rate costprice signals competitive free market system may fail to achieve the socially optimal mix the allocationally efficient mix of output the presence of externalities does not alter the economic argument that competitive mineral producer s should be taxed under the same income tax rules as the competitive nonmineral producers but it does suggest either separate energy tax in the case of negative production externality where production and use of energy ge nerates costs or an energy tax subsidy in the case of positive production externality where the firms competitive free market output generates benefits to third parties environmental pollution externalities environmental damage is perhaps the major negative externality created as result of energy production nd consumption activities this consists mostly of air pollution resulting from mining transporta tion and transmission and refining and industrial use of oil gas and coal but also includes discharges of effluents into the water runoff from streets and damages to the land from mining for example coal mining can be the source of external co sts such as black lung disease from underground mining destruction of ndscape and water pollution from acid drainage combustion of coal in coalfi red powerplants produces large emissions of harmful gases fine particulate matter and urban smog linked to wide range of health and environmental damages9 the use or combustion of fossil fuels at the final consumer level by house holds motorists and businesses is also significant source of air pollution and other environm ental damages that impose uncompensated costs on society those not paying for the use of the fuel directly while much of the air pollution is from the combustion of fossil fuels gasoline and diesel in transportation it also include s industrial and resi dential fuels such as natural gas heating oil and coal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs9 10

montreal protocol of 1987 which required the 162 signatories to reduce production and consumption of substances that deplete the ozone layer the united states ratified the treaty in 1988 and it went into effect in 1989 in 1996 the m ontreal protocol banne d production of cfcs altogether since the tax raises revenues it was also viewed during the heated 1989 debates over budget reconciliation as an option for reducing the persistent and large federal budget deficits 13 see crs report rs21935 the black lung excise tax on coal by salvatore lazzari 14 renewable resources are generally thought to be less polluting than conventional fossil fuels but they can also harm the environm ent and are not pollution free hydroelectric power affects wildlife habitats as do wind farms the combustion of biomass fuels generates air emissions the negative externalities engendered by the use of renewables would also have to taxed in theorythe emissions tax most public finance nd environmental economists argue that marketbased instrument such as tax eg an emissions tax in the case of air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels would be an economically preferred instrument to correct for the market distortions caused by the pollution externality10 the tax would be equal to the m onetary value per unit of emissions of the damages to third parties and structures and other damages resulting from the harmful emission while current federal ta x law does not provide an example of theoretically pure pollution tax the tax on ozonedepleting chemicals resembles such tax11 this tax which is part of in ternal revenue c ode irc 4681 and 4682 assesses perpound tax on the sale or use of variety of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and other chemicals th at have been proven to be harmful to the earths ozone layer the tax varies based on the degree of harm of each of the taxed chemicals being lowest for methyl chloroform and highest for halon130112 another example might be the blacklung excise tax on domestically mined coal13 energy taxes aa pollution taxes some have proposed energy taxes based on the assumption that there is r oughly direct proportional relationship between emissions and the quantity of the fuel used this tax would be imposed on the quantity of polluting fuel used with rates varying directly with the amount of external cost generated by each fuel base d on estimates of the m onetary value of the harm to third parties thus it would be highest on coal then oil then gas and any nonpolluting renewable energy resources such as hydropower would be either taxed at very low rates or tax exempt dependi ng on the degree of environmental damage14 two example of such tax are the carbon tax and the british thermal unit or btu tax while carbon tax in theory shoul d be charge on the emissions of co2 in practice this tax is conceived of as an energy tax on the quantity of three fossil fuels burned coal petroleum nd natural gas with the tax rate based on the carbon content in the ratio of 10 to 08 to 06 respectively an example of an energy tax that approximates the effects of theoretically pure environmental tax might be tax on vehicle fuel as proxy for the pure tailpipe emissions tax this could behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs10 15 the current excise taxes on gasoline diesel and most other motor fuels include only the user charge component and the 01gallon leaking underground storage tank lust fund components for example the 184gall on tax on gasoline consists of the 183 user charge that goes into the highway trust f und and the 01 that goes into the lust trust fund thus there is externality component on these fuels to correct for the cost imposed on society from the harm caused by emissions fro m the combustion of the fuels there are three exceptions 43 of the taxes on diesel used by railroads and by boats on inland waterways and 68 of the tax on gasoline used by recreational motorboats goes into the general fund of the us

clinton administration in 1993 is flat or unit excise tax on all forms of energy ba sed on the btu for example one barrel of oil has on average about 58 million btus meaning that it has 58 million

review may 2005 coal price data are from the energy information administrations website variety of external costs may be asso ciated with petroleum importation these may result when petroleum im porters fail to take into account the nonmarket costs of excessive dependence on importe d petroleum from countries that are politically unstable or perhaps unfriendly to the united states these costs are the weakened defense posture and greater military vulnerability in the event of an embargo or supply disruption the cost of allocating greater res ources to national defense in order to maintain the level of national security preferred compared with the quantity that would be allocated with much lower oil imports and the economic and social costs in terms of unemployment inflation and shortages that would result from an effective oil embargo or oil price spikes18 one economically efficient policy to corr ect for these distortions would impose tax or tariff on imported pe troleum based on the perbarre l estimate of these costs the socalled oil import premium such tax however would likely violate trade agreements and thus policymakers focus on alternative policies such as tax incentives for domestic petroleum produc tion which also reduce the demand for imported petroleum httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs12 19 us congress the energy factbook committee print 96ifc60 november 1980 prepared by the congressional research serv ice at the request of the subcommittee on energy and powerthe problem of vulnerability to embargoes and price shocks which relates to dependence on imported oil from the orga nization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other unstable foreign countries is distinct from the problem of import dependence and might be better addressed in policy of stockpiling oil as is being done with the strategic petroleum reserve productioninvestment risk some have argued that oil price volatility might be possible source of market failure because it raises the risks associated with investing in oil and gas and may result in underinvestment in dom estic oil and gas extraction for much of the first part of the 20th century crude oil prices declined in real terms and the energy markets were relatively stable the price of oil varied during this period but new discoveries kept the tr end of prices downward gasoline natural gas and electricity prices were also essentially declining in nominal terms during much of this period19 the 197374 arab oil embargo against the united states reduced oil supplies by 1015 and oil pri ces

iraq which also threatened world oil supplies and supplies to the united states although the loss of imports to the united states was not that large about 500000 bpd the threat of another supply

increase investor risk in the energy industry particularly for oil and gas inves tments but it can also inhibit investments in the development of alternative ergy resources both unconventional and renewable and in energy efficiency however all prices fluctuate in free market although some more than others and such fluctuations or risks are part of being in business they are not necessarily market failures further if oil and gas prices fluctuate excessively so that they genera unusual risks that may affect energy economic or national security the preferred approach from an economists point of view would be to attempt to stabilize the price of oil this might be done by variable oil import tax rather than to provide tax subsidies20 energy user charges sometimes energy taxes may act as quasi user fee charge for the benefits received by taxpayers from the provision of public good or quasipublic good financed from the user fee revenues this is the economic rationale for the gasoline tax which charges motorists generally in proportion to their use of the interstate highways and highway infrastructure and uses the revenues to build and maintain that infrastructure to the extent that charges approximate individual benefits received the tax would be efficient and equitable21 such taxes however are less precise instruments than tolls and other benefit charges because 1 they do not actually charge users for the marginal cost of us ing the infrastructure including pavement costs congestion costs and environmental costs and 2 some of the highway trust fund revenues currently the revenues fro m 286 of the tax are allocated for mass transit which means that motorists are paying to subsidize users of mass transit it is true that all motorists benefit fro m reduced conges tion but the most efficient way of addressing this probl em is to price the use of the roads to account specifically for the congestion externalityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs14 taxes vs tax subsidies incentives when the externalities or spillover effects are positive ie when market transaction or activity confer s unpriced benefits on third parties the market system would under supply the commodity or activity the classic case of positive externalities is research and development rd that leads to technological innovations an individual firm that unde rtakes rd activities obviously incurs the cost of these efforts and activities but it typically does not obtain the entire return some of which accrues to other firms free riders that do not undertake these expenditures energy rd engenders s imilar spillover effects whether it is from research in cleancoal technologies photovo ltaic solar systems electric cars fuel cells or energy efficiency technologies the manufacturer of building equipment and energyusing technologies may not have adequate incentives to support sufficient levels of research to improve building or equipment efficiency because some of the gains may accrue to firms not undertaking the expenditures in cases of positive externalities the social return exceeds the purely private returns to individual companies and from an economic perspective subsidy is warranted to bring the marginal costs of production in balance with the marginal social benefit private benef its external benefits at th margin such support has produced major innovations in the energy efficiency of various energy using equipment such as heat pumps and resulted in significant reductions in the price of generating alternative energy such as photovo ltaic solar energy such is the rationale for the present tax subsidies for such tec hnologies the tax credit and expensing treatment of rd expenditures as well as government expenditures for energy rd the amount of the subsidy on the product or activity would be the value of the benefits per unit of the commodity tr aded proportional to the spillover conferred on the source of the external bene fits energy rd is unlikely however to require differential subsidy above and beyond that provided for nonenergy rd since there is priori reason to believe that the external benefits from energy rd are higher or lower than for nonenergy rd energy tax subsidies as an industrial policy many of the incentives or subsidies that are proposed for oil and gas as well as for alternative fuels appear to be base d on the supposition that government ought to support business particular ly when times are bad such for example was the rationale for numerous proposals to help the domestic oil industry particularly small producers that were harmed by the downwar d trend in crude oil prices since the mid 1980s and the sharp drop in those prices during 199899 the low prices of 199899 fostered pr oposals for economic relief through the tax code for the particularly small independent drillers and producers which were the harbingers of current comprehensive energy bills the 199899 proposals mainly focused on production tax credits for marginal or stripper oil which were later included in the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 enacted on october 22 2004 also referred to as the j

incentives the economic justification for tax subsidies as an industrial policy there is purely economic jus tification either on efficiency or stabilization grounds for using tax subsidies as an industrial or employment policy to help distressed industry including the conventional fossil fuels industry and the alternative fuels industr an industrial policy is usually the context for government subsidies to businesses whenev er those businesses experience sustained or sharp economic hardships due genera lly to any cause but targeted toward industries experiencing declining prices suffering costprice squeezes or competition from foreign firms economic theory does recognize that market failures such as barriers to entry into markets and other failures that i nhibit market compe tition may be used to justify government intervention interventi on may also be justif ied by externalities or spillovers previously discussed the us and world crude oil markets are certainly not perfectly competitive as there are elements of market power particularly in the world oil market which is significantly affected by the opec but these markets are certainly more competitive today then they have ever been it does not appear that the imperfections may be exhib ited by either the us or world crude oil markets that they would justify tax s ubsidies to oil and gas producers on grounds of economic efficiency depressed or volatile oil prices or any other price are not market failures an industrial policy is an inefficient way to stimulate aggregate employment the social rate of discount and market failures some have argued that the competitive freemarket system may establish interest rates or private di scount rates that are too hi gh which may lead producers to discount the future excessively and ther efore deplete energy and other minerals too rapidly rapid depletion in creases environmental damages for the current generation and reduces economic living standards real income for future generations who would have lower capital stock in general economic theory and empi rical evidence refute the proposition that competitive markets lead to excessive exploitation of mineral resources capital markets are also believed to function fairly close to competition and there is market failure that results in interest rates higher than the competitive rates even if the argument were true however it would at the very least suggest policies to lower interest rates elimin ation of all federal tax subsidies for nonrenewable resources and the imposition of federal

pollution w ould contribute significantly to energy conservation by raising energy prices and reducing the demand for energy thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs16 22 technical change and recycling can offset the depletion effect of resource exhaustion 23 energy efficiency an engineering concept or measure that has little in common with economic efficiency basically measures th energyoutput ratio the amount of energy input required to generate one unit of output for example the average thermal efficiency of coalfired steam generators is about 34 which means that it takes an average of 100 btus of fuel to generate an average of 34 bt us of electricity 64 of the energy from the fuel is lost or wasteddemand for energy would decline both th rough direct demand response ie curbing energy use through reductions in output service or utility levels eg by reducing the number of miles dr iven indoor temperatures during winter by turning down the thermostat etc and through substitution of more energyefficient for less energyefficient technologies this would be true for all energy that generates external costs but is particularly true for fossil fuels whose external costs are generally greater than for other energy types however energy taxes to encourag conservation should be unnecessary on economic grounds because over the longer rm as depletion gradually diminishes the stock of exhaustible energy resources such as petroleum conventional energy prices would be expected to increase in r eal terms all else such as technological advancements and innovations and the degr ee of recycling remaining the same22 as result more of the energy efficien t technologies would become profitable and investment in energyefficient technol ogies would increase for example more energy efficient housing automobiles with higher miles per gallon and more energy efficient industrial equipment such as boilers23 thus aside from energy taxes or subsid ies to correct for energy production and consumption externalities and aside from possible user charges economists generally argue there is economic justification for additional taxes or tax subsidies to encourage greater energy conservation or energy efficiency th is is because there is generally market failure in energy use notwithstanding the environmental externalities discu ssed above or the exceptions disc ussed below or in investment in energyusing technologies at eith er the household or business level that requires such tax subsidies just as the competitive market system corrected for externalities automatically and efficiently leads to the optimal production and use of energy resources it also leads to th optimal amount of investment in energy efficiency technologies all this is done w ithout the effect of subsidies in terms of revenue losses and allocati onal distortions which reduce aggregate output and the general welfare there are four market failures in energy use however that may be an economic justification for government intervention but only one is rationale for certain types of conservation tax subsidies in rental housing the tenant and the landlord lack strong financial incentives to invest in energy conservation quipment and materials even when the benefits clearly outweigh the costs because the benefits from such conservation may not entirely accrue to the party undertaking the energysaving expenditure and effort builders and buyers may also lack sufficient information problem which is also discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs17 as general rule tenants are not going to improve the energy efficiency of residence that does not belong to them even if the unit is metered they might if the rate of return or payback is sufficiently large but most tenants do not occupy rental housing long enough to reap the full benefits of the energy conservation investments part of the problem is also that it is not always easy to calculate the energy savings potential hence rates of return from various retrofitting investments landlords may not be able to control the energy c onsumption habits of renters to sufficiently recover the full cost of the energy conser vation expenditures re gardless of whether the units are individually metered or not if the units are individually metered then the landlord would not undertake such inves tments since all the benefits therefrom would accrue to the renters unless landlord could charge higher rents on apartments with lower utility costs if the units are not individually metered but under centralized control the benefits of conservation measures may accrue largely to the landlord but even here the tenants may have sufficient control over energy use to subvert the accrual of any gains to the landlord in such cases from the landlords perspective it may be easier and cheaper to forego the conservation investments and simply pass on energy costs as part of th rents individual metering can be quite costly and while it may reduce some of the distortions it is not likely to completely eliminate these because even if the landlor d can charge higher rents he may not be able to recover the costs of energy conservation efforts or investments these market failures may lead to under investment in conservation measures in rental housing and provide the econo mic rationale for in ternal revenue code irc 136 which allows the value of any energy conservation subsidy provided by electric utilities to households to be ex cluded from gross income without such explicit exclusion such subsidies would be treated as gross income and subject to tax this exclusion however applies to both owneroccupied and rental housing and to limited extent to business conservation subsidies there are other types of market failures in energy use that may suggest either minimum efficiency standards or governme ntprovided information such as energy efficiency labels as suggested above many homeowners may not know the precise payback or rate of return of particular energyefficiency enhancing investment or may not know how to calculate it this ma be particularly serious problem for older homes which are less energy efficient then newer models those built since the energy crisis of the 1970s this ma rket failure problem suggests government provided information as solution how ever rather than tax subsidies third energy market failure arises out of asymmetric information between energy consumers and manufacturers of energy efficient equipment the energy consumer may have little incentive to b ecome fully informed about the energy efficiency of particular energyusing or saving item while the producer who has complete and accurate information doesnt have the incentive to produce higher priced and more energy efficient product si nce it is might be more difficult to market and sell such product thus while pa rticular energysaving device may have high rate of return the market may not provide it this problem suggests either government mandated efficiency standards or labeling as is currently being done with appliance energy labels and fuel economy labels httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs18 24 levelized costs converts series of nonuniform costs over time into an average annual cost over that time period

capital markets are gene rally competitive and efficient low income consumers may have difficulty acquiring loans fo r conservation investments even when such investments are profit able the present value of the energy expenditure savings is greater than the capital costs this suggests that low or zero interest rate loans for low income consumers or even weatherization grants could address the problem renewable vs conventional fuels the higher energy prices that would result from taxes imposed on conventional energy to address external costs would also lead to more investment to increase the supply of alternative fuels which would in time lead to even more conservation of reduced demand for conventional fuels over the longer term the supply of these alternatives would tend to increase as deple tion of conventional energy raises its real price even without increases in conventi onal fuel prices alternative energy could gain price advantage through future technological advances as in the case of energy conservati on there are externalities or market failures that cause underinvestment in lternative energy technologies and under supply of alternative fuels the privat market system works effectively and efficiently in developing any form of energy and its technologies if there are sufficient profit incentives ie if the rate of return on such inve stments is above the opportunity cost of capital moreover the market ensures that the leastcost most efficient alternatives become commercializ ed first and the market adjusts quickly and efficiently to the changing dynamics of the marketplace in general in cases where alternative fuels have difficulty penetrating the market it is because they ca nnot be co mpetitively priced relative to conventional fuels generally because either oil prices ar too low capital costs of alternative fuels technologies are too high or both to illustrate compare the estimated 30year levelized costs per unit of electrical output and the capital costs of various technologies for producing electricity usin g conventional fuels primarily coal but also natural gas and alternative fuels such as biomass and wind energy systems24 electric

these are substantially lower than some estimates of the costkwh of the following energy alternatives 150 for photovoltaics 510 for small hydroelectric 68 for solar thermal power 47 for wind power and

by salvatore lazzarivolatile oil prices can increase investor risk and inhibit the development of alternative renewable solar wind etc and unconventional resources this is because oil is the benchmark energy resource that sets the longterm price and therefore influences the profitability of all other fuels hypothetically if alternative fuels would be profitable at oil prices of 40 per barrel but prices fluctuate between 20 per barrel and 60 per barrel there will generally be less investment in renewable and unconventional resources than if the price were stable at 40 every year however as discussed before tax subsidies for alternative fuels are costly and inefficient policy to correct for such risks does oil and gas have competitive advantage it is sometimes argued that alternative fuels such as solar and wind energy and other renewables are at competitive disadvantage visavis fossil fuels because of the production tax subsidies expensin g percentage depl etion and others bestowed on the oil and gas industry ov er decades and that this justifies countervailing subsidies to alte rnative fuels to level the playing field historically the large tax subsidies for oil and gas which totaled tens of billions of dollars to date helped keep domestic and world oil prices low encouraged consumption and discouraged the development of alternatives fuels pa st subsidies however do not determine the economic viab ility of altern ative fuels at the present time past subsidies do not significantly affect the current competitive structure of the energy market as to the current oil and gas tax subsidies there are two reasons that these subsidies are unlikely to reduce the competitiveness of alternative fuels first current oil and gas tax subsidies are smaller than they have been historically indeed some evidence suggests that current oil and gas tax subsidies are smaller in relationship to industry size than the tax subsidies for alternative fuels26 second and more importantly the structure of the world cr ude oil market since the 1970s has changed in fundamental but critical way crude oil prices have since the 1970s been determined in world oil market market which has become more competitive and in which us domestic producers are price ta kers in such market the subsidies for oil and gas have little if any effect on the market price of crude oil hence little if any effect on the competitiveness of alternative fuels energy taxes to increase revenues and reduce deficits energy taxes have also been proposed fo r primarily fiscal reasons to generate revenues for deficit re duction the first federal gaso line tax was enacted in 1932 at 1gal for gasoline and 2 for diesel fuel as way of cushioning federal deficitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs20 27 some label the environmental gains and the efficiency gains from green taxes as the double dividend but it is really the same effect 28 revenue estimates run at about 1 ton of co2 at least for relatively small taxes per ton see us congressional budget office reducing the deficit spending and revenue options march 1997 p 392 and us congressional budget office carbon charges as continuedwhich were mounting with the great depr ession energy tax proposals for deficit reduction were commonplace during th 19821993 period as budget deficits mounted due to huge tax cuts under the economic recovery ta x act of 1981 pl 9734 and the nation experienced reduced inflation economic recession defense buildups and the federal inability to contro l spending several energy taxes were proposed at that time an increase in the excise taxes on gasoline diesel and other motor fuels sizeable tax on imported oil in addition to the customs duties that are already imposed on imported petroleum tax on both imported and domestically produced crude oil and broadlybased or general energy tax on all or most types of energy consumption either based on the heat content of the fuel btu tax the carbon content of the fuel the carbon tax or on the sales price the ad valorem energy tax eventually only the tax on gasoline and other motor fuels was increased by 5 in 1982 5 in 1990 and by 43 in 1993 as general economic principle there is distinct fiscal rati onale for federal energy tax as source of general fund fina ncing of federal activities or for deficit reduction economic principles suggest fede ral programs ought to be financed by general income or general consumption taxes such taxes however while less distortive and more equitable than energy taxes and other selective excise taxes or differential commodity taxes are also distortional income taxes for instance distort the choice between work and leisure by raising the price of work relative to the price of leisure which tends to increase leisure and reduce work income taxes also distort the choice between consuming and saving for the future by raising the price of consuming in the future ie saving if an efficiency enhancing tax such as an externality correcting energy tax could be substituted for distortional tax in revenue neutral way not only would there be budgetary effect but there would be gain in efficiency eg reduction in pollution to the environment27 in some cases the revenue gain hence the possible efficiency gain could be subs tantial for example 30ton tax on carbon emissions which would roughly st abilize carbon emissi ons at their 2000 levels would generate bout 40 billion annually 100 pe r ton tax could generate as much as 100 billion annually28 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs21 28 continued response to global warming th effects of taxing fossil fuels august 1990 p 21another example is the gasoline tax cu rrently the burden of the gasoline tax is largely offset or counterbalanced by the benefits received from highways and infrastructure financed from the tax this means that under current law and indeed since the inception of the gasoline tax there has never been tax on gasoline that accounts for the external costs of driving the environmental costs of oil production and refining the environmental costs from tailpipe emissions the costs of oil import dependence and the road congestion policy to impose tax on gasoline as substitute for distorting income tax would not only make drivers pay for the external costs of driving it would re duce income tax distortions and enhance economic efficiency moreover higher ga soline prices would promote petroleum conservation reduce air pollution and carbon emissions substantially and would promote the development of alternative fuel s without large cost in terms of reduced revenues from subsidization to the fede ral budgetary however gasoline taxes of this magnitude could be unl ess phasedin gradually significant shock to the economy energy taxes vs regulation to achieve environmental policy goals energy taxes and subsidies when used to correct for externalities and other market failures offer an efficient altern ative or supplement to regulations as an instrument of environmental policy regulations prescrib the type of technology or equipment for environmental protection the maximum permitted rate of emission for particular pollutant or minimum energye fficiency standard and are part of the commandandcontrol appro ach to environmental protection regulations such as standards give policymak ers more assurance that environmental policy goals will be achieved regardless of cost but are often more costly and less economically efficient than taxes or tradeable emissions permits to illustrate the fundamental reason why standard would be economically less efficient than the tax consider regulation that prescribes that electric utility generators must be at least 45 energyeffi cient as way of conserving energy and reducing power plant emissions that is every fossilfuelfired generator in use would have to have an efficiency rate of 45 in response to the standard and given current economics of alternative generation strategies most utilities would invest in the advanced combinedcycle natural gas system accng which is the cheapest and most energy efficient technology w ith an efficiency rate close to 50 subjecting all firms to the same regulatory standard essentially ensures the same behavioral response regardless of differences in the marginal costs of reducing air emissions but while the accng system is the leastcostly technology among those feasible technologies that m eet the 45 energy efficiency standard it may not be the leastcost energy conservation or air pollution control strategy for every single utility in every single plant every single generating unit and for each of the various types of emissions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs22 intuition suggests and many studies have confirmed that the marginal costs of pollution control marginal abatement costs vary for each type of pollutant and with the type of technology that utilities use with the regulation as described account would be taken of the differences among utilities plants and generating units in their capacity to reduce emissions yet because of differences in site characteristics design and utilization rate current generating units differ significantly with respect to the difficulty or ease and the cost of reducing emissions as result those firms with the greater pollution abatement costs would have to undert ake the same level of abatement as those with lower marginal abatement costs because of these cost differences there are many different strategies and options that utilities might use to reduce exhaust emissions from power plants for example some utilities might just reduce output others might invest in pollution control equipment and still others might repl ace their coalfired units with advanced technologies if there are enough diffe rences among utilities and their marginal abatement costs then the total costs of reducing emissions with the regulatory standard would be greater less efficient than any of the marketbased approaches in contrast tax would provide the incentive for each polluter to reduce pollution in the least costly way up to the point at which the tax just equals the marginal abatement costs in the bove illustration the utility with the lower marginal abatement costs of reducing pollution would undertake more pollution abatement than the utility with higher marginal abatement costs in that way the total cost of abatement would be minimized tax revenues could be used to compensate the parties that are harmed by the emissions the total costs of emissions control from utilities would be much lower if utilities were permitted to use various technologies and control options that are the least cost for that particular utility that particular plant and that particular generating unit to address different emissions which is how tax would work by using tax instead of standard all those anti pollution activities that cost less than th tax will in theory be undertaken taxes or tradeable emissions permits an alternative marketbased appro ach for environmental protection an efficient alternative to emissions taxes or their practical equivalent energy taxes is the tradeable emission permit or allowance also known as pollution rights capandtrade or marketable polluti on permits under this approach the government the congress and the envir onmental authorities requires each emitter of particular pollutant to have legal permit to emit fixed amount of that pollutant the authorities establish target level for aggregate emissions of particular pollutant say so many hundreds of thousand of tons per year and the pollution equivalence of the tradeable pe rmits one permit equals one ton of x pollutant it also allows these permits to be traded in the marketplace among source emitters or among anyone who can either buy and use them if the costs of permit are less than the marginal abatement costs save them for future use if they expect marginal abatement costs to rise above the cost of each permit or sell them if their marginal abatement costs per ton are less than the price of permit the idea underlying this approach is that it achie ves any given level of pollution at lower costs and is thus economically efficient those firms with relatively low marginal abatement costs will choose abatement over permits those with relatively highhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs23 29 see david w pearce and r kerry turner economics of natural resources and the

association vol 48 september 1998 pp 829837 abatement costs will choose to purchase per mits rather than control pollution the aggregate level of pollution is fixed however while in theory allowances are equivalent to an emissions tax and thus also more efficient than standards in practice there are differences that may make tradeable permits generally more appealing to the policymaker in certain situations while the emissions tax approach is more appealing in others29 first tradeable permits fix the level of aggregate pollution and let the price adjust whereas the tax fixes the price the statutory tax rate per unit and lets the quantity of pollutant or its equivalent amount of energy adjust thus tradeable permits appear to give the authorities greater certainty of control over the level of po llution and therefore control over air and water quality tradable permits are considered by many superior instrument when pollution is reaching some critical level and the government needs to control the quantity of the emissions another advantage of tradeable permits is that they avoid the information problem associated with emissions taxes which would require aut horities to know both the marginal external costs the monetary value of the damages and the marginal abatement costs per unit of pollution this information none of wh ich is required with tradeable permits is difficult and costly to estimate and in some cases not available at all none of this is required with tradeable permits finally taxes may be eroded by inflation and affected by the entry and exit of firms this is not problem for tradeable permits under tradeable permit system the authorities must establish system for monitoring the emissions of the polluter this is relatively simple when the number of polluters is relatively small in relationship to the magnitude of the emissions which is the case with so2 emitted by electric utilities as the number of polluters increases the complexity of emissions monitoring and program administration increases exponentially which raises the tr ansactions costs of the permit system to such levels that it would longer make tradeable permits efficient such is the case with co2 emissions which have millions of sources in such case an emissions tax is more appealing the economic efficiency advantages of marketbased approaches to environmental protection are suggested by the documented evidence on the success of the tradeable permit system mandate d by title iv of th clean air act in controlling emissions of sulfur dioxide so2 by electric

ot her force or factor that inhibits competition might generate substantial economic rents particularly for lowcost producers for example clearly saudi arabia and other persian gulf producers earn substantial economic rents from their oil production as it costs only few dollars per barrel average pr oduction costs of saudi oil have been estimated at about 150ba rrel to produce oil however us oil producers are basically the high cost or marginal producers from the perspective of the world crude oil market and do not generally earn such high rents in any event as noted before the world

subsidies can affect energy prices and output economic growth rates inco distribution and international trade thus they can be very powerful ergy and economic policy instrument efficiency effects as was discussed above energy taxes nd subsidies can be useful instrument to correct for preexisting distortions in the allocation of resources and simultaneously generate tax revenues if they are imposed on activities or commodities such as energy resources w hose production and use generate external costs or if they are imposed as user fees for the services of public good otherwise selective energy excise taxes for either greater production improved technical energy efficiency or increased supply of altern ative fuels reduce the efficiency of the economy reduced efficiency implies redu ced output and lower standards of living distributional effects with respect to energy taxes on supply th ere is generally parate equity case that can be made for taxing energy at higher rate than other commodities due to nonrenewable resources finite stock economic rents also called s carcity rents are created when these resources are produced under competitive conditions such rents would be expected to rise at the rate of interest so as to achieve asset or capital market equilibrium such rents are not excessive under competitive supply and need not be taxed away on equity grounds32 energy taxes on consumers eg gasoline taxes oil taxes or general energy taxes also frequently have negative distributional consequences because the incidence of ch taxes often falls disproportionately on lower incomes finally energy tax s ubsidies frequently so have adverse distributional effects one example there are others is the income tax credithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30406crs25 the 29 tax credit for nonconventiona l energy resources which in add ition to distorting resource allocation losing ta x revenues and not reducing oil import dependence since it has basically increased the supply of methane gas rather than alternatives to petroleum is also stionable on tax equity grounds supporters of the credit contend that it encourages dom estic energy production however and could become more important in the future they also note that domestic methane resulting from the credits helps offset the growing us need for natural gas imports macroeconomic effects increases in energy taxes are basically contractionary fiscal policy that would tend to reduce aggregate output and empl oyment and produce temporary increase in the rate of inflation bove the baseline increases in taxes
