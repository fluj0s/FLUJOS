in life sciences domestic social policy division food safety federal and state response to the spinach coli outbreak summary in september 2006 the food and drug administration fda and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc began receiving reports on clusters of patients in various states confirmed to have coli infections by early october 199 people in 26 states had become ill 102 had been hospitalized 31 had developed hemolytic uremic syndrome hus type of kidney failure and three had died escherichia coli o157h7 coli is bacterium found in animal feces that causes diarrhea and abdominal cramps within days of exposure an infection can lead to hus and in some cases death public health laboratories perform type of dna fingerprinting to determine whether sample taken from patient matches those taken from other patients and contaminated food during an outbreak the time from exposure to confirmation of an coli infection can take two to three weeks as the number of infections increased an investigation that included fda cdc and state and local public health officials was launched starting on september 14 and continuing into early october fda and cdc released nearly daily statements on the status of the investigation alerting the public to the number of cases states with confirmed cases spinach product recalls agency actions and consumer advice on consumption of spinach products investigators were able to trace the outbreak back to several farm fields in the salinas valley of california while the investigation continues there is evidence that nearby livestock feral pigs or other environmental sources may have contaminated one or more of the fields since the outbreak fda has advised growers of fresh produce that they need to develop and implement voluntary guidelines to prevent outbreaks of foodborne diseases fda has also announced that it will convene public meeting on the issue once the investigation is complete several growers groups have called for their industry to use the best agricultural and processing practices to prevent such outbreaks not least because losses to the industry from the spinach outbreak have been estimated at 100 million in october 2006 the house committee on energy and commerce asked fda to explain its role in detecting contaminated food particularly in the recent tainted spinach case the request sought details about the agencys food safety procedures used in emergency situations both proponents and opponents of the national uniformity for food act s 3128 hr 4167 have weighed in on how it would have affected the coli outbreak opponents believe that states ability to act would have been compromised while proponents claim that the legislation would not have affected state adulteration or inspection authorities legislators may address the recent coli outbreak during reauthorization of the farm bill in the 110th congress when the proposal for single food safety agency with increased powers may be considered contents introduction 1 background 1 the process of coli case confirmation 1 the systems used to monitor foodborne illnesses 2 timeline of cases recalls and agency actions 3

coli outbreak introduction in september 2006 government officials were alerted to an outbreak of coli o157h7 infections associated with the consumption of tainted fresh spinach for several weeks the food and drug administration fda and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc investigated the situation as additional cases were identified nearly daily this report details the events as they unfolded and includes the number of cases the detection of the first case and the process by which relevant agencies acted as subsequent cases were reported this report will be updated in response to any further developments background the public first became aware of new deadly strain of coli in 1982 during an outbreak associated with ground beef escherichia coli is bacterium normally found in the intestines of humans and animals most strains of coli are harmless several strains including serotype o157h7 may cause serious illness in humans though they are frequently found in livestock feces particularly in cattle manure in humans infection with coli o157h7 can cause diarrhea that is often bloody and accompanied by abdominal cramps fever may occur symptoms usually develop in two to four days but may emerge as quickly as day or up to week after exposure healthy adults can generally recover completely from infection within week some individuals however especially young children and the elderly can develop hemolytic uremic syndrome hus as result of infection hus can lead to serious kidney damage and even death in terms of treatment antibiotics are not indicated and may be harmful due to the severity of illness treatment of these infections often requires hospitalization patients who experience kidney failure may need dialysis for the remainder of this report coli will refer to the coli o157h7 strain implicated in the spinach outbreak the process of coli case confirmation the cases of coli linked to spinach consumption as discussed in this report are confirmed meaning that victims have been shown by laboratory analysis of specimens to be infected with the organism there are number of reasons why confirmation may not occur for all victims of an outbreak though for serious illnesses such as coli the proportion of cases that are investigated with laboratory testing is generally higher than with milder foodborne illness the time from the beginning of patients illness to confirmation of whether the patient is part of an crs2 outbreak typically takes from two to three weeks in the case of the coli outbreak in spinach the average time for confirmation of cases was about 15 days1 in most cases of coli infection public health laboratories in states and some cities perform type of dna fingerprinting on coli samples investigators determine whether the dna fingerprinting pattern of the bacterium from one patient is the same as that from other infected patients and from contaminated food bacteria with the same dna fingerprint are likely to have come from the same source series of steps takes place between the point when patient is infected and the point when public health officials can confirm whether the patient is part of an coli outbreak as result there is generally two to threeweek delay between the start of the illness and confirmation of the patients connection to the outbreak this series breaks down as follows in the case of coli an incubation period from the time of eating contaminated food to the beginning of the first symptoms is typically two to four days the time from the first symptom until the person seeks medical care when diarrhea sample is collected for testing is generally one to five days the process of laboratory diagnosis which begins when patient provides sample and coli is subsequently obtained from the sample usually takes one to three days the time required to ship coli bacteria from laboratory to state public health authorities who will perform dna fingerprinting may take up to week depending on the transportation system within state and the distance between clinical laboratory and public health department the time required for state public health officials to perform dna fingerprinting on an coli sample and compare it with an outbreak pattern is ideally one day however with limited staff and space in public health laboratories during period when other emergencies may occur the process can take up to four days state health departments typically report laboratoryconfirmed cases of foodborne illness to cdc on regular basis during serious interstate outbreaks such as the coli outbreak linked to spinach state health departments would typically notify cdc of newly confirmed cases on daily basis to facilitate swift nationwide investigation in general disease reporting by states to cdc is voluntary but it may be required as condition of federal funding for certain state public health systems such as the pulsenet system described below the systems used to monitor foodborne illnesses the tracking and reporting of foodborne illnesses are conducted in several ways pulsenet is national network of public health and food laboratories coordinated by the cdc the network consists of labs in state and local health departments and federal agencies cdc fda and the us department of agriculture or usda pulsenet experts perform standardized dna fingerprinting of

these systems have been used in the investigation of the recent coli outbreak timeline of cases recalls and agency actions3 federal and state tracking and investigation september 8 2006 according to fda and cdc reports the agencies were first alerted on september 8 to four cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome hus in call from wisconsins state epidemiologist cdc began an investigation working collaboratively with state health departments and fda to detect infections identify the cause of the infections and provide information to the public and health care providers on the treatment and prevention of coli o157h7 infections september 12 2006 on september 12 the pulsenet system confirmed that the coli o157h7 strains from the patients in wisconsin all had the same dna fingerprint pattern and also identified the same pattern in some coli patients from other states september 13 2006 by september 13 cdc officials were alerted by epidemiologists in wisconsin and oregon that fresh spinach was the suspected source of small clusters of coli cases the same day wisconsin and oregon epidemiologists were contacted by new mexico epidemiologists about cluster of 2 cdc pulsenet home page at httpwwwcdcgovpulsenetindexhtm 3 the data in this section were taken from the daily alerts issued by fda and cdc available at the following sites httpwwwfdagovocopacomhottopicsspinachhtml and httpwwwcdcgovfoodborneecolispinach crs4 coli infections that had also been associated with fresh spinach consumption at this point the association of illness with spinach consumption was based only on epidemiologic evidence the common finding among victims who were interviewed of history of recent spinach consumption september 14 2006 fda and cdc issued the first of nearly three weeks of daily consumer alerts about an coli outbreak in several states that was believed to be associated with the consumption of fresh produce at the time preliminary epidemiological evidence pointed to bagged fresh spinach as the possible cause of the outbreak fda advised consumers to avoid consuming bagged spinach it is notable that this productwide advisory was made based solely on epidemiologic evidence since at this point the outbreak organism had not yet been identified in any spinach products the agencies advised individuals who believed that they had experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach to contact their physicians and physicians were urged to report suspected cases of coli infection to local and state public health officials as soon as possible the federal agencies reported that they were working with state and local agencies to determine the cause and scope of the outbreak eight states had reported illnesses connecticut idaho indiana michigan oregon new mexico utah and wisconsin total of 50 infected individuals had been identified among them were eight cases of hus one death and multiple hospitalizations the date range of infection was estimated to be from august 25 to september 3 2006 september 15 2006 on september 15 fda and cdc issued announcements that the outbreak of coli in multiple states had been associated with the consumption of fresh spinach and fresh spinachcontaining products the statements indicated that natural selection foods llc of san juan bautista california had launched voluntary recall of products that contained spinach marked with best if used by dates of august 17 through october 1 2006 fda does not have authority to mandate recalls of most of the foods it regulates including fresh produce fda reported that it was investigating whether eight other companies and their brands were involved the products under investigation and subject to an expanded consumer advisory included spinach and any salad blend containing spinach intended for retail or food service restaurant and institutional use cdc also noted that 94 cases of illness had been reported and that 29 people 31 had been hospitalized 14 15 had developed hus and one had died by this point california kentucky maine minnesota nevada new york ohio pennsylvania tennessee virginia washington and wyoming had also reported human infections to cdc bringing the total number of affected states to 20 spinach from presumptively affected lots was also reported to have been distributed in canada and mexico the agencies also indicated that they or state officials were testing available packages of spinach consumed by victims of coli infection september 16 2006 on september 16 cdc reported that 102 cases of illness due to coli infection had been confirmed and that 52 people 51 had been hospitalized 16 16 had developed hus and one had died tennessee was removed from the list of states that had confirmed cases because case originally crs5 attributed to the state had actually occurred in kentucky fda advised consumers to avoid fresh bagged spinach and issued company recall information fda also announced that it was expanding its lettuce safety initiative to cover spinach in response to repeated coli outbreaks associated with fresh lettuce the agency had advised growers in november 2005 of its concerns about the safety of fresh greens and the need for continued efforts to assure good agricultural and processing practices within the industry4 the california department of health services had expressed similar concerns in letter to california growers in january 20065 september 17 2006 on september 17 cdc reported that 109 cases of coli infection had been confirmed and that 55 people 50 had been hospitalized 16 15 had developed

from natural selection foods the fdas report listed all river ranch and natural selection brands september 18 2006 on september 18 cdc reported that 114 cases of coli had been confirmed and that 60 people 53 had been hospitalized 18 16 had developed hus and one had died cdc added illinois and nebraska to the list of states with confirmed cases bringing the total to 21 the rest of the information reported by cdc and fda which was repeated in subsequent notices was the same as on previous days consumer advice symptoms of illness the two recalls the lettuce safety initiative and the ongoing investigation september 19 2006 on september 19 cdc reported that the number of coli cases reported had risen to 131 and that 66 people 50 had been hospitalized 20 15 had developed hus and one had died fda stated that products containing tainted spinach had been distributed to taiwan as well as to canada and mexico as noted above but that illnesses had been reported by those countries september 20 2006 on september 20 cdc reported that the number of reported cases had increased to 146 and that 76 people 52 had been hospitalized 23 16 had developed hus and one had died arizona and colorado had been added to the list of states with confirmed cases bringing the total to 23 fda expanded its consumer alert to include fresh spinach in bagged products spinach in clamshell and spinach from farmers markets the agency also indicated that it had found evidence that spinach that was frozen canned or an ingredient in pre made meals manufactured by food companies was tainted fda reported

september 20 2006 the agencies alerts also noted that the new mexico department of health had announced that through dna fingerprinting it had matched strain of coli from victims package of spinach with the outbreak strain taken from infected patients this marked the first laboratory confirmation of the link between spinach consumption and coli infections september 21 2006 on september 21 cdc announced that 157 cases of coli illness had been reported and that 83 people 52 had been hospitalized 27 17 had developed hus and one had died fda reported that it was working closely with the state of california since it had been determined that the contaminated spinach had come from fields in the california counties of monterey san benito and santa clara fda alerts reassured consumers that processed spinach frozen and canned and other produce from those counties were not implicated in the outbreak the same day cdc held clinicians outreach and communication activity coca conference call with 800 people who heard experts provide an overview of the current outbreak and fdas investigation the nature of coli as pathogen and treatment options for patients exhibiting symptoms of the infection september 22 2006 on september 22 cdc indicated that 166 cases of illness had been reported and that 88 people 53 had been hospitalized 27 16 had developed hus and one had died maryland and tennessee were added to the list of states with confirmed cases bringing the total to 25 fda reported working closely with the state of california in the three counties in which the tainted spinach may have been grown investigators were attempting to narrow the geographic area suspected of being the source of the outbreak fda repeated the consumer notice that processed spinach spinach grown elsewhere in the united states and other produce grown in the three implicated counties were safe to eat and that the food industry was working to get fresh spinach back on the market september 23 2006 on september 23 cdc announced that 171 cases of coli infection had been reported and that 92 people 54 had been hospitalized 27 16 had developed hus and one had died in addition fda reported two more voluntary recalls for products containing spinach supplied from natural selection foods of california triple b corporation doing business as st produce of seattle washington recalled its fresh

people 52 had been hospitalized 29 16 had developed hus and one had died september 29 2006 on september 29 fda announced that it had determined that spinach implicated in the coli outbreak had been traced to natural selection foods llc of san juan bautista california the determination was based on epidemiologic and laboratory evidence obtained from multiple states colorado ohio wisconsin nevada pennsylvania utah new mexico and illinois and analyzed by cdc and on product distribution information one company had recalled its product on september 15 and four others had instituted secondary recalls because they received the recalled product from natural selection foods the statement indicated that fda the state of california cdc and the us department of agriculture usda were continuing to investigate the cause of the outbreak through ongoing inspections and sample collections at facilities in the environment including irrigation water sources and through studies of local animal management and water use the fda update indicated that the grower shipper association of central california the produce marketing association the united fresh produce association and the western growers association had agreed to develop voluntary plan to improve the safety of fresh produce fda and the state of california however have not ruled out the possibility of instituting regulatory requirements in the future in addition fda intends to convene public meeting later in the year to address the larger issue of foodborne illnesses linked to leafy greens once the current investigation is complete crs8 october 3 2006 on october 3 cdc reported 192 cases of illness and that 98 people 51 had been hospitalized 30 16 had developed hus and one died october 5 2006 on october 5 fda announced that the us attorney for the northern district of california had issued statement on the execution of two search warrants for growers express in salinas and natural selection foods in san bautista california in connection with the outbreak of coli o157h7 that fda had traced to spinach grown in the salinas area the us attorney stated that there was indication at that time that leaf spinach had been deliberately or intentionally contaminated fda stated that it was working with the us attorneys office and the federal bureau of investigation fbi to determine the facts behind the outbreak particularly allegations that certain spinach growers and distributors may have failed to take all necessary precautions to ensure that their spinach was safe before it was placed in interstate commerce the number of reported cases of illness had not changed october 6 2006 on october 6 cdc announced that the number of reported cases had increased to 199 see figure 1 below 102 people 51 had been hospitalized and 31 16 had developed hus on this date cdc also announced that total of three people had died in the outbreak the single case announced earlier an elderly woman in wisconsin and two more victims with coli infections that matched the outbreak strain on dna fingerprinting child in idaho and an elderly woman in nebraska cdc also reported fourth suspicious death in an elderly woman in maryland but samples to confirm infection by dna fingerprinting were not available the two confirmed deaths announced on this date had occurred in september but required additional time to link to the outbreak by dna fingerprinting cdc reported additional findings as follows of the individuals affected by the outbreak 141 71 were female and 22 11 were children under the age of five the proportions of individuals in each age group who developed hus included 29 of children under age 18 8 of those aged 18 to 59 and 14 of those who were 60 years or older the cases were spread

september 15 kenter canyon farms inc of sun valley california had instituted voluntary recall of repackaged spinach as part of the nationwide recall of natural selection foods the recalled product was only distributed in california and carried an expiration date of september 20 2006 crs9 october 12 2006 on october 12 fda and the state of california announced test results from the field investigation of the outbreak of coli o157h7 in spinach samples of cattle feces taken from one of the four implicated ranches tested positive based on matching dna fingerprints for the same strain that sickened 199 individuals the announcement stated that while this finding was significant it was just one aspect of the traceback investigation that was ongoing for fda the state of california cdc and usda as of november 8 2006 this alert was the agencies most recent readers should note that later news reports6 have indicated that there were total of 204 confirmed cases but this number had not

the outbreak on october 22 2006 statement issued by the united fresh produce association indicated that it understood that fda had eliminated all concerns about spinach grown anywhere outside of the three counties in california7 the group indicated its commitment to determining the specific source of the contamination and working to prevent future outbreaks including the use of the best agricultural practices in the field and the strongest possible hazard analysis and critical control points haccp programs in processing facilities the center for science in the public interest cspi petitioned the state of california to adopt stricter food safety procedures because the state has been at the center of the coli outbreak and has experienced other problems with contamination of leafy greens8 the petition calls for the california department of health services to establish mandatory regulations relating to manure and water safety on farms similar to those required of the meat and poultry industries cspi suggested that the use of manure as fertilizer should be prohibited during growing season and that only drinkable water should be used in produce processing facilities on october 29 2006 news article reported that the investigation of the coli spinach outbreak had been thorough although there were final answers yet9 the article indicated that the codes printed on the bags of spinach had reportedly led detectives to discover when it had been bagged on august 15 and other specific details including worker shift and packing line exhaustive testing of the plants equipment and water supply over several weeks turned up none of the implicated bacteria according to government officials and company representatives company records led investigators to the fields of nine farms in the three counties where the spinach packed on august 15 had been grown coding on additional bags of contaminated spinach allowed investigators to narrow the search to four fields fda reported that the strain of coli had been found in manure on cattle ranch in the salinas valley within mile of spinach fields investigators combed the fields for more samples including wildlife and cattle feces stream water and spinach leaves six samples taken from the ranch tested positive for the coli strain that was being sought including one found in the gut of feral pig killed on the property there were also signs that feral pigs had broken through wire mesh fence to reach the spinach indicating that the field was likely source of the outbreak and that the wild pigs were the probable carriers of the bacteria however other fields have not been ruled out as the source nevertheless this investigation has provided the most specific information to date for how microscopic

oct 29 2006 crs12 animals feces can cause illness and death in consumers thousands of miles away from the primary source of the contamination on october 30 2006 the western growers association proposed that farmers who grow leafy greens be subject to new food safety standards10 while detailed plan has yet to be released the statement indicated that soil irrigation water and farm equipment should be tested for bacteria workers should be trained in food safety practices and processing plants should be checked regularly violators could be fined or banned from shipping the association indicated that the produce industry is subject to little oversight by state and federal regulators an arrangement that is believed to have led to the coli outbreak losses to the spinach industry alone from the recent outbreak have been estimated to exceed 100 million11 the association proposes to fund the food safety measures through the novel use of marketing order marketing orders were authorized by state and federal legislation in 1937 as way to compel producers of particular crop to follow common set of rules and pay fees used to fund programs while marketing orders have never been used to enforce food safety california department of food and agriculture officials have said that such procedures appear to be within the scope of the law information is available on the cost of implementing such program although farmers have to approve marketing orders they do seem to support the call for increased regulation the september 2006 outbreak represented the ninth outbreak in california in decade and the 20th report of an coli outbreak in lettuce or leafy greens nationwide since 1995 fda has reportedly pressed the lettuce and spinach growing industry for more than two years to follow voluntary federal guidelines to prevent outbreaks of foodborne diseases on november 2 2006 rancher in san benito county california revealed that his operation was one of four farms under investigation by government agencies in connection with the september 2006 coli outbreak12 the rancher indicated that his operation did not grow or process the spinach in question but that he rented fields to two tenants one of whom was still under investigation as of november 8 also on november 2 the canadian government lifted its ban on us spinach that is grown anywhere outside of san benito and monterey

weeks to establish new safety rules to prevent coli outbreaks13 the consortium of stores vons ralphs and albertsons grocery chains and the costco wholesale corporation wanted growers to work with federal regulators academia and industry research scientists to standardize food safety requirements the group also called for process for updating food safety rules in response to the emergence of research findings on how diseases are spread from the farm to the dinner table if growers failed to achieve more stringent and enforceable farming practices the consortium indicated that it was prepared to set up its own certification system related congressional activities on october 24 2006 the house committee on energy and commerce asked fda to explain its role in detecting contaminated food particularly the coli strain that tainted spinach in september 200614 the request asked for detailed information about the agencys food contamination preparedness and deterrence assessment conducted in 2004 and how the assessment was being used in emergencies like the 2006 coli outbreak the committees letter asked the agency for the types of food commodities selected for vulnerability assessments under its 2004 assessment known as the fda security surveillance assignment fssa and how the data were collected and analyzed fssa was conducted to determine the safety of food at special security events such as the g8 summit and the national political conventions the recent coli outbreak led opponents of the national uniformity for food act s 3128 hr 4167 which is scheduled to come before the senate in the closing days of the 109th congress to call for rejection of the bill the association of food and drug officials afdo has indicated that states ability to react to future bacterial outbreaks would be compromised while fda does not have authority to mandate recalls for most of the foods it regulates the states generally do have this authority proponents of the bill argue that the legislation would not affect state adulteration or inspection authorities supporters believe that state food regulators are simply wrong to say that the legislation standardizing food warning labels would have hindered states ability to recall spinach see crs report rl33559 food safety national uniformity for food act by donna v porter for further information 13 grocers enter

responsibilities between usda which regulates meat poultry and processed egg products and fda which regulates all other food products proposal for single food safety agency with increased powers may become part of the debate while not mentioned in fdas reports of its investigation it is likely that the investigation was streamlined as result of certain new authorities granted to fda in comprehensive bioterrorism and public health preparedness legislation in the 107th congress pl 107188 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 gave fda the authority to require that food processing facilities register with the agency which had not been previously required in addition processors were required to maintain records that fda could use to facilitate product tracebacks during outbreak investigations including in their records information about the source of ingredients coming into their facilities one step back and the customers to whom they shipped products one step forward final observations the federal and state systems for tracking and investigating the bacterial outbreak seem to have worked well once the clusters of coli infections were recognized in several states investigators were able to trace back to the likely location and source of the problem through mix of epidemiologic and laboratory investigation and multiagency coordination the fda and cdc provided alerts to the public and to health officials and continued to do so through daily updates in addition cdc held conference call for 800 health care professionals on the investigation of the outbreak coli testing and treatment of patients weak point in the system seems to be how best to intercept coli contamination before it enters the food chain while procedures are in place to enhance the safety of meat products the voluntary federal guidelines for leafy greens seem to be ineffective or not fully implemented by growers and processors plans to develop more effective system announced by the produce industry may address this weakness in the food chain however mandatory requirements may need to be implemented by regulators to assure the public that leafy greens are safe for consumption while funding through market orders has been proposed by one group the question of whether this source of funding or another source is used remains to be resolved oversight of the produce safety system will likely be needed in the final analysis the specific cause of the california spinach coli outbreak may never be known investigators were able to develop fairly good idea of how the contamination and outbreak occurred thanks to identifying information on bagged spinach and dna fingerprinting technology while livestock and feral pigs were shown to be carriers of the implicated coli strain the precise pathway by crs15 which the spinach became contaminated is as yet unclear best agricultural practices and haccp in processing operations are likely to help in preventing such outbreaks in the future for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33722
