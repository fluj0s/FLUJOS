this report provides brief hi story of federal alcohol ex cise tax rates and examines recent federal revenue collecti ons from alcohol products ra tes were last increased by the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 rra90 pl 101508 under that act congress increased the excise tax rates on cohol products because of large continuing federal budget deficits which resulted in the need for add itional federal re venues tax rates were increased 100 per proof ga llon on distilled spirits to 1350 per proof gallon the tax rate for beer was doubled to 1800 per barrel also the excise tax rates on wines were increased with the new ra tes ranging from 107 per wine gallon to 330 per wine gallon all these rates became ffective january 1 1991 breaking down these rates the consumer would find that the cu rrent federal alcohol excise taxes amount to 214 per 750ml bottle of distilled spirits 33 cen ts for sixpack of beer and 21 cents per 750ml bottle of table wine this report will be updated to reflect new information or as legislative velopments warrant brief history of tax rates the tax rate on distilled spirits remained unchanged from 1951 to 19851 in october 1985 the rate was raised from 1050 to 1250 per pr oof gallon under the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 rra90 pl 101508 the rate was increased by anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20605crs2 2 proof is method of measuring the alcohol content

of alcohol content it contains 231 cubic inches at 60 degrees fahrenheit 5 this credit does not apply to champagne and sparkling wine 6 as noted earlier in this report small br ewers whose production is less than 2000000 barrels of beer per year pay reduced excise tax rate on the first 60000 barrels of taxpaid beeradditional 100 per pr oof gallon to 13502 the tax rate on beer had not been raised since november 1 1951 then the rate wa s raised from 800 to 900 per barrel the rra90 doubled the existing rate which sta nds today at 1800 per barrel the rra90 retained the small producers exception of prior law which allows lower rate to apply to small brewers who produce fewer than 2000000 ba rrels of beer per year the rate for small brewers which has been in eff ect since february 1977 is 700 per barrel3 for the first 60000 barrels after 60000 barrels sma ll brewers pay the 1800 per barrel rate thus small brewers pay appr oximately 2 cents per 12ounce serving for the first 60000 taxpaid barrels of beer the taxes on wines are levied at variety of rates as in the case of beer the tax rates that applied to wine remained unchanged for many years until the passage of rra90 prior law rates ranged be tween 17 cents per wine gallon4 for still wine to 340 per wine gallon for sparkling wines u nder the rra90 these rates range from 107 per wine gallon to 340 per wine gallon the details of these changes are shown in table 1 below unlike other alcohol tax rate s included in the rra90 the tax rates on champagne and sparkling wines were not in creased small domestic wineries credit equal to 90 cents per wine gallon is pr ovided for the first 100000 gallons of wine production with phaseout of the credit for wineries whose production falls between 150000 and 250000 gallons5 the effective date of all these tax rate changes was january 1 1991 under provision of the taxpay er relief act of 1997 the excise tax rate on hard cider was lowered the credit availa ble for small producers of hard cider was also lowered commensurately comparison of alcohol tax rates for comparison purposes the federal tax rates on all alcohol products listed here have been converted to leve l of federal excise tax per dr ink obviously such conversion requires assumptions regarding serving size the federal statutory ta x rate on beer is 18 per barrel of 31 gallons6 for beer this equates to 058 per gallon or approximately 033 per sixpack of 12ounce cans or just over 5 cen ts per 12 ounce can more than 90 of all beer sold is in 12ounce serving sizes the federal statutory tax rate on distilled spirits is 1350 per proofgallon re tailers most often ll distilled spirits in 750ml bo ttles and at 80proof federal excise tax of 214 attaches to an 80proof 750ml bottle of distilled spirits if mixed drink contains approximately 15 ounces of distilled spirits the federal ex cise tax per drink is approx imately 013 at higher alcoholhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20605crs3 proofs higher tax rates woul d apply and thus higher tax revenues would be generated there are special tax rates or credits for small domestic distillers converting wine excise taxes is problema tic because of the differences in rates between large and small wineri wine is most commonly sold in 750ml bottles this bottle size equates to 254 ounces under th rra90 federal excise taxes rose from 3 cents to 21 cents on 750ml bottle of table wi ne if glass of wi ne holds approximately 5 ounces the tax rate per glass produced by large winery equates to slightly more than 4 cents because of the 90 cents per wine gallon tax credit provided to small domestic wineries by the rra90 the tax rate for sm all wineries equates to 3 cents per 750ml bottle or less than penny per glass of wine thus the federal excise tax that attaches per drink is approximate ly 4 cents per glass of wine from large wineries 5 cents per can of beer and 13 cents per mixed drink table 1 comparison of alcohol excise tax rates before and

collected for the fiveyear period 2004 to 2008 such an increase would raise the tax on 750ml bottle of distille d spirts from 214 to 254 the tax on six pack of beer from about 33 cents to 81 cent s and the tax on bottle of still table wine 750ml from about 21 cents to 70 cents8 revenues collected from all alcohol excise taxes go into the general fund of the united states treasury as such these re venues are not specifically dedicated for any trust fund or for any special use the rationa for the last increase in tax rates was the budget deficit there have been legislativ proposals made in the past to dedicate the excise taxes on alcohol products for various purposes for example it has been suggested that the revenues collected from alcohol excise taxes be used to help finance the medicaremedicaid trust funds here the ra tionale given has been that the abuse of alcohol products early in life may lead to h ealth related problems th at drain revenues from those federal trust funds sugge stions have also been made that alcohol tax receipts be used for alcohol rehabilitati on treatment and to compensa victims of drunk drivershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20605crs5 9 crs report rs20172 excise taxes on alcohol tobacco and gasoline history and inflation indexed rates by louis alan talley pamela j jackson and brian w cashell 10 the taxes imposed on alcohol and tobacco products are sometimes referred to as taxespolicy arguments among the arguments frequently made for in creasing the alcohol excise taxes is that they can raise substantial and stable am ounts of revenues while the cost of tax administration in relation to the revenue ge nerated is small the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the us departme nt of treasury believe s the compliance rate for payment of the federal alcohol excise taxe s to be high in the past most of the legislative proposals to change the tax merely raise the tax rates since the number of business concerns that make th federal excise tax paymen ts is fixed and known federal collection costs should remain stable thus it is generally believed th at those legislative proposals that simply raise or lower the tax rate should not change the administrative ease with which the tax is currently collected some supporters of an increase in rates ve suggested that one way of increasing revenues without large onetime tax increase would be to tie the alcohol tax rates to an inflation adjustment such as the consumer pr ice index since these taxes are imposed on per unit basis their real cost d eclines during inflationary periods9 another possible alternative is converting the cu rrent excise tax to an adval orem tax that would tax the product at percentage of the manufacturers pr ice thus tax revenues would rise as the price of alcohol products andor th eir consumption increases over time alcohol excise taxes10 have long been justified as user tax societys cost from alcohol includes those from coholinduced auto accidents nd increased police services resulting from its indiscriminate use it is possible that these costs are not fully reflected in the price of alcohol it is sometimes argued that further increases in tax rates would help pay for these services and the attendant costs to society an argument made against alcohol excise ta xes is that they are regressive this is because individuals with lower incomes would spend larger portion of their income than higher income person for the same c onsumption amount in opposition however some argue that not only should abi litytopay be factor of ta xation but also the ability to spend and consume spending by pers on with limited resources for nonessential is considered sufficient reason by some for imposition of tax and reflects an ability to support the national government in the sa proportion as the amount purchased and consumed supporters of alc ohol taxes argue that while the tax can be said to be regressive it can also be said to be ta x that wealthy taxpayers cannot avoid through loopholes or other income tax re duction or saving devices several other arguments have been advanced against increasing the excise taxes on alcohol products an increase in rates c ould be expected to decrease consumption decreased consumption will affect state tax revenues unless the states were to further raise their own excise tax rates which could lead to still lower rates of consumption opponents note that the state governments ofte n rely more heavily on salebased taxes than does the federal government decrease in consumption can also be expected tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20605crs6 11 congressional budget office budget options revenue option 34 p 231cause loss of employment not only in the cohol industry but also in related industries such as advertising trucking and packaging some recent research suggests that modera consumption of some alcohol products might produce beneficial health effects an increase in taxes could reduce consumption by some light drinkers wh ich could have been benefi cial to their well being11 further increased tax rates can result in increased evasion and illegal production of product
