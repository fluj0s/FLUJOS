later politically moribund yeltsin resigned as president of ru ssia three months before the end of his term and named putin acting president circumventing the normal electoral process with this legup

determined to take chances on the outcome in the runup to the duma electi on the authorities used myriad official and unofficial levers of power and influence to assure an overwhelming victory for

candidates were bought off intimidat ed or barred from running on legal technicalities in march 2007 for example the supreme court ruled that vladimir ryzhkovs republican party one of the fe w remaining liberal democratic parties must be disbanded because it violated the 2004 law requiring parties to have at least 50000 members and 45 regional offices5 russian authorities effectively prevented the main election observing body of the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce from sending an observer team first by limiting their number to 70 compared to 450 osce

acted as though it practically ected the parliament itself on december 10 barely week after the duma election putin announced his choice for president dmitri medvedev the 42yearold medvedev longtime putin protégé had headed the presidential administration before putin made him first deputy prime minister in 2005 like putin and many of the kremlin inner circle medvedev is native of st petersburg formerly leningrad but unlike so many of the inner circle he does not have background in the security services his academic training is as lawyer he is viewed by many in russia and the west as one of the most liberal of the gene rally illiberal cadre surrounding putin9 one day after his anointme nt medvedev announced that if elected he would ask putin to serve as prime minister one week later putin formally accepted this offer this carefully choreographed arrangement presumably was meant to assure political continuity for putin and to dampen political infighting among the rival clans

medvedevs favor this was especially true of tv news the principal source of political news for most russians all the nationwide tv networ ks are owned or controlled by the state the previous format of

constituti on shifting some power from the presid ent to the prime minister under the present superpresidentia l constitution the prime minister serves at the pleasure of the president and may be dismissed by the president at any time19 according to unnamed kremlin sour ces the presidential administr ation was ordered to prepare draft constitutional law that would require the president to secure approval of four fifths of the duma and twothirds of the federation council the upper chamber of parliament in order to dismiss the prime minister20 this is only one of many changes that would have to be made in order to shift power decisively from the president to the prime minister it would require major rewrite of the constitution move that putin has specifica lly said he does not contemplate21 others suggest that president medvede v may voluntarily cede substantial power to prime minister putin allowing the ntor to continue wielding real power proponents of this view note that medvede vs entire political career has been under the direct tutelage of putin and that the ounger man is totally loyal protégé but such dual power arrangement is viewed by some observers as inherently unstable as former russian presidential spokesman vyacheslav kostikov put it the problem is who will be number one another insider wrote that the key problem will not be relations between putin and medvedev per but how this diarchy is able to handle the kremlin inner circle which is split up into competing factions the regime will have another center of influence less legitimate than putin to whom it will be possible to appeal and for the first time there will be situation in which putins decision may not be the final or decisive one22 another scenario envisions medvedev resigning after decent interval necessitating new presidential election in which putin would be eligible to run since he would not have served more than two consecutive terms this hinges on medvedevs total loyalty to putin but could putin count on that with complete certainty the ageold lesson illustrated in tolkeins lord of the rings is that power is seductively delicious nd difficult to relinquish still others suggest that because russian political institutions per are weak putin would be able to retain the status of facto national leader based on his popularity prestige and powerful connections with the security services whose personnel he has placed in key positions th roughout the government ministries and bureaucracy the media and leading economic enterpriseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34392crs7 23 ibidalternatively putin might plan on remaining as powerful prime minister for year or two while making sure that dvedev is an able and loyal successor and be prepared to push medvedev aside if th younger man proved unsatisfactory but in this view if medvedev pr oved himself to be worthy successor in putins eyes putin would gradually relinqui sh command of the ship of state leaving the helm in medvedevs hands23 possible implications for us interests russia is not as central to us interests or the us role in the world as was the soviet union in the cold war era but developments in russia are still quite important to the united states russia remains nuclear superpower and will play major role in determining the national security environment in europe the middle east and asia russia is also majo r economic power with vast oil and gas reserves the war on terrorism arms contro l efforts to contain wmd proliferation the future of nato and energy security inter alia may all be affected by developments in russia important specific immediate issues on the usrussian agenda include missile defense in eur ope kosovo and irans nuclear activities some observers believe that the identity of the individual who wields power in the kremlin after 2008 is not particularly important because putin has already succeeded in reestablishing traditional russ ian authoritarianism and statism ie putinism will prevail with or without putin others argue that russias postsoviet political evolution is still work in progress that the policies and preferences of russias paramount leader can be decisive in setting the nati ons course and its relations with the united states as wa s the case when mikhail gorbachev ascended to the kremlin and adopted policies that wrought profound albeit sometimes unintended consequences the question of whether medvedevs ection victory results in an actual transfer of power is in itself an important issue if medvedev replaces putin as the decider the act of honoring the twoc onsecutiveterm constitutional limit itself will strengthen the rule of law in russia if on the other hand it turns out that putin succeeds himself in one way or another th at will reinforce the tradition that russia is ruled not by laws but by men it may not necessarily be true that more democratic russia will be more friendly and accommoda ting partner for the united states but there is widespread belief that the more russia adopts the values of democracy and free markets the more likely is it to coexist harmoniously with the industrial democracies of the west wh ereas authoritarianism and statism are believed more likely to lead toward militarism and neoimperialism in what many russians still think of as the former soviet spacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34392crs8 24 putin was soviet kgb foreign intelligence officer for 16 years in 19981999 he headed russias federal security service the

career kgbfsb professional24 purposefully undermined nascent mocratic trends that had arisen under gorbachev and yeltsin in favor of statism and centraliz ed authoritarianism one of the hallmarks of putins administr ation is that he surrounded himself with current and former members of the security services the socalled siloviki 25 medvedev is one of the few in putins inner circle who does not share that background having initially attained promin ence as an outstanding young attorney and law professor26 some russian and wester n observers view medvedev as relatively liberal compared to
