falling agespecific mortality life expectancy rose dramatically in the united states over the past century final data for 2003 the most recent available show that life expectancy at birth for the total population has reached an alltime american high level 775 years up from 492 years at the turn of the 20th century recordhigh life expectancies were found for white females 805 years and black females 761 years as well as for white males 753 years and black males 690 years life expectancy gaps between males and females and between whites and blacks persisted in combination with decreasing fertility the life expectancy gains have led to rapid aging of the american population as reflected by an increasing proportion of persons aged 65 and older this report documents the improvements in longevity that have occurred analyzing both the underlying factors that contributed to mortality reductions and the continuing longevity differentials by sex and race in addition it considers whether life expectancy will continue to increase in future years detailed statistics on life expectancy are provided brief comparison with other countries is also provided while this report focuses on description of the demographic context of life expectancy change in the united states these trends have implications for wide range of social and economic programs and issues that are likely to be

considers population longevity in the united states as measured by life expectancy1 life expectancy is the expected number of years to be lived on average by particular cohort2 if current mortality trends continue for the rest of that cohorts life3 it most commonly refers to life expectancy at birth the median number of years that population born in particular year could expect to live for instance based on recently released final data life expectancy at birth in 2003 was 775 years 4 this tells us that for those born in calendar year 2003 in the united states 50 will die before that age the other half will live longer life expectancy is also routinely calculated for other ages life expectancy at age 60 for instance refers to the additional number of years that person who has already attained age 60 will live beyond age 60 life expectancy at age 60 in the year 2003 was 222 years in the united states 5 person who reached age 60 in 2003 was expected to live an additional 222 years on average and would die at age 822 while this report concentrates on trends and differentials in life expectancy at birth appendix b table b2 provides estimates of life expectancy at selected additional ages in 2003 the most recent final data available measures of life expectancy are published in official life tables which are based on agespecific death rates in the united states data on mortality are collected and compiled through the vital statistics system by the centers for disease control and prevention cdcnational center for health statistics nchs the most recently released final data on deaths and mortality are for calendar year 2003 6 preliminary estimates are often released by nchs but are generally not referred to in this report the concept of life expectancy which considers the average experience for population is distinct from the concept of life span which considers the upper limit of human life that could be reached by an individual according to the u s census bureau international data base7 the highest attained life expectancy to date for national population was that of andorra in 2006 when life expectancy was 835 years for the total population 866 years for females 806 years for males the oldest authenticated female life span thus far recorded was for j calment of france who died at age 122 years 164 days and for man c mortensen danish immigrant to the us who died at age 115 years 252 days 8 there is lively debate among researchers 1 research assistance provided by angela napili librarian knowledge services group of the congressional research service 2 persons born in particular year see appendix glossary 3 life expectancy is hypothetical measure that applies todays agespecific death rates to predict the future survival of cohort it would technically be more accurate to follow the cohort through time and apply the actual agespecific death rates that the cohort experiences as it moves through its life course but calculation of actual life expectancy would then require more then 100 years until th death of the last survivor in the cohort 4 national center for health statistics nchs deaths final data for

or whether future increases are probable life spans are not considered further in this report this report documents the improvements in life expectancy that have occurred analyzing both the underlying factors that contributed to mortality reductions as well as the continuing longevity differentials by sex and race in addition it considers whether life expectancy will continue to increase in future years while this report focuses on describing the demographic context of longevity change in the united states these trends have implications for wide range of social and economic issues that are likely to be considered by congress for instance one consequence of lengthening life expectancies is that the older populations needs for careassistance with daily tasks to allow continued communityliving for highfunctioning seniors institutions for those with more severe disabilities or cognitive impairments training of specialized work force in geriatric careare likely to increase particularly for the oldestold there are also questions with respect to ensuring basic income support medical care and housing for the older population at the same time there is the recognition that government programs such as social security and medicare will face financial pressures to meet the increasing needs what program changes are required to ensure the continued viability of such programs as the number of beneficiaries increases what will be the federal governments role in an environment of competing demands for limited resources

century these advances were largely attributed to an enormous scientific breakthroughthe germ theory of disease which led to the eradication and control of numerous infectious and parasitic diseases especially among infants and children 9 the new theory led to an entirely new approach to preventative medicine practiced both by departments of public health and by individuals interventions included boiling bottles and milk washing hands protecting food from flies isolating sick children ventilating rooms and improving water supply and sewage disposal10 beginning in the 1940s the control of infectious diseases was also aided by the increasing distribution and usage of antibiotics including penicillin and sulfa drugs since midcentury advances in life expectancy have largely been attributable to improvements in the prevention and control of the chronic diseases of adulthood in particular death rates from two of the three major causes of death in 1950diseases of the heart ie coronary heart disease hypertensive heart disease and rheumatic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases stroke have fallen by approximately 60 and 70 respectively on an ageadjusted basis 11 since 1950 see table 2 improvements that the cdc has characterized as one of the most important public health achievements of the 20th century12 9 sh preston and m haines fatal years child mortality in late nineteenth century america national bureau of economic research series on longterm factors in economic development princeton nj princeton university press 1991 10 preston and haines rule out formal health care doctors hospitals drugs and therapies as the primary catalyst for longevity improvements during this period as most of the decline had occurred before any effective therapies were available also the mortality experience of physicians and their families was not significantly different from that of the general population evidence from other industrialized countries also supports

behaviors number of additional factors are known to be associated with mortality decline they are briefly mentioned here but it is beyond the scope of this report to discuss them in detail or to disentangle them from the factors already described socioeconomic status ses higher ses persons tend to be better educated have higher incomes and practice better individual behaviors less smoking healthier diets etc and are more likely to have financial resources or health insurance to ensure access to medical care social policies some social policies such as medicare and medicaid are oriented to health improvements both programs were designed to increase access to health care for vulnerable populations the elderly and the poor with the ultimate goal of improving health for these groups other social policies such as social security affect income and may affect health and wellbeing through that channel finally some social policies may affect health by changing the access that people have to alreadyestablished resources an example is the combination of civil rights legislation and improved health programs for the poor during the mid1960s especially through medicaid 14

the total us population aged 65 and older between 1900 and 200016 he asserted that assuming future mortality improvement at nearly the same rate as for the last centurya little more than 07 annuallyis reasonable assumption with roughly equal likelihood of doing better or worse this rate of improvement is more optimisticabout twice as largeas experienced during the last 18 years of the 20 th century

expectancy to rise linearly by more than two years per decade over the past 40 years26 or the last 160 years27 more rapid pace than suggested by current models also useful analyses of the

death to the size of sex differentials in life expectancy in developed countries for the early 1980s36 diseases of the circulatory system were found to account for nearly 40 of the mean sex differential in life expectancy neoplasms cancer for 18 accidents suicide and violence for 19 and diseases of the respiratory system for nearly 10 37 in general why is life expectancy longer for women the answer which is still being investigated involves the complicated interplay of host of biological social and behavioral conditions in addition it differs according to age and to the underlying disease and mortality profiles for men and women at birth boys have clear advantage in the united states 1049 boys were born for every 1000 girls in 2003 38 but male mortality exceeds that of females in every age group and for most major causes of death beginning in infancy and continuing through the oldestold age groups one researcher has suggested that the male advantage at birth is moderated by higher male mortality to ensure that the number of men and women will be about the same at reproductive age39 g4g146g152g149g152g144g146g140g138g149g561g8g138g140g157g152g155g156g561 it has long been argued that hormones play role in longevity as described by desjardins40 the female hormone estrogen helps to eliminate bad cholesterol ldl and thus may offer some protection against heart disease41 in contrast some say testosterone found in greater amounts in males may make men more likely to engage in violence and risktaking behavior especially if reinforced by cultural influences42 women may also gain an additional biological advantage because of their two x chromosomes if gene mutation occurs on one x womans second x chromosome may be able to compensate in comparison genes on mens sole x

do not withstand critical analysis44 he offered an alternative hypothesis that has not yet been subject to longterm scientific scrutiny he asserts that strong positive correlation has been reported between sexual size dimorphism ssd45 and malebased mortality with men being the largertaller sex globally larger body requires more cell doublings especially due to the ongoing regeneration of tissues over lifetime accordingly the replicative history of male cells might be longer than that of female cells resulting in the exhaustion of the regeneration potential and the early onset of age associated diseases predominantly in males th underlying mechanism is the gradual erosion of chromosome ends telomeres two recent studies confirm that men do have shorter telomeres than women at the same ages numerous studies also demonstrate links between chronic stress and indices of poor health including risk factors for cardiovascular disease and poorer immune function 46

contribute significantly to the sex differentials observed between men and women womens social status and life conditions such as the hardships associated with childbirth may have nullified american womens biological advantage at the beginning of the 20 th century but are longer major factors in gender differentials in life expectancy in the united states though these explanations are still relevant in number of other countries higher male mortality rates have been attributed to greater male exposure to specific risk factors such as alcohol consumption and occupational hazards life expectancy in russia for instance fell by 63 years for russian men during the period 1990 to 1995a level of decline that was unprecedented both in russia and in other industrialized countries in investigating the cause of the sudden drop team of researchers from the london school of economics and the russian academy of sciences observed that excessive alcohol consumption contributed both directly and indirectly to the marked increases in deaths from fatal events eg accidents injuries suicides poisonings and in deaths from cardiovascular disease 47 the most cited behavioral contributor to higher male mortality rates in the united statesand the subject of considerable research interesthas been the greater male exposure to cigarette smoking smoking patterns are an obvious place to look for an explanation of sex mortality differences because the health risks are high and longlasting large fractions of the population have engaged in the habit and smoking patterns differ between the sexes 48 more specifically 43 r stindl tying it all together telomeres sexual size dimorphism and the gender gap in life expectancy medical hypotheses 200462 pp 151154 44 stindl shows that estrogen levels in postmenopausal women are virtually identical to estrogen levels in males and can hardly explain the discrepancy he notes that testosterone got its bad reputation from one outdated study on nonrepresentative sample of men and since its unlikely that mu tations in genes on the x chromosome are involved in all agerelated diseases and that mutated versions of these genes occur in all men the model might be of academic value only 45 in biology dimorphism refers to having two different di stinct forms of individuals within the same species or two different distinct forms of parts within the same organism sexual dimorphism is common case which refers to the fact that the two sexes have different shapes sizes etc from each other 46 epel and colleagues accelerated telomere

when the sex differential in mortality was increasing cigarette smoking was implicated50 now as the sex differential is narrowing new body of research is evaluating the role of cigarette smoking in explaining the trend pampel51 for instance documented that the rate of decline in female mortality in the united states has slowed since 1980 or so while that of males has returned to its earlier trend of relatively rapid improvementthus resulting in narrowing life expectancy differential by gender he concludes that smoking behavior lies behind the changing pace of mortality decline not only in the united states but also in 20 other industrial nations extending pampels analysis lee showed that the rate of decline for deaths not associated with smoking was actually faster for women than men while death rates associated with smoking actually increased for women while decreasing for men 52 preston and wang53 demonstrate that changes in sex mortality differences in the united states have been structured on cohort rather than period basis and that the cohort imprint is closely related to histories of cigarette smoking allowance for the smoking histories of cohorts significantly affects the assessment of mortality trends national mortality levels would have declined more rapidly in the absence of smoking and they are likely to decline more rapidly in the future as smoking

and 753 years with black females having the slight advantage of the four racesex groups considered black males have the shortest average longevity690 years withinsex groupings whites have the advantage for both females and males what accounts for the higher mortality and subsequent lower life expectancy for blacks and especially for black men in the united states this has been subject of research by medical and social scientists for at least century and the issu stands at the heart of the current public health agenda in the united states 55 one of the two primary goals of healthy

lymphoma figures are in the original source but are not shown in table these results are consistent with findings from other studies57 and are said to show that most of the influential diseases are ones in which the rates vary based on avoidable risks such as smoking exposure to hiv and obesity and this adds to the credibility of publichealth interventions aimed at reducing the exposure to these risk factors58 the results may also offer hope for the elimination of racial disparities in health59 beyond describing gross health disparities scientific inquiry has shifted to explaining the underlying factors that account for these differences in health outcomes understanding these underlying causes requires disentangling the complex web of factors connecting the nexus among race socioeconomic status behavioral factors and health60 some have argued that if pertinent differences between whites and blacks in their underlying social demographic familial and economic circumstances were eliminated racial differences in mortality would be significantly reduced 6162 socioeconomic arguments cite the consequences of lifelong poverty relevant factors include both earlylife differences such as birth weight and childhood nutrition and midlife variables such as access to employerprovided health insurance the strain of physically demanding work and exposure to broad range of toxins both behavioral eg smoking and environmental eg workplace exposures over the life cycle these factors combine to increase the demand for health care while potentially limiting consumption of necessary health services in late life these factors may affect the age of onset of both morbidity and disability the severity of symptoms and ultimately the age at and cause of death 63 in addition martin and soldo64 note that there are differences between racial groups in norms regarding not only lifestyle and selfcare behaviors but also in access to health care providers and treatment compliance moreover the experience of racial discrimination may have adverse psychological and physiological effects in addition to limiting the quantity and quality of health care received some of these factors that contribute to the racial gap in life expectancy will be discussed briefly in the following paragraphs 57 see for instance rg rogers living and dying in the usa sociodemographic

access to highquality health care diet housing and health insurance black households had the lowest median income in the united states in 2003 their median money income was about 30000 which was 62 of the median for nonhispanic white households about 4800065 poverty rates among african americans are persistently higher than those of nonhispanic whites in 2003 244 of blacks were poor compared to 82 of nonhispanic whites66 recent research also highlights the enduring effe cts of education increased education appears to lower the risks for some chronic diseasesmost notably coronary heart disease which is the leading cause of death in the united stateswhile retarding the pace of disease progression for other conditions67 in 2003 the proportion of both blacks and nonhispanic whites who had high school diploma of persons in the population aged 25 and over reached record highs but at different levels for the two racial groups80 and 89 respectively the gap in educational attainment is also apparent among recipients of bachelors degrees30 of nonhispanic whites aged 25 and older had attained fouryear college degree compared to 17 of blacks 68 marriage is also socioeconomic determinant that is related to health outcomes married people consistently exhibit lower levels of mortality than those who are not married marriage acts to select healthy individuals but it also enhances social integration and encourages healthful behaviors 69 race differences in marital and cohabitational stability are substantial and may be increasing over time about 91 percent of white women born in the 1950s are estimated to marry at some time in their lives compared with 75 of black women black married couples are more likely to break up than white married couples and black divorcees are less likely to remarry than white divorcees 70 the degree of attachment to marriage among black americans is similar to that of white americans as measured by attitudes toward marriage one explanation offered by some researchers for the lower proportion of time spent in marriage among black americans is the idea of marriage squeeze in which the marriageable pool of black men is low due to high rates of joblessness incarceration and mortality employed men are more likely than unemployed men to marry71 65 c denavaswalt bd proctor and rj mills income poverty and health insurance coverage in

health outcomes and various healthdamaging such as smoking alcohol abuse and health promoting exercise lowfat diet behaviors and some researchers have explored the extent to which healthdamaging and healthpromoting behaviors explain blackwhite differences in health status berkman and mullen72 for instance found that despite greater apparent concern on the part of blacks than whites about their health blacks do not consistently adopt more beneficial behaviors than whites older blacks engage in less physical activity and are more likely to be obese especially women but they are less likely to consume alcohol than whites racial differences in smoking patterns are complex with older blacks less likely to have smoked but if they have less likely to have quit lack of exercise and obesity are associated with hypertension and diabetes both of which have been reported to be twice as common among blacks than among whites 73

significant numbers of americans and especially african americans do not have sufficient health care coverage more specifically 210 of blacks under age 65 and 129 of whites of the same age lacked private health insurance in 200375 beyond health insurance chandra and skinner76 argue that there is differential access to health services in the united states especially because of geographic variation in treatment and outcome patterns minorities tend to seek care from different hospitals and from different physicians than nonhispanic whites in large part reflection of the general spatial

that there are racerelated genetic factors both for predisposing conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus and for lifethreatening conditions such as aplastic anemia as recently noted by the national research council however probably aspect of the debate about the causes of racial differences in health is potentially more sensitive than the discussion about the extent to which genetic

support of racism77 those in favor of using race assert that there is useful degree of association between genetic differences and racial classifications so that the use of race as research variable is warranted opponents however argue that bundling the population into four or five categories based on skin color or other traits is not useful way to summarize genetic variation when we know that there are at least 15 million genetic polymorphisms in humans of which an unknown number underlie variation in normal and disease traits 78 research in this area is still in its infancy and tends to reflect two ways that genes may be relevant to the study of health differentials79 first there are small number of conditions with singlegene disorders in populations that have descended from relatively small number of people and that remain endogamous80 an example is taysachs disease among ashkenazi jews second genes may be relevant to the study of health differentials through environmental factors which may vary by racial or ethnic group and which might interact with genotype to produce different outcomes for different groups g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 one of the most important public health achievements of the 20th century in the united states was the dramatic and widespread increase in life expectancy that occurred over the past century in the united statesfirst as result of the control of the infectious and parasitic diseases that had plagued mostly infants and children in the early part of the century and later because of medical advances that led to large decreases in adult mortality especially from two of the most prevalent causes of deathcardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases consequence of the improved survival coupled with declining fertility rates is that the united states is in the midst of profound demographic change rapid population aging phenomenon that is replacing the earlier young agesex structure with that of an older population 81 hastened by the retirement of the baby boom generation the cohort born between 1946 and 1964 the inexorable demographic momentum will have important implications for large number of essential economic and social domains including work retirement and pensions wealth and income security and the health and wellbeing of the aging population whether the life expectancy improvements will continue is the subject of intense debate the social security administration ssa assumes that the rate of future mortality improvements will be nearly the same as for the last centurya little more than 07 annuallywhile asserting that it may be difficult to match the accomplishments of the past century especially in light of increasing obesity declining levels of exercise and the introduction of new scourges such as aids sars antibiotic resistant microbes 82 some demographers on the other hand feel that 77 b cohen introduction in nrc 2004 p 9 78 eg burchard and

and argue based on historical trends and evidence from other developed countries that american survival will be longer than that projected by ssa83 the outcome of the debate has important implications for determining the number of future beneficiaries and ultimately the financial soundness of the social security and the medicare programs this report also highlights the continuing differentials in life expectancy by race and sex in the united states with black males continuing to be the most disadvantaged group on this measure life expectancy at birth in 2003 for black males measured 690 years falling short of the comparable figure for white males by 63 years the gap between black and white men has remained relatively stagnant since the mid1950s the sources of the racial disparities in life expectancy are complex and require disentangling the complex web of factors connecting the nexus among race socioeconomic status behavioral factors and health differences exist on wide variety of important variables including lifetime income and wealth marriage patterns birth weight and childhood nutrition access to employer provided health insurance the strain of physically demanding work exposure to toxins risky behaviors such as smoking high saturated diet adherence to preventative health measures such as maintaining healthy weight exercise and access to and quality of health care in addition the experience of racial discrimination may have adverse psychological and physiological effects in addition to limiting the quantity and quality of health care received84 recent research however that shows that the leading specific diseases that are the main sources of the racial disparity in life expectancy are rgely preventable causes of premature death offers hope that publichealth interventions can reduce the racial disparities specifically the leading causes of the racial disparity were hypertension which contributed 150 to the disparity followed by hiv disease 112 diabetes 85
