growth in foreign holdings of federal debt november 13 2006 philip d winters analyst in government finance government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33723growth in foreign holdings of federal debt summary the governments persistent deficits have increased the amount of debt the treasury must sell to the public to raise the cash needed to cover the gap between its income and spending over the last 20 year s and particularly the last 10 years most of this debt has been sold to foreig ners both central banks and others by 2005 foreign holdings had risen to 54 of all privately he ld federal debt domestic holdings have fallen from 83 of all privately held federal debt in 1985 to 46 in 2005 the most dramatic shift in the relative shares has occurred since 1995 during which total privately held fe deral debt grew by 580 billion domestic holdings fell by 670 billion and fore ign holdings ballooned by 1250 billion as shares of gross domestic product gdp privately held federal debt peaked in 1993 at 455 of gdp having risen fro m 323 of gdp in 1985 before falling back to 314 of gdp in 2005 foreign holdings have risen from 54 of gdp in 1985 to almost 17 of gdp in 2005 their hi ghest level so far domestic holdings peaked in 1993 360 of gdp and have fallen steadily since to 146 of gdp in 2005 the foreign purchases of federal debt over this 20year period have held down domestic interest rates and prevented the crowding out of private investment that might otherwise have occurred the foreig n holdings of federal debt or other us assets means some of our future income will be sent overseas to pay interest or dividends although unlikely rapid diversification out of dollar assets is possible such situation could cause collapse in the dollars value putting the us economy at risk of recession slower divestment of dollar assets woul d tend to raise us interest rates and slow investment but would proba bly not trigger recession the special role that the dollar plays in international finance and the strength and stability of the us financial markets including treasury securities make them attractive sources for foreign investment these factors generally encourage the retention of dollar assets by foreigners as result the levels of foreign holdings of federal debt are currently neither threat nor problem for the nationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33723contents g r w t h i n f d r l d b t h l d b f r i g n r s 1 p s s i b l c n s q u n c s f i n c r s d f r i g n h l d i n g s f f d r l d b t5 list of figures

this report documents the growth in foreign holdings of federal debt over the last 20 years and the potential consequences of the changes growth in federal debt held by foreigners figure 1 shows federal debt in billions of dollars annually by domestic and foreign holders for the fiscal years 1985 through 20054 the figure shows the steady and then more rapid growth in foreign holdings over the 20year period domestic holdings of federal debt began falling after 1995 but st abilized after 2001 since 2001 the increase in foreign holdings is equal to 98 of the total increase in private holdings of federal debt httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33723crs2 the 2001 to 2005 growth in foreign holdings along with relatively stable domestic holdings pushed foreign holdings to 54 of total holdings at the end of 2005 if federal reserve system holdings were included in domestic holdings the foreign share would remain below 50 in 1985 foreign holdings were 17 of total privately held federal debt over 20 years domestic holdings declined from 83 of total private holdings in 1985 to 64 in 2001 and to 46 in 2005 table 1 provides data for figure 1 containing the levels of domestic and foreign private holdings of federal debt in dollars and as percentages of privately held federal debt yearly for the 1985 through 2005 period over this period total private holdings grew in each year except during the four years that the government had surplus 1998 through 2001 between 1985 and 2005 foreign holdings grew in all but three of the years with surpluses domestic private holdings grew through 1994 and then fell in each subsequent year until 2002 after which it remained relatively unchanged for the whole period foreign holdings produced 73 and domestic holdings produced 27 of the total increase in privately held federal debt between 1995 and 2005 domestic holdings fell by 671 billion while foreign holdings grew by 1250 billion an amount twice as large as the overall increase in privately held federal debt which grew by 579 billion over these years 02505007501000125015001750200022502500 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005domestic foreignin billionsfigure 1 privately held federal debt fy1985fy2005

as shares of gdp the data present different overall view of privat ely held federal debt over the last 20 years than is shown in figure 1 total holdings are now slightly below their level in 1985 and well below their peak in 1993 as percentages of gdp foreign holdings grew in dollars and as sh ares of gdp and by 2004 were larger than domestic holdings foreign holdings reached 150 of gdp in 1997 before falling to 100 of gdp in 2001 since then the constant subs tantial growth in foreign holdings has raised them to 168 of gdp this level of foreign holdings is likely to be surpassed in the next few years as the government c ontinues to need foreign resources to help finance its large and persistent budget defic its total privately he ld federal debt will continue growing as long as the govern ment has deficits whether it grows or shrinks as percentage of gdp depends on the relative rates of growth of privately held debt and gdp figure 3 shows the yeartoyear change i n dollars in domestic foreign and total privately held debt for the fiscal years 1985 through 2005 the figure clearly shows the rise in purchases of federal debt by foreign holders particularly after 1994 while

right section of the figure the data show domestic holders purchased the majority of the debt in the first two fiveyear periods but reduced their holdings in the second two five year periods over the

federal debt the increase in foreign holdings of fede ral debt has held down domestic interest rates preventing the crowding out of investment that mig ht have otherwise occurred as result of large federal deficits without the inflow of funds into the financial markets from foreig n investors competition for the available funds in the domestic financial markets by investors and the federa l government would raise interest rates the increased government demand for financial resources to finance the deficit in the absence of inflows fro m overseas reduces the resources availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33723crs6 6 such action would have negative effects on the value of dollar assets still held rapid diversification away from dollardenominated ssets could prove costly to the country doing the diversificationto the private sector crowding out priv ate investment instead when foreigners finance the deficit exports get crowde d out through larger trade deficit there is firm consensus among analysts over the longerterm effect of increased foreign holdings of federal debt and other us assets although unlikely the possibility exists for adverse economic repercussions if fore ign holders were to engage in rapid large scale dive rsification out of dollar assets6 this could cause collapse in the dollars value putting th economy at risk of recession under more orderly divestment of foreign holdings interest rates would still rise and investment would be smaller but r ecession could be avoi ded supporting the slower diversification away from dollar asse ts is the tendency of foreign holders of treasury securities to be very stable in their holdings once purchased foreigners tend to hold onto us treasury securities at this time there seems little prospect that foreign holders of treasury securities will move away from these dollar assets factors supporting the value of the dollar in clude the rapid growth of wealth and large pools of savings in emerging econo mies and oil exporting countries these create strong demand for low risk and liqui d wealth savings options something the us financial markets provi in abundance including us treasury securities which are particularly impor tant option for foreigners second factor is the large and growing amount of treasury debt held by foreign central banks which are less prone to sudden portfolio adjustments than private sector holders third factor is that the us borrows in dollars our own currency so any exchange rate movements do not change the cost measured in dollars of our interest payments or principal payments to foreigners an examination of the data and the economics of the situation indicates that the levels of foreign holdings of federal debt are currently neither threat nor problem for the united states
