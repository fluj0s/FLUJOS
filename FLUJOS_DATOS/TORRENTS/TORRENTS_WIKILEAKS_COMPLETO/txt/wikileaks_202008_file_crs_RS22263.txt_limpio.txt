enterprises gses to make affordable housing allocations to victims this report will be updated to reflect new developments beginning august 29 2005 hurricane katrina disrupted both power and communications in parts of mississippi alabama and louisiana cash could not be withdrawn checks could not be cashed and debit and credit card networks including an unknown number of atms were down in addition facilities of number of financial institutions were destroyed by wind or made inaccessible by water the latter included the new orleans branch of the federal reserve bank of atlanta which supplies check and cash services to southern louisiana and the nearby gulf coast congressional research service the library of congress crs2 such effects however are mostly short term and regulators have experience in ameliorating the problems caused by physical destruction the atlanta federal reserve instituted armored car deliveries of currency to operating bank locations moved check clearing operations to atlanta and maintained the discount window to assist all depositories in meeting their needs for liquidity among other actions1 by september 7 in briefing with house financial services committee members financial regulators were able to report that the financial system was functioning well in the crisis with banks coming to the aid of other banks in handling cash and checks and variety of regulatory relief initiatives beginning to take hold many protective protocols put in place following the terrorist attacks of 911 and the hurricanes of 2004 appear to have proved their worth those protocols which were required of all but the smallest depository institutions included maintaining critical personnel and data storage with at least daily backups at sites at least 20 miles distant from banks headquarters2 apparently in almost every case backing up data has worked despite loss of electricity as of september 20 the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic reported that it had heard from all 280 insured depository institutions in the gulf area and that most httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22263 were operating with 95 of branches in the affected area open3 the national credit union administration ncua had earlier said that all 139 federally insured credit unions in affected areas were operational counting those operating via backup sites4 industry representatives testified about resumption of operations before the house subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit on september 14 20055 regulatory actions and advisories joint guidance provided by federal bank regulators the office of the comptroller of the currency the office of thrift supervision the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation advised temporary easing of regulations although each financial institution is left to decide on its own how to follow this guidance and emergency procedures are to remain consistent with safe and sound banking practices6 specific actions permitted under the federal guidance include waiving atm fees for customers and noncustomers increasing atm daily cash withdrawal limit easing restrictions on cashing outofstate and noncustomer checks waiving overdraft fees as result of paycheck interruption waiving early withdrawal penalties on time deposits 1 see httpwwwfrbatlantaorg 2 see crs report rl31873 homeland security

emergency services including check cashing and atm access can be provided to nonmembers7 members may receive services at other institutions ncua can use its insurance authority to guarantee loans to affected credit unions these agencies have also formed working group to coordinate emergency responses on both state and national levels to provide institutions with clear timely and consistent information on areas of concern it is associated with the federal financial institutions examination council8 depository institutions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22263 the view of most regulators is that the banking system both in terms of safety and soundness and in terms of financial infrastructure is well on the way to overcoming the shortterm difficulties presented by katrina the systemwide view may miss serious problems at individual institutions particularly smaller banks whose business activities were concentrated in the hurricane area banks whose depositors have an urgent need for cash and whose loan collateral is believed to lie under water or otherwise to have been destroyed could face at least temporary financial distress if not failure federal reserve actions can maintain liquidity but there is some anecdotal evidence that major depositors are withdrawing their funds from smaller banks out of concern that the banks may fail and they may lose amounts that are above the deposit insurance ceiling since bank can withstand serious run on deposits some bankers have called for temporary increase in the deposit insurance ceiling to reassure depositors during the emergency9 another concern is that the need to provide emergency services to hurricane victims may conflict with antimoney laundering regulations intended to keep drug lords and terrorists from using the banking system the gulf is said to have largely reverted to cash economy10 and large cash transactions are normally subject to stringent reporting and knowyourcustomer requirements in addition many evacuees lack the records or forms of identification that bank would usually require while regulators have issued advisories that appear to suspend or relax rules concerning money laundering customer identification and other requirements11 they have also left banks some discretion in following those advisories some bankers have expressed concern that if 7 see

an account for displaced katrina victim with only minimal information they may later be penalized for poor discretion there have been calls for temporary relief from these regulatory requirements12 finally it is not clear that all existing financial institutions will ultimately survive the disaster the most important reason is the loss of assets in the area homes and businesses that provide much of the loan collateral for smaller institutions are gone and may not be revived or insurance may not be adequate to make the loans whole in addition many customers of the banks are gone and may never return either loss could well prove sufficient to end profitability of some banks banks and the finance units of the nations automakers are offering some relief to borrowers affected by hurricane katrina for example bank of america jp morgan chase and wells fargo are letting their customers defer payments on mortgages and homeequity lines for up to 90 days13 general motors ford motor and daimlerchrysler14 are offering payment relief for customers who took out loans via their financing units httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22263 bankers also have some incentive to send longerterm funds into affected areas under the community reinvestment act cra banking businesses are graded on their sociallydirected loans investments and services coincidentally effective september 1 2005 the scope of application of this act was expanded concerning community development the definition of community development now includes activities that revitalize or stabilize distressed or underserved rural areas and designated disaster areas federal or state governments designate disaster areas which would include those severely damaged in the hurricane thus allowing banks anywhere in the nation to meet their cra obligations by assisting in the recovery assistance to displaced evacuees qualifies15 mortgage lenders fannie mae and freddie mac buy residential mortgages and either hold them in portfolios or repackage them into mortgagebacked securities for sale both gses have large numbers of mortgages secured by residences in the hurricane zone both have announced that they will continue to make
