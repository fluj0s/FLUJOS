limited to guerrilla warfare gw sabotage subversion intelligence activ ities and unconventional assisted recovery uar unconventional warfare aspects 11 uw also includes interrelated aspe cts that may be prosecuted singly or collectively by predominantly indigenous or surrogate personnel an external source usually supports and directs these personnel in varying degrees during all conditions of war or peace the intent of united states us uw operations is to exploit hostile po wers political military economic and psychological vulnerability by developing and sustaining resistance forces to accomplish us strategic objectives 12 regardless of whether uw objectives are strategic or operation the nature of resistance and the fundamental tactics and techniq ues of uw operations remain unchanged uw includes the following interrela ted activities 13 guerrilla warfare consists of military and paramilitary operations conducted by irregular predominantl indigenous forces against superior forces in enemyheld or hostile territory it is the overt military aspect of an insurgency 14 sabotage is an act or acts with intent to injure or obstruct the n ational defense of nation by willfully damaging or destroying any na tional defense or war materiel premises or utilities including human nd natural resources it may also refe r to actions taken to injure or obstruct the military capability of an occupying power sabota ge may be the most effective or the only means of attacking specific targets beyond the capabili ties of conventional weapon systems sabotage selectively

nature of subversion dict ates that the underground will do the 11 fm 305201 bulk of the activity subversion is fo rm of effectsbased targeting on human terrain 16 effective sf targeting demands

critical to planning and co nducting operations sustaining and protecting themselves and the uw force to assessing the capabil ities and intentions of indigenous and coalit ion forces these activities may be unilateral or conducted through surroga tes sf intelligence activities may require coordination with other government agencies ogas and m ay involve nationallevel oversight 18 unconventional assisted recovery is subset of nonconventional assisted recovery nar and is conduc ted by special operations forces sof department of defense dod dire ctive 23102 uw forces conduct uar operations to

unconventional assisted recovery mechanisms u arms and unconventional assisted recovery teams uarts the uarm refers to an entity group of entities or organizations within enemyheld territory that operate in cla ndestine or covert manner to return designated pe rsonnel to friendly control and most often consists of established indigenous or surrogate infrastructures uarts consist primarily of sof personnel dire cted to service existing designated areas of recovery dars or selected areas for evasion safes to recover evaders 19 uw has taken on new significance for several reasons historically sf units have focused on uw as part of general war now the us policy of supporting selected resistan ce movements requires sf to focus on uw during conflicts short of war also global urbanization provides for shift in emphasis from rural guerrilla warfare to all aspects of clandestine resistance including urban and border operations training and suppor t for these operations may come from the joint spec ial operations area jsoa or from an external training or support site some scenarios may dictate traditional role reversalthe urban guerrilla may conduct most of the operations while supported by the rural guerrilla 110 uw is the most challenging of sf missions because it involves protracted operations with joint forces allied forces indigenous or surrogate forces us agencies or elements of all of these entities uw involves detailed centralized planning and coor dination from the sfoda through the secretary of defense and ultimately decentralized execution uw requires 12 fm 305201 proficiency in other sf principal missi ons foreign internal defense fid direct action da and special reconnaissance sr since once deployed the uw mission may include portions of thos missions before the conduct of sf uw operations resistance potential should exist sf personnel do not create this resistance potential it is already present and has usually developed into resistance movement or an organized effort by some portion of the civil population to resist the regime 111 when uw operations support co nventional military operations the focus shifts to primarily military obje ctives when conventional force is committed and its area of interest nears the jsoa resistance operations may expand to help the tactical commander in addition there ar times operation enduring freedom when the introduction of conventional forces does not take the main effort aw ay from unconventional operations in fact the conventional forces may pport the unconventional forces uw operations can delay and disrupt hostile military operations interdict lines of communication deny the hostile power unrestricted use of key areas divert the hostile powers attention and resources from the main battle area interdict hostile warfighting capabilities resistance and insurgency 112 governments inability or unwillingness to meet the legitimate needs of its people may cause widespread frustration and dissatisfac tion people may lose their faith and confidence be cause the government lacks legitimacy they may also simply recognize that the government is incapa ble of effectively providing internal security and development 113 resistance may be either nonviole nt or violent nonviolent resistance involves acts such as ostracism tax ev asion boycotts strikes or other types of civil disobedience violent resistan ce includes sabotage subversion and guerrilla warfare people usually resist nonviolently at first however they may willingly take up violent resistance if subversive ca dre provides them with cause they perceive to be both worthy and achievable i f the sociopolitical conditions are oppressive enough resistance may develop into an organized resi stance movement 114 resistance movement is an orga nized effort by some portion of the civil population of country to oppose or overthrow the establish ed government or cause withdrawal of an occupying power the center of gravity in any resistance movement is the peoples will to resist th people bear the brunt of the established authoritys retaliatory measures though armed resistance may be stability operations and support operations from the us perspective it is total war for those who take up arms 115 an insurgency is an organize d resistance movement that uses subversion sabotage and armed conf lict to achieve its aims it is protracted politicomilitary struggle desi gned to weaken government control and legitimacy while increasing insu rgent control and legitimacythe 13 fm 305201 central issues in an insurgency each insurgency has it s own unique characteristics based on its strategic objectives its oper ational environment and available resources insurgencies normally seek to overthrow the existing social order and reallocate po wer within the country they may also seek to overthrow an established governme nt without followon social revolution establish an autonomous national territory within the borders of state cause the withdrawal of an occupying power extract political concessions that are unattainable through less violent means 116 the structure of revolutionar movement can be compared to pyramidal iceberg the bulk of which lies submerged with onl its peak visible in building resistance struct ure insurgent leaders give principal attention to the development of suppo rt infrastructurea task done by specially trained personnel the resi stance cadre organizes the support infrastructure which in turn supports the guerrillas th is infrastructure works among the citizens in rural villages towns and urb an cities within the military police and administrative apparatus of gover nment and among labor groups and students dynamics of insurgencies 117 insurgencies arise when the government is unable or unwilling to address the demands of important social groups these groups band together and begin to use violence to change th governments position insurgencies are often coalition of different fo rces united by their common hostility for the government to be successful an insurgency must develop unifying leadership doctrine organization and strategy only the s eeds of these elements exist when an insurgency be gins the insurgents must continually nurture and provide the necessary care if the insurgency is t mature and succeed insurgencies succeed by mobilizing human and mater iel resources to provide both active and passive support for their programs operations and goals mobilization produces workers and fighters raises funds and gets the necessary weapons equipment and supplies mobilization grows out of intense popular dissatisfaction with exis ting political and social conditions in an insurgency the active supporters consider these conditions intolerable the insurgent leadership articulates the dissatisfaction of the people places the blame on government and offers an alternative the insurgen t leadership then provides organization and managerial skills to transform disaffected people into an effective fo rce for political action ultimately the insurgents need the active support of mo st of the politically active people and the passive support of the majority 118 successful insurgency is the most important politi cal power in newly liberated country guerrillas existi ng and fighting under conditions of great hardship develop extremist attitu des and become very jealous of their prerogatives to determine the postwar complexion of their country these attitudes may make it difficult or impossible to establish government 14 fm 305201 sympathetic to us national interests however nation that sponsors successful insurgency generally has political advantage at the close of hostilities 119 there are seven dynamics that are common to most insur gencies these dynamics provide framework for analysis that can reveal the insurgencys strengths and weaknesse s although the analyst can examine the following dynamics separately he must study their interaction to fully understand the insurgency leadership 120 insurgency is not simply random political violence i t is directed and focused political violence it requires adership to provide vision direction guidance coordination and organizational coherence the insur gency leaders must make their cause known to the people and gain popular pport their key tasks are to break the ties between the people and the governme nt and to establish credibility for their movement the leaders must replace the governments legitimacy with that of their own their education background family social connections and experi ences shape how they think and how they will fulfill their goals these factor s also help shape their approach to problem solving 121 leadership is function of both organization and personality some organizations deemphasize individu personalities and provide for redundancy and replacement in decision making these mechan isms produce collective power and do not depend on sp ecific leaders or personalities to be effective they are easier to penetrat but more resilient to change other organizations may depend on charismatic personality to prov ide cohesion motivation and focal point for the mo vement organizations led in this way can produce decisions and begin new actions rapidly but re vulnerable to disruptions if key personalities are removed or coopted by the enem ideology 122 to win the insurgents must have program that expla ins what is wrong with society and justifies its actions they must pr omise great improvements after the government is overthrown the insurgency accomplishes this goal through ideology ideology guides the insurgents in offering society goal the insurgents of ten express this goal in simple terms for ease of focus the insurgents plans must be vague enough for b road appeal and specific enough to address important issues 123 the ideology of groups within the movement may suggest d iffering views of strategic objectives groups ma have ideological conflicts that need to be resolved before an opponent can capitalize on them ideology may suggest probable goals and tactics it greatly influences t he insurgents perception of his environment this pe rception of the environment in turn shapes the movements organization and operational methods 15 fm 305201 objectives 124 effective analysis of an insurgen cy requires interpreting strategic operational and tactical objectives th strategic objective is the insurgents desired end state that is how the insurgent will use the p ower once he has it the replacement of the government in power is only one step along this path however it likely will be the initial focus of efforts typ ically the strategic objective is critical to cohesi on among insurgent groups it may be the only clearly defined goal the movement presents 125 operational objectives are those th at the insurgents pursue as part of the total process of destroying gove rnment legitimacy and progressively establishing their desired end state 126 tactical objectives are the imme diate aims of insurgent acts some examples include the dissemination of psychological operations p syop products or the attack and seizure of key facility these actions accomplish tactical objectives that will lead to op erational goals tactical objectives can be psychological and physical in nature for example legitimacy is the center of gravity for both the insurgents an d the counterinsurgents legitimacy is largely product of perception consequently it can be the pr incipal consideration in the selection and attainment of tactical obj ectives environment and geography 127 environment and geography including cultural and demographic factors affect all participants in conflict the manner in which insurgents and counterinsurgents adapt to these realities creates advant ages and disadvantages for each the effects of these factors are most visib at the tactical level where they are perhaps the predominant influence on decisions regarding force structure doctrine tactics techniques an d procedures 128 uw in an urban environment pr esents different set of planning considerations than in rural environm ents these planning considerations impact directly on structure doctrine tactics techniques and procedures appendix describes characteristics of cities and urban tactical operations external support 129 historically some insurgencies have done well without external support however examples such as vietnam and nicaragua sh ow that external support can accelerate events and influence the outcome external support can provide political psycholo gical and material resources that might otherwise be limited or totally unavailable the types of external support involve the following moralityacknowledgement of the insu rgents as just and admirable political issuesactive promotion of the insurgents strategic goals in international forums resourcesmoney weapons f ood advisors and training sanctuarysecure training and operational or logistics bases 130 accepting external support ma affect the legitimacy of both insurgents and counterinsurgents it im plies the inability to sustain oneself 16 fm 305201 also the country or group providing pport attaches its legitimacy along with that of the insurgent or the counterinsurgent group it s upports the consequences can affect programs in the supporting nation wholl unrelated to the insurgent situation phasing and timing 131 successful insurgencies pass thro ugh common phases of development not all insurgencies experience every phase and progression thr ough all phases is not requirement for success the same insurgent m ovement may be in another phase in other regions of country successful insurgencies can also revert to an earlier phase when under pressure resuming development when favorable conditions return th three phases of insurgency are explained below phase i latent or incipient insurgency 132 during this phase the resistan ce leadership develops the movement into an effective clandestine organizati on the resistance organization uses variety of subversive techniques to ps ychologically prepare the population to resist these techniques may include propaganda demonstrations boycotts and sabotage subversive activities freq uently occur in an organized pattern but major outbreak of armed violence occurs in the advanc ed stages of this phase the resistance organizati on may establish shadow government that parallels the established author ity also during this phase the resistance leadership recruits organizes and trains cadres infiltrates key government organizations and civilian groups establishes cellular intelligence operational and support networks organizes or develops cooperative relationships with legitimate political action groups youth grou ps trade unions and other front organizations this approach velops popular support for later political and military activities solicits and obtains funds develops sources fo r external support phase ii guerrilla warfare 133 phase ii begins with overt guerr illa warfare the guerrilla in rural based insurgency will normally operate fr om relatively secure base area in an insurgentcontrolled territory in an urbanbased insurgency the guerrilla operates clandestinely using cellular or ganization subversive activities can take the form of clandestine radio broadcasts newspapers and pamphlets that openly challenge the control and gitimacy of the established authority recruiting efforts expand as the people lose faith in the established authority and decide to acti vely resist it 17 fm 305201 phase iii mobile warfare or war of movement 134 the last phase starts the tran sition from guerrilla warfare to conventional warfare if successful th is phase causes the collapse of the established government or the withdraw of the occupying power without direct intervention phase iii insurgen cy takes on the characteristics of civil war the resistance organization could achieve legal belligerent status as it gains control of portions of the country the resistance movement becomes responsible for the population resources and territory under its control based on the conditions set ear lier an effective resistance movement will establish an effective civil administration establish an effective military organization provide balanced social and economic development mobilize the population to support the resistance organization protect the population from hostile actions failure to achieve these objectives may cause the resistance mo vement to revert back to an earlier phase 135 some insurgencies depend on pr oper timing for their success because of their limited support the insurgents must weaken the govern ments legitimacy so that it becomes ineffective then an opportunity to seize power exists when the insurgents move to seize power they expose their organization and intentions if they move too early or too late the government may discover their organization and destroy it organization and operational patterns 136 insurgencies develop organizational and operational patter ns from the interaction of various factors the interactions cause each insu rgency to be unique the three general patterns that emerge foco massoriented and traditionalare explained below foco insurgency 137 foco spanish word meaning f ocus or focal point is single armed cell that emerges from hidden strongholds in an atmosphere of disintegrating legitimacy in theory this cell is the nu cleus around which mass popular support rallies the insurgents build new ins titutions and establish control based on that support for foco insurgency to succeed government legitimacy must be near to tal collapse timing is critical the foco must mature at the same time the government ses legitimacy and before any alternative appears an infa mous foco was led by castro in cuba the strategy was very effective becaus the batista regime was corrupt and incompetent the distinguishing charac teristics of foco insurgency are the deliberate avoidance of preparatory organizational work the rationale is based on the premise that most peasants are intimidated by the authorities and will betray any group that cannot defend it self 18 fm 305201 development of rural support as shown by the ability of the foco t strike against the authorities and survive absence of any emphasis on the pr olonged nature of the conflict massoriented insurgency 138 the massoriented insurgency aims to achieve the political and armed mobilization of large popular movement massoriented insurg encies emphasize creating political and arme d legitimacy outside the existing system they challenge that system and then destroy or suppl ant it these insurgents patiently build large armed force of regular and irregular guerrillas and construct base of active and passive political supporters the insurgents plan protracted campaign of increasing violenc to destroy the government and its institutions from th outside their political leadership normally is distinct from their military leadership their movement normally establishes parallel government that openly proclaims its own legitimacy insurgents have welldeveloped ideol ogy and choose their objectives only after careful analysis highly organize d they mobilize forces for direct military and political challenge to th government using propaganda and guerrilla action examples of this pattern include the communist revolution in china the viet cong insurgency the sendero luminoso shining path in peru the following excerpts cite the ccess of the sendero luminoso and their heavy influence in the rural areas of peru the governments failure to change conditions in the southern highlands made peasants question the relevance of the distant culturally alien government which has

of more t han five senderistas thus creating tightly controlled unit impervious to infiltration war in peru gets bloodier latin american weekly report 25 october 1990 19 fm 305201 139 there are distinguishing characteristics of massorien ted insurgency these characteristics include political control by the revolutionary organization that assures priority of political considerations reliance on organized popular support to provide recruits funds supplies and intelligence primary areas of activity especially in early phases in the remote countryside where the population can be organized and base areas established with little interfer ence from the authorities reliance on guerrilla tactics to carry on the military sid of the strategy these tactics focus on avoiding battle except at t imes and places of the insurgents choosing th ey also focus on employing stealth and secrecy ambush and surprise to overcome the initial imbalance of strength phased strategy that first focuses on organizational struct ure in which the population is prepared for its vital role secondly an armed struggle is launched and the guerrilla force gradually bu ilds up in size and strength the third phase consists of more mobile convent ional warfare conceptually this phase is accompanied by popul ar uprising that helps overwhelm the regime it is concept of protracted war traditional insurgency 140 this insurgency normally grows fr om very specific grievances at first it has limited aims it springs from tr ibal or factional racial religious linguistic or other similarly identifiable groups the ins urgents perceive that the government has denied the rights and interests of their gr oup and work to establish or restore them they frequently seek withdrawal from government control through autonomy or semiautonomy insurgents seldom specifically seek to overthrow the gove rnment or control the whole society they generally respond in kind to govern ment violence their acts of violence can range from strikes and street demons trations to guerrilla warfare these insurgencies may cease if the government agrees to the insurgents demands however the concessions the insurgents demand are so great that the government concedes its legitimacy along with them examples of this pattern include the mujahideen in afghanistan before the soviet withdrawal ibo revolt in nigeria biafra tamil separatists in sri lanka sri lanka is diverse nation sinhalese make up 74 percent of t he population and are concentrated in the more densely populat ed southwest ceylon tamils whose s outh indian ancestors have lived on the island for centuries form around 12 percent of the population and live in the north and the east indian tamils distinct ethnic group represent about 6 percent of the population other minorities include veddas muslims both moors and malays and burghers who are descendants of european colonial ttlers most of the sinhalese 110 fm 305201 community are buddhist most tamils are hindu most of the muslims practice sunni islam the different groups tend to lead highly segregated lives and live within their own communities apart from in the capital colombo although sinhalese are the clear majority they fear the influence of the huge tamil population across the palk straits in the southern indian state of tamil nadu the british colonial policy of divide and rule sowed the seed s of renewed tensions between the sinhalese and tamil communities after independence tamils although well educ ated were given dispro portionate number of top jobs in the civ il service by the british once the sinhalese majority held sway its po liticians sought to redress the balance with populist but discriminator policies against tamils in 1956 the victory of swrd bandaranaike on platform of sinhalese nationalism led to him declaring sinhala to be the countrys official language among other antitamil measures communal tension and violence increased from 1956 onwards as tamils became increasingly frustrated by the mid70s tamils we re calling for separate state in the north and east of the country in t he 1977 elections the separatist tulf won all the seats in tamil areas while groups such as the li beration tigers of tamil eelam ltte began to use violence for the same nds barry n stein tigers seize key town as death toll soars 1 october 1998 united states sponsorship 141 the united states cannot afford to ignore the resistance potential that exists in nations or countries that ar our potential enemies in conflict situation or during war sf can deve lop this potential into an organized resistance movement capable of signif icantly advancing us interests the strategic politicomilitary objective of uw during wartime is normally to influence conventional military operatio ns however in stability operations and support operations the goals may range from interdicting foreign intervention in another country to opposing the consolidation of new hostile regime to actually overthrowing such reg ime 142 when directed sf personnel suppo rt selected resistance organizations that enhance us national interests during limited or general war sfods normally infiltrate hostile areas to organize train equip and advise or direct an indigenous resistance organization they may conduct uw internally in jsoa or train an insurg ent force at an external training site the external element may be an indigenous force that will conduct uw inside its country or act as surroga for another internal or external mission 143 there are seven phases to us sponsored insurgency figure 11 page 112 they are preparation initial contact infiltrati on organization buildup combat employment and demobilization although ea ch insurgency is unique us sponsorship of resi stance organization generally passes through the seven phases each phase ma not occur sequentially or receive the same degree of emphasis the phases may occur concurrently or not at all depending on the specific situatio n large and effective organization 111 fm 305201 may only require logistics support while small or disorg anized organization might require more attention figure 11 seven phases to ussponsored insurgency phase i preparation formerly called psychological preparation 144 the preparation phase must begin with complete intelli gence preparation of the battlespace ipb uw operations need to include but are not limited to thorough analysis of the resistance forces strengths weaknesses logistic concerns level of training and experience political or 112 fm 305201 military agendas factional relationship s and external political ties along with this data thorough area study sh ould be done of the target area the area study should include but is not limited to political issues religion economics weather living standard s medical issues education and government services this study is re quired to develop strong psyop and civil affairs ca plans that are crucial in the support of strong uw plan 145 the preparation phase includes ca and psyop support ca units support sf in uw missions by providin g advice and assistance relating to social economic and political consider ations within the jsoa psyop units prepare the resistance organization and civilians of potentia l jsoa to accept us sponsorship and the subsequent assistance of sfods 146 the nature of uw may limit the use of supporting ca unit s to outside the jsoa ca personnel may accompany deploying sf units depending on mission requirements or metttc ca personnel train insurgent litary and political elements in ca activities and civilmilitary operations cmo the training focuses on the civil centers of gravity and gain s momentum to mobilize the civilians towards the insurgen ts goals these activities must be coordinated with the jsoa psyop plan 147 the united states government usg begins psyop as far in advance as possible psyop units prepare the resistance orga nization and the civilian population of potential jsoa to accept us sponsorship psyop objectives in uw operation include creating popular support fo r the insurgency movement developing support of the populace to allow the insurgents to avoid detection and move freely promoting the recruitment of others into the resistance movement discrediting the existing go vernment and its programs informing the international community of the goodwill and inten t of the united states and insurgents gaining support of the indigenous populace for us support an d presence countering hostile propaganda training members of the indigenous population or force in psyop target audience analysis local product development targeting dissemination and analysis of impact indicators maintaining motivation among the insurgents passing information or instructions to the resistance organization or its subordinate elements providing link between the resistance organization and forei gn populations promoting reforms the insurgent organization will establish after the hostile governments overthrow 148 ca planning teams may participate in the military decisionmaking process mdmp and analyze the jsoa to provide the

ca capability to facilitate the transition to stability operat ions developing draft disengagement concept phase ii initial contact 149 ideally initial contact with the established or potential resistance movement should be made before committing sf units this procedure allows for an accurate assessment of the po tential resistance in the jsoa and arranges for the reception and initial assistance of the infilt rated element other usg agencies normally conduct the initial contact during contact sf personnel assess the resistance potential in the area of operations ao and the compatibility of us and resistance interests and objectives this phase also allows assessment planners to ma ke arrangements for the reception and initial assistance of the sfod th special operations command soc should arrange to exfiltrate an asset from the ao to brief the st aff and sfod while in isolation under certain circu mstances small carefully selected pilot team composed of individuals possessing specialized skills may make initial contact this teams mission is to assess designated areas to determine the feasibility of developing the resistan ce potential and to establish contact with indigenous leaders once the th eater command or soc has determined the feasibility of developing the area additional sf elements may be infiltrated the pilot team may remain with the sfods or be exfiltrated as directed 150 during this phase psyop units can develop themes symbols and programs that support the planned re sistance operations they can also prepare the local inhabitants to receive allied forces and actively assist in the uw mission to follow psyop begins targeting the enemy and resi stance forces with the need to adhere to the law of war highlighting emy violations ca team members may cont inue to support sfod assessments 114 fm 305201 ca specialists can participate as members of the pilot tea m to assist in assessing the feasibility of developing th resistance potential in designated areas and establishing contact with indigenous leaders phase iii infiltration 151 during the infiltration phase the sfod clandestinely or covertly infiltrates into the jsoa mission re quirements along with metttc will determine the most desirable method of infiltration after infilt ration the sfod meets the resistance organizati on and moves to its secure area infiltration is not complete until the init ial entry report is sent to the special forces operational base sfob or fo rward operational base fob the detachment submits the initial entry report as soon as poss ible upon infiltration the report must be sent even if the sfod does not c ontact the local resistance immediately upon infiltration the sfod beg ins continuous area assessment to confirm or refute information received before infiltration the detachment will continue to report all relevant operational information if the mission warrants selected ca and psyop tea m members may infiltrate into the jsoa with the sf detachment otherwi ca and psyop team members support infiltration and subsequent phases as reachback assets from the sfob or fob phase iv organization 152 the sfod begins to establish rappo rt with the resistance leadership by showing an understanding of confiden ce in and concern for the resistance organization and its cause the detachment explains its cap abilities and limitations and begins to assist the resistance leadership with the development of the resistance organization the sfod must then pr ove its value in actual operations building ra pport is difficult and complicated process based on mutual trust confidence and understanding it is not accomplished overnight 153 before resistance organization can successfully engage in combat operations the resistance leadership must organize an infrastr ucture that can sustain itself in combat and withst and the anticipated hostile reaction to armed resistance during the organization phase the resista nce leadership develops resistance cadre to serve as the organizational nucleus during the buildup phase the sfod assists the resistance leadership in conducting cadre training program to prepare for the eventual buildup of t he resistance organization 154 the resistance leader and sfod commander must agree upon command and control c2 arrangemen ts detachment members normally advise and assist counterpart resistan ce leaders in some situations sfod members may actually direct some resistance activit ies 155 the specifics of resistance orga nization depend on local conditions uw requires centralized direction and decentralized execution under conditions that place great demands on the resistance organiza tion and its leadership armed rebellion inherently creates an ambiguous nd unstructured environment two resistance organizations need t he same degree or level of organization the sfod commander should consider the 115 fm 305201 following factors when advising the resistance leadership concerning organization effectiveness of existing resistance organization extent of cooperation between the resistance organization and the local populace hostile activity and security measures political boundaries natural terrain features potential tar gets population density and other characteristics of the jsoa religious ethnic political and ideol ogical differences among elements of the population and competing resistance organizations proposed type and scope of combat operations degree of us influence with the resistance organization 156 during the organization phase psyop personnel can be used to promote the resistance movements expansion and development by highlighting the enemys weaknesses and countering the enemys propaganda psyop forces use themes to help the resistance organ ization influence attitudes and behavior to win the populaces support psyop programs can support damage control an d assist the development of sound infrastructure such programs contribute to the overall atta inment of the resistance movements go als psyop programs can cover the resistance movements political economic and soci goals the resistance movement cadres ideological indoctrination the practical impact of tactical operations on the population and the significance of and need for the resist ance members proper personal conduct with the populace 157 ca team members can be used to assess the effect of the organ ization efforts on the political economic in formation social and cultural and humanitarian aspects of the jsoa they can also screen the m embership of the resistance cadre for potential positi ons in posthostilities infrastructure in future operations ca team member s may present redevelopment models illustrating the impact of posthostilities civilmilitary initiatives ca team members can assist by helping indigenous people and their i nstitutions as may exist and building local capacity to survive ensu ing conflicts or crises phase v buildup 158 the buildup phase involves expa nding the resistance elements and their activities their tasks include infiltration or procu rement of equipment and supplies to support the expansion and subsequent combat operations during the buildup phase the resistance cadre expands int an effective organization that can conduct combat operations recruitment increases due to successful missions guerrilla force missions and tactics dictate simple mobile and flexible organization capable of rapid dispersion nd consolidation in response to the tact ical situation each unit must be selfcontained with its own intelligence communications and logistics systems 159 in this phase psyop units can be used to focus on the resistance movements full expansion and develo pment psyop programs enhance the 116 fm 305201 resistance leaderships legitimacy and effectiveness emphasize the rules of engagement roe and identify targets whose destruction would i mpact adversely on the civilian populace they highlight the governm ents actions taken against the population during its counterinsurgency campaign psyop units can promote the uncommitted populations support for the insurgency and counter the enemys propaganda unit members continue to stress and assure the success of the resistance movement and allied operations 160 ca team members can continually assess the effect of the buildup efforts on the political economic information and humanitaria n aspects of the jsoa ca team members can assist the sfod in training insurgent military forces in ca activities and cmo ca team members begin focusing on planning posthostilities transition operations that capi talize on the unique skills of the usar ca functional specialists to include training potential members of the posthostilit ies infrastructure separately and concurrently with the guerrilla force phase vi combat employment 161 combat operations increase in scop and size to support the objectives of the area command during the combat employment phase the r esistance organization conducts combat operations to achieve its strategi c politico military objectives the sfod ensures that resistance activities continue to support the goals of the area command interdiction is the bas ic uw combat activity these operations can drain the hostile powers morale and resources disrupt its administration and maintain the civilian populations morale and will to resist each target should contri bute to destroying or neutralizing an entire target system 162 in this phase psyop units can exploit successful combat operations to attract more recruits unit members focus on themes and s ymbols of nationalism success and inevitability of complete victory psyop units can also induce enemy defections or noncom pliance with orders in an effort to protect themselves they continue targ eting the population to increase their support for the insurgency the allied forces and the eventual followon government psyop units can assist in controlling or directing the dislocated civilian dc flow to facilitate the movement of combat forces and to minimize casualties they continue to counter

operations on the civil environment ca teams anticipate monitor and co nduct mitigating activities to reduce the negative effect of combat operations on the civ il sector and vice versa as well as to identify when the moes have been achieved they assist the sfo d and area commander by fulfilling the command responsibilities inherent in cmo they do this directly by conducting ca activities and indirectly by providing ca advisors they assist the sfod in co ntinuing to apply mediation skills to possible and actual sources of indigenous tension 117 fm 305201 phase vii demobilization 164 demobilization is the last most difficult and most sensitive phase of uw operations demobilization planning begins when the usg decides to sponsor resistance organization and ends in the jsoa civi lian usg agencies along with international orga nizations and agencies such as the united nations and the organization of american states oa s normally conduct demobilization of the military groups sf ps yop and ca units help these agencies conduct mobilization using their knowledge of the terrain and the forces within the jsoa the manner in whi ch demobilization occurs will affect the postwar attitudes of the p eople and the government toward the united states the greatest demobilization danger is the possibility that former resistance members may resort to subversion of the new government factional disputes or banditry the new government brings arms and ammunition under its control to ensure pub lic security and to return to functional civil structure based on the rule of law it helps resistance forces return to previous ccupations and may integrate them into the new reconstituted national army the new government must make every effort to reorient former resistance mbers into peaceful society and gain their trust the most important phase is the one where successful accomplishment meets the us government objectives col john mulholland commander 5th special forces gr oup airborne afghanistan 165 psyop units help explain the demobilization process and promote the insurgents orderly transition to peacef ul civilian life the primary aim is to prevent the formation of groups opposing the recognized government maintaining loyalty to the legitimate n ewly established government is the major concern psyop units also conduct many direct and indirect activities that assist the new governments demobilization effort psyop units help to secure lines of communications locs control rumors by publishing and broadcasting the news assist the marshalling of available

psyop specialists augmenting the sfod can deploy into any jsoa and plan the propaganda themes m essages media and methods to be used based on target audience analysis psyop in contemporary and future uw become more critical as ideological and resistance struggles increase temporary tactical advant age may create longterm psychological disadvantage all actions must be reviewed based upon their local regional or even international impact psyo p usually involve the following major target audiences in jsoa enemy forces 170 these elements may represent the government forces an occupy ing power or one assisting the hostile government and may be of the same nationality as the local populace in any case psyop personnel wage campaigns against the members of the enemy forces to make them feel isolated and improperly supported doubtf ul of the outcome of their struggle distrustful of each other and unsure of the morality of their c ause 119 fm 305201 enemy sympathizers 171 this target audience consists of civilians in an ao who are willing enemy collaborators unwilling enemy collaborators will collab orate under duress and passive enemy sympathize rs the goal of psyop campaign aimed at this group is to identify an d discredit the enemy collaborators and to weaken their belief in the enemys military strength and pow er the uncommitted 172 these members of the general population are neutral during the initial stage of hostilities or resistance movements they may fear the aims of the movement or are uncertain of its success to win over the uncommitted psyop personnel must stress that the re sistance shares and fights for the political and social goals of the popula tion the united states and its allies in backing the resistance movement pport these same goals to ensure the resistance movement will be successful resistance sympathizers 173 this target audience includes civilians and government military or paramilitary members who support the goals of the movement b ut who are not active members of the resistance force psyop directed at this target audience stress themes that encourag the populace to support actively though generally covertly or cooperate passively with the resistance force in achieving common goals these appeals ensure that the people t heir sensitivities cultures customs and needs are respected 174 psyop advisors and the sfods with whom they work exploit propaganda opportunities the psyop teams attached to the sfod h elp convince the guerrillas to conduct oper ations that create popular support for the resistance movement both in and out of the jsoa indigenous personnel are trained in the effective conduct of psyop and then integrated into the political infrastructure and guerrilla forces these forces then conduct psyop in support of the needs of the area commander those needs sh ould relate to the goals of the unified commander specific situation or uw mission through facetoface meetings with local indigenous leaders sfod personnel strengthen mutual respect co nfidence and trust they also gain valuable insight into the guerrilla forces problems and gai n rapport by sharing the same living and fighting conditions civilmilitary operations in uw 175 cmo are inherent to uw th uw environment contains both military and civilian components that are scattered and i ntertwined within the jsoa although the sfod generally focuses its efforts on the m ilitary aspect of an insurgency it must also consider the nonmilita ry aspects of the jsoa natural routine planned or unpredictable indigenous activities may hinder or help the activities of the guerrilla force during all phases of ussponsored insurgency 176 cmo are the commanders activi ties that establish maintain influence or exploit relations betw een military including guerrilla or insurgent forces government and nongovernment civilian organizations 120 fm 305201 and authorities and the indigenous po pulace in the jsoa these activities should facilitate military operations and consolidate and achieve us objectives in cmo military forces ma perform activities and functions normally the responsibility of local re gional or national government these activities will occur before during or after other military actions they may also occur if directed in the abs ence of other military operations special operations imperatives 177 sof commanders must incorporate the 12 special operation s so imperatives into their mission planni ng and execution to use their forces effectively these imperatives although developed to provide guidan ce to sof apply to any unit organization agen cy or activity that may be involved in uw they are discussed below 1 understand the operational environment 178 in uw there are two aspects of the operational environment t hat sf must be familiar withthe internal and the external the first aspect is critical to applying resources and skills effectively to accomplish the mission the second aspect is critical to guidin g actions in very fluid and highly unstructured environment internal factors 179 sfod members must know pertinent metttc as in any mili tary operation in addition they must understand the insurgent movement to include the underlying political and social causes demogr aphic composition of the movements membership history goals claim s to legitimacy methods and any other pertinent information sfod members must have thorough knowledge of the government military and other institutions that formally or informally exercise power norma lly associated with functional government this knowledge includes strengths weaknesses vulnerabilitie s functions and actual power centers as opposed to what appears on organization charts of the organizations interrelationships between these organizations goals and motivating factors for each organization relationships with the united states other governments international organizations and ngos 180 the civilian population is the critical factor sfod m embers must understand the demography culture taboos beliefs customs history goals ethnic composition and expectations of the civilian population most important they must be aware of the dynamics of the many corr elations among these various aspects of society sfod members must b aware of who can influence whom and how that influence is achieved and exercised they must also be aware of any incidental effect the actions with any one factor have on another external factors 121 fm 305201 181 sfod members must understand the us army com mand relationships both military and intera gency that affect the individual guerrilla and the sfod in addition sfod members must derstand the scope and limitations of each agencys influence and programs legal and political restrictions on sf activities sources and assistance available to sf to further assure mission accomplishment role of the us media and the international press intent and goals of the usg intent and goals of ngos humanitarian relief organizations hr and other key civilian agencies in the jsoa command relationships of international agencies and ngos wit h representatives of the usg intent and goals of international agencies united nations north atlantic treaty organization nato applicable roe to include their in tent as well as the specifically enumerated provisions 182 sfod members must also be able to visualize and act on u nforeseen circumstances therefore they must have clear understandin g of the charter and goals of the total us effo rt it is impossible to predict every situation and write specific roe or course of action coa th at addresses each and every situation when the sfod members understand t he commanders intent they can respond with rapid flexibility to the apparent unforeseen and unplanned circumstances 2 recognize political implications 183 uw is essentially political acti vity every act from advising military activities to informal conversation has potential political impact sfod members should not anticipate conventional environment where more traditional military concerns predom inate whether conducting military operations independently or in conjunc tion with conventional forces sfod members must consider both the short and longterm political implications of their acts 3 facilitate interagency activities 184 uw by definition is an interagency effort in which mil itary operations represent only one part usu ally not the most important one of the overall us program sf must be aware of all the agencies that comprise the uw effort sf may also act as the liaison between the resista nce force us agencies and other dod components to ensure that synergy is achieved when participating in an interagency and often join t effort sf must strive for unity of effort and reco gnize the difficulty in achieving it sf must also anticipate ambiguous missions conflicting interests and goals and disunity of effort when lacking unity of command sf can promot unity of effort by requesting clear mission statements and the decision makers intent 122 fm 305201 actively and continually coordinati ng activities with all involved 4 engage the threat discriminately 185 the sf commander must know when where and how to employ his assets based on short and longterm objectives this imperative contains three messages for sf involved in uw effort 186 the first message concerns the lection and distribution of resources for both personnel and materiel approp riateness not mass is the standard sf commanders must ensure that sfods selected for the mission are capable qualified trained and necessa ry for the effort minimizing the us presence while maximizing its impact is the desired outcome 187 the second message relates to selection of training advice and assistance to be given resources are normally limited in uw environment and must be used wisely for best ffect based on sofs understanding of their operational environment and its complex internal dynami cs sf must carefully select which particular training and advice to give this impact is as much consideration in selecting tr aining and advice as are the political implications of the type of subject and assistance given 188 the third message deals with tactical considerations tactical operations in uw must be carefully targeted to ensure success an d avoid alienating the civilian population 5 consider longterm effects 189 uw efforts are inherently longt erm tactical victories are of little value unless they contribute to the success of the overall operati onal scheme the operational scheme may be nonmilitary in nature placing each problem in its broader political military an d psychological context is the next consideration sfod members develop longterm approach to solving the problem they accept legal and political constraints to avoid strategic failure while achieving tactical success they do not jeopardize the success of theater longterm goals by the desire for imme diate or possible shortterm success policies plans and operations must be consistent with us national and theater priorities and the objectives they support 6 ensure legitim acy and credibility of special operations 190 significant moral and legal cons iderations exist in uw effort legitimacy is the most crucial factor in developing and mai ntaining international and internal support without this support the united states cannot sustain assistance to resist ance movement without recognized legitimacy and credibility military oper ations will not receive the support of the indigenous population the us population or the interna tional community 7 anticipate and control psychological effects 191 all operations and activities in uw environment will have significant psychological effects co mbat operations and civic action programs are examples of the type of operations or activities with obvious psychological effects some operatio ns and activities may be conducted 123 fm 305201 specifically to produce desired psycholo gical effect tactical victory may be totally negated or overshadowed by negative psychological impac t recognizing that perceptions may be mo re important than reality in this arena sf must take care to ensure operations are understood by all audiences loss of control of perceptions may cause distortion of the facts and may even diminish or destroy the difficult gains of even the best planned and executed missions 8 apply capabilities indirectly 192 the primary role of sf in uw is to advise train and aid resistance forces the resistance area commander must assume primary auth ority and responsibility for the success or failure of this combined effort successful usadvised operations reinforce and enhance the legitimacy and credibility of the area command and resistance movement 9 develop multiple options 193 sfod members engaged in uw operation must be aware of and prepared for possible contingencie s and followon missions the sfod members must plan to use their range of expertise even if not spec ifically tasked to do so change of operational environment may dictate change of roe or mission sfod members maintain operational flexibilit by visualizing and developing broad range of options and concept plans conplans they can then shift from one option to another before and during mission execution 10 ensure longterm sustainment 194 sfod members involved in uw effort must avoid advising or training the resistance forces in tec hniques and procedures beyond their capabilities to sustain themselves us tactics techniques and procedures tactical communications medic demolit ions weapons and logistics may be modified to negate the threat sf mu st recognize the need for training programs and equipment that are durabl consistent and sustainable by the resistance movement and the usg 11 provide sufficient intelligence 195 intelligence forms the basis for all uw activities and p rograms uw operations depend on detailed and comprehensive intelligence on all aspects of the operational environment and its internal dynamics sfo d members establish priority of effort when th ey identify intelligence requirements effective operations security opsec re quires an alert organization that can assess the hostile threat warn the unit and take timely action to penetrate and neutralize the hostile effort sfod members in uw environmen t need intelligence that identifies the enemy cations and their intentions for force protection however not all threats may come from an identifiabl enemy sfod members should consider the nonmilitary threats posed by the civil sector such as criminal activities zardous materials civil unrest and disease the knowledge they gain prep ares them to effectively advise and train the guerrilla force 124 fm 305201 125 12 balance security and synchronization 196 sfod members performing uw ssion may be in unique position to significantly help other sof and conventional forces accomplish their missions so are often compartmen ted for security concerns but compartmentation can exclude key personnel from the planning pr ocess insufficient security may compromise mission but excessive security will almost always cause the mission to fail because of inadequate facetoface coordination sf must resolve the dichotomy of mission planning synchronization and security chapter 2 premission activities sf commanders conduct both deliberate and timesensitive mission planning and targeting they receive their missions as res ult of the joint strategic planning process strategies policies and sf ssions are subject to continual change this c hapter describes how sf missions are identified and how sf battalions companies and sfodas condu ct mission analysis feasibility assessments and mission pl anning to perform uw missions ingredients of successful irregular warfare are as follows 1 patience to withstand protracted conflict time works for us time will be our best strategist truong chinh 2 political awareness on the part of all ranks 3 intensive wooing of all the littl people to the side of the insurgent 4 the weakening of the enemys morale by constant propaganda and harassment 5 constant offensive action against enemy personnel and sensitive points but only when tactical advantage is on the side of the irregulars 6 the avoidance of pitched battles with equal or superior forces 7 defense only when it is essential to survival or to aid another element to withdraw 8 the consideration of the enem ys supply system as your own making him haul the materiel to dumps then seize it from him 9 constant striving to grow undercove r forces into regular forces ones capable of meeting the enemy on his own ground when the t ime and circumstances make victory certain findings from bg yarboroughs study circa 1961 mission analysis 21 in uw mission analysis the battalion staff analysts view all sources of mission letters and

battalion support company must have clear picture of mission requirements the company provides in telligence and electronic warfare iew support css and signal support to an fob and their deployed sfods the first so urce of these requirements is the mission letter working with other primary and special staff sections the s3 section prepares this mission letter which the battalion com mander issues the mission letter contains general guidan ce as to the types and quantities of support the company will be required to provide the mission let ter must alert the signal detachment to any unus ual signal requirements and include other uwspecific taskings the mission letter serves as basis for metl development for the sf battalion suppo rt company commander the second means of identifying support requiremen ts are the briefbacks conducted by the employed sfods representation of all concerned staff sections at this mostly oral presentation enhances mission success more than almost any other briefing the briefback is normally the last chance for th s3 and s4 representatives to brief the sfod commanders present any last minute changes and updates 236 upon completion of specific mission planning the support company commander revises the draft metl working with the appropriat staff section the support company commander issues guidance to each of his subordinate elements in

letter and tip are needed to begin feasibil ity assessment fa or develop poe each tip contains the soc and g roup commanders operational intent it also contains specification of premission constraints and considerations that will hamper the assess ment and planning process the group commander and staff review the tip and sompf to determine the general shortcomings and requirements inher ent in the taskord they then assign battalion to assess the miss ions feasibility and to begin planning the mission although th group passes the 212 fm 305201 action to the battalion for more detaile d analysis group staff elements must continue their own analysis and coordinate the known and ant icipated shortfalls figure 23 deliberate planning process 213 fm 305201 feasibility assessment process 239 upon receipt of the taskord the sf battalion begins the fa process this assessment determines th ability of the sfoda to perform the mission and the abilities of the battalion or sfodb to support the mission the battlefield operating systems bos and so imperatives are the guides to use for conducting an fa the fa process requires direct in volvement of the battalion or fob staff the sfodb staff and the sfoda eac h has specific degrees of concern and areas of responsibility aors that when addressed will accurately reflect missi on feasibility reviewing these items ensures unity of effort of all units in the jsoa and avoids conflict among friendly units when determining mission feasibility for preconflict mission assignment at home station planners must forward to the isolated sfob detailed mission shortfalls in training or resource requirements that are beyond the battalions capability to fix such as school qu otas and mission specific equipment once completed the fa must clearly show w hether mission feasibility is conditional upon th resolution of identified shortfalls the battalion commander translates traini ng deficiencies into additions to the sfod metl for training he then task s his staff elements to coordinate the resolution of materiel or personnel shortfalls battalion feasibility assessment activities 240 the battalion commander and his staff consider the speci fic mission requirements in the context of overall group and battalion plan s they must assess the battalion or fob staffs ability to prepare suppor t sustain command and control uw elements once they are committed to an oper ation the sf battalion has two principal roles in the fa process to guide and support the sfods efforts in the liberate planning process at home station where time is not critical factor the battalion will not find mission infeasible without allowing the tasked sfod to conduct its assessment if the sfods and the battalion staffs assessments conflict the ba ttalion commander makes the final determination the battalion operations staff serves as the focal point for coordina ting infiltration and exfiltration feasibilities sfods and battalion sta ffs must consider all methods of infiltration and exfiltration during fa infeasible or inappr opriate methods of infiltration or exfiltration are ex cluded from future consideration mission becomes infeasible when all potential infiltration and exfiltration methods are infeasible the battalion or fob staff forwards to the tasked sfoda and sfodb known constraints available information and the commanders intent which become their basis for assessment company feasibility assessment activities 241 battalion gives missions direct ly to each of its 3 sfodbs and 18 sfodas this tasking does not imply that the company hq does not participate in tasking its organic sfodas unless there re security reasons for compartmentalizing the mission the company receives the tas kord from the battalion commander and staff the battalion then tas ks one of its sfodas or sfodbs and supervises its assessment activities the sf battalion commander has three reasons to pass the taskord thr ough the company commander first the sfodb company manages the da ytoday activities of the sfoda and sfodb second operational experien ce of the 214 fm 305201 sf company hq normally exceeds that of the sfoda the company staff mentors the sfoda third after deployment the most common missions for an sfodb will be that it is indepe ndently deployed into the jsoa or deployed to support the sfoda as an aob or as socce for uw the companys fa concerns include communications means and schedules emergency exfiltration requirements emergency resupply considerations preliminary contact and linkup plans 242 the sfoda or sfodb performing fas for specific missions does not develop plans at this time either detachment can determine mission requirements and examine applicable tact ics techniques and procedures

limitations and requirements need to be identified early in the mission planning sequence during planning the commander establishes restricted fire areas r fas nofire areas nfas and fire support coordination lines as needed develops fire support coordination measures that protect deployed sfods and are not unnecessarily restrictive on the conventional or supporting forces fm 30520 and jp 309 doctrine for joint fire support provide detailed fire support information 215 fm 305201 postfeasibility assessment activities 245 once mission is determined fe asible or conditionally feasible the fob staff or sfod anticipates actual taskord the battalion or fob staff immediately identifies requirements fo r schooling training and equipment modifying mtoes or taskorganizing earl to meet mission requirements are examples of longterm fixes that should begin during fa the ba ttalion staff and the sfod retain all documentation and working papers from the fa since they form the basis for subsequent poe development plan of execution development 246 the poe is the final element of the sompf it shows how t he sfoda intends to carry out the assigned mission specific mission preparation begins when the battalion receives the tasking to prepare so mpf to accomplish tasked mission this taskin g takes the form of sompf shell containing all elements developed to that point fm 10025 and jp 3055 provide information on sompf contents options for conducting specific mission planning include activating the fob for training and isolating sfodas so th at they may accomplish their detailed planning conducting planning as part of the routine training day battalion activities 247 the battalion commander and staff plan for support of the ov erall operation in addition the battalion has activities that support sfod poe development building upon the anal ysis conducted during the fa the battalion staff uses the military decisi onmaking process as described in fm 50 currently fm 1015 for planning that is not timecri tical the staff prepares formal written estimates that identify anticipated missionspecific requirements of the sfods they also address planning options available to the tasked sfod for example the signal section addresses vailable communications capabilities and procedures for transmitting data without undue risk of compromise at the batta lion level the commander directs the decisionmaking process toward developing estimates to be used in preparation of the battalion order and sfod planning guidance developing the commanders inte nt into feasible conops planning for fob activities required to support the employed s fods battalion order 248 the battalion planning process produces the battalion order the battalion order encompasses all missions the battalions sfod s will accomplish sfodas and sfodbs will norm ally receive information on their jsoa only 249 once completed the coordinate d battalion order or plan becomes supporting plan to the group or sfob oplan the revised or new mission letter normally requires the staff to review previous home station analysis and coordination 216 fm 305201 commanders intent 250 the commanders intent serves to communicate guidance in the absence of specific orders the commanders intent must be stated clearly it must be brief and to the point the commander must include separate statement of intent for each specific taskord the intent direct s micon development at the sfod level the or der must contain sufficient detail to guide the sfod commanders mission analysis and decisionma king process without limiting the sfods flexibility during the planni ng options mission letter 251 the battalion commander issues mission letter to the sfodas and sfodbs he then provides the battalion oplan and sompf to the sfod the sfoda needs time to review the information before receiving the mission briefing from the battalion commander and staff the ssion briefing consists of battalion staff fficers mission operation cell moc and noncommissioned officers ncos they summarize their specific areas and elaborate on data or changes in the oplan that impact on th sfodas mission the sfoda does not leave the briefing until it unders tands the commanders intent and has asked all the questions generated by its review of the battalion oplan and sompf the battalion staff answers all questions concerning for example inf iltration platforms support equipment availability and rehearsal areas available to the sfod company activities 252 the sfodb may also prepare for its own followon area comman d mission in the future when the sfodb is not compartmentalized from the sfoda receiving its mission the sf company commander and staff monitor the mission briefing with the sfoda this practice ensures the sfodb is available to the sfoda during the planning process understands the training and resou rce requirements related to the mission if tasked to act as an aob or as fob augmentation understa nds the missions it is supporting or controlling 253 deliberate uw planning during isolation prepares the sfoda for hypothetical crisis based on the most current intelligence this assumption allows for the preplanned use of reso urces and personnel projected to be available when the plan becomes effective the assumptions make it improbable that any conplan the sfoda has implemented will be totally usable without modifications the deta iled analysis and coordination that was accomplished during the time available for deliberate pl anning will expedite effective decision making as the crisis unfolds at this time assumptions and projections are replaced with hard data nce the fob commander selects an sfoda to execute the mission the detachme nt moves into an isofac receives the opord and mission brief and begins its mission preparation as follows 217 fm 305201 step 1 receive the mission 254 the sfod and its moc receive the battalion staffs plann ing guidance this guidance may come in mission letter from th group during normal peacetime operations or it may come in the form of an opl an and sompf during hostilities taskor d the company passes command guidance to the sfoda the sfod commander reviews this plan ning guidance and activates the staff sections within the sfoda unit standing operating procedures sops designate sfoda members for each sta ff section according to their moss and assigned staff responsibi lities each sfod member reviews his portion of the oplan when review of the oplan is complete the sfod discusse s the battalion commanders intent each member voices his concerns and velops questions to be answered in the mission briefing to the team the sfod develops rfis and puts them in writing these rfis address unanswered questions and unclear points in the commanders intent these rfis are forwarded to the battalion sta ff and mission briefing is scheduled the battalion staff presents th mission briefing during which it answers as many rfis as possib and provides working status on the others the sfod questions each staff mber as required the sfoda commander ensures the perception of the comman ders intent is correct through faceto face discussion with the battalion commander step 2 exchange information 255 after the mission briefing is co mplete and all questions have been answered or noted for further research and coordination the sfod commander conducts mission analysis session with the sfod this session ensures sfod members understand pir roe intelligence indic ators legal and political constraints and the role of ca and psyop in this session the sfod reviews all available information to ensure that all sfod members agree on what has been presented sf od members with specialized skills or experience either for the mission or in the jsoa provide information on their unique perspectives or requiremen ts if confusion over information or interpretations of information exis ts the sfod develops and forwards additional rfis to the battalion for clarification step 3 restate commanders intent and produce planning guid ance 256 after exchanging information the sfod commander adc and the sfod operations sergeant or company operations wo or sgm if an s fodb meet to develop the restated mission and intent to produce opord planning guidance here the sfod leaders review the specified and implied tasks from the opord review the battalion mission statement and commanders intent consider the information received to date review the feasible infiltration and exfiltration means 257 based on this information th sfod leaders review and develop comprehensive list of specified and implied tasks and the comm ander develops restated mission the wording of the task in the opo rd does not 218 fm 305201 need to be rearranged the restated mission specifically identifi the task as the what of the who what when wher and why based on the knowledge of the skills capabilities current and achievable standa rds of training of the sfod and available resources the sfod leaders develop numerous coas for consideration 258 planning responsibilities different from or not covered by unit sops are also clearly stated when the sfod leaders have completed th analysis they pass the findings out to the entire sfod normally information is given orally however written guidance or tr aining aids for example flip charts are preferable where guidance is co mplicated as minimum the sfod leaders must usually present three coas in writing step 4 prepare staff estimates 259 based on the planning guidance and unit sops the sfo d members prepare estimates for their aors these estimates are not limited to those of the traditional staff aors psyop and cmo estimates will ways be prepared for uw operations at home station sfods planning where time is not factor includes written estima tes written estimates provide needed continuity for replacements when sfod members rotate staff estimates must identify support requirements for each coa once completed the detachment commander briefs the staff estimates to the sfod the briefing serves the purpose of exchanging information between sfod members step 5 prepare commanders estimate and decision 260 after the staff estimate briefi ngs the sfod commander reassembles the sfod leaders and with their assistance prepares the c ommanders estimate critical portion of this step is finding and weighing the factors to be used in evaluating the coas the sfod leaders select the s pecific factors for the mission based on the commanders intent and the specified and implied tasks the commanders estimate must include specifi c factors for each of the functional areas in the bos the so imperatives sh ould be translated into specific factors related to the mission the com manders estimate is prepared in written form based on his estimate t he commander decides which coa the sfod will plan to ex ecute the product of this step is statement of the sfod commanders intent and concept of the operation the sfod commander briefs them to the entire sfod this briefin g serves to answer any questions the sfod may have and serves as the sfod murder board for the concept after briefing the battalion the commander schedules an informal micon briefing with the sfod and the b attalion commander step 6 present micon briefing 261 the micon briefing is an inform briefing presented to the battalion commander to ensure the planning efforts meet his intent the mic on allows approval of the sfods concept of the operation before expendin g time in detailed planning the goal of the micon is to get the comma nders approval for coa micon briefings have specific format bu t normally include the mission 219 fm 305201 higher commanders intent concept of the operation coas considered factors used to evaluate the co risk assessment and metttc specific uw tasks task organization to include requests for required attachments infiltration contact and exfiltration means identification of external support required such as interagency approval of special activities and nonstandard equipment general statement of the commanders conops missionessential personnel and equi pment problems not previously addressed 262 visual aids should be those that the sfod is already using for mission planning the micon briefing should t be so formal the event hinders the sfods planning activities the battalion commander pproves the concept modifies it or directs the sfod to return to step 3 providing additional guidance to clarify his ssion intent key battalion staff members may accompany the battalion commander to the micon briefing and familiarize themselves with the approved mission concept 263 based on the approved concept the battalion staff antici pates the sfods support requirements for example if the micon call s for high altitude lowopening halo infiltration of 12man sfod the s4 does not wait for support request for halo air items for the infiltration the selected concept drives intelligence requirements because of the g enerally repetitious ir intelligence personnel can anticipate and deliver many of their requirements however the sfod is still responsible for all details of the uw operation 264 approval of the micon ends th concept development phase for this planning session responsibility for the concept now rests wit h the battalion commander and the sfod conti nues with their planning step 7 prepare oplan 265 upon approval of the micon the sfod leaders produce the body of the oplan the written oplan specifies tasking to subordina elements and individual members of the sfod anne xes are not included at this point they are produced during the detailed planning phase the pl an must be in keeping with the battalion commanders guidance and underst ood by all members of the sfod when these criteria are satisfied the batt alion commander approves the plan after completion of the briefback step 8 conduct detailed planning 266 the sfod organizes for planning the same as it would for mission execution when the mission does not require the entire sfod noness ential members help subordinate elements in the mission planning pr ocess compartmentation within the sfod is generally counterproductive each 220 fm 305201 sfod member or element completes detailed plan for the execution of assigned tasks members of the sfod brief their respective areas while other members provide an appropriate critique the battalion staff should be available to provide the same service with the added advanta ge of greater experience and objectivity 267 in uw certain aspects of the missi on may be beyond the experience of any of the planners in these circumsta nces rehearsals are excellent mission planning tools new or unfamiliar employment techniques may be tested by realistic rehearsals of portions of th plan during its development often walking through an action will reveal the need for changes to the plan in any case before an sfod briefs poe to its battalion commander sfod members should physically confirm the viability of the plan under the most realistic circumstances possible form ats for specific subelements of the detailed plan that support the poe vary with the mission some portions of the poe may require annexes others only require mention in larger section the poe should relate how th exceptional activity contributes to collecting and reporting requirements or how it enhances the survivability of the sfod alternate plans and conplans are also considered the poe lists all missionessential equipment and accounts for the di sposition of that equipment in sfod packing and resupply plans the sfod lead ers ensure that all supporting subplans are consis tent and mutually supportive they also must ensure that specialized equipment used for one activit can also be used for another upon completion of all supporting subplans t he sfod leaders supervise the preparation of th formal poe it includes all the annexes notes narratives and graphi cs essential to conduct the mission step 9 conduct briefback 268 the briefback serves distinct purpose although the poe details what an sfoda intends to accomplish the briefback explains to the battalion commander how the sfoda will execute the assigned ta sks all information is contained in the commander s folder and must be able to stand alone the sfoda is now ready to accomplish its mission th battalion commanders last effective influence on these activities is through guidance given at the briefback 269 the briefback format is driven by the plan not the reverse several mission briefback formats are available that provide general g uidance there is best format or checklist for uw the sfoda prepares the briefback using the completed detailed plan existi ng formats are useful as means to organize the presentation in general rms and as checklist to look for obvious areas that were overlooked during planning briefback p reparation often reveals gaps in planning in adapting the format the following principles apply the format must provide detailed description of the activities of each sfoda member throughout the execution of the mission this description provides mental picture of the operation for the commander receiving the briefing the briefing uses visual aids only if they help to clarify the briefing 221 fm 305201 briefers must avoid constant referenc to the commanders folder as it denies the staff access to necessary information use charts inst ead the briefing must provide the commander with adequate informati on to judge the efficacy of the plan 270 the sfoda presents its briefback in the isofac where t he planning was conducted this practice nhances opsec and reduces both administrative and support requiremen ts each sfoda member briefs his own responsibilities the staff members focus questions on areas w here they did not hear adequate information to judge the completeness or viability of the plan however all staff elements should have thoroughly coordinated their input during the missionplanning phase the tradit ional habit of quizzing sfoda members memory of missionessential tails is appropriate for this briefback since mission preparation and training will continue the purpose of the briefback is for the commander and st aff to judge the merits of the plan for example if the battalion c ommunications representative hears reference to communications system that he cannot personally verify as available he questions the sfoda on the vailability of that system if he hears discussion on the use of an antenna that appears inappropriate he confirms the reason for that selection the briefback is intended to show any weaknesses in the plan while they can st ill be corrected if the sfoda cannot justif any action matter how minute that action needs to be reconsidered corrected and then implemen ted 271 once the battalion commander is co nfident the plan is workable and is delegated the authority by the group commander he approves the poe if further work is still required he gives specific guidance an d returns the sfoda to the planning phase the commander determines the exten t of revision and whether another full brief back is required as minimum he should require the appropriate staff fficer to personally brief him on any changes once the plan is approved the sfoda commander is responsible only for the preparation of the sfoda and execution of its mission the battalion commander assumes responsibility for the viabilit of the plan he should withhold final approval of plans until all support requests are confirmed and the taskord authority approves the poe step 10 obtain poe approval 272 once the poe is completed and approved by the battalion commander the s3 forwards it through the sf group to the tasking agency the tasking agency then compiles the sompf by obtaining the mission sup port package msp and other supporting documents the s2 or s3 secures the basic folder and returns copy to the mission planning agent mpa this procedure constitutes poe approval mission preparation 273 mission preparation must pr edate isolation and the deliberate planning process during mission preparation specific sion employment is not required sfods tasked to conduct specific type of ssion or use specific means of infiltration cont inue to support their metl through 222 fm 305201 scheduled training mission preparation which is best done at the units home station includes metl indivi dual and missionspecific training 274 based on the group commanders training guidance the battalion commander assigns the missions and approves the draft sfod s metl that supports the assigned missions th company commander must plan conduct and evaluate company and sfod training to support this guidance and the approved metl for the mission premission training 275 the sfod commander ranks the tasks that need trainin g since there will never be enough time to train in every area he focuses on the metl tasks that are essential for mission completion he emphasizes bu ilding and maintaining proficiency in those task s that have not been performed to standard and sustaining proficiency in those tasks that are most difficult he will rank those tasks during training meetings with the sfodas and sfodbs 276 once the tasks for training are selected the sfoda comm ander builds training schedule and plans on those tasks he pr ovides the previous training requirements to the battalion commander the battali on commander approves the list of tasks to be trained and then the sfoda c ommander includes them in the training schedule 277 the company commander coordinates

the mission and conducted its mission preparation at home station timesensitive tasks such as revi ewing the current intsum for changes and confirming infiltration and exfiltration means are cri tical and timely activities failure to allow the sfod to complete these activities in the 96hour timesensitive planning proce ss decreases the probability of mission success emerging missions 287 emerging missions are those other missions for which r equirement was not anticipated and tip or sompf has been prepared the time sensitive planning process for such missi ons involves 96hour cycle at the fob the sfod uses the first day to prepare orders and may dedicate the last 3 days to the deliberate planning process rehearsals inspections and rest during the sfod isolation as with any such procedur guide the time frames are approximate and planners can adjust them as required the 96 hour time frame obviously does not permit the type of meticulous metl driven mission preparation described in the previous paragra phs of this chapter if however the battalion has done thorough job of m ission analysis for its assigned jsoa the general conditions of the emerging mission will parallel other missions for which it has previ ously prepared its sfods the jsoa may be similar if not the same as will the threat and other factors of the operational environment the battalion and com pany commanders must make every effort to assign the emerging mission to the sfod that has most closely prepared for the similar operation during time sensitive planning staffs must anticipate mission requirem ents and staffto staff coordination planners must consider the transportation and information needs commonly requested fo r the type target being considered some specific areas that are particular ly critical to timesensitive planning are communications intelligence operat ions map coverage logistics and infiltration and exfiltration methods 225 fm 305201 288 significant planning cannot begi n without adequate and current map coverage the fob s2 must supply current maps to the sfod qu ality imagery will significantly enhance the probability of missi on success detailed planning for infiltration and ex filtration is critical compromise of the sfod on infiltration can indicate the mission will be failure since infiltration and exfiltration usually invo lve joint external assets coordination is more difficult in this short time pe riod facetoface coordination between the sfod and the supporting asset for example pilot boat oper ator or ship captain is crucial 289 supplies from the fob support ce nter sptcen are usually the only logistic support available this situation highlights th need for the battalion s4 to plan and deploy with large assortment of

infiltration follows initial contact with the resist ance organization or government in exile normally ogas conduct initial co ntact and make an assessment of the resistance potential part of the initial c ontact phase also involves making arrangements for rece ption and initial assistance of the infiltrating sfod or pilot team successful infiltration into the jsoa requires detailed planning and preparation at the joint lev several methods are considered based on metttc appendix f provides additional information area assessment 32 the sfod members and the commander begin an area assessmen t immediately after entry into the jsoa this assessment is the collection of special information and serves as the commanders estimat of the situation the area assessment is continuous proc ess that confirms corrects refutes or adds to previous intelligence acquired before commitme nt the area assessment also serves as basis for changing premission operational and logistic plans there are fixed fo rmulas for doing an area assessment 31 fm 305201 each commander has to decide for himsel f what should be included and what conclusions may be drawn from the information he collects 33 when making an area assessment the sfod commander consi ders all the major factors involved including the enemy situation security measures and the many aspects of the civil component as defined by cascope the sfod should only disseminate new intelligence informati on that differs significantly from the intelligence received before com mitment area assessment is either initial or principal depending on t he urgency involved appendix g contains sample format for an initial and principal area assessment initial assessment 34 initial assessment includes those requirements deemed essential to the pilot team or sfod immediately following infiltration the mission of the team is to assess designated areas to determine the feasibilit of developing the resistance potential and to establish contact with in digenous leaders these requirements must be satisfied as soon as possible aft er the team arrives in the ao much of this initial assessment may b transmitted in the initial entry report ier angus or situation cyril repor t once the theater command or jsotf has made termination as to the feasibility of developing the area additional sf elements may be infiltra ted the assessment team may remain with the operational element r be exfiltrated as directed fm 305220 provides further information on pilot team support principal assessment 35 principal assessment forms the basis for all other subsequent uw activities in the jsoa it is continuo us operation and includes those efforts that support the continued planning and conduct of operation s it should be transmitted using the format planned during isolation this format may be abbreviated by deleting information already confirmed this report should include new or changed information area assessment in an urban environment 36 what makes urban guerrilla warfare so different from rural guerrilla warfare or conventional military contest is the presence of large audience to the struggle unlike rural guerrillas urban guerrillas cannot withdraw to some remote jungle where they are safe from observation and attack they must be able to live in the midst of hundreds of witnesses and potential informers 37 appendix provides guidance for the planning and conduct of uw in an urban environment the appendix des cribes characteristics of cities and urban tactical operations and provides an urban operations survey checklist users of appendix should already have had sufficient ex posure to aso and therefore amplifications and definitions of specific terms are unn ecessary fm 305220 provides further information 32 fm 305201 development of the jsoa 38 the organization and development of the jsoa or region involves early marshalling of the resistance command structure and the sub sequent buildup of the resistance force wellorganized jsoa allows close c oordination between the sfod and the resistance element the sfod gain s thorough knowledge of the ao through extensive area studies these studies include history economy religion infrastructure ethnic groups needs of the populace customs taboos and other data that will affect the organization c2 and selection of leaders within the resistance force appendix h provides an area study outline format objective 39 after infiltration the major task facing the sfod is t develop all resistance elements into an effective force able to ach ieve us and the area commanders objectives to the area command the sfod is th direct representative of the us government the sfod members mu st be diplomats as well as military advisers and establish good working relationship with the resistance organiza tion this relationship develops from acceptance of us sponsorship an d operational guidance the sfod and guerrillas are united with common goal against common enemy development 310 politics ideology topography security communications and many other factors govern the shape size and ultimate organiza tion of the jsoa or region the operational areas of guerrilla forces must h ave clearly defined boundaries these limits simplify coordination and c2 an d reduce friction between adjacent units the operational areas should conf orm to the existing spheres of influence of the established commanders history d emonstrates that areas with basic religious ethnic or political di fferences should not be included in the same area command 311 jsoas should not be larger than the communication and logistics capabilities can effectively support jsoa is the largest territorial organization commanded by an overall area commander who is w ithin enemy territory the jsoa should include enough dense terrain fo r the operation security training and administra tion of the guerrilla forces 312 country may be divided into veral jsoas based on administrative units or natural geographic bounda ries administrative units include counties districts provinces depart ments and states this system is satisfactory when guerrilla missions include sabotage prop aganda and espionage conducted by small cellular units one negati ve aspect of this method is that by following the present governments est ablished unit of administration the resistance is indire ctly aiding the governments control and coordination efforts 313 countries divided by natural geog raphic boundaries are superior for military and overt operations on large scale each major operational area should include difficult terrain or uncontrolled areas itable for area complexes and guerrilla operations each jsoa and subor dinate sector command may also include foodproducing areas that will pport the 33 fm 305201 guerrilla force in the area these considerations may only be ignored when logistics support from external sources is available regularly and on very substantial scale 314 the establishment of rapport between the sfod and t he resistance element is vital first requirement for the sfod an eff ective working and command relationship helps develop high degree of c ooperation and influence over the resistance force this influence is ensu red when resistance leaders are receptive to the sfods suggestions to accompli sh the mission the command structure and the physical organization of the ar ea are priority tasks of the sfod in some situations the resistance organization may be well established but in others organizational structure may be totally lacking in all cases some improvement in physical ar ea organization will probably be necessary tasks and requir ements dictate the organization of the jsoa but organization also depends on local customs and conditions more so than on any fixed set of rules governmentinexile 315 governmentinexile does not exist in every uw situ ation where it does the leader may be figurehead for the resistance he may be deposed former leader of the country or prominent person of society who commands the respect of his fellow citi zens highly stru ctured resistance organization might report to national governmentinexi or if one does not exist to shadow government incountry the leader of the area command may declare himself the leader of shadow government if the enemy government usurped power against the wishes of th people the usg may instead recognize the governmentinexile as the offici government of the country area command 316 an area command is combined indigenous and sf comm and control communications computers an d intelligence c4i structure that directs controls integrates and suppo rts all resistance activities in the jsoa or region the size of the area command is dependent on m etttc the area commander is the resistance leader selected sfo d members serve as advisors to the area commander and his staff small nd mobile the hq size is limited because of meager communication capabili ties functions and forces must be decentralized due to the everpresent possibili ty of the area command being destroyed by enemy action the area command wi th the underground auxiliary and other support systems should be organized prior to phase ii guerrilla warfare they all conduct centralized planning but give maximum latitude for decentralized execution to th eir subordinate sector commanders this policy suppo rts the utmost titude allowing subordinate commanders to determine the how to in planni ng and executing their missions mutual confidence cohesion an d trust must exist between the area commander subordinate commanders and the s fod for each to be effective 317 the area commander should be located where he can safe ly control the resistance movement and its activities flexibility int elligence mobility and opsec are the keys to survival and success the area comman der or his 34 fm 305201 designated representatives should make frequent visits to subordinate units both for morale enhancement and to become acquainted with the l ocal situation where personal visits ar not possible the commanders should communicate with each other frequently area command elements 318 there are rigid patterns for the structure and funct ion of an area command the area command is co mpartmented but should include representatives from all elements of the resistance movement regardless of the level of organization the basic elements of the area comma nd are the command group and the resistance fo rces figure 31 shows the jsoa command structure command group 319 the command group consists of political leaders or thei r representatives from the exiled or shadow government the area commander as the resistance leader the commanders staff and key mem bers of the sfod figure 31 area command structure resistance forces 320 sector commanders or resistance element leaders from eac h sector in the jsoa represent the resistance forces historically u s uw doctrine has made clear distinction among elements of the resistance movement guerrilla forces the auxiliary and the underground the c omposition and duties of these elements forming the resistance force will dep end on factors unique to each jsoa and resistance organization 35 fm 305201 area command meeting 321 the area command meeting is the primary method of conduct ing business within an area command the sfod must thoroughl plan and rehearse its agenda for the meeting personnel must analyze information from the area study operational area intelligence study and area assessment to determine the main points for discussion the meeting is not confrontation between the area commander and the sfod seating arrangements should integrate the area commander his sta ff and the sfod among each other to form large team planning considerat ions for the area command meeting include security measures key issues to be discussed personnel who should attend location of meeting site length of meeting 322 metttc is the basis for an area command or sector meeting suitable locations for the site should be in secure and isolated location either rural or urban when indigenous or enemy governmen timposed population control measures are in effect it may be eas ier for meetings to be held in rural or guerrillacontrolled territory the initia l meeting should be conducted as soon as possible after th sfod infiltrates during the meeting sfod members should establish personal and professional relationships with t he resistance discuss guerrilla and sfod abilities and limitations discuss procedures for developing the resistance cadre establish centralized planning and decentralized execution establish security measures and discuss threat activi ty discuss political boundaries terrain features targets density of population and other jsoa and regionspecific information establish positive us influence with the resistance org anization establish type and scope of combat operations organize the resistance infrastructu re to survive in nonpermissive environment organize cooperation between the resistance and local civilians establish necessary documentation co ver stories and proper clothes discuss roe emphasize unity of effort with open dialogue always plan for contingencies 323 the sfod advises and assists wi th security for the meeting in similar manner to that of the area complex outer and inne r security zones are formed the outer security ring cons ists of observers strategically placed determined by metttc away from the meeting place members of the outer security zones observe avenues of approach and provide ea rly warning 36 fm 305201 they may use handheld radios or telephones to provide ear ly warning of enemy threats which are passed using code words or ssages the inner security zones surround the meeting place itself and c onsist of enough personnel to allow for the escape of the resistance leadershi p in case of compromise before the meeting convenes those present must d ecide on the actions to take in case of compromise they must consider cape plans and routes security element usually members of the inner curity zones serves as rear guard while key pers onnel equipment and documents are removed and quickly evacuated intelligence section 324 during the initial organization of an area command the intelligence section of the staff is given special emphasis throughout all phases of the organization of resistance force the intelligence net is exp anded progressively until the intelligence re quirements for the area command hq can be fulfilled the functions of an area command int elligence section are to collect record evaluate and interpret information of value to the guerrilla forces it distributes the resulting intellig ence to the area commander and staff and to higher and lower commands organize supervise and coordinate together with the operat ions section special intelligence teams airfield survei llance air warning and coast watcher plan and supervise the procurement and distribution of maps charts photos and other materiel for intelligence purposes recommend intelligence and counterintelligence ci po licies collect and distribute information on evasion and recover er to include instructions for downed aircrews evaders and escapees establish liaison with the intelligence staffs and lower commands provide intelligence personnel for duty at lower commands conduct training to carry out intelligence functions 325 the intelligence section is organi zed into forward and rear echelon to provide continuous operation when enemy pressure forces the ar ea command hq to move to alternate locations when these moves are anticipated the forward echelon sets up and begins operations in the prepa red alternate site before the rear echelon moves during largescale overt op erations the forward echelon provides an intelligence section for an ad vance command post organized to direct the operations of two or more sector c ommands guerrilla area command must produce the intelligence need ed for its own security and for local operations against the enemy it must also gather the information required by higher hq although supervised b the area command intelligence section information collectors are d ecentralized as far as practicable to subordinate sector commands sector commands 326 large area commands may establish subordinate sector co mmands sector command meetings are conducted after the initial area command 37 fm 305201 meeting sectors are formed to simplify c4i operations and to provide mechanism to promote centralized planning and decentral ized execution if the area command is subdivided into sector commands its component units are the subordinate sector commands the sector command is the command element of the resistance in given sector the same fact ors that define the boundaries of area complexes define the boundaries of sectors the kinds and disposition of facilities within sector are the same as those for an area complex the sector command performs the same functions as the area command except within the limits of its own boundaries the component elements of sector command are the functional components of resistance movement area complex 327 an area complex is clandestine dispersed network f facilities to support resistance activities it is liberated zone des igned to achieve security control dispersion and flexibil ity to support resi stance activities an area complex must include security system base cam ps communications logistics medical facili ties supply caches training areas and escape and recovery mechanisms the area complex may consist of friendly villages or towns under guerrilla military or p olitical control 328 according to mao tsetung in on guerrilla warfare guerrilla base may be defined as an area strategicall located in which the guerrillas can carry out their duties of training lfpreservation and development the ability to fight war without rear area is fundamen tal characteristic of guerrilla action but this does not mean that guerrillas can exist and function over long period of time without the development of b ase areas there is difference between the terms base area and guerrilla base area an area completely surrounded by territory occu pied by the enemy is base area on the other hand guerrilla base area includes those areas that can be controlled by guerrillas only while they physically occ upy them 329 within the area complex the re sistance forces achi eve security by establishing an effective intelligence net using the early warning with listen ing posts lps observation posts ops and security patrols practicing ci measures rehearsing withdrawals and conplans employing mobility and flexibility using rapid dispersion techniques for personnel camouflaging and adhering to noise and light discipli ne organizing the active support of the civilian population 330 the c2 base camp is in the heart of the area complex specially trained and equipped guerrilla forces co ntrol and defend this camp special guerrilla security detachment provides the internal protec tion for the area commander his staff and the sfod key personnel critical equipment and sensitive information are based from there and may include th following the area commander and staff 38 fm 305201 the sfod and support personnel communication equipment controlled medical supplies and treatment facilities supply caches of weapons ammunition and explosives 331 an area complex can be subdivided into two security zon outer and inner figure 32 page 310 there are clearcut boundaries between zones and security responsibilities can overlap each zone is the responsibility of specific guerrilla element whose mission is to provide for the security and defense of the zone in the area complex to achieve total and overlapping security coverage outer security zone 332 the outer security zone is vitall important to guerrilla force the local guerrilla forces and the civilian support infr astructure are organized and developed in the outer security zone this area serves as the primary source of recruits for the guerrilla fo rce the outer zone also serves as the first line of indepth security and defense for the area comp lex resistance elements in this area are responsible for providing the rea command with timely and accurate information on emy activities within the zone local guerrillas are the resistance element responsible for the zone s control and defense this element is also responsible for the conduct of operations within the zone the local guerrilla forces organize employ and serve as part of the civilian support element the civilian support element gat hers current intelligence information and provides logistic psyop and operational support to the regular guerrilla forces and the area comm and the initial screening selection and training of new resistance members takes place in this zone the most promising and trus ted recruits are then selected for membership in the regular or fulltime guerrilla forces inner security zone 333 the inner security zone encompasses the base camp of th regular or fulltime guerrilla forces these forces defend and control the zone and are constantly mobile within the area the primary mission of the guerrilla forces operating in this zone is to temporarily delay any penetr ation made by the enemy they watch trails and avenues of approach they u ops or lps fixed fighting positions and preposi tioned obstacles such as bunkers and minefields to delay enemy forces they employ harassment ambushes sniping and other interdiction tact ics and practice rapid withdrawal procedures these tactics increase the in depth defense of the area complex they should also use commanddetonated antivehicular and antip ersonnel mines on permanent basis guerrilla forces may place mine s along probable enemy vehicular and personnel avenues of approach such as tr ails creeks and riverbeds the guerrillas must avoi d at all costs be coming decisively engaged while carrying out their delaying and defens ive mission civilians do not normally occupy the inner security zone therefore it may serve as an area of food cultivation for the guerrilla population 39 fm 305201 figure 32 area complex security zones guerrilla bases 334 guerrilla base is hq for any size guerrilla force base may be temporary or permanent depending on the guerrillas stage f development guerrilla c4i support facilities and operational units are located within the base locs connect the base and facilities within the area complex the installations and facilities found within guerrilla base are the command posts training areas or classrooms communications facility and medical 310 fm 305201 services the occupants and facilities mu st be capable of rapid displacement with little or prior warning there is usually more tha n one guerrilla base within sector or jsoa they are in remote

escape routes mandator requirement for guerrilla base camp is source of water wells may be dug where permanent bases are established ideall there will be an abundance of water sources to choose from in the area all base camps shoul d have an alternate location for contingency use in case the enemy overruns the base all personnel should plan for and rehearse rapid withdraw als types of bases 335 there are three types of guerrilla bases in order of dev elopment they are mobile semipermanent and perman ent initially all guerrilla base camps are mobile and as the jsoa matures semipermanent camps are constructed when the jsoa matures enough to conduct battali on combat operations the semipermanent camps become permanent norm occupation time is based on metttc mobile 336 fulltime guerrillas and local guerrilla forces establ ish mobile bases these bases are at the periphery of their zones of responsibil ity mobile bases are normally occupied for peri ods ranging from 1 to 7 days semipermanent

security and early warning for the base each patrol should carry frequency modulated shortrange radio similar to an an prc77 enabling the patrol to relay information to the base in timely manner patrols must search all areas but give priority of search to the high ground surrounding the base and to creek and riverbeds in th area patrols also search roads and trails for tracks or signs of enemy presence if there are friendly civilians in the area they may be questioned regarding enemy activity civilians unfamiliar to the patrol may be threat or sympathizer in formation provided by the friendly civilians is critical to the sec urity of the guerrilla base camp the mission of the security patrols is to detect signs or other indicators of enemy presence or activity these indicators in clude tobacco candy gum and food wrappers human excrement or other waste products tracks made by bare feet or boots on recently used trails broken branches and bent twigs suggesting direction of trav discarded rations containers and equipment 343 passive security measures that can be taken include camouflaging dwellings and hutches with vegetation personnel should change vegetation daily they can also camouflage trails and erase tracks personnel should avoid smoke from cooking fires especially during dayligh t hours and maintain noise and light discipline at all times 313 fm 305201 antipersonnel mines 344 sfods may temporarily use anti personnel mines along likely avenues of approach into the base creeks riverbeds and the surrou nding elevations are good locations for placing antipersonnel mines person nel will warn the civilian population about the use of mines to preclude u nnecessary civilian casualties they may temporarily employ antipersonnel mines in the following areas not used by civilians near running water sources around fruit and shade trees on littleused roads and trails in and around abandoned fighting positions or around abandoned uninhabited dwellings

type of recruitment used in the early stages of resistance movement is selective recruitment as security is emphasized recruitment is highly selective many ta sks of the resistance force require qualification for its recruits beyond certain degree of intelligence and emotional stability since some activities require special qualifications recruiters must look for individuals who can perform lea dership duties intelligence collection and other special tasks the scr eening process includes surveillance and background checks the recruiters use the following methods to ensure loyalty loyalty chec ks oaths and probationary periods once the resistance cadre is established and the resistanc movement is successful mass recruitment begins recruiters seek base of support among large segments of the indigenous population auxiliar members are excellent recruiters because they can move easily throug h denied areas the resistance movement must re ly on mass support if it is to survive and expand figure 34 page 316 recruiting chniques include appeals coercion and suggestion as well as playing on an individuals feelings of governmental alienation 350 recruitment is difficult in the early phases of the peration and easier after the resistance establishes its credibility if the resistance recruits too many civilians enemy reprisals against the remainder of t he community are very possible the number of base camps and the quantity of supporting logistics stock limit the number of potential armed gu errilla recruits administrative procedures 351 as development of the resistance organization progress documentation and record keeping of mission functions is vit to maintaining wellorganized force this information als enables the sfod commander to conduct effective c2 pay rewards and eventually demobilization measures the sfod must establish admini strative procedures early on to facilitate wellorganized guerri lla force appendix i addresses detailed ad ministrative issues commanders 352 the most delicate part of an sfods duty is to ensure t hat competent indigenous personnel occupy key leader ship positions if leaders and staff members of the resistance organization do not appear qua lified to fill positions held the sfod should try to increase their effe ctiveness increasing the effectiveness of these personnel will normally enhance the influence of the sfod the personality and characteristics of the area commander are extremely important his ability must exten d beyond military and technical fields successfully commanding guerrilla force with all its diverse elements requires psychological and politic skills the area commander should have distinction among the civilian pop ulation and the confidence of his followers 353 the area commander influences others to accomplish t he mission by providing purpose direction and motivation purpose giv the guerrillas the reason why direction shows what must be done and motivation gives his 315 fm 305201 guerrillas the will to do everything they are capable of t accomplish their mission figure 34 building resistance movement 354 combattested leader demonstrates his tactical and technical proficiency and uses initiative to exploit opportunities for s uccess he accomplishes this process by taking ca lculated risks within the commanders intent he leads by example from the front and not by fear and c oercion successful leadership in combat enables leader to never underestimate his enemy 316 fm 305201 consider the civil component in all operations understand basic weapons and demolitions understand both conventional force and guerrilla tactics appreciate and understand the strategy of war respect and anticipate the objectives and campaign goals of conventional forces be able to taskorganize himself and others be able to recognize and appoint good leaders improvise on short notice allow the use of initiative employ and exploit all types of intelligencegathering oppo rtunities 355 historically the sector leaders have been recognized as commanders within their spheres of influence in the organization of com mand every effort is made to assist and recognize local guerrilla leader as the overall area commander this concept must not be violated just bec ause the local commander may lack the requisite military service or qual ifications if he can command the respect of the people and subordinate commande rs in the area the sfod should tutor him in carrying out his area comma nder functions replacing locally developed leaders wi th area commanders from external outofcountry sources even though the new area commanders are native born may create personal or politica l rivalries and alienate the area commanders already in existence the recognition of comman ders especially the overall area commander must not be arbitrary or hasty recognition should be based on careful assessment of the existing po litical conditions and social attitudes within the jsoa if resistance moveme nt has failed to develop due to serious personal rivalries or political differ ences the concept of recognizing popular local leader as the overall com mander may in fact be violated in this case leader who commands respect and can unify the efforts of the opposing factions is then appointed or infiltra ted into the jsoa 356 the local area commander is responsible for the organization training administration and operations of guerrilla forces within his area specifically the duties of the guerrilla area commander are operations of the forces under his command and coor dination of operations between subordinate forces and allied forces he continuously determines the resources combat strength dispositions movements and capabilities of the enemy that will affect completion of his mission he als appoints or recognizes subordinate sector commanders prepares plans to accomplish assigned missions and contemp lated missions prepares and assigns missions to subordinate sector commanders establishes adequate communicati on systems between the various forces of his command organizes and operates ci and intelligence nets plans security and defensive measures within the area

accords and conventions plans prepares and employs psyop guides training for individuals and units requisitions and collects supplies from local sources requisitions supplies and equipment from outside the jsoa allocates and disburses equipment and supplies to subordinate sector commands 357 the area commander ensures the reception support an d protection of sfod personnel in the jsoa he accounts for key epws prominent civilians and for the rescue and exfiltra tion of downed aircrews he is also responsible for the civilians in the area initially hi s responsibilities are for the safety and welfare of those noncombatants within the jsoa as the jsoa matures he may actually supervise the organization of civil administration capability among the populace using promi sing members of the resistance movement the sfod supports him in these r equirements by employing ca assets first as planners and advisors to the sfod including using reachback capabilities to ca specialists in rea r areas or the continental united states conus then as co re advisor teams to fledgling civil administrators and finally as fully staffed teams capab of providing support to civil administration the organization and empl oyment of these ca assets is based on us policies and objectives in the jsoa and metttc elements of the resistance 358 the resistance organization consists of three elements they are the guerrilla force the auxiliary and the underground the g uerrilla force is the overt military or paramilitary arm the auxiliary is th clandestine support element of the guerrilla force the underground is cellular organization that conducts clandestine subversion sabotage uar and intelligence collection activities fm 305220 contains additional infor mation on resistance organization and structure guerrilla force 359 guerrillas are decisive comb at force they conduct tactics techniques and procedures employed in the united states duri ng the french and indian wars they continued to have success during the american revolution and during the american civil war for both the federal and confederate troops during world war ii classic exampl of decisive combat force was merrills marauders an d their use of raids ambushes and to lesser extent offensive and defensive maneuvers to defe at the japanese in burma 360 the organization of guerrilla force from the resistance mov ement or the reorganization of existing guerrilla forces into co mbat command is timeconsuming process the organization must follow definite plan phased 318 fm 305201 and coordinated with the sfob direct ives from outside the jsoa to the guerrilla area commanders prescribe the general coas b ased on detailed reports and recommendations of the sfod the commander issues more specific orders much later to reach the desired organization level then the highly organized guerrilla force may be employed in overt comba t operations 361 guerrilla forces are organized in similar manner to c onventional units since guerrilla operations normally do not exceed the equivalent of battalionlevel operations most guerrilla forces are organized only to that level in the later stages of successful uw situation guerrilla forces conceivably could conduct coordinated regimental or higher operations against the enemy forces 362 the progressive organization of guerrilla force in an ao works in three general phases these phases are not specific periods but normally overlap and merge into one another the typical organizat ion and functions of each phase are as follows organization phase i 363 in the first phase of organization individuals band t ogether under local leadership figure 35 page 320 their main concern is survival they have basic need for shelter food water and weapons appropriate terrain and friendly villages on the outer limits of enemycontroll ed areas offer shelter these small bands obtain food water and weap ons locally the activities of these small bands are limited to the organiza tion and establishment of support infrastructure within the local civilian population to obtain information recruits and logi stic assistance they may also conduct political work smallsc ale attacks and sabotage the area commander locates his hq where he can directly influence organization nd operations in the most important sectors of his jsoa his hq is in secure area where access is limited or uncontrolled by the enemy the surroun ding terrain should not favor largescale enemymounted or dismounted op erations logistic concerns and health conditions in the area are furth er considerations also just in case the area commander lects two or more alternate sites and prepares them for emergency use 364 the area commander appoints secondincommand and organizes staff to accomplish military staff functions the staff is ke pt small and mobile it places special emphasis on the organization of the intelligence section hq units carry out the admini strative functions based on advice from the sfod the area commander makes an estimate of the situation formulates tentative organizational and operational plans nd issues directives to place them into effect this effort should fo cus on division of the jsoa into sectors appointment of sector commanders assignment of missions to sector commanders organization in each sector designation of units and au thorized strengths general operating principles and procedures communications system and responsibilities 319 fm 305201 365 in areas that have guerrilla forces or strong re sistance movement the area commander may appoint sector commander for the exploitation and organization of the area this support may consist of as signing cadre personnel for sector commanders hq combat units to provide security and nucleus around which he may organi ze and expand his local forces the area commander helps the sector commanders obtain the supp ort of the indigenous population by visiting the sector and empl oying ca activities such as emergency services militar civic action mca and support to civil administration the effectiveness of ca activities may be enhanced by strong public information ca mpaign supported by psyop figure 35 typical phase i organization 366 in areas where many independent guerrilla forces exis t the area commander gives the appointed sector commander the necessary support to bring about unity of command he gives this support through personal contact with the various local guerrilla leaders the area commander may apply drastic measures to influence independent leaders and units that resist integration into the overall command withholding logis tic support from outside the jsoa to those elements resisting integration is normally sufficient to encourage their willing compliance the sf od commander 320 fm 305201 should be prepared to advise the area commander on the possible repercussions of the area commanders actions 367 normally skeleton organization is formed during phase i also established are command hq in each subordinate sector communication system linking the area command hq with sector hq an extensive intelligence and ci net covering the entire jsoa establishment of this net is extremely important 368 the overall strength of the command and the component u nits may be kept as low as onethird of the potentia l strength to be developed premature expansion and buildup of strength during this phase can c ause undue strain on local resources create hardships and result in dissen sion among the civilian population organization phase ii 369 in the second phase of organization the number and size of units increase figure 36 page 322 small units unite under comm on leadership volunteers individual soldiers or serting army units further strengthen their ranks when tested local leader emerges as comman der command and leadership improve personnel work diligently to estab lish contact with external support sources or with sy mpathetic national government these external support sour ces along with battlefield re covery efforts increase the quantity of war materiel greater enemy pressure results in w idespread sabotage raids and ambushes politica l and administrative considerations policies of the sponsor supporting th resistance move ment and metttc determine the extent to which unifie d commands develop during phase ii the commander modifies or adopts the tentative plans prepared in phase i and places them into effect he makes continuous assessment s and considers additional coas to further expand and build up forces the ex pansion that takes place during this phase directly relates to the am ount of logistic support from sources outside the jsoa missions and internal functions in the operational area also lead to expansion this organiza tional expansion may include increasing the strength of the skeletonized command comba t and service support units up to 50 perce nt of their potential strength organizing additional guerrilla units expanding the communication system within the ao and wi th subordinate sector commands expanding the intelligence and ci nets emphasizing the organization of the civilian population 370 phase ii is normally the most critical period in the organization of guerrilla force the commander must ensure the guerrilla organization and its infrastructure supporting civilian population is w ell organized and strong enough ideologically to withstand heavy enemy politic and military pressure 321 fm 305201 figure 36 typical phase ii organization organization phase iii 371 during the third phase of organization figure 37 page 3 23 unified command is established over so areas often because of strong and competent leader emerging as the recognized commander in creased communication and liaison enhance control and coordination mong the various guerrilla forces and external so urces based on the mission assigned by higher hq input from the sfod is critical factor t he area commander makes an estimate of the situation and plans the mission the decision to conduct an operation results in an oplan that states requir ements for the area command staff sector commands and logistic elements portions of these tentative plans are then sent to subordinate comma nds the subordinate commanders determine th area commanders intent and prepare their own plans accordingly also during phase ii i command personnel methodically develop and expand effective ci and intelligen ce nets observe and enforce strict opsec measures determine what control measures the enemy has imposed on the civilian population 322 fm 305201 develop and implement programs of benefit to the populace for example developmental mca projects supported by psyop fforts to counter enemy propaganda and help elevate the morale of g uerrillas and loyal civilians execute training and wellplanned operations to improve the effectiveness of individuals and units infiltrate supplies from external sources to augment exist ing military equipment figure 37 typical phase iii organization 323 fm 305201 372 in addition the guerrilla force supported from an exter nal source develops cohesive military establishment able to firmly defend and strike with substantial force at selected target s general directives normally control guerrilla activities during this phase typical organiza tional expansion during phase iii may include building existing units up to authorized strength activating additional units prepositioning units closer to their tentative operational reas increasing efforts to organize the civilian population into n effective support mechanism 373 the joint commander makes every effort to develop bal anced guerrilla force trained and ready to negate the threat and carry out these activities assigned by the area command the organization of the guerrilla force depends on existing threat conditions and operational considerations within the jsoa if the threat is armor then the force shoul d taskorganize as an antiarmor force when practical the organization of the guerrilla force should closely parallel the organization of conventional forc to enhance mission c2 the single most important point about guerr illa forces is that they cannot be arbitrarily located or pinpointed due to t heir use of tactics flexibility and knowledge of the area in turn availab guerrilla manpower and material assets influence these missi ons and tactics they must also be careful not to reduce the inherent flexibility that the force r equires membership 374 the guerrilla force consists of people in different social classes and ethnic groups some of whom are often antagonistic toward eac h other they reflect variety of educational and aptitude categories with different interests and inclinations the guerrill leader depends on volunteers to increase the size of his force if he is incompetent or unpop ular or if the guerrillas suffer tactical reversals he will have diff iculties in getting more recruits the following quote serves as good representat ion of the underground auxiliary and guerrilla force relationship the people are the sea the revolutionaries are the fish t he sea supports the fish it also hides them from predators the revo lutionaries only want to show themselves when they are not themselves vu lnerable then they fade back into the sea or the mountains or t he jungles mao tsetung auxiliary 375 the success or failure of the guerrilla force depends on its ability to maintain logistic and intelligence support the auxilia ry fills these support functions by organizing civilians and conducting coordi nated support efforts its organization and mission depend upon metttc the ass istance of the civilian population is critical to the success of the resistance movement auxiliary units have their own combat support and under ground units the auxiliary primarily provides security in telligence and logistic support for the guerrilla force by using civilian supporters of the res istance the auxiliary 324 fm 305201 conducts clandestine support functions by organizing peop on regional district or sector basis depending on the degree to wh ich guerrilla forces are organized the auxiliary members screen all new potentia l underground members for opsec reasons all auxilia ry functions must first section off from each other and from the guerrilla forces they support thro ugh dead letter drops and other clandestine communications the guerr illa force needs the following clandestine support functions to supplement its own capabilities air land or maritime reception support internal systems for ac quisition of supplies internal systems to acquire operational information and intel ligence medical facilities for hospitalization treatment and rehabilitation of sick and wounded ci systems to deter enemy penetration attempts outer zone security for early warning to guerrilla forces systems and procedures for recruitment of personnel compartmented communication systems for various support funct ions current information on terrain weathe r civilians and local resources direct intelligence support especially in the outer secur ity zone of the guerrilla base camp deception operations support manufacture and maintenance of equipment transportation systems organization 376 an auxiliary command committee organizes civilian sympathizers into subordinate elements or uses them individually when possible the committee organizes subordinates into functionally compart mented structure figure 38 page 326 hist orically each subordinate auxiliary has had to perform several functions because of shortage of loya l personnel 377 the auxiliary normally organizes to coincide with or parallel the existing political system or administration this system ensures that an auxiliary unit assists ea ch community and the surrounding countryside 378 organization of auxiliary forces st arts at any level or at several levels simultaneously it is either centralized or decentrali zed the auxiliary establishes commands at each administ rative level for example at the regional county district loca l community or village level 379 command committee at each leve l controls and coordinates auxiliary activities within its aor in this respect the committ ee resembles the command group and staff of military unit at the lowest level one individual may perform two or three duties members of t he command committee are assigned specific duties such as security intelligence operations 325 fm 305201 communications transportation supply recruiting figure 38 auxiliary cell membership 380 members of the auxiliary are people who maintain perma nent residence in the denied sector or ao and have identifiable nd legitimate means of livelihood the auxiliary member s must appear in all respects to be average citizens they must be loyal to the resistance ca use people who are simply coerced or duped into supporting the resistance are not considered auxiliary members auxiliary components in sector or ao are normally satellites of local guerrilla forces they also provide supp ort to other guerrilla forces that normally do not operate within this jsoa or re gion 381 guerrilla forces depend on the civilian population for re cruits to replace operational losses and to expand their forces auxi liaries spot screen 326 fm 305201 and recruit personnel for active guerrilla forces if recruits are provided from reliable auxiliary sources the enemys chances of placin g agents in the guerrilla force are greatly reduced 382 the two most important keys to the survival and effectiveness of auxiliary members are maintaining an average citizen image and being extremely cautious about confiding in others examples of w hat not to do include failing to maintain an average citizen image being repeatedly absent from work without good explanation s showing an unusual concern about enemy activities failing to account for missing supplies appearing unusually nervous or habitually tired confiding too freely in strangers asking questions and unusual favors of people of questionabl loyalties being too eager to recruit people without adequate security chec ks security support 383 auxiliary members and units derive their protection by two principal meanstheir compartmented structure and their mode of ope ration under cover while enemy counterguerrilla activities often force t he guerrillas to move temporarily away from given areas the auxiliaries survive by remaining in place and conducting th eir activities to avoid detection individual auxiliary members carry on their normal day today routine while secretly carrying out the many facets of resistance activiti auxiliary units frequently use passive or neutral elements of the population t provide active support to the common cause they usually use such people on onetime basis because of the increased security ri sks involved 384 the demonstrated success of the friendly forces further enhances the ability of auxiliary forces to manipulate large segments of the neutral population the organization and use of the auxiliary vari from country to country or ao security must be the first thought when th auxiliary is organized the resistance movement depends heavily on th logistic support and early warning systems the auxiliary provides the res istance movement cannot survive without the support of its greatest assett he civilian population 385 auxiliary members continue participating in the l ife of their community to all appearances they present break from thei r daily routines and at the same time engage in resistance act ivities and operations such personnel are in fact leading double lives and their success in the resistance depe nds on their ability to keep that side of their lives secr et from all including family and friends the farmer by day supporter by night commonly called parttime guer rilla often is the forerunner to the fulltime guerrilla 386 the auxiliary leader assigns tasks to groups or indiv iduals according to their capability dependability an d the degree to which they are willing and able to participate those who unwittingly give suppor t or are coerced 327 fm 305201 into giving support are not considered auxiliaries pers onnel who sympathize strongly with the resistan ce movement but may be under surveillance by the enemy provide little value as auxiliary members other xamples of personnel who might prove more dangerous than profitable ar former political leaders or technicians employed by the enemy fun ctions that require travel or transportation might be performed by ch persons as foresters farmers fishermen or transportation workers in ddition these functions should if possible be covered by routine daily activities other duties such as security and warning require valid reason for remaining at given location over an extended period intelligence support 387 auxiliary members can give cons iderable intelligence support due to their athome status and their freedom of movement through out the ao the auxiliary organizes an extensive system of civilians who can keep enemy forces under surveillance and provide early warning of their movements individuals are selected because of advantageous locations that permit them to monitor the enemy 388 when engaged in specific intelligence operations sel ect personnel and informants because of their locations can surveil virtually every overt enemy activity the auxiliary also aids the ar ea command ci effort by maintaining watch over transitory civilians by screening recruits for guerrilla forces and by monitoring refugees and other personnel not indigenous t the area due to their intimate knowledge of the civilian population aux iliaries can identify attempts by enemy agents and local civilians sympathetic to the opposition or enemy forces in the area they can also name those civilian s whose loyalty to the resistance might be suspect au xiliary units collect information to support their own operations and those of the area command this information provides direct intelligence support to gu errilla forces operating within the aor 389 because the auxiliary members live and work among the civilian population at large they can inconspicuously observe enemy movements and activities they report sightings of interest to the guerri llas observers must have good reasons to justify their activities simply loitering in an area where the enemy is draws suspicion and causes the observer to b arrested and interrogated the best justification for an observers activities is that he or she works in the area examples are sales clerk in s tore near an enemy facility gas station operator in ga s station used by the enemy street cleaner near an enemy facility and fa rmer working in field beside road where enemy convoys are moving the auxiliary can be sensit ive to ci operations of the enemy such as the attempt to infiltrate the guerrillas with recruits who are actually spies 390 the area command controls auxiliary activities the uxiliary members responsibi lities relate to their civilian occupations such as construction workers with access to expl osives and related supplies doctors medical assistants pharmacists har dware store managers transportation workers and communications technicians 328 fm 305201 391 also civil service employees are excellent sources of information functions are compartmented so that if member of the au xiliary is compromised the information that he can reveal is lim ited and not time sensitive 392 the auxiliary also provides the guerrillas goods and services that relate to their civilian occupations it provides guerrilla recruiters with the names and addresses of prospective ne w guerrillas it can also tell the guerrillas of homes and places in the community that favor the resistance and can give support logistic support 393 most missions of the auxiliary supp ort the guerrilla forces in its area there are two methodsdirect support or area commanddirected support normally the auxiliary provides direct support missions fo r the guerrilla forces in its area the auxiliary supports guerrillas in ll phases of logistic operations the auxiliary provides transportation for supplies and equipment cares for the sick and wounded provides medical supplies arranges for doctors and other medical personnel collects food clothing and other pplies through controlled system of levy barter or contribution sometimes provides essential services such as repair of clo thing shoes and other items of equipment supplies personnel to help at reception sites 394 the extent of the logistic support given by the auxiliary depends on the resources of the area the degree of influence it exerts on the population and enemy activities when requisit ioning support the auxiliary must emphasize the righteousness of the resistance objectives and the commonality of resistance or population goals the resistance pends on the goodwill of the population and the steady i dont know replies to enem interrogators in cases where the population acts only halfheartedly for the resistance some civilians are willing to help by bein g observers scouts or messengers home guard 395 the home guard is the paramilitary arm of the auxilia ry force the various command committees control home guards all auxil iary elements do not necessarily organize home guards home guards perform many missions for the auxiliary forces such as tactic missions guarding of caches and training of recruits their degree of organization and training depends upon the extent of effective enemy control in the area psychological operations 396 very important mission in which auxiliary unit s assist is psyop which must be integrated and synchronized at all level s to achieve its full forcemultiplier potential the spreading of rumors leaflets and posters is timed with guerrilla tactical missions to deceive the enem the spreading of 329 fm 305201 conveyed selected information usually involves little r isk to the disseminator and is very difficult for the enemy to control populace and resources control 397 the auxiliary employs populace and resources control prc measures to minimize or eliminate black marketing and profiteering and to demonstrate to the enemy the power of the guerrilla movement prc consists of the following two distinct but related concepts populace controls provide security for the populace mobilize human resources deny personnel to the enemy and detect and red uce the effectiveness of enemy agents populace control measures inc lude curfews movement restrictions travel permits registration cards and resettlement of villagers dc oper ations and noncombatant evacuation operations neo are two special categories of populace cont rol that require extensive planning and coordination among various m ilitary and nonmilitary organizations r sources ls regulate the movement or consumption of materiel resources mobilize mate riel resources and deny materiel to the enemy resources control measures include licensing regulations or guidelines checkpoints for example roadblocks ration trols amnesty programs and inspection of facilities tro 398 to perform prc and give the enemy an impression of guer rilla power the auxiliary establishes legal control system to h elp prevent black marketing and profiteering the auxiliary may use subtle coercion or other stricter means to control collaborators evasion and recovery 399 the auxiliary is ideally suited for the support of er mechanisms contact with and control over segments of the civilian p opulation provide the area commander secure means of aiding evaders 3100 the auxiliary members receive conceal and transport resistance personnel who are infiltrating into or exfiltrating out of t he jsoa they also receive and conceal guerrillas who have been wounded or parated from their units during hostilities other support missions 3101 the auxiliary may be called up on to perform several other guerrilla support missions such as coordinating actions with the guerrillas against their targets for example the auxiliary may conduct min or acts of sabotage such as cutting telephone lines reversing street signs giving false information and obstructing troop movements it may also support guerr illa missions by furnishing guides operating courier systems conducting active guerrillatype operations on limited b asis raising funds 330 fm 305201 underground 3102 the underground supports the area command auxiliary and guerrilla force based on metttc these personnel commit s abotage intelligence gathering and acts of deception through the ction arm intelligence supply and personnel sections trainers velop guerrilla metl after mission analysis and apply it to metttc organization 3103 the underground organizes into compartmented cells figures 39 and 310 page 332 it forms these cell s within various political subdivisions of the sector or area such as the us equivalents of countie s towns and neighborhoods the underground environment may be urban or rur fm 305220 includes further discussion on cell organization figure 39 underground operations cell 331 fm 305201 figure 310 underground intelligence cell 3104 if member of the underground is compromised the information that he can reveal is limited command committee organizes and controls underground activities the committee members perform dut ies and responsibilities based on their skills and the degree of ri sk they are willing to accept 3105 for security reasons the size of the underground is kept as small as possible the underground receives evaders downed pilots an d other key people it hides people and moves them as needed or moves t hem out of the jsoa entirely the auxiliary also moves and hides peo ple within its sector of operation however the underground can move people across t he entire area complex it has system of safe houses that have been c arefully selected 332 fm 305201 and prepared to hide these people it velops procedures so that people can be moved along selected routes at the best times to avoid d etection the underground moves them in falsebottom containers to include laun dry carts fish crates vehicles furniture and caskets it also moves sensitive documents and equipment in similar manner 3106 to support other operations particularly those involvin g the smuggling of personnel and materials the underground commits acts of deception to steal bonafide documents identification id cards passes ration coupons money and passports and use them under false pretenses if the underground cannot obtain the bona fide documents it prep ares facsimiles membership 3107 the underground member needs to apply traditional b ehavior patterns to create positive image he is frequently pr ohibited from taking anything from the people without paying for it he may even have to befriend certain segments of the population to influence them in suppor t of the movement he strives to conform to the normal behavi or and daily activities of his neighborhood by appearing conventional and inconsp icuous he makes it difficult for the security force to detect identify or f ind him without records or physical evidence he is difficult to link to the organization contact and communications between members are key survival and critical points of subversive operations 3108 the underground normally contains more specialists and technicians than either the guerrilla or auxiliary components ideally they are able to conduct combat operations in sr da and uw also they sh ould possess the ability experience and equipment necessary to prepare l types of counterfeit documents and be able to produce counterfeit money 3109 to survive and be effective member of the underg round must exhibit many positive personality traits necessary to endure hardship and he must be highly selfmotivated among these traits he must be technically and tactically proficient in combat skills stealth and selfdiscipline maintain and display an inconspicuous average citizen image toward the enemy be very cautious about confiding in others secrecy and dedication to the cause come before any personal benefit allowing for greater longevity nature of operations 3110 underground operations can be clandestine covert an d overt these operations have major similarities with those of both the guerrillas and the auxiliary some involve overt and violent actions and ot hers are passive the following paragraphs discuss the undergrounds relationship to other elements of the resistance 3111 underground cells support the operations of the guer rillas and auxiliary within their sector commands with acts of deception sabotage 333 fm 305201 and movement of personnel and equi pment underground cells cooperate closely with other underground counterparts in their sectors and throughout the area complex cooperation enables successful movement of personnel and equipment in and out of the jsoa 3112 the guerrillas and auxiliary ar more independent only in rare coordinated operations does the underground work with its co unterparts in other sectors 3113 the underground may commit acts of violence or sabotage to interdict enemy operations and movements 3114 the underground may publish resistance newsletter or newspaper promoting the resistance cause among th civilian populati on in countries with controlled media system private publication of this nature will be of high interest however the underground must anticipate enemy reprisals for possession of the paper so the enemy will probably search for the printing press defense against this threat is to print the p aper outside the jsoa and smuggle it into the country storing the supply in various locations 3115 the underground may engage in covert operations to disseminate embarrassing or incriminating information about the enemy or its officials these revelations may inflame existing problems in sensi tive areas and degrade the enemys rapport with the civilian population or cause dissension in the enemys ranks training the resist ance organization 3116 major part of the sfods missi on is to plan organize conduct and evaluate training of selected resistance cadre this work prepares the sfod to be trainers and force multipliers for the resistance organ ization during premission planning the sfod develops tentative training plan based on metttc the sfod members prepare the training plan poi and training aids in the indigenous language if possible they incl ude sand tables with toy soldiers and vehicles as instru ction aids after commitment into the jsoa sfod members evaluate the present level of the resis tance forces training and update the initial training plan or mo dify it to ensure its effectiveness training plan 3117 the training plan outlines how the sfod will best accomplish its training objective sfod members develop the training p lan in isolation based on an estimate of the training situation by the pilo t team important factors in developing the training plan are mission per sonnel time facilities and organization for training other cons iderations are weather climate and the enemy situation mission 3118 based on operational directives from higher hq the sfo d determines the specific tasks conditio ns and standards the resistance forces must accomplish if the resistance forc has to conduct multiple missions the sfod must set up priorities for tr aining because guerrilla travels 334 fm 305201 primarily on his feet he must unde rgo rigorous physical training and numerous crosscountry marches time 3119 the available training time is critical factor the shorter the training time the more time is taken to define the training objectives sfod personnel will lose training time because of operational requirements they must include makeup training as an in tegral part of the training program facilities 3120 the sfod will advise the area command and resistance force on selecting and establishing ranges training areas impr ovised classrooms training aids and other training facili ties security is of prime importance the sfod locates ranges and training areas away from the base camp it can m k s m l l v l l w i t h r i l c n c l m n t r m n m d t u n n l i n t singlelane ranges air and bb rifles are excellent alternate inexpensive training aids in lieu of full caliber marksman ship training political training 3121 politically or religiously extreme insurgents use frequent criticism and selfcriticism sessions as form of catharsis venting these sessions allow members to voice fears and proble ms and to hear from other members an individual who is disillusioned with the resistance movement will find it difficult to conceal his true feelings in these sessions he will become influenced by what his friends and co mrades think of him ideologically oriented unit leaders are more cohesive and effective in their training cadres in each unit must set the politically correct examp during these daily training sessions they must continua lly reinforce rankandfile members assuring them that what they are doing is needed to carr out the will of the people such confidence will elevate morale and fighting s pirit equal importance should be attached to the military and po litical aspects of the oneyear consolidation and training program which has just begun and the two aspects should be integrated at the start stress should be placed on the political aspect on improving rel ations between officers and men enhancing internal unity and arousing high level of enthusiasm among the masses of cadres and fighters only thus will the military consolidation and training proceed smoothly and attain better results mao tsetung 1945 training the guerrilla force 3122 sfod members evaluate how well the guerrillas are tra ined through personal observations and inspection s and the results of limited easy combat missions characteristics of the guerrilla force that may present obstacles to trai ning include wide range of education and military experience different personal motivation for joining the force 335 fm 305201 possible language and dialect barriers requiring tra ining through interpreters training organization 3123 the requirements for physical security in the jsoa dictate that guerrilla forces be dispersed over wide area consequently the system and organization for training are decent ralized and handson training is emphasized the sfod must train the guerrilla cadre and ter help this cadre in additional training and combat employment throughout the organization development and training phases of guerrilla activities the guerrillas conduct limited combat operations these acti ons support training instill confidence and test the readiness of the force t he goals of these combat operations are to attract additional recruits to the guerrilla force assist in gaining popular support from the civilian pop ulation allow the area command and sfod an opportunity to evaluat the training increase the morale and esprit corps of the guerrilla forces with initial successful combat operations training methods 3124 the sfod generally uses the threetier concept for t raining this concept is similar to the us army red green and amber training cycle it allows for onethird of the guerrilla forces in training on ethird providing security for the training and onethird providing support or doing smallscale operations the threetier concept accommodates the trainin g of any size unit 3125 generic poi development is the same anywhere trainer s base all training basic advanced and specialized on metttc nd the current combat skills of the guerrillas they modify the training after contact with the guerrilla force appendix j outlines generic guerrilla poi 3126 trainers base all training basic advanced and specialized on metttc and the current combat skills of the guerrillas they may modify the training after contact with the guerrilla force as for the training courses the main objective should still b to raise the level of technique in marksmanship bayoneting grenadethrow ing and the like and the secondary objective should be to raise the level of tactics while special emphasis should be laid on night perations mao tsetung 1946 basic training 3127 metttc determines the need for base camps within the js oa all guerrillas including the area command may receive basic training each base camp may conduct its basic training in sectors indepe ndent of the other two or it may conduct part of basic training and rotate t another camp for more training either the sfod or guerrillas may rotate the ba camps may 336 fm 305201 construct ranges and training areas for their use or one bas camp may construct range and teach all marksmanship classes another base camp may construct training areas for raids and the other may construct areas for ambushes and reconnaissance the present combat abilities of the guerrillas and the threat determine how much basic training is needed 3128 basic training contains subjec ts on small arms first aid land navigation and political or psyop cla sses the time allotted for training needs to be flexiblebetween 21 and 31 days depending on t he knowledge and abilities of the force advanced training 3129 each base camp conducts some advanced training or r otates to other base camps for additional training this concept is similar to basic training and the guerrillas or sfod may rotate trainers can conduct medical and demolitions training in one base camp communications and intelligence in another and tactics operations and heavy weapons in t he third at the end of the advanced training period the guerrillas or sfod wo uld rotate to another base camp for new training cy cle for security reasons all the engineer communications medical and intelligence sergea nts should not be in the same sector base camp at the same time 3130 advanced training may last from 40 to 80 days t his phase consumes the most time but it also pays the most dividends some bjects covered in greater depth include combat orders machine guns tacti cs survival and moss of medical communications weapons and demolition s specialized training 3131 specialized training is broadly subdivided into ementary and advanced specialized training personnel and units assigned to the theater sf may have received elementary specialized training if not such training becomes responsibility of the theater sf commander speci alized training elementary and advanced is conducted by training c enter operated by the theater sf 3132 elementary specialized training consists of training individuals and teams to carry out their assigned func tions intensive courses are conducted and include the following map reading and sketching patrolling close combat physical training fieldcraft tactics of both regular and guerrilla forces demolitions and techniques of sabotage use and care of weapons including those of the enemy forces first aid use of enemy and civilian motor transportation 337 fm 305201 enemy organization and methods methods of organizing and training

training individuals are organized into the teams in which they w ill be employed thereafter the group trains lives and operates as unit u nder simulated conditions of the area where they are to be employed special techniques skills and orientation are stressed to enable them to carry out their mission and to weld them into efficient mob ile and selfsufficient teams parachute or amphibious training is given depending on the cont emplated means of entering enemy territory 3134 besides the training outlined above technical train ing is given to radio operators medical technician s demolition experts and other specialists training staff and auxil iary or underground personnel 3135 while the sfod members are training the guerrilla f orce the sfod commander adc and team sergeant are training the area co mmand and staff sector commander and staff and selected members of th auxiliary or underground the area commander and his staff may train in the same base camp with his guerrillas although the area command and auxiliary or underground may be trained anywhere in the jsoa it shoul d be compartmented for security reasons fm 305220 provides more information on training the auxiliary and underground in advanced so techniques training through interpreters 3136 historically sfod members in uw environment hav been faced with social and political power struggle when they tr ied to select an interpreter to work with them the st ruggle has not always been to their advantage the next few paragraphs discuss some tips on how to select an interpreter and avoid some of the oftenrepeated pitfalls native speaker 3137 the ideal interpreter would be native speaker from the ao who knows most of the area dialects his speech grammar back ground and social mannerisms should be understandable to the students if he fits this ideal description the students will listen to what he says not how he says it the students will understand the interpreter social status 3138 an interpreter often is limited in his effectiveness with students if his social standing is considerably lower than that of his stu dents there may be significant differences among the students and the interp reter in military rank or memberships in ethnic or religious groups when st udents are 338 fm 305201 officers it may be best to have an office r or civilian act as an interpreter on the other hand if students are enlisted personnel an of ficer interpreter might intimidate the students and stifle class partici pation an enlisted interpreter would be the best choice in this case most cultures recognize technical competence and international differences in militar structure so there should be problem for the sfod despite personal feeli ngs on social status the instructors job is to train ll students equally not act as an agent of social reform in foreign land the instructor must accept local customs as way of life english fluency 3139 if the sfod instructor and interpreter can commun icate with each other in english the interpreters command of english is adequate the instructor can check the interpreters vel of understanding by asking him to paraphrase in english what the instru ctor has just said if the interpreter restates the comments corre ctly both are reading off the same sheet of music intelligence 3140 the interpreter should be quick alert and responsi ve to changing conditions and situations he must be able to grasp complex concepts and discuss them without confusion in logical sequence educ ation does not equate to intelligence but better educat ed interpreters will be more effective due to experience and maturity technical ability 3141 if the interpreter has technical training or experien ce in the instructors subject area he will be more effective since he will translate meaning as well as words doct or could interpret for medic and former military personnel could in terpret best for the weapons and intelligence sergeants reliability 3142 an instructor must be leery of any interpreter who arrives late for the class many cultures operate on flexible clock where t ime is relatively unimportant the interpreter must understand the concept of punctuality also it is safe to assume that any interpreters firs t loyalty is to his country not to the united states the security implications are c lear the instructor must be very cautious in explaining concepts to give the interpreter greater depth of understanding also some interpreters for political or personal reasons may have hidden agenda when they appl for the job compatibility 3143 the instructor must establish rapport with his int erpreter early in their relationship and maintain compatibility through out their joint effort mutual respect and understanding are essential to effectiv instruction some rapportbuilding subjects to discuss with the interpr eter are history geography ethnic groups political system prominent poli tical figures 339 fm 305201 monetary system business agriculture exports and hobbies the sfod member is building friendship on daily basis 3144 if several qualified interpreters are available the instructor should select at least two the exhausting na ture of the job makes halfday of active interpreting the maximum for peak efficiency one interpreter however skilled will seldom be enough except for shortt erm courses conducted at leisurely pace if two or more interpreters are available one of them can sit in the rear of the class and provide quality control of the instruction by crosschecking the active interpreter meanwhile additional interpreters can conduct rehearsals grade examinations and evaluate the exercises mature judgment and genuine concern that th students are learning important skills go long way toward accompl ishing the mission 3145 good instructors will tactfu lly ask about their interpreters background with genuine concern they ask about the inter preters family aspirations career and education they can start with his home life its very important to him and is neutral territ ory instructors can follow up with discussion of cultural traditions to find out more about hi m and the land he lives in 3146 the instructor should gain his interpreters trust and confidence before embarking on sensitive issues such as sex politics and religion he must approach these areas carefully and tactfully they may be useful and revealing in the professional relationship between inst ructor and interpreter once this stage is reached the two are well on their wa to valuable friendship and firm profe ssional working relationship training the interpreters 3147 very early on the instructor conveys to the interp reter that he will always direct the training however he must stress how important the interpreter is as link to the studen ts he can appeal to the interpreters professional pride by describing how the quality and quant ity of learning are dependent on his interpreting skills and his ability t function as conduit between instructor and students the in structor must also stress patriotism that the defense of his country is directly related to h is ability to transfer the instructors knowledge to the students 3148 because of cultural differences interpreters may attempt to save face by concealing their lack of understanding they may ttempt to translate what they think the instructor meant without asking for clarification disinformation and confusion result for the students ultimately when the students realize they have been misle d they question the instructors credibility not the in terpreters if the instructor has established rapport with his interpreter he is in better position to appeal to the interpreters sense of duty honor and country m utual understanding allows for clarification when needed ads to more accurate interpretation and keeps the instructor informed of any student difficulties conducting the training 3149 to prepare for teaching the instructor must have initial lesson plans available for basic advanced and specialized training he must also have on 340 fm 305201 hand the available supporting document ation such as fms when the class begins the instructor should express the training objective in measurable performance t erms outline the course content with methods of instruction and t he various training aids to be demonstrated and then used by the stud ents supply and circulate all class handout material when needed m d i f t h t r i n i n g s c h d u l t l l w m r t i m t t r i n f r i g n students due to language and translation constraints 3150 glossary of terms is valuable aid for the instru ctor and the interpreter many english words and phrases do not trans late literally into many foreign languages technical rms need to be clearly defined well ahead of class listing of the most common terms and t heir translated meaning will be useful product 3151 the instructor presents bitesized information tailo red to the student audience he talks directly to the students in relax ed and confident manner the interpreter watches the instructor carefully an d emulates his style and delivery as he interprets for the students durin g the translation the instructor observes the interpreter to detect any proble ms the interpreter will do some editing as function of the interpreting process but it is imperative that he transmits the instructor s meaning without additions or deletions wellcoordinated effort is the key to success 3152 although maximum improvisation must be used in ll phases of operations the following items accompanying deployed d etachments may prove useful in conducting training grease pencils and colored chalk target cloth or ponchos blackboard substitutes basic manuals on weapons generally found in the area in the language of the country if possible graphic training aids improvised from parachutes or othe r such material student questions 3153 whenever students have questions the interpreter immedi ately relays them to the instructor for an answer the students t hen realize the instructor not the interpreter is the sm and is in charge of the class when problem occurs neither the instructor nor the interpreter corrects each other in front of the students they must settle all diff erences in professional manner 3154 rapport is as important between student and instruc tor as it is between interpreter and instructor when the interpreter an d instructor treat the students as mature valuable people capable of lear ning rapport will build easily between the students and the instruct or communication 3155 an instructor learns by experience that way to c ommunicate is through an interpreter use of profanit slang colloquialisms and military 341 fm 305201 jargon with students is harmful often these expressions c annot be translated and do not come out with the desired meaning i f he must use technical term or expression the instructor makes sure the i nterpreter conveys the proper meaning in the indigenous language transitional phrases 3156 transitional phrases tend to confuse the learning process and waste valuable time expr essions such as for example and in most cases or qualifiers such as maybe or perhaps are difficult to translate many native interpreters have learned much of th eir english from reading rather than hearing english spoken the instructor keeps the class pre sentation as simple as possible using short words and phrases taboo gestures 3157 social and cultural restrictions will manifest themse lves during class gestures are learned behavior and vary from culture to cult ure if the instructor doesnt know he should ask the interpreter to r elate the cultural taboos before class and avoid them the instructor should k now before class when it is proper to stand sit or cross legs if the index finger chin or eyes may be used for pointing if nodding of the head means yes or manner of speaking 3158 the instructor should try to look at the students nd talk directly to them not the interpreter he speaks slowly and clearly and repeats himself as needed the instructor should not address the students in the third person through the interpreter instead he should say something l ike im glad to be your instructor and not tell them im glad to be their instructor 3159 the instructor must speak to the students as if they will understand every word he says he must convey enthusiasm and use all of the gestures movements voice intonations and inflections he would us for an english speaking audience the students will reflect the same amou nt of energy interest and enthusiasm that the instructor conveys to them the instructor must not let the interpreter sabotage training with l ess than animated delivery and presentation of the material 3160 when the interpreter is translating and the student s are listening to get the full meaning of the translation the instructor s hould do nothing that could be distracting these distractions might be pacing t he floor writing on the blackboard drinking water or carrying on with othe r distracting activities 3161 the interpreter should be checked periodically to ma ke sure the students understand the instructors meaning cadre mem ber qualified in the native language may observe and comment on the interpr eters knowledge skills and abilities when the instructor has been misunderstood the point needs to be made clear imme diately if further clarification is needed the instructor should phrase the instruction diff erently and illustrate the point as necessary 342 fm 305201 combat employment 3162 north vietnamese general giap wrote in his book the military art of peoples war we strike to win strike only when success is certain if its not then dont strike this simple straightforward idea for conducting combat operations is the key concept an sfod advising guerril should never disregard operations 3163 the guerrilla force should ca refully select plan and execute uw combat operations to ensure success wi th minimum number of casualties combat defeat in the early stages of training demoralizes the guerrilla force combat operations should be commensurate with the status of tr aining and equipment available to the resistance force as training is completed and units are organized guerrilla forces with sf assistanc can plan and execute smallscale combat operations against soft easy targets an important confidence builder later they progress to larger an d more complex targets principles for success 3164 successful uw combat operations depend on five principles those principles are speed of movement surp rise low enemy morale security and collaboration with the local population speed of movement 3165 to achieve speed guerrillas practice rapid force concen tration and rapid deployment from march formations they also practice movements and attacks during periods of limited visibility pursui t of disorganized enemy units with little time wasted on reorganization after an gagement and fast withdrawals guerrillas use an mss and travel light to increase their element of speed and surprise surprise 3166 to surprise the enemy guerrillas plan to conduct and integrate deception operations into every uw mission low enemy morale 3167 guerrillas take advantage of every opportunity to underm ine enemy morale by including psyop security 3168 guerrillas prepare the battlefield as far in advance s possible reconnaissance elements gather all available information on the terrain installations enemy units and civilian activities t hey also reconnoiter escape and withdrawal routes well in advance collaboration with the local population 3169 the auxiliary in the area provides the guerrillas in formation transportation supplies hi deouts and guides familiar with the objective 343 fm 305201 security within the area of operations 3170 the ao requires special security measures that apply particularly to insurgent forces the survival of the insurgents depends u pon constant vigilance on the part of every member of the organization plus the ability to transmit warnings effective ci is also essential secur ity measures must prevent losses by enemy action ensure freedom of action and nimize interruption of insurgent activities depe ndable security can be achieved by intensive training in security discipline establishment of warning systems and extensive ci responsibility 3171 the area commander is responsible for the overall secu rity of the insurgent forces although commander s of subordinate units must take individual measures for their own local protection the ch ief of the security section of the area command controls all security operatio ns except ci he prescribes necessary measures and coordinates those adopt ed by subordinate commanders ci is the responsibility of the chief of the i ntelligence section of the area command again subordinate commanders must blish local ci for their own security factors affecting security 3172 security measures developed by th chief of the security section of the area command are affected by the following factors mission local situation of individual units physical characteristics of the ao the enemy situation capabilities and limitations of the insurgent forces considerations affecting the civilian population operations of conventional and coalition forces 3173 during the early phases of insurgent warfare the ssion of insurgent forces will necessitate organization of ci s ystem alongside the intelligence system development of communications sy stem that will facilitate warnings and establishment of physical curity for installations particular attention should be directed toward the enemy s state of internal security formations and their intell igence and communications systems 3174 military actions against the enemy initiated duri ng the early phases of operations should be planned and executed in such way that they will not lead to wholesale enemy antiinsurgent activity reprisals against the civilian population or compromise of external logistical support in the latter stages of insurgent warfare operations are not cu rtailed for security reasons because the established security system provides greater protection for the insurgents also insurgent control over the area may riv the enemys own influence 344 fm 305201 principles of security 3175 insurgent forces avoid larg concentration of troops even though logistical conditions may permit large tr oop concentrations commands should be broken down into smaller units and wi dely dispersed the dispersion of forces facilitates concealment mobility nd secrecy large forces may be concentrated to perform specific operation but on completion of the operation they should again be quickly dispersed 3176 the principle of dispersion is applied to command serv ice and technical installations large insurgent hq for exampl is divided into several echelons and scattered over the area 3177 in the event of wellconducted largescale enemy oper ation against the insurgent force the area commander may find it necessa ry to order the division of units into smaller groups to achieve greater dispersion and facilitate escape from encirclement this action should be t aken only when all other means of evasive action are exhausted because such disp ersion renders the force inoperative for considerable period of time lowe rs the morale of insurgents and weakens the will of th civilians to resist to assure successful reassemb ly of dispersed units emer gency plans must include alternate assembly areas 3178 all insurgent installations and forces must have high degree of mobility their evacuation pl ans must ensure that all traces of insurgent activity are eliminated before abandonment of the ar ea 3179 forces can maintain evacuation mobility by ensuring that equipment that must be moved can be disassembled into oneman loads th area commander ensures suitable caches are provided for equipme nt that would reduce mobility materiel that could provide intelligence for the enemy is destroyed the area is policed and signs of the route of withdrawal are eliminated security of information 3180 information concerning insurgent operations is limited to those who need to know it only necessary copies are made or maintained each person is given only that inform ation that is needed to accomplish his mission special efforts are made to restrict the amount of information given to indi viduals who are exposed to capture 3181 administrative records are kept to minimum ar cached and the location made known only to required few whenever possib references to names and places are coded and the key to the code is g iven on needto know basis records that are longer of value to operations or for future reports must be destroyed 3182 strict security discipli ne is necessary and all security measures must be rigidly enforced security instruction of personnel must be extensive they must be impressed with the importa nce of not divulging information concerning in surgent activities to persons not requiring it individuals seeking such in formation must be reported to proper authorities 345 fm 305201 3183 security violations are ex tremely serious an d demand severe punishment all cases involving possible breach of curity must be reported immediately 3184 the key to successful security of information however is the individual insurgent himself who must always be securityconscious one careless individual can destroy the best security system devised 3185 during the training phase curity consciousness must be stressed special emphasis should be placed on safeguarding documents security of information and re sistance agains t interrogation security of movement 3186 security of movement can be pr ovided only by an accurate knowledge of the enemys location and strength intelligence rega rding enemy disposition and activities is essential the intelligence section of the area command informed through its various nets must provide t his vital information for security of movement 3187 after the routes have been lected the units must be briefed on enemy activity primary and alternate routes dispersal nd reassembly areas along the way and security measures to be observed route if the route leads through areas outside insurgent influence auxilia ry civilian organizations must provide security of movement for the in surgents security of installations 3188 most installations are located in isolated regions known as insurgent base of operations or guerrilla base they are mobile and are secured by guards and warning systems alternate locations are prepa red in advance so that any installation threatened by enemy action can be ev acuated from the endangered base area to more secure area location of thes alternate areas is given to personnel only on needtoknow basis 3189 physical security of installati ons will include terrain ci this may vary from simple deceptive measures ch as camouflage or destruction and reversal of road signs and mileposts to the creation of physical barriers such as roadblocks and demolition of road beds and bridges the use of civilian guides to misdirect enemy troops for example into ambus h can also be effective trizonal security system 3190 typical means of providing adequate security for th insurgent base area is trizonal security system this system provides t he following series of warning nets zon is the insurgent base area itself it is secured by reg ular guard system but it largely depends for its safety upon ad vance warnings received by clandestine agents in zone c or pos ted observers in zone b if enemy action threatens the insurgents mov to another location before the arrival of enemy forces zon b lying beyond the populated zone c is territory not well controlled by the enemy in which the insurgent forces can oper ate 346 fm 305201 overtly it is usually open rugged terrain and the war ning system depends upon stationed observers watching for enemy movements in the area zon c the farthest from the insurgent base area is usually w ell populated and is located inside enemycontrolled territory enemy security forces police and military units exercis relatively effective control and the populace may be predominately hostile to th insurgents at the same time there are excellent and ra pid locs whereby clandestine agents are able to warn the insurgents q uickly of enemy activity this area is known as the clandestine zo ne and the functions of the warning system are the responsibility of the underground security of communications 3191 insurgent communica tions facilities are rigidly regulated by the soi these measures include restriction on what may be transmitted the use of codes and ciphers and means of concealment deception an d authentication particular emphasis is placed on restricting time and number of radio transmissions to the absolute minimum counterintelligence 3192 insurgent security depends not only on security measures taken to safeguard information installations and communications but also on an active ci program to neutralize the enemys intelligence sys tem and especially to prevent the penetration of insurgent forces by ene my agents 3193 the intelligence section of the area command implement s the ci program specially selected and traine d ci personnel carefully screen all members of the insurgent organization and protect the insurgents from enemy infiltration ci personnel also carry on an active ca mpaign of deception disseminating false information to mislead the enem 3194 ci personnel must keep constant check on the civil ian population of the area through clandestine sources to ensure against t he presence of enemy agents within their midst civilians upon whom the insur gents depend heavily for support may compromise the insurgent warfare effort as easily as disloyal insurgent may 3195 false rumors and false information concerning insurgent strength location operations training and eq uipment can be disseminated by ci through clandestine nets facts may be di storted intentionally to minimize or exaggerate insurgent capabilities at any given time alth ough such activities are handled within the intelligence section they must be co ordinated with the security section in order to preven t inadvertent violations of security outlaw bands 3196 outlaw bands operating as insurgents also endan ger insurgent security by alienating th civilian population thro ugh their depredation the area commander cannot tolerate outlaw bands which are t willing to join the organized insurgent effort every effort must be made to pe rsuade these 347 fm 305201 bands to join forces if all other methods fail it may be necessary to conduct operations against these groups reaction to enemy operations 3197 inexperienced insurgent commanders and troops are of ten inclined to move too soon and too frequently to escape enemy troops condu cting anti insurgent operations unnecessary movement caused by the presence of the enemy may expose insurgents to greater risks than remaini ng calm and concealed such moves disrupt operations and reduce security by dislodging previously established nets and expo sing insurgents to enemy agents informants and collaborators defensive operations 3198 defensive operatio ns are exceptional forms of combat for guerrilla forces the guerrilla force may engage in defensive operatio ns to prevent enemy penetration of guerrillacontrolled areas gain time for their forces to accomplish specific mission assemble their main forc for counterattacks 3199 guerrillas normally lack support ing fire artillery antitank weapons and other weapons to face conventional forces historically guerrillas have avoided prolonged position type of defense when committed they modify the principles of defensive operations to best meet their needs and offset the difficulties they are aware of their limitations the g uerrillas choose the terrain that gives them every possible advantage they seek ter rain that denies or restricts the enemys use of armor and complicates his logistic support in the guerrillaposition defense they raid ambu sh and attack the enemys locs flanks reserve units and supporting arms nd installations the guerrillas provide camouflaged sniper fire on officers radio operators and other highvalue targets they mine or boobytrap ap proach and departure routes 3200 guerrillas may resort to defensive operations to cont ain enemy forces in position favorable for attacking thei r flanks or rear they often begin or intensify diversionary actions in adja cent areas to distract the enemy guerrillas use skillful ruses to lure the attacking forc into dividing their troops or hold objectives pending the arrival of conventiona l or allied coalition forces offensive operations 3201 the degree to which the offensive operations of guerr illa forces can be sustained depends in the long run on the base camp support available to them when operating remotely from or not with conventional forces the guerrilla forces establish and hold bases of their own t hey locate their bases if available with view to isolatio n and difficulty of approach by the opposing forces they also consider strong defensive ch aracteristics and closeness to neighboring supporting states the bases should b organized for defense and tenaciously defended by trained motivated forces fm 78

significant impact on the output of the targeted system subsystem or complex and at the highest level on the threats ability to make or sustain war criticality depends on several factors how rapidly will the impact of target destruction affect enemy operations what percentage of output is curtailed by target damage is there an existence of substitutes for the output product or service what is the number of targets and their position in th system or complex flow diagram 3204 accessibility is the ease with which target can be reached either physically or by fire target is accessible when an action element can physically infiltrate the target or if the target can be h it by direct or indirect fire accessibility varies with the infi ltration and exfiltra tion the survival and evasion and security situation route to and at the ta rget and the need for barrier penetration climbing and so on at the tar get the use of standoff weapons should always be considered when evaluating accessi bility survivability of the attacker is usually most closely cor related to targets accessibility 3205 recuperabili is measure of the time required to replace repair or bypass the destruction or damage inflicted on the target recuperability varies with the sources and ages of targeted components nd with the availability of spare parts the existence of economic embarg oes and the technical resources of the enemy nation will influence recupe rability t 3206 vulnerability is measure of the ability of the action element to damage the target using available assets both men and material target is vulnerable if the unit has the capability and expertise to successfully attack it vulnerability depends on the nature and construction of the target amount of damage required assets available manpower transportation weapons expl osives and equipment 3207 effect is the positive or negative in fluence on the population as result of the action taken effect considers public rea ction in the vicinity of 349 fm 305201 the target but also considers the domestic and internati onal reaction as well effects to consider include the following will reprisals against friendlies result will national psyop themes be reinforced or contradicted will exfiltration or evasion be helped or hurt what will be the allied and domestic reaction will the enemy population be alienated from its governme nt or will it become more supportive of the government note effect is often neutral at the tactical level 3208 recognizability is the degree to which target can be recognized under varying weather light and seasonal conditions with out confusion with other targets or components factors that influence recogni zability include the size and complexity of the target the existence of dis tinctive target signatures and the technical sophistication and traini ng of the attackers 3209 target selection factors may be used to construct carver matrix the matrix is decision tool for rating the relative desir ability of potential targets and for wisely allocating attack resources figure 311 page 351 to construct the matrix analysts list the potential target s in the left column for strategiclevel analysis analysts li st the enemys systems or subsystems electric power rail fo r tacticallevel analysis analysts list the complexes or components of the subsystems selected for attack by their h igher hq 3210 next analysts develop concrete criteria for evaluating each carver factor for instance time may be used to evaluate criticality if loss of component results in an immediate halt of output then that component is very critical if loss of the component results in lt of output but only after several days or weeks then that component is less cri tical similarly percentage of output curtailed might be used as the eval uation criterion 3211 once the evaluation criteria ve been established analysts use numerical rating system for example 1to5 or 1to10 to r ank the carver factors for each potential target in 1to10 numbering sys tem score of 10 would indicate very desirable rating from the attackers point of view and score of 1 would reflect an undesirable rating the evalua tion criteria and numerical rating scheme shown are only included as exam ples the analyst must tailor the criteria and rating scheme to suit the particular strategic or tactical situation and the particular targets being analyzed 3212 the area commander considers the possible adverse eff ects target destruction will have on future operations and the civilian population targets that will hinder or hurt the civilian population may be attacked only as last resort the goal is to diminish the enemys mil itary potential not destroy the only footbridge in the area for civilians to go to work however an improperly timed operation may provoke enemy counteraction for which resistance units and the ci vilian population are unprepared an unsuccessful guerrilla attack often may have disastro us effects on troop morale successful operations raise morale and increase pres tige in the eyes of the civilians making them more willing to provide support psyop exploi t the impact of 350 fm 305201 successful raids if raid is unsuccessful psyop person nel need to diminish the adverse effects on the frie ndly local indigenous force figure 311 sample carver matrix 3213 although detailed the plan for raid must be pra ctical and simple the raid force commander plans activities so that the tar get is not alerted he carefully considers time available allowing enough time for assembly and movement the best hours for the oper ation are between midnight and dawn when limited visibility ensures surpri personnel favor early dusk when knowledge of the installation is limited or other factors re quire tight control of the operation successful guerrilla withdrawal late in the day or at night makes close coordinated pursuit by the enemy much more diff icult 3214 the commander must strictly enforce opsec measures during planning only those personnel directly involved with the operation must be informed civilian sympathizers shou ld never be informed of upcoming operations unless they provide support to the guerrilla forces personnel should carefully rehearse all raids and contingencies u sing realtime and full size mockups they must also select and rehearse an alternate plan and escape route for use in case of emergencies 3215 the raid unit must also plan for medical support reactive planning in the medical arena is predictably unsuccessful resulti ng unnecessarily in loss of life or limb adequate and visible medical planni ng has considerable positive psychological effects on the raid forces morale personnel should plan to handle anticipated casualties with aid and litt er teams at the objective at planned rallying points rps and in the ba area considerations should include evacuation routes at all l evels and priorities for evacuation nonevacuation and hospitalization personne l should 351 fm 305201 coordinate with treatment facilities before raid but not divulge the target or timing of the mission organization 3216 the size of the raid force depends on metttc the raid force may vary from few personnel attacking checkpoint to battal ion attacking large supply depot regard less of size the raid force consists of four basic elements command assault security and support with strategic placement of medical personnel within all elements command element 3217 the raid force commander and key personnel normally ma ke up this element they provide general support to the raid such s medical aidmen radio operators and if fire support element is part of the r aid forward observer the command element is not normally assigned spec ific duties with any element personnel may work with any of the major elements of the raid force the raid force commander locate s himself where he may best control and influence the action assault element 3218 applying metttc the assault element is specific ally task organized by what is needed to accomplish the objective if the ra id objective is to attack and render unusable critical elements of target system ch as bridge or tunnel the raid force assaults and molishes the bridge or tunnel if the target is enemy personnel the raid force conducts its atta ck with high proportion of automatic assault weapons covered by mo rtar fire from the support element usually the assault element physically m oves on or into the target this method is the least preferred more preferre d method is for the assault element to complete its task from standoff distance the assault element attacks using lasers antitank weapons and other heavy weapons security element 3219 the security element supports the raid by securing withdrawal routes providing early warning of enemy approach blockin g avenues of approach into the objective area preventing enemy escape from the objective area and acting as the rear guard for the withdrawing ra id force the size of the security element depends on the enemys capability to in tervene and disrupt the mission if the threat has armor then the element needs antiarmor weapons where the enemy is known to have aircraft t he security element employs antiaircraft weapons as the assault element moves into position the security element keeps the command group inform ed of all enemy activities firing only if detected and on order from the command group once the assault begins the security element prevent s enemy entry into or escape from the objective area as the raid force with draws the security element enhanced by sniper teams conducts rearguard action to disrupt and ambush any enemy counterattacks and pursui ts 352 fm 305201 support element 3220 the support element of the raid force conduct s diversionary or coordinated attacks at several points on the target to he lp the assault element gain access to the target it uses ambushes roadblocks and mortar fire on the threat support personnel also execute complem entary tasks in eliminating guards breaching and removing obstacles t the objective and conducting diversionary or holding acti ons they assist by providing fire support and acting as demolition teams to set charges and neutralize destroy or render parts of the target unusable historicall the support element has covered the withdrawal of the assault element from the immediate area of the objective and then with drawn on order or prearranged signal intelligence and reconnaissance 3221 the raid force commander must have maximum intell igence on the target site enemy reaction forces inclu ding routes strength and avenues of approach and the routine activities and attitudes of t he indigenous population in the area intelligence and reconnaissance pers onnel conduct premission survey of the routes to the target locations for friendly support weapons enemy defenses to include key weapons minefields and weak points critical nodes to be destroyed within the target site and withdrawal routes the raid force gains access to the target site itsel f civilian supporters may help in these attempts if they have good cover for action if tactically feasible personnel may conduct surveillance of the target to learn last minute requirements 3222 intelligence and reconnaissance personnel conduct d etailed intelligence gathering and leader reconnaissance before beginning the raid they construct basic salute report to include the following strength and location of the threat and its combat effectiv eness the threats armaments and its location reaction time security and protection positions of key and automatic weapons 3223 intelligence gathering includes answers to the following questions are reserve threat troops in the vicinity are they waiting with armor or aircraft what are their strength time to reinforce and communication abilities is the terrain accessible can it be blockaded or defended what are the locations and capabilities of local inhabitants what routes to and from the raid site provide cover conceal ment and security and simplify movement does the threat have armor or air support where should key support weaponsantitank antiair snip er teams and machine gunsbe placed 353 fm 305201 3224 additionally intelligence and reconnaissance personnel consult with supporting ca team members to consider the nonmilitary t hreats to the planned raid they analyze the civilian component of the targ et area using cascope typical questions are as follows what civilian areas exist between the line of departure an d the objective what activities are employed in these areas what civilian structures permanent semipermanent or tempor ary may be encountered along the route what protection status i s assigned to these structures what civilian capabilities exist that could intercede or support the raid as part of contingency is th ere credible police capability what organizations host nation hn ngo multinational corporation criminal terrorist exist in and around th objective area what activities are they engaged in what assistance might we obtain from them what types of civilians might we encounter in and around the objective area what general activities are they engaged in what migh t be their reaction to contact with raid forces what might be t heir reaction to combat operations are there any civilian events that may affect the conduct of the military operation such as call to prayer or church s ervices festival celebrations rush hour traffic and planting or harvest season activities participant rehearsals 3225 raid participants conduct re alistic timely rehearsals for the operation using terrain similar to the target area whenever possible participants use sand tables fullsiz mockups sketches and photographs to assist in briefings they practice immediate action dr ills iads along with contingency and emergency actions guerrillas hold fullsc ale final rehearsals under conditions and visibility realistically expecte d in the objective area at the time of attack night raids 3226 the best time for raid is du ring limited visibility darkness allows units to maneuver even closer to the enemy enemy reinforcem ents will have difficulty in moving to ssist their troops under atta ck and air assets will be at disadvantage however maneuver ing at night is more difficult to accomplish and command control and communications c3 are more difficult to maintain day raids 3227 units conduct raids during daylight when the troop s at the target location are lacking in security morale or discipline key question is whether they will get help from adjacent units especially under adverse weather conditions of sandst orms rain or snowstorms 354 fm 305201 final inspection 3228 the raid force commander conducts final inspection of personnel and equipment before moving to the objective area he ensures weapons are testfired broken equipment is replaced and the physical condition of each man is checked he checks personal belongings to ensure that incriminating documents are carried duri ng the operation this inspection assures the raid force commander that his unit is equipped and ready for successful mission movement 3229 the raid force commander pl ans and conducts movement to the objective area so that the raid forces approach to the targ et is undetected figure 312 movement may be by single or multiple ro utes the preselected route or routes may end in assembly areas one or more patr ol bases or msss which enhance mission success the raid force makes every effort to avoid contact with the enemy during movement upon reac hing the objective rallying point orp security and leader reconnaissance parties deploy and make final coordination before the assa ult force moves to the attack position figure 312 movement to and withdrawal from the objectiv area 355 fm 305201 actions in the objective area 3230 support elements move to th eir positions and eliminate sentries breach or remove obstacles and execute other tasks the ssault element quickly follows the select soldiers into the target rea once the objective of the raid has been accomplished the assault element and s pecial troops withdraw covered by fire support on preselected targets if the attack is unsuccessful the raid force ends the action to prevent undue loss of personnel and the support elements withdraw according to plan the assault and support elements assemble at one or more rps while the security elements cover the withdrawal according to plan withdrawal 3231 the raid force commander designs withdrawal to achieve m aximum deception against the enemy and minimum danger to the rai d force the various elements of the raid force withdraw on order or at prearranged time but never the same way twice the movement uses ma ny doglegs over the previously reconnoitered routes to the base camp through series of rps should the enemy organize close pursuit of the assault eleme nt the security element covering force assists by fire and move ment harassing the enemy and slowing it down other elements of the raid force do not attempt to reach the initial rallying point irp but on their own initiative lead the enemy away and attempt to lose them by evasive action in difficult terrain 3232 the raid force commander issues specific instructions concerning contingencies the commander decides which coa to follow based on time and distance to be traveled firepower or fire support and the raid forces physical condition the raid force then attempts to reest ablish contact with the main force at other rps or continues to the base camp as s eparate groups iaw metttc battalion large raids 3233 when target is large and well guarded much rger raid force conducts the mission to sure successful attack large raids involve the use of battalionsized unit conduct is similar to that of smaller raids but c2 becomes more diff icult as the force increases in size movement to the objective area 3234 surprise is priority in all raids but is mo re difficult to achieve during battalion operations the number of troops to assem ble and deploy requires additional msss farther from the target to preserve secrecy also the force requires longer route to the attack position large raid force usually moves by small components over multiple routes to an mss then to the objective figure 313 page 357 control 3235 units need extensive radio communications equipmen t to coordinate c2 operations in an active electronic warfare ew environm ent effective coordination is difficult to achieve raid planners use p yrotechnics audible signals or runners to coordinate action at designated tim even under 356 fm 305201 optimum conditions massing of the raid force at the objecti ve is extremely difficult to control lights armbands or scarves enhance control during planning the raid force commander considers the complexi ty of the plan and the possibility of overall failure if subordinate elements do not arrive on time he plans for these possible continge ncies to ensure mission success figure 313 movement to the objective area for battalion raid training 3236 executing large raid requires high degree of trai ning and discipline extensive rehearsals help prepare the force for the mission in particular commanders and staffs learn how to use large numbers of troops as cohesive and coordi nated fighting force fire support 3237 raids usually require additional fire support in the jsoa such support may mean secretly caching amm unition in msss over long period before the raid each member of the raiding force carries an extra mortar round recoilless rocket round or can of machine gun ammunition 357 fm 305201 timing 3238 timing is both crucial and much more difficult for large raid the time of the raid takes on increased importance because of the large number of personnel involved more time is required to coordinate and move units and the main action element usually needs more time to do its mission as result larger raids require larger security elements to isolate the objective for longer time periods the element moves to the objective duri ng limited visibility but due to fire support coordination requir ements and the large number of personnel the mission begi ns during early daylight hours withdrawal 3239 elements usually best withdraw from large raid in small groups over multiple routes to deceive the enemy and discourage enemy pursuit dispersed withdrawal also denies pr iority target to enemy air and fire support elements the raid force commander considers the p ossibility of an alert and aggressive enemy counterattacking the dispers ed elements of the force he carefully weighs all metttc factors before deciding how when and where he will conduct his withdrawal ambushes 3240 the ambush is surprise attack from concealed posi tion upon moving or temporarily halted target it is one of the old est and most effective types of guerrilla tactics an ambush is executed to reduce the enemys overall combat effectiveness by destroyi ng or harassing his soldiers and their will to win an ambush may include an assault to clos with and decisively engage the target or the attack may be by direct or indirect fire to harass the enemy note the following article was originally serialized in red thrust star dated july and october 1995 and october 1996 afghanistan is not europe yet the soviet army that occupied afghanistan in late december 1979 was trained to fight na to on the northern european plain consequently the soviet army had to reequip reform and retrai n onsite to fight the insurgent mujahideen holy warrior guerrillas the soviets were forced to revise their tactics and tactical methodologies in order to meet the demands of this very different war one of the tactical areas which the sovi ets thoroughly revised was the conduct of ambushes the soviets planned to use ambushes in the europea n theater but they were primarily ambushes against attacking or wi thdrawing nato armored columns the soviets constructed most of their ambushes around tanks and ta nk units they planned to employ concealed individual tanks tank platoons and tank companies along high speed avenues of approach or withdrawal to engage the enemy from the flank and then to depart such ambushes were part of security zone defensive p lanning as well as planning for the deep battle and pursuit the soviets so trained their squad and platoonsized reconnaissance elements to conduct dismounted ambushes to capture prisoners and documents they employed command element sna tch group and fire support group in these smallscale ambushes in afghanistan the mujahideen seldom used armored vehicles and seldom advanced along highspeed avenues of approach instead they infiltrated lightinfantry forces through some of the most inhospitable terrain on the planet to mass for an attack or 358 fm 305201 ambush the soviets soon discovered that they had difficulty maintaining control of the limited road network which constituted the so viet lines of communi cation the guerrillas constantly cut the roads and ambushed convoy s carrying material from the soviet union to the base camps and cities in afghanistan t he soviet ability to maintain its presence in the country depended on its ability to keep the roads open and much of the soviet combat was fight for control of the road network during th war the guerrillas destroyed over 11000 soviet trucks and reportedly even more afghan trucks through ambush the soviets learned from mujahideen ambushes and used the ambush to interdict the guerrilla supplies coming from pakistan and iran the soviets conducted ambushes mainly with reconnaissance and ot her special troops airborne air assault spetsnaz and elements from the two separate motorized rifle b rigades which were designed as counterguerrilla forces t he composition and employment of ambush forces differed with the units involved and t he part of afghanistan in which they were employed destruction 3241 destruction is the primary purpose of an ambush the n umber of men killed wounded or captured and loss of equipment and supp lies critically affect the enemy guerrillas benefit from the capture of equ ipment and supplies through battlefield recovery harassment 3242 frequent ambushes harass the enemy and force him to di vert men from patrol operations to guard convoys troop movements nd installations when enemy patrols fail to accomplis h their missions because they are ambushed the enemy is deprived of the valuable contribution s these patrols make to its combat effort series of successful guerrilla ambushes cause the enemy to be less aggressive and more defensiveminded the enemy becomes apprehensive and overly cautious and reluctant to go on patrols to move in convoys or to move in small groups the enemy wants to void night operations is more subject to confusion and panic if ambus hed and is mentally defeated element of surprise 3243 surprise allows the ambush force to seize control of any situation the force achieves surprise by carefu lly planning preparing and executing the ambush guerrillas attack the targets when where and in manner for which the enemy is least prepared coordinated fires 3244 the ambush force commander positions and coordinates th use of all weapons mines and demoli tions he coordinates all fires including artillery and mortars when available coordinated fire support ensures isolation of the kill zone this isolation prevents enemy escape or reinforc ement due to the large volume of accura concentrated fire 359 fm 305201 control measures 3245 the ambush force commander maintains close control measu res during the ambush operation these control measures incl ude provisions for early warning signals of target approach withholding fire until the target has moved into the ki lling zone opening shifting and halting fire at the proper time initiating proper actions if the ambush is prematurely det ected timely and orderly withdrawal to recognized rp categories of ambushes 3246 ambushes have two general categories point and area point ambush whether independent or part of an area ambush po sitions itself along the targets expected route of approach it attacks single kill zone when there is not sufficient intelligence for point amb ush the commander establishes an area ambush an area ambush uses multipl point ambushes around central kill zone 3247 these two variations succeed be st in situations where routes of approach by relieving or reinforcing units are limited to those favorable for ambush by the guerrillas both variatio ns were used extensively by the north vietnamese guerrilla forces in vietnam against us forces in the republic of vietnam point ambush 3248 point ambush whether independent or part of an area ambush is positioned along the targets expected route of approach fo rmation is important because to great extent it determines w hether point ambush can deliver the heavy volume of highly co ncentrated fire necessary to isolate trap and destroy the target 3249 the formation to be used is determined by carefully sidering possible formations and the advantages and disadvantages of ea ch in relation to terrain conditions of visibility forces weapons an d equipment ease or difficulty of control target to be attacked and overall comb at situation 3250 the following paragraphs discuss few formations that have been developed for the deployment of point ambushes those d iscussed are named according to the general pattern formed on the ground by the deployment of the attack element line formation 3251 the attack element is deployed generally parallel to the targets route f m v m n t r d t r i l s t r m this deployment positions the attack element parallel to the long axis of the killing zone and subjects the target to heavy flanking fire the size of the targ et which can be trapped in the killing zone is limited by the area the attack element can effectivel cover with heavy volume of highly concentrated fire the target is tr apped in the killing zone by natural obstacles mines cla ymore antivehicular antipersonnel demolitions and direct and indirect fires figure 314 page 361 360 fm 305201 disadvantage of the line formation is the chance that lateral dispersion of the target may be too great for effective coverage line forma tion is appropriate in close terrain that restricts target maneuver and in open terrain where one flank is restricted by mines demoli tions mantraps or sharpened stakes similar obstacles can be placed between the attack elemen t and the killing zone to provide protection from the targets counterambush mea sures when destruction ambush is deployed in this manner access lanes are left so that the target can be assaulted figure 315 page 362 the line formation can be effectively used by rise from th ground ambush in terrain seemingly unsuitable for ambush an advantage of th line formation is its relative ease of control under all conditions of visibility figure 314 line formation for harassing or destructio n ambush 361 fm 305201 figure 315 line formati on for destruction ambush l formation 3252 the lshaped formation is vari ation of the line formation the long side of the attack element is parallel to the killing zone and delivers flanking fire the short side is at the end of and at right angles to the killing zone and delivers enfilading fire that links with fire from the other leg this formation is very flexible it can be established on straight stretch of trail or stream figure 316 page 363 or sharp be nd in trail or stream figure 317 page 363 when appropriate fire from the short leg can b shifted to parallel the long leg if the target tries to assault or cape in the opposite direction in addition the short leg prevents escape in the direction of attack element and reinforcement from its direction figure 318 p age 364 362 fm 305201 figure 316 l formation for destruction ambush figure 317 l formation for destructi on ambush on bend of trail or stream 363 fm 305201 figure 318 l formation where short leg of attack element prevents escape or reinforcement z formation 3253 the zshaped formation is another variation of the line for mation the attack force is deployed as in the l formation but with an additional side so that the formation resembles the letter z the additiona l side figure 319 page 365 may serve to engage force attempting to relieve or reinforce the target seal the end of the killing zone restrict flank prevent envelopment 364 fm 305201 figure 319 z formation for destruction ambush t formation 3254 in the tshaped formation the attack element is depl oyed across and at right angles to the targets route of movement so that it nd the target form the letter t this formation can be used day or night to establish purely harassing ambush and at night to establish an mbush to interdict movement through open hardtoseal areas such as rice paddies 3255 small group of persons can use the t formation to haras s slow and disorganize larger force when the lead elements of the targ et are engaged they will normally attempt to maneuver right or left to close with the ambush mines mantraps and other obstacles placed to t he flanks of the killing zone slow the enemys movements and permit the mbush patrol to deliver heavy fire and withdraw wi thout becoming decisively engaged figure 320 page 366 365 fm 305201 figure 320 t formation for harassing ambush 3256 the attack element can also use the t formation to interdi ct small groups attempting night movement across open areas fo r example the attack element is deployed along rice paddy dike wit h every second person facing in the opposite direction the attack of target approaching from either direction requires only that every second person shi ft to the opposite side of the dike each person fires only to his front and onl when the target is at very close range attack is by fire only and each person keeps the target under fire as long as it remains on his front if the t arget attempts to escape in either direction along the dike each man takes it und er fire as it comes to his vicinity the t formation is very effective at halting i nfiltration but it has one chief disadvantage while spre ad out the ambush may engage superior force use of this formation must therefore fit the local enemy situation figure 321 page 367 366 fm 305201 figure 321 t formation for harassing ambush in rice paddy v formation 3257 the vshaped attack element is deployed along both sides of the t r g t s r u t f m v m n t s t h t i t f r m s t h l t t r v c r i s t k n t ensure that neither group nor leg fires into the other this formation subjects the target to both enfilading and interlockin g fire the v formation is best suited for fairly open terrain but can also be used in the jungle when established in the jungle the legs of the v close in as the head elements of the target approach the apex of the v the attack element then opens fire from close range here even more than in open terrain all mov ement and fire must be carefully coor dinated and controlled to ensure that the fire of one leg does not endanger the other the wider separation of elemen ts makes this formation difficult to control and there are fewer sites that fa vor its use its main advantage is that it is difficult for the target to tect the ambush until it has moved well into the killing zone figures 322 page 368 and 323 page 369 367 fm 305201 figure 322 v formation for open mountain terrain triangle formation 3258 this formation is variation of the v and can be used in three different ways one way is the closed triangle figure 3 24 page 369 in which the attack element is deployed in three groups or parties positioned so that they form triangle or closed v an automatic weapon i s placed at each point of the triangle and positioned so that it can be shifte d quickly to interlock with either of the others men are positioned so that their fields of fire overlap mortars may be positioned inside the triangle when deployed in this manner the triangle ambush becomes small unit strongpoint it is used to interdict night movement thro ugh rice paddies and other open areas when target approach is likely to be from any direction the formation provides allaround security and secu rity parties are deployed only when they can be positioned so that if detected by an approach ing target they will not compromise the ambush attack is by fire only and the target is allowed to approach within close range before fire is opened 368 fm 305201 figure 323 v formation for jungle terrain figure 324 closed triangle formation for night harass ing ambush 3259 advantages of the triangle formation include ease of c ontrol and all around security in addition target approaching from ny direction can be brought under fire of at least two automatic weapons 369 fm 305201 3260 there are several disadvantage s for example an ambush patrol sized or larger is required to reduce the danger of being ov errun by an unexpectedly large target one or more legs of the triangle may come under enfilade fire lack of dispersion particularly at the po ints increases danger from enemy mortar fire 3261 the open triangle during harassing ambush is desi gned to enable small force to harass slow and inflic t heavy casualties upon larger force without itself being decisively engaged the attack lement is deployed in three parties positioned so that each party becomes corn er of triangle containing the killing zone when the target enters the killi ng zone the party to the targets front opens fire on the leading element wh the target counterattacks the group withdraws and an assault part to the flank opens fire when this party is attacked the party opposite fl ank opens fire this process is repeated until the target is pulled apart each party reoccupies its position if possible an d continues to inflict the maximum damage possible without becoming decisively gaged figure 325 page 371 3262 in an open triangle during destruction ambush the attack element is again deployed in three parties positioned so t hat each party is point of the triangle 200 to 300 meters apart the killing zone is the area within the triangle the target is allowed to enter the kill ing zone the nearest party attacks by fire as the target attempts to m aneuver or withdraw the other groups open fire one or more assault p arties as directed assault or maneuver to envelop or destroy th target figure 325 page 371 as destruction ambush this formation i s suitable for platoon sized or larger forces unit smaller than platoon would be in too great danger of being overrun 3263 the following are more disadvantages of the triangle in assaulting or maneuvering control is very difficult very close coordination and control are necessary to ensure that assau lting or maneuvering assault parties are not fired on by another part the ambush site must be fairly level open area that p rovides around its border concealment for the ambush patrol unless it is rise from the ground ambush box formation 3264 this formation is similar in pu rpose to the open triangle ambush the attack element is deployed in four parties positioned so that each party becomes corner of square or rectangle containing the ki lling zone figure 326 page 372 the box formation can be used as harassing or destruction ambush in the same manner as the two variations of the pen triangle ambush 370 fm 305201 371 figure 325 open triangle formation fm 305201 372 figure 326 box formation fm 305201 area ambush 3265 the origin of the type of am bush now called area ambush is not known hannibal used the area ambush against the romans in the second century bc more recently it was modified and perfected by the british army in malaya and with several variations used in v ietnam the british found that point ambushes often failed to produce heavy casu alties when ambushed the communist guerrillas would immediately break contact and disperse along escape routes leading away from the killin g zone the british counteracted this tactic by blocking escape routes leading away from the killing zone with point ambushes they called these multip lerelated point ambushes the area ambush british version 3266 the british army version of the area ambush involves point ambush that is established at site having several trails or other escape routes leading away from it the site may be water hol an enemy campsite known rendezvous point or along frequently traveled trail this site is the central killing zone point ambushes are establ ished along the trails or other escape routes leading away from the central killing zone 3267 the target whether single group or several groups approaching from different directions is permitted to move to the central killing zone outlying ambushes do not attack unless discovered the ambu sh is initiated when the target moves into the central killing zone when the target breaks contact and attempts to disperse escaping portions are in tercepted and destroyed by the outlying ambushes th multiple contacts achieve increased casualties harassment and confusion figure 327 page 3 74 3268 the british army version of the area ambush is best ited to counterguerrilla operations in terrain where movement is largely restricted to trails it produces the best results when it is establi shed as deliberate ambush 3269 when there is not sufficient intelligence for deliberat ambush an area ambush of opportunity may be established the outlying ambushes are permitted to attack targets approachin g the central killing zone if within their capability if too large for the particular outlyin g ambush the target is allowed to continue and is attacked in the central ki lling zone baited trap version 3270 variation of the area ambush is the baited trap ver sion figure 328 page 374 where central killing zone is established along the targets route of approach point ambushes are establish ed along the routes over which relieving or reinforcing units will have to approach the target in the central killing zone serves as bait to lure relieving or reinforcing units into the killing zones of the outlying ambushes the outlyin g point ambushes need not be strong enough to destroy their targets they may be small harassing ambushes that delay disorganize and eat awa the target by successive contacts 373 fm 305201 figure 327 area ambush british version figure 328 area ambush baited trap version 3271 this version can be varied by using fixed installa tion as bait to lure relieving or reinforcing units into the killing zone of one or more of the outlying ambushes the installation replaces the central ki lling zone and is attacked the attack may intend to ove rcome the installation or may be only ruse 374 fm 305201 3272 these two variations are best suited for situations where routes of approach for relieving or reinforcing uni ts are limited to those favorable for ambush they are also best suited for use by guerrilla forces rather than counterguerrilla forces communist guerrilla forces in vietna m used both variations extensively unusual ambush techniques 3273 the ambush techniques described above are so well know n and widely used that they are considered standard other s well known less frequently used techniques are considered unusual two such t echniques are described below rise from the ground ambush 3274 the attack element uses this type of ambush figure 329 page 376 in open areas that lack the good cover and concealment and other features normally desirable in good ambush site the attack elemen t is deployed in the formation best suited to the overall situation it i s completely concealed in the spiderhole type of covered foxhole soil is careful ly removed and positions expertly camouflaged 3275 when the ambush begins the attack element throws ba ck the covers and literally rises from the ground to attack this ambush takes advantage of the tendency of patrols and other units to relax in areas th at do not appear to favor ambush the chief disadvantage is that the ambush pat rol is very vulnerable if prematurely detected demolition ambush 3276 electrically detonated mines or demolition charges or both are positioned in an area figure 330 page 377 over which target is expected to pass this area may be portion of road or trail an open field or any location that can be observed from distance activating wires are run to concealed observation point which is sufficiently di stant to ensure safety of the ambushers 3277 as large force as desired or necessary can be used to mine the area two men remain to begin the ambush others return to the unit when target enters the mined area killing zone the two men remai ning detonate the explosives and withdraw immediat ely to avoid detection and pursuit 375 fm 305201 figure 329 unusual techniques rise from the ground ambush special ambush situations 3278 the following techniques are not considered standard amb ush scenarios and therefore require special considerations columns protected by armor 3279 attacks against columns protecte d by armored vehicles depend on the type and location of armored vehicles in column and the we apons of the ambush patrol if possible armored vehicl are destroyed or disabled by fire of antitank weapons landmines molotov cocktails r by throwing hand grenades into open hatches an effort is made to immobi lize armored vehicles at point where they are unable to give protection to the r est of the convoy and where they will block the route of other supporting vehic 376 fm 305201 figure 330 unusual techniques demolition ambush ambush of trains 3280 moving trains may be subjec ted to harassing fire but the most effective ambush is derailment train derailment is desirabl because the wreckage remains on the tracks and dela ys traffic for long periods of time derailment on grade at sharp curve or on high brid ge will cause most of the cars to overturn and result in extensive casualties among the passengers fire is directed on the exits of overturned coaches and designated parties armed with automa tic weapons rush forward to assault coaches or cars still standing other pa rties take supplies from freight yards and then set fire to the train rails are removed from the tra ck at some distance from the ambush site in ea ch direction to delay the arrival of reinforcements by train in planning th ambush of train soldiers must remember that the enemy may include ar mored railroad cars in the train for its protection and that important trains may be preceded by advance guard locomotives or inspection cars to check the track ambush of waterway traffic 3281 waterway traffic such as barges or ships may be mbushed similar to vehicular column the ambush patrol may be able to min the waterway and thus stop traffic if mining is not feasible fire delivered by recoilless weapons can damage or sink the craft fire should be direct ed at engine room spaces the waterline and the bridge recovery of supp lies may be possible if the craft is beached on the banks of the waterway or grounded in shallow water 377 fm 305201 ambush patrols 3282 an ambush patrol is combat patrol whose mission i s to harass target destroy target capture personnel or equipment execute any combination of these 3283 an ambush patrol is planned and prepared in the s ame general manner as other patrols that is by using patrol steps troop leading procedures each step is explained below planning and preparation 3284 planners must first consider whether the ambush is to be deliberate ambush or an ambush of opportunity in deliberate ambush the greater amount of target intelligence available permits plannin g for every coa at the target plans for an ambush of opportuni ty must include consideration of the types of targets that may be ambushed as well as varying situations in both plans must be flexible enough to allow modification as appr opriate at the ambush site when planning the principles discussed below apply all plans must be rehearsed in detail 3285 every person must thoroughly understand what he is to do at every stage of the operation in ambush more so than i n other operations failure of even one person to perform exactly as plan ned can cause failure 3286 point or area many factors affect the types of ambush they include organization the number of men requir ed the equipment and communications required and all other aspects of the patrol 3287 each possible formation mu st be considered for its advantages and disadvantages 3288 an attack may be by fire only harassing only or may include an assault of the target destruction ambush 3289 the patrol is tailored for its mission two men may be adequate for harassing ambush destruction am bush may require the entire unit squad platoon company 3290 an ambush patrol is organized in the same manner as other combat patrols to include patrol hq an assault element support element and security element figure 331 page 379 the assault and support elements are the attack force the security element i s the security force when appropriate the attack fo rce is further organized to provide reserve force when an ambush site is to be occupied for an extended period double ambush patrols may be organized one ambush patrol occupies the site while the other rests eats and tends to personal ne eds at the orp or other concealed location they alternate each 8 hours if t he waiting period is more than 24 hours three ambush patrols are organized figu re 332 page 379 378 fm 305201 figure 331 organization of ambush patrols example 1 figure 332 organization of ambush patrols example 2 379 fm 305201 3291 the selection of accompanying equipment and supplies is based on the mission enemy threat size of the resistance force means of transportation distance and terrain weight and bulk of equipment 3292 primary route is planned that will allow the patrol to enter the ambush site from the rear the killin g zone is not entered if entry can be avoided if the killing zone must be entered to place mines or explosives great care must be taken to remove any tracks and signs that might alert the target and compromise the ambush if mines mantraps or explosives are to be placed on the far side or if the ppearance of the site from the targets viewpoint is to be checked wide detour around the kil ling zone is made here too great care must be taken to remove any traces that might reveal the ambush an alternate route from the ambush site is planned as in other patrols 3293 maps and aerial photographs are used to analyze the ter rain when possible the patrol makes an ontheground reconnaissan ce against an experienced enemy socalled ideal ambush sites should be avoided an alert enemy is suspicious of these areas avoids them if possible and increases vigilance and security when they must be enter ed surprise is even more difficult to achieve in these areas instead unlik ely sites are chosen that offer favorable fields of fire occupation and preparation of concealed positions channelization of the target into the killing zone covered routes of withdrawal to enable the ambush patrol to brea k contact and avoid pursui t by effective fire 3294 as general rule the ambush patrol occupies the ambush site at the latest possible time permitted by t he tactical situation and by the amount of time required to perform site preparation required this not only reduces the risk of discovery but also reduces the time men must remain still and quiet in position 3295 the patrol moves into the ambush site from the rear as discussed earlier security elements are positioned first t prevent surprise while the ambush is being established automatic weapons are then positioned so that each can fire along the entire killing zone if this is not possible they are given overlapping sectors of fire so th at the entire killing zone is covered the patrol leader then selects his position located where he can tell when to begin the ambush riflemen and grenadiers ar then placed to cover any dead space left by automatic weapons all we apons are assigned sectors of fire to provide mutual support the patrol leader sets the position 380 fm 305201 preparation time the degree of preparation depends on t he time allowed all men work at top speed during the allotted time 3296 camouflage is of utmost importance each man must be hidden from the target during pr eparation for the patrol each man camouflages himself and his equipment and secures his equipment to prevent noise at the ambush site positions are prepared with min imum change in the natural appearance of the site all debris resultin g from preparation of positions is concealed execution 3297 effective c2 are essential to mission success the patrol leader establishes the communications plan and control measures for execution as the patrol leader makes contact communications stand good chance of breaking down he must plan using the primary alternat contingency and emergency pace method rehearsals are conducted to ensure everyone knows and understands the following crucial points 3298 three signals often four are needed to execute the ambush audible and visual signals such as whistles and pyrotechnics must be changed often to avoid establishing patterns too frequent ly use of the same signals may result in their becoming known to the enemy target might recognize signal and be able to react in time to avoid the full effects of the ambush for example if white star cl uster is habitually used to signal withdrawal in night ambush an alert enemy may fire on and cause premature withdrawal 3299 signal by the security force to alert the patrol lea der to the targets approach may be given by arm and hand signals radio as quiet voice message by transmitting prearran ged number of taps or by signaling with the pushtotalk switch field telephone when there is danger that wire between positions will compromise the ambush 3300 signal to begin the ambush given by the patrol leader or designated individual may be shot or the detonation of mines or explosives signal for lifting or shifting fires if the target is to be assaulted may be given by voice command whistles or pyrotechnics all fire must stop immediately so that the assault can be made before the target can react signal for withdrawal may also be by voice command whis tles or pyrotechnics 3301 this is key part of the ambush fire must be withheld until the signal is given then immediately livered in the heaviest most accurate volume po ssible properly timed and delivered fires achieve surprise as well as destruction of the target when the target is to be assaulted the lifting or shifting of fires must be equal ly precise otherwise the assault is delayed and the target has opportunity to recover and react 3302 the orp is located far enough from the ambush site that it will not be overrun if the target att acks the ambush 381 fm 305201 routes of withdrawal to the orp are reconnoitered situatio n permitting each person walks the route he is to use and picks out ch eckpoints when the ambush is executed at night each person must be able t follow his route in the dark 3303 on signal the patrol quickly but quietly withdr aws to the orp reorganizes and begins its return ma rch if the ambush was not successful and the patrol is pursued withdrawal may be by bound s the last group may arm mines previously placed along the withdrawal route to further delay pursuit 3304 contingency plans should include removal of the wo unded both friendly and hostile under pursuit or at more measured pace treatment location and moves from the target si to rearward position must be flexible plans should also include insertion of medical ass ets within the assault element as well as within th hq security and support elements should be considered depending on the mission mines and booby traps 3305 resistance forces may employ bo th mines and booby traps to enhance their combat operations in areas occupied and protected b the enemy the resistance should employ mines to impede delay and disrupt traffic using roads and trails these actions cause the enemy to divert valuable forces to guard and clear those routes the personnel and equipment patrolling the roads to detect and remove mines are prime targets for guerr illa mines and snipers in congested areas where the enemy conducts offensi ve operations or patrol activities the guerrillas shou ld employ mines and mechanical booby traps the mines and booby traps will inflict casualti delay and channelize movement and damage or destroy equipment mines should be deployed to reduce accidental injury of noncomba tants the resistan ce makes and uses military homemade mines most guerrilla mines are hand made using duds discarded ammunition and materials thrown away by th enemy materials discarded as trash such as improperly destroyed rations ammunition beer and soda cans batteries waterproof packing materials nd ammunition bandoleers provide the resistance valuable source of supply for mining and booby trap operations fms 534 and 2032 contain more inform ation on mines sniper operations 3306 sniping as an interdiction technique has very d emoralizing effect on the enemy welltrained and properly used snipers can inflic t many casualties they can hinder or temporarily deny the use of c ertain routes or areas snipers also cause the enemy to use disproportionat number of troops to clear and secure the area they must have miss ion orders outlining priority targets to include key threat personnel snipers may cover an area that has been mined to prevent removal or breaching of th minefield snipers may be part of raid or ambush to stop threat pe rsonnel from escaping the area under attack they may also prevent or i mpede the enemy from reinforcing the objective besides their sniping m ission they may collect information for the area command or sector commands all tactical plans can incorporate sniper missions provisions must be made for th snipers rest 382 fm 305201 and recuperation after continuous operations to prevent fatigue fm 305222 provides more information on sniper operations manportable air defense systems 3307 the most recent and largescale uw operation occurred in afghanistan between the soviet union and the afghanistan freedom fighter mujahideen they were formidable guerrilla force against s oviet airborne air assault spetsnaz and ground forces initially the u s army supplied the mujahideen with redeye missiles in the early 1980s but soon followed with improved manportable air defense systems manpads the stinger with the new system the warhead did not have to get direct h it hitting close would cause an explosion 3308 the premier soviet helicopter hindd has dualrole capab ility as an air assault vehicle and gunship platform this helic opter was quickly rendered out of action with wellplaced hit on the tran smission the stinger team easily found and exploited this weakness by aiming at and hitting the large red star behind the cockpit the so viets had to alter so of their basic tactical doctrineuse of vehicleequipped ground forces in conjunction with either helicopter helo assault or gun run on suspected mujahideen targets 3309 using manpads in uw role can have signific ant tactical and operational impact manpads are relatively new us wea pons light and very mobile they can be concealed easily for movement or ca ched for future operations most are relatively simple to operate guerrilla s can quickly learn how to use them as demonstrated very effectively in afghanis tan they require little maintenance because the missile is selfcont ained personnel can use these systems in various ways from the traditiona l defensive coverage to offensive tactics included are aerial ambush direct action or attacks on specific targets and harassment attacks meant either to produce psychological impact or to change emy tactics the degradation of the enemys close air support pays great dividends both tact ically and psychologically for the guerrilla fm 44100 us army air and missile operations provides additional information on air defense employment f s considerations 3310 there are four employment considerations for manpads mass mix mobility and integration each of these considerations is discussed in the following paragraphs 3311 units achieve mass employme nt by allocating enough manpads to defend an asset soldiers move all the avail able manpads to the key assets or operations that need them 3312 mix results from using different types of weapons that i s manpads and other weapons that may be effective against aircraft air defense operations are more effective when the guerrillas use mix of weapons this mix of weapons prevents almost any aircraft from countering the weakness of solitary system with overlapping and co ncentrated fire although guerrilla force is not likely to use zsu234 s vulcans and hawks 383 fm 305201 to any large extent it will more than likely have some of the following or similar weapons sy stems available zsu23s rpg7s dshks m2 hb caliber 50 machine guns redeyes stingers light machine guns and assault rifles 3313 the guerrilla force must be able to move on short notice air defense assets must also be able to displace quickly in uw environment 3314 massing all air defens weapons in common coordinated effort provides integration units can integra manpads with other weapons for the best effect based on terrain enemy aer ial tactics and desired effect of the air defense operation using metttc ai r defense personnel may use stingers to force enem aircraft to fly at lower altitudes at lower altitudes personnel can shoot down the enemy using massed heavy machine guns rocketpropelled gr enades rpgs and stingers employment 3315 defensive and offensive uses of manpads provide for balanced defense overlapping fires weighted coverage mutual support and early engagement each use of manpads is described below 3316 critical guerrilla assets may be subject to enemy attack as targets of opportunity since the attack can com from any direction it is desirable to have equal firepower in all directions the best coa is balanced defense because the terrain may not favor most probable avenue of approach by the enemy 3317 teams should positi on manpads 2 to 3 kilometers apart and one team should overlap another ot her types of weapons should be mixed in to complement the manpads th is overlapping prevents the manpads team from being overwhelmed by multipl aircraft and increases the chances of their ccessful air defense against any enemy aircraft 3318 teams can weight defense in circumstances where the terrain restricts lowlevel attacks to only p articular avenues of approach they can also weight defense when intelligence has established that air attacks will come from particular direction balance may be sacrificed with weighted defense sinc most air defense weapons would be positioned to cover the probable direct ion of approach th weighted defense then becomes the best coa 3319 support from another manpads team allows one to fire into the dead space of the other if the terrain or s ituation will not allow covering each others dead space teams should ma ke use of similar weapons to cover these areas usin g stingers or re deye missiles 384 fm 305201 3320 teams should positi on manpads and other similar systems well forward of the guerrilla forces main body or key facilities this early engagement provides the best opport unity to identify and fix the enemy aircraft before they can attack the guerrill as technical and tactical requirements 3321 in addition to the principles and guidelines previously discussed there are certain technical and tactical requirements that need to be considered before employing manpads among the questions ar what type of aircraft ordnance and electronic countermeasures cm has the threat been using in the area what aerial tactics have the enemy pilots been using in th area terrain and weather 3322 mountains and hills may pres ent terrainmasking problems for manpads whenever possible manpads teams should position along the commanding heights to detect and gage enemy aircraft effectively weather can also adversely affect manpads that need an infrared source to lock on in addition poor weather condit ions such as snow fog or rain can obscure the gunners vision routes of approach 3323 there are two general categories of routes of approa ch probable and forced probable route of approach is the one the enemy is most likely to use but to which he is not restricted pilot of an aircraft traveling at 500 knots and 150 meters above the ground can see little detail on th ground he can however see large objects highways ri vers and buildings and use them as aids to navigation if these landmarks lead to key assets they may be considered sign of probable approach forced route of ap proach is the one an aircraft will be forced to use and wi th options the forced route will be to the advantage of the guerrilla because he knows the terr ain and where he can hide to best engage the aircraft map analysis and planning 3324 terrain analysis is necessary to find good observation points fields of fire routes of approach and any terrain that may inhibit the full capabilities of manpads the ideal planning range for manpads is 3 to 5 kilometers from the target this positioning greatly enhances their rvivability by optimizing the lockon range to enemy aircraft position selection 3325 when selecting positions for manpads personnel s hould consider observation and fields of fire communi cation position physical security cover and concealment alternate posi tions and safety considerations 385 fm 305201 offensive operations 3326 aerial ambushes are similar to the ground baited trap ambush figure 333 if the enemy is known to reinforce outposts or ground units with air support personnel select target for ground attack just to draw an aerial response from the enemy personnel also select targe t that causes probable or forced avenue of approach for the reinforcing aircra ft the guerrilla manpads teams together with other air defense assets are positioned at key points along the ai rcrafts probable approach route this pattern is very effective in mountainous terrain where vall eys are the prime flight routes an early warning post radios timely forewarning alert to prepare an ambush for the aircraft figure 333 manpads in offensive operation aerial ambus h direct action 3327 units may use manpads in da role to take out specific type of aircraft or aircraft with key personnel this operation is most effective when employed around airfields an aircraft is very vulnerable when taking off 386 fm 305201 and to lesser extent when landing the concept is to u at least two manpads against the target personnel cate firing positions on curve 3 to 5 kilometers from the runway within range and obser vation of the probable flight path of th aircraft personnel must study carefully the flight patterns to confirm this critical information if the d istance to the airfield is kept to 3 kilometers centralized posi tioning can cover flight routes either approaching or departing the airfield with longer range s and longer airfields the manpads team must confirm the aircraft approach and takeoff direction and position the manp ads toward that end of the airfield the actual employment will depend heavily on the type of manpad s available and the terrain around the target when in do ubt personnel should use metttc harassment 3328 the harassment campaign focuses on disrupting t he operational procedures of the airport and aircrews the intended results are to force the pilots to lower their flight altitude s making them more vulnerable to guerrilla ground fire harassment also forces the enemy to d ecrease its air reconnaissance and support effort defensive operations 3329 in addition to the principles and guidelines of man pads employment discussed previously defense planners must t ake other considerations into account personnel must establish air defense priorities first developing priority list is matter of asse ssing each asset to be defended air defense priorities include criticality v ulnerability and recuperability 3330 despite the type of defense used the same principles guidelines and air defense priorities still apply among the types re stationary point moving point integrated and prepositioned defenses 3331 the key to stationary point defense is early engagement so that the enemy force cannot destroy the targ et if the target is large such as series of facilities or units concentr ated in relatively small area personnel should use startype defense this type of defense makes use of interlocking fields of fire bunkers trenches and conc ertina and tanglefoot wire along with mines and machine guns each leg of the star has central and alternate control capa bility to defend the base camp 3332 in the past units have used this defense to defend march columns in uw environment personnel and supplies may have to move in march columns these column s consist of vehicles carts pack animals bicycles and personnel traveling on foot person nel use manpads to defend the columns by inte gration or prepositioning 3333 if personnel decide to integrate manpads into the march column they should deploy them evenly along the len gth of the column this pattern ensures other weapon systems are tied in to complement the overall air defense plan when only one manpa ds team of two men is available both men should only be gunners single manpads should be placed in the column where it can provide the bes t air cover 387 fm 305201 3334 personnel preposition manpads to defend march column as it passes critical point along the route th is method is preferred for defending march column personnel use it when the di stance to be traveled by the march column is relatively short they so use it when air defense is required at only few locations along the rout the manpads teams may join and integrate with the column after it pa sses the critical point figure 334 the manpads teams may each receive orders positioning themselves at given location they are then given engagement instructions for specific window of time this plan allows both for maintaining opsec and receiving air defense coverage prep ositioned teams should be used only if the route to be used is relatively secure from enemy patrols metttc or current guerrilla intelligence repo rts reflect enemy patrols are minimal figure 334 manpads prepositioning at cr itical point defending march column support and sustainment 3335 uw missions cannot be accomplished without adequate support and sustainment all units need food clothing water dical and personnel services sustainment the types quan tity and phasing of supplies influence the guerrillas their capabilities and limitations and the type of missions they undertake supplies and equipment made available to the guerrillas may influence their morale since each shipment represents encouragement and assurance of support from the outside world once c hannel of supply is 388 fm 305201 established the guerrillas will continue to rely on that source for support appendix and appendix k provide additional information indicators of counterguerrilla operations 3336 tactical counterguerrilla oper ations are conducted to reduce the guerrilla threat or activity in the area to effectively c ombat the enemys counterguerrilla operations soldiers must be familiar wi th the indicators of counterguerrilla operations effective offensive and defensive tactics and countertracking methods 3337 security of the uw jsoa requir guerrilla intelligence measures to identify indications of impending counterguerrilla action population control measures and guerrilla reaction to enemy counterguerrilla actions some activities and conditions that may indicate impending enemy counterguerrilla actions are suitable weather new enemy commander changes in battle situation elsewhere arrival of new enemy units with special training extension of enemy outposts increased patrolling and aer ial reconnaissance increased enemy intelligence effort civilian pacification or control measures increased psyop against guerrillas 3338 some measures that may be used to control the popula tion of an area are mass registration curfews intensive propaganda compartmentation with cleared buffer zones informant nets party membership drives land and housing reform relocation of individual s groups and towns rationing of food and goods defensive tactics 3339 the existence or indication of counterguerrilla opera tions requires the sf and guerrilla force commanders to plan and use defensive tactics discussed below are some of the defensive tactics applicable ag ainst counterguerrilla operations 389 fm 305201 diversion activities 3340 sudden increase in guerrilla acti vities or shift of such activities to other areas assists in diverting enemy attention for ex ample intensified operations against enemy locs and installations require th enemy to divert troops from counterguerrilla operatio ns to security roles full use of underground and auxiliary capabiliti assists in creating diversions defense of fixed positions 3341 the rules for guerrilla defense of fixed positions re the same as those for conventional forces except there are few support ing fires and counterattacks are generally not practicable in conjuncti on with their position defense elements of the guerrilla force conduct raid s ambushes and attacks against the enemys locs flan ks reserve units supporting arms and installations routes of approach are mined and camoufla ged snipers engage appropriate enemy targets diversionary actions b all elements of the resistance movement are increased in adjacent areas delay and harassment activities 3342 the objective of delay and harassm ent tactics is to make the attack so costly that the enemy eventually ends its operations defe nsive characteristics of the terrain are used to the maximum mines and snipers are employed to harass the enemy and ambushes are positioned to inflict maximum casualties and delay 3343 as the enemy overruns various strong points the gu errilla force withdraws to successive fensive positions to agai n delay and harass when the situation permits the guerrilla force attacks the enemys flanks rear and locs if the enemy continues its offensive the guerrill forces should withdraw and leave the area under circumstances shoul d the guerrilla force become so engaged th at it loses its freedom of action and permits enemy forces to encircle and destroy it withdrawal 3344 in preparing to meet enemy offensive action the sf an d guerrilla force commanders may decide to withdraw to another area not likely to be included in the enemy offensive key installations within guerrilla base are moved to alternate bases and essential records and supplies may be transferred to new location s less essential items will be destroyed or cached in dispersed locations if the commander receives positive intelligence about the enemys plans for major counterguerrilla operation he may decide to withdraw and leave his main base without delay 3345 when faced with an enemy offe nsive of overwhelming strength the commander may disperse his force in either small units or as individuals to avoid destruction this coa however renders the guerrilla force ineffective for an undetermined period of time and therefore should not b taken unless absolutely necessary 390 fm 305201 counterambush 3346 the very nature of ambusha surprise attack from conc ealed positionplaces the ambushed unit at disadvantage obviously the best defense is to avoid being ambushed but this is not always possible unit must therefore reduce its vulnerability to ambush and reduce the damage it will sustain if ambushed these asures must be supplemented by measures to destroy or escape from an ambush fm 78 contains more detailed information on ambush and counterambush procedur reduction of vulnerability to ambush 3347 single defensive measure or combination of measures can prevent or effectively counter all ambushes in all situations the effectiveness of counterambush measures is directly related to the state of training of the unit and the leadership ability of its leader 3348 in avoiding ambush dismounted units have an adva ntage over mounted units they are less bound to the more obvious rout of movement such as roads and trails as in armored units however dismounted units are at disadvantage when terrain such as heavy jungle rest ricts or prohibits crosscountry movement the need for speed requires movement on roads trails or waterways preparation for movement 3349 in preparing for movement the leader must use metttc and oakoc in doing so he studies maps of the area and if possible makes an aerial reconnaissance map reconnaissance 3350 in studying maps of the terrain over which the lead er will move his unit the leader first checks the maps marginal data to determine reliability at the time the map was made if reliability is not good or if the map is old he evaluates its reliability in light of all other information he can obtain for example 20yearold map may not show several nearby roads and trails more recent building development in the area will not be shown the leader considers the terrain in relation to all available informa tion of known or suspected enemy positions and previo us ambush sites his map study includes evaluation of the terrain from the enemys viewpoint how would the enemy use this terrain where could the enemy position troops installations and ambushes aerial reconnaissance 3351 if possible the leader ma kes an aerial re connaissance the information gained from the aerial reconnaissance enables him to compare the map and terrain he also obtains cu rrent and more complete information on roads trails manmade objects type and density of vegetation and seasonal condition of streams an aerial reconnaissance rev eals movement or lack of movement in an area friendly enemy civilian 391 fm 305201 indications of enemy activity smoke may indicate location s of campsites patrols or patrol bases freshly dug soil may indicate positions or ambush sites shadow s may aid in identifying objects unusual shapes sizes shadows shad or colors may indicate faulty camouflage 3352 despite its many advantages aerial reconnaissance h as limitations some examples include the following strength of bridges ca nnot be determined terrain surface may be misinterpreted mines and booby traps cannot be seen presence of aircraft may warn enemy route selection 3353 the factors the leader considers are the same whether he is selecting route or studying route he has been directed to follow ea ch factor is discussed below cover and concealment 3354 cover and concealment are desir able but route with these features may obstruct movement terrain that provides moving unit cover and concealment also provides the enemy increased opportunities for ambush identification of areas where ambushes may be concealed llows the leader to develop plans for clearing these areas how the terrain affects observation and fields of fire available to the unit and to the enemy will influence the selection of and movement over rout formations rate s of movement and methods of control key terrain 3355 key terrain is an earth feature that has controllin g effect on the surrounding terrain it must be identified and actions planned accordingly if for example hill provides observation and fields of fire on any part of route the leader must plan for taking the hill from the enemy or avoiding it altogether obstacles 3356 obstacles may impede movement or limit maneuver alon g route they may also limit enemy action current intelligence 3357 all available information is considered this inclu des but is not limited to known suspected and pr evious ambush sites weather and light data reports of units or patrols that have recently operated in the area size location activity an d capabilities of guerrilla forces in the area 392 fm 305201 attitude of the civilian population and the extent to which they can be expected to cooperate or interfere counterintelligence 3358 in counterguerrilla operations in particular key feature of preparing for movement is denying the enemy information unit is especially vulnerable to ambush if the enemy knows the unit is to move what time it is to move where it is to go the route it is to follow and the weapons and equipment it is to carry the efforts made to deny r delay enemy acquisition of this information comprise the ci plan s minimum the plan restricts dissemination of information 3359 the leader gives out mission information only on needtoknow basis this procedure is especially important when the na tive personnel operating with the unit might possibly be planted info rmers once critical information is given personnel are isolated so that not hing can be passed out if it is likely that the enemy or enemy informers will obs erve the departure of unit deception plans should be used communications 3360 the leader plans how he will communicate with elemen ts of his unit with artillery air or other supporting units and with higher hq on an extended move radio relay or fieldexpedient antenna m ay be necessary an aircraft might be used to help communicate with ai r artillery support or other units on the ground fire support 3361 the leader plans artillery and mortar fires so they will deceive harass or destroy the enemy they may be planned as sch eduled or oncall fires 3362 fires are planned on key terrain features along the route these can serv as navigational aids or to deceive harass or destroy the emy on known enemy positions on known or suspected ambush sites on the flanks of identified danger areas wherever diversion appears desirable for example if th unit must pass near an identified enemy position artillery or m ortar fires on the position may distract the enemy and permit the unit to pas s undetected at intervals along the route ever 500 to 1000 meters for example with fires so planned the unit is ne ver far from plotted concentration from which shift can be quickly made 3363 coordination with the supporting unit includes route to be followed scheduled and oncall fires 393 fm 305201 call signs and frequencies checkpoints phase lines and other control measures times of departure and return intelligence 3364 the unit must provide its own intelligence support members must be alert to report information and lead ers must be able to evaluate the significance of this information in relation to the situ ation 3365 obvious items from which intelligence may be gaine d are signs of passage of groups such as crushed grass broken branches footprints cigarette butts or trash these may reveal identi ty size direction of travel and time of passage workers in fields which may indicate absence of the enemy apparently normal activities in vill ages which may indicate absence of the enemy 3366 less obvious items from which negative information can be gained are the absence of workers in fields which may indicate presence of the enemy children in the village which may indicate they are b eing protected from impending action young men in the village which may indicate the enemy trols the village 3367 knowledge of enemy signaling devices is very hel pful those listed below are some that were used by communist guerrillas in vietnam farm cart moving at night shows one lantern to indicate that government troops are on the road or trail behind two lan terns mean that government troops are close behind worker in the field stops to put on or take off his shirt either act can signal the approach of government troops this is relayed to the insurgency villager fishing holds his pole out straight to sig nal all clear and up at an angle to signal that troops are approaching security 3368 security is obtained through organization for movement manner of movement and by every man keeping alert at all time s some examples of these security measures are as follows twoman patrol can maintain security by organizing into security team with sectors of responsibility larger unit can use any standard formation file colu mn v and establish reaction force this reaction force can be positioned to the front rear or flanks of the main body so that it does n ot come under direct contact any unit of squad or larger regardless of t he formation used should have security forces to the front flanks and rear 394 fm 305201 dismounted unit moves by the sa methods as motorized patrol these methods include continuous movement and travelin g traveling overwatch and bounding overwatch formations countertracking 3369 to be more effective in co mbatting counterguerrilla operations soldiers should be familiar with coun tertracking techniques if the person tracking the soldier is not an experi enced tracker some of the following techniques may throw him off moving from thick area to an open area 3370 while moving in any given direction from thick ar ea to more open area soldiers walk past large 10inch diameter or rger tree toward the open vegetation for five paces and then walk backward to th front of the tree and change direction 90 degrees soldie rs must step carefully and leave as little sign as possible if this is not the direction the s oldiers want to travel they must change direction again at another large tree in t he same manner the purpose is to draw the trackers into the open area where it is harder to track this technique may lead the trackers to search in th wrong area before realizing they have lost the track 3371 when soldiers are being trac ked by trained persistent enemy trackers those the soldiers are unable to lose because the tra ckers keep hearing or seeing them the soldiers best coa is to outrun or outdistance the trackers or double back and ambush them depending on their strength compared to that of the soldiers crossing road 3372 soldiers approach trail from an angle and enter th trail in the direction they want to be followed leaving considerable si gns of their presence after about 30 meters soldiers walk backward to the point they entered the trail and exit in another direction leavi ng sign soldiers move off on an angle opposite the one they entered the trail on for about 100 meters and change direction to th eir desired line of march leaving footprints 3373 soldiers walk backward over so ft ground to leave reasonably clear footprints they try not to leave every footprint clear and do n ot leave an impression of more than 14 inch deep soldiers continue this deception until they are on hard ground they select the ground carefully t ensure that they have at least 20 to 30 meters of this deception this techniqu should always be used when exiting river or stream and can be used in conjunction with all other techniques as well to add even further confusion to the following party this tactic can be used several times to lay fal trails before actually leaving the stream crossing stream 3374 when approaching stream soldiers approach at an ngle in the same manner as road they move downstream for about 30 meter s 395 fm 305201 396 backtrack and move off into the intend ed direction to delay the trackers soldiers set up false tracks leaving footprints as describ ed above 3375 below are some additional tact ics that soldiers can use to aid in eluding following party stay in the stream for 100 to 200 meters keep in the center of the stream and in deep water watch near the banks for rocks or roots that are not covered with moss or vegetation and leave the stream at this point walk out backward on soft ground walk up small vegetationcovered tributaries and repla ce the vegetation in its natural position walk downstream until coming to the main river and then depart on log or prepositioned boat enter the stream having first carried out the above tacti c then exit at the point of entry and make large backward loop crossing and checking it and move off in different direction note using stream as deception technique is one of the best ways to slow down and lose following part the deception starts 100 meters from the stream and the successful completion of the tactic is to ensure that the following party does not know where to exit from the s tream camouflage techniques 3376 walking backward to leave conf using footprints brushing out trails and moving over rocky ground or through streams are examples of camouflage techniques that may be used to confuse the trac ker moving on hard surfaces or frequently traveled trails may also aid in eluding the tracker soldiers should avoid walking on mosscovered rock s as they can be easily displaced techniques used to confuse dogs 3377 enemy tracking teams may use do gs to aid in tracking the soldiers soldiers may confuse or delay dogs by scattering black or red pepper or if authorized riot control agent such as cs powder along the route using silencesuppr essed weapons against animals chapter 4 postmission activities upon mission completion the guerrilla force may withdraw by any method and conduct linkup with any fr iendly force or may be exfiltrated to friendly training sites appendix l sfods should conduct withdrawals immediately unless the objective is key terrain and may influence future operations after linkup resistance forces revert to national control these forces may demobilize or reorganize as conventional combat forces for use in economyofforce missions transition 41 transition refers to turning over an activity or task to new indigenous government allied or coalition force or government or to private sector agencies examples include the transfer of civil authority from military guerrilla forces to ci vil government establishment of indigenous police or security forces privatization or return of facilities such as public works and utilities airports and seaports to indigenous control privatization of humanitarian demining operations 42 transition is as critical to ussponsored uw movement as the combat operations that terminated the insurgency in favor of th insurgents the sustainment of successfully terminated insurgency depends in large part on how quickly and efficiently th posthostilities government can take control and provide the sustainable st ability and functioning infrastructure required to support population transition may begin in reas where conflict has subsided while combat op erations continue elsewhere in the jsoa planning and preparation for the transition therefore begin during the preparation phase and continue throughout the subsequent p hases 43 when planning to transfer an acti vity or task to indigenous populations or institutions it is important to know the capabilities and limitations of the elements of the existing infrastructure examples include host governments bilateral donors agencies international organizations espe cially the international crisis group icg and the international committee for the red cross icrc 41 fm 305201 ngos by type for example assi stance advocacy and indigenous organizations define the desired end state for example continuity of current operations or modification of current operations to some other format identify the organizational structure required to perform the act ivity or task identify competent trustworthy individuals to fill positions within the incoming organizational structure determine how to conduct demilitar ization of indigenous forces and incorporation of former belligerents into the private sector attempt to fully understand implications of withdrawal as well as tribal or factional breakdown to include historical boundar ies and differences not yet resolved identify equipment and facilities required to perform the activi ty or task and who will provide them prepare the appropriate proper ty control paperwork if transferring equipment or facilities to the relieving organization create timelines that provide suffi cient overlap between the outgoing and incoming organizations determine the criteria that will dictate when the incoming organization will assume control of the activity or task for example target date task standard or level of understandi ng orient the incoming organization to the activity or task to include providing procedures routine and recurring events and other information critical to the conduct of the activity or task demonstrate the activity or task if possible supervise the incoming organization in performing the activity or task the departing organization retains control of the activity or t ask during this process providing critiques and guidance as needed transfer the task according to the transition plan provide continued support to the incoming organization as requ ired bolster the image and prestige of the incoming organization in the eyes of the populace and the international community demobilization 44 demobilization is major acti vity of transition it involves demilitarizing the combatants of re sistance movement and reorienting them or in some cases orienting them for the first time from l ife as guerrilla to life as peaceful producti ve member of society demobilization planning must be closely coordinated and synchronized with t ransition planning as the need for resistance fighters diminishes the incoming government decides whether to place guerrilla forces in suppor ting role or to begin demobilizing them 45 how guerrilla force is demobilized will affect the postwar attitudes of the civilian population toward the new government to ensure the guerrilla 42 fm 305201 force is aligned with the new gove rnment the combatant commanders through the soc coordinate between sof the area commander an d other military organizations when demobiliz ing the guerrilla force the following coas could be considered retain the force with weapons and equipment as new military or police force integrate personnel weapons and equipment into new local sta or country public services and retrai n personnel into new civil sector occupations turn in all weapons and equipment and return personnel to thei r former occupations the collection of weapons is timeconsuming and sensitive issue an arms for cash reward system may be effective combine any of the above methods 46 after the war is over the guerrilla forces hospitals wil l be kept operational until patients can be transferred to military or civilian hospitals permanently disabled patients should be granted pensions by the new government rehabilitation assistance mu st be available to the guerrillas to assure their place in the civilian community civil affairs support 47 during combat operations the sfod and the guerrilla forc conduct postmission activities such as aars reco nstitution or preparing for the next mission ca forces participate by cond ucting ca battle damage assessment bda this evaluation assesses the results of the mission on th factors of cascope validates the ca and cmo conops and determines w hether the established moes for the operation have been met it also hel ps the sfod and area commander decide when and how to adjust the pla n when to develop new plans to address unforeseen consequences of operations and when to terminate or transition an operation 48 in areas where conflict has subsided and conditions ind icate successfully terminated insurgency tran sition and demobilization activities may begin transition and demobilizatio n require the collaborative efforts of many military and civilian us and international and government and nongovernment agencies ca participatio n is more prevalent in transition and demobilization than in most other aspects of the uw campa ign ca specialists provide the preponderance of ca support although ca generalists will still have an important role 49 ca forces support transition by addressing transition issues early in the planning stages of the uw campaign including establishment of moes and other indic ators that determine points at which to transi tion to different phases of the operation identifying individuals among the insurgency movement who would provide the experience knowledge and leadership required to creat and sustain postuw infrastructure individuals should be identified 43 fm 305201 who can fill roles in government economics and commerce publ ic facilities and special functions at the national provinci and local levels separating those individuals from the main body of guerrilla forces and with the assistance of other government and nonmilitary agencies orienting and training the in dividuals to their future roles in the postuw infrastructure depending on metttc this may occur inside or outside the jsoa refining the transition plan based on periodic assessments of t he situation within the jsoa as well as among the internati onal community observing and validating the moes and other indicators t hat help determine when conditions are righ t to begin the transition phase supporting transition operations by providing advisory sup port to civil administration in friendly territory maintaining the cmoc to facilitate collaborative interagency planning coordination and synchronization throughout all phases of the uw movement and contracting the cmoc according to the transition plan providing postredeployment oversigh t and support mechanisms for the new indigenous government and infrastructure for example reachback points of contact peri odic visits combatant commanders theater engagement programs 410 ca forces support demobilization by considering demobilization issues in transition plans to include interpreting the combatant commanders policy on demobilizati on demilitarization and disarming of the former warring factions supporting sfod fid missions identifying civil sector manpower requirements in government economics and commerce public facilities and special funct ions at the national provincial and local levels establishing programs to screen and identify candidates among the demobilizing guerrilla force to fill required positions in the p ostuw infrastructure establishing and overseeing training programs for former guerr illas to gain new skills and knowledge and to make them peaceful produ ctive members of the new indigenous society psychological operations support 411 the sfod establishes liaison with the psyop element befor demobilization when supporting uw mission the supporting psyop element trains the indigenous personne l in the conduct of effective psyop assists in gaining converts and recruits for the resistance as they develop the necessary governmental infrastructure and conducts operations to create popular support for the resistance movement 44 fm 305201 45 412 the senior psyop commander at the conventional force hq pla ns psyop to support the linkup and demobilization of the guerrilla s the psyop commander prepares and coordinates linkup plans with ps yop personnel supporting the resistance movement because of their ex treme sensitivity and importance demobilization plans must begi n in the early phases of operations and have continuous support 413 psyop in the jsoa prepare the ci vilian population to cooperate fully with the conventional tactical forces psyop elements urge the ci vilian population to remain in place and t hinder operations psyop elements brief the resistance organizations lead ers on the importance of cooperating with the tactical force commanders an d accepting the conventional force leadership psyop elements psycho logically prepare the resistance organization to assume whatever roles the legal government wants it to play these roles include but are not limited to their incorporation into the national army paramilitary organizations national police or demobilization psyop programs explain the demobilization process they promote th insurgents orderly transition to pe aceful civilian life psyop personnel attempt to prevent the formation of quasimilitary or political groups opposing the recognized government loya lty to the legitimate government is the major concern dangers of demobilization 414 the primary concern in any demo bilization program is the guerrilla his personal and political motives va ry the resistance organization can include peasants laborers bandits criminals merchant s and few social and intellectual leaders during the conflict some guerrill as may have achieved status and leadership positions that they now are r eluctant to relinquish others may have found adve nture in combat that they would not now trade for peace or prosperity ho stile groups may have clandestinely infiltrated the guerrilla force to cont inue their own personal or political agenda they may take advantage of the demobilization program t organize paramilitary or political groups that will be in conflict with the new provisional government or us authorities 415 it is imperative that demobilization programs and pr ocedures be executed quickly and with major political support the progr ams and procedures begun are direct result of decisions made by highlevel civilian and military authorities their successf ul implementation requires maximum effort and coordination among sf ca and psyop 416 because of their knowledge and history of the guerrilla force sfods initially remain in their operational ar eas to assist in demobilization the sfod commanders and their supporting ca and psyop elements ensure transfer of us responsibility without ss of control influence or property accountability the key to longterm stra tegic success in uw is planning and executing postmission responsibilities appendix m provides d etailed guidance on the sfods responsibilities appendix unconventional warfare in an urban environment in the current international political atmosphere the emphas is of insurgent activity has shifted from the rural to the urban environment therefore the urban rather than the rural setting will be th battlefield of the future the phenomenon of urbanization is occurring with increasing acceleration in virtually every country of the world urban areas are rapidly expanding both in area and population the us northeastern seaboard has become vast open megalopolis in only few short years in the developing nations the rate of urbanizati on is even more pronounced their cities rate of population growth is much greater than the general rate a1 if the people support the guerrillas cause are neut ral or have been l i n t d b g v r n m n t c t i n s t h g u r r i l l s w i l l b b l t s u r v i v revolutionaries in asia and latin america have turned awa from the classic doctrines of rural insurgency as espoused by mao tsetung nd che guevara and devoted more attention to the struggle in the cities failu re in the countryside is one reason few of the guerrillas who took to t he hills decades ago could boast of much success beyond survival the dramat ic growth of cities in the socalled third world is another reason a2 the upsurge in urban guerrilla warfare has caused worl dwide concern since it has not been confined to developing countries terr orist bombings kidnapping of government officials stre et barricades and open assaults have become commonplace even in the united states the recent t errorist attacks using civilian aircraft and the biological threat within the postal system have proven that we are not immune from this threat a3 the growth of cities everywhere along with the advent of television and the transmission of news via satellite provide an insta nt worldwide audience for almost any act of violence like any other form of warfare urban guerrilla warfare is form of political struggle it can be prelude substitute or an accompaniment to rural guerrilla warfare or to conventional military contest many of asias revolutionaries regard the assaul t on cities as the penultimate stage of takeover according to their views t he struggle must begin in the countryside the countryside and the countryside alone can provide the basis from which the revolutionaries can go forward to final victory lin piao a4 initially this pattern was foll owed by the tupamaros in uruguay who operated briefly as rural guerrillas finding their supp ort among the workers a1 fm 305201 on the sugar and rice plantations in the northern part of the country but they soon realized that uruguay has too little countrysid a5 as stated by one tupamaro we do not have unassailabl strongholds in our country where lasting guerrilla nucleus could b installed on the other hand we have large city with buildings covering more than 300 square kilometers and that allows th development of an urban struggle a6 carlos marighella the posthumously famous brazilian author of the minimanual of the urban guerrilla saw urban guerrilla warfare as means of diverting government forces while rural guerrillas estab lished themselves in the countryside in other parts of latin america urban guerrilla warfare increased as rural guerrillas were chased into the cities b successful government pacification campaigns in the countryside such was the case in guatemala a7 cities have always been centers of human activity the result is greater centralization and consolidation of countrys entir range of social political cultural and economic activities in the urban centers in many countries these activities are centered in only one or two key cities a8 in most cases the capital city of the nation is the primary area of conflict the capital city of practically every national political entity is the nerve center of the nation even in the democratic natio ns where decentralization is more common the capital city occu pies the key position in the political control of country this is even truer in the case of the developing nations a9 all presentday dissident groups are well aware of thi s situation and realize they must center the insurgent an d terrorist activities on the political center of the country to be successful the political in stitutions of state are centered in its capital with controls emanating from t his hub of sovereign power communication media are located in capital and oth er urban areas to cover the area of densest population national police and military forces have their control hq in the capital with subordinate elements in other urban centers a10 in addition to the political powe r most capital cities have symbolic value in terms of custom culture trad itions and religion an insurgent force that can paralyze the capital can effect ively paralyze the entire nation and one that can take over the city with its institutions int act can use these institutions to exercise control over the remainder of the n ation a11 each city is unique it may be built on hillsid in mountainous area or lie on plain it can be located along river or the seashore or in the middle of jungle or desert wherever it is located the s ite wholly or partially limits or restricts its developm ent and in some respects determines the external form and dimensions of the city city is unifor m in its internal composition rather just as two cities are alike each ci ty varies widely within itself city is composed of multiple nucleim arked distinct zones which differ greatly these zones quite disparate althoug h the boundaries between them may be blurred can be residential ranging from the ghetto a2 fm 305201 neighborhood to the comfortable affluent suburbs there ar business service and industrial areas and sometimes combinat ion of these there are often parks and large unbroken expanses of woods lik activities tend to cluster together while those that are incompatible such as highpollutant industries and nurseries are widely separated a12 the truly rural area is completely selfsustaining large urban area never is the material base on which the city is dependent is largely external to it the resources cities need and the goods and servi ces it provides determine the functions of the city some of the standard fu nctions are economic political religious educational residential or any combination of these a13 most cities can be characterized as either preindustrial or industrial in preindustrial cities the upper class lives at or nea r the city center and the lower class lives on the outskirts the reverse is usua lly true in the industrial city the preindustrial city tends to be polynuclear since it is based on bazaartype economy whereas the industrial city is more li kely to have central business distri ct and distinct industrial zone internally dist inctive street patterns place constraints on the type of construction within the city preindustrial cities tend to be tightly knit with irregular street patterns and buildings of fairly uniform height this height is usually three to six stories resulting from the limits imposed at the time of construct ion by lack of technology building materials available or weak foundations low nearly uniform skyline characterizes this type of city with buildings very densely concentrated a14 the industrial city presents quite different form the business district is usually concentrated near th point of peak accessibility in this core buildings are as high as possible to minimize the use of ground space the result is cluster of highrise buildings with the sk yline falling away in all directions in larger cities smal ler versions of the downtown cluster appear at other points throughout the city a15 despite their differences urban areas have certain similarities that provide us with some general characteristics of urban tact ical operations these have special significance regardless of the nature or level of conflict a16 cities are complex and heterogeneous the nature of the cities presents difficulty to the planner as we ll as the operator planning must be in much greater detail than is normally required the use of largescale city plans and street maps is imperative th texture of the city varies greatly and often changes abruptly operators must function in th city core open suburbs industrial areas transpor tation centers parks woods and waterfronts a17 the nature of the city favors the inhabitant and fender the city dweller is the man on the ground with an inherent knowled ge of his daily surroundings these surroundings appear to the outsider as hopelessly tangled web of buildings streets and alleyways but are as familiar to the inhabitant as his own living room buil dings and street co mplexes restrict a3 fm 305201 movement and reduce the attackers mobility but provid fields of fire to the defender obstacles are fairly easy to construct as is the establishment of population control measures checkpoints and traffic c ontrol points a18 small unit engagements will predominate the normal building and street patterns will reduce any op eration to series of small unit engagements the advantage of the principle of mass is gre atly reduced flexibility is decreased for larger units and increased for smaller ones cells or teams operating in the city must be limited to mor than five or six members a19 the unique vertical dimension must be considered t he elevation of the buildings provides vertical di mension not normally encountered in tactical operations this vertical dime nsion is not only above the surface but extends to the subterranean level in th form of subways sewers tunnels and basements elevated positions offer good observation and fields of fire plus cover and concealment particularly effective f or snipers subterranean areas offer protected and concealed areas for storage as well as effective routes of movement and communication a20 combat occurs at extremely short ranges which limits or nullifies the effectiveness of longrange weapons and increases the usefulness of individual weapons operators must be proficient in the quick accurate firing of their personal weapons systems a21 there will be large number of noncombatants present which can be expected to restrict the use of firepower munitions and explosives on the part of the operator at the same time the presence of large numbers of noncombatants can be used to the enemys advantage such s the creation of confusion large numbers of people also increase the operator s blendingin capability a22 there will be collateral damage constraints thes constraints may affect the selection of targets or the means by which the t argets are attacked the limitations may be imposed by higher hq or could t ake the form of moral constraints as in the case of cri tical lifesupport services another form of constraint is where an assigned ta sk would have significantly adverse effect on the mission for example alienating segment of t he population on which the operators existence depended a23 intelligence collection is difficult for the outsider accurate and timely intelligence is of extreme value for the inhabitant dayto day activities and occurrences are routine and taken in stride but these sa activities could provide situation for which the operator is totally unpr epared in the final analysis there is substitute for

particular part of the communications system suc h as radio fails communicators use the alternate radio system however they should continue to use the other primary parts of the system as long s they can interface with the alternate equipment the alternate mechanis m may be upgraded to the primary when equipment availability permit s short duration missions such as raids and ambushes may not need to be pace planned but should at least contain primary alternate and contingency plan b3 communications within the jsoa should also be pace planned one system described below will be usef ul in every situation however combination of the systems in the pace plan will ensure that communications will continue opera tor training and adherence to communications security comsec pr ocedures will make communications success primary b4 the primary communications syst em includes routine communications between the sfod and the sfob or fob the primary usually consists of radio communications in high frequenc hf or tactical satellite tacsat modes iaw standard audiovisual service supplement sav ser sup 6 the primary communications system can handle the message t raffic from the sfods and the base stations the base station communicates wi th the b1 fm 305201 deployed sfods transmitting and re ceiving messages in support of the sfob or fob mission requirements alternate b5 communicators plan and use the alternate communications system in case of primary system failure this system consists of alternate radios frequencies and times in open net contacts iaw sav ser sup 6 usually the same type of encryption system will be used in the event of primary encryption system compromi communicators must plan practice and use an alternate encryption system b6 the alternate communications system should be able to han dle the same amount of traffic as the primary system when initially used it alerts the sfob or fob to potential problem communicators should us it until the primary system is again operational or until exfiltration as long as most of the radio equipment used for the pr imary system is operational this equipment should be used for the alternate system however this s ystem should not remain operational for the duration of the mission an alternate hf or tacsat radio must be infiltra ted with the sfod and kept available in case of primary equipment failure the alternate equipment m ay or may not be of the same type but must be able to transmit and receive in the required mode of operation hf or tacsat base station alternate equipment should be installed in case the primary system fai ls contingency b7 the sfod plans and uses the contingency communications system in case of primary and alternate systems failure the contingency system should be able to provide the normal communications between the d eployed sfod and the sfob or fob but only fo r short durations an example would be battlefield recovery of equipment able to transmit an hf signal or continuous wave cw the guard ne t frequency memorized by the sfod members while in isolation would be used as contingency when loss or compromise of the frequency encipher pad occurs this communication since it is less secure would only be used until the primary or lternate communications equipment or system is operational b8 operating in this mode the sfod is in communicationscritical stage which increases its vulnerability to dete ction therefore commanders at all levels should take steps to bring the primary and alternate communications systems on line as soon as possible an emergency resupply of equipment to the sfod may be necessary meanwh ile communicators would use the current emergency crypto system as contingency encryption system this system could handle the normal amount of message traffic at least for short durations communicators would use primary or alternate encryption system as soon as possible emergency b9 the emergency communications system is last resort med ium for the sfod to inform the sfob or fob of its status if the sfod is operational but lacks necessary communications equipment it uses the em ergency b2 fm 305201 communications system to inform the sfob or fob of this fact the sfod uses the emergency communications sy stem if the emergency resupply is compromised the sfod would also use the emergency communication s system to inform the sfob or fob that all of the sfods commu nications equipment is damaged or compromised an d it is in the evasion mode if the sfod is evading and has higher system of communications such as primary alternate or contingenc then it uses those systems b10 the sfod and the sfob or fob prearranges in detail t he emergency communications system before infilt ration they also coordinate the communication mechanism and the acti ons upon receipt the plan could come in one or twoword message ex filtrated by other resistance elements or groundtoair signals from particular location the emergen cy communications system must be fail safe simple secu re and reliable security b11 uw communications techniques and procedures cover the enti re spectrum of communications available to the sf communicator however as stated above radio communications do minate communications between the sfod and the sfob or fob between elements within the jsoa communications will be predominantly nontechnical in natur at least until the epw threat has been considerably lessened security is the communicators number one concern an communications within the jsoa must be totally clandestine until communications linkup is made with conventional forces the sfods ability to accomplish its mission could be drastically affected if the enemy had knowledge of the presence of the sfod in the jsoa amount of time spent on message traffic being sent and received areas of concentration and message repetition extent of the sophistication and size of the communications net b12 signals security sigsec which includes physical transmission and cryptographic security allows the sfod to operate longer wit hout detection sigsec denies the enemy any usable inte lligence from traffic analysis or radio direction finder rdf data it also keeps the enemy from us ing imitative deception against friendly use of the electromagnetic s pectrum for sigsec efforts to be successful all sfod and guerrilla member s must follow comsec procedures physical security b13 physical security includes all measures taken to safeg uard classified materials and equipment from unauthorized persons these measur have functional destruction plan for materi als and equipment in anticipation of capture of classified materials and equipment by the enemy th sfod commander controls the encryption and decryption systems and the encryption and decryption of message tr affic those personnel transmitting or receiving message traffic should never know the contents of the messages in case of capture and interrogation under circumstance will indigenous personnel be given access to the sf ods encryption systems or equipment b3 fm 305201 used for communications with the sf ob and fob the communicator must sterilize transmission sites after all transmissions b14 only sfod members should have access into any area tha t has classified materials communications eq uipment or communications logs and other documentation indigenous perso nnel must be screened before being trained in communications ssistance within the jsoa transmission security b15 transmission security identifies measures taken to prev ent interception traffic analysis and imitativ deception it also limits the effect of jamming the friendly use of the electromagnetic spectrum to r educe chances of detection communicators use directional antennas and terrain masking from known rdf stations they also adhere to the transmission procedures iaw acp125 communications instructionsradiotelephone procedures and sav ser sup 6 to lessen transmission time and the possibility of threat detection safe practice is to assume the threat has intercepted the signal and has cated the transmission site the communicator should keep transmissions short or risk the cons equences cryptographic security b16 cryptographic security re sults through technically sound cryptographic systems it is impera tive that communicators use only authorized cryptographic systems for transmissions between the sfod and the sfob or fob sufficient quantities and types of cryptogra phic systems should be infiltrated with the sfod to ensure all message tra ffic is encrypted and decrypted using one of these authorized systems communicators will not use these systems for encrypting messa ge traffic within the jsoa the sfod must infiltrate additional encryp tion techniques to ensure communications within the jsoa are secure under circumstances will homemade cryptographic systems be used for any type of radio transmissions methods of communications b17 upon infiltration into the jsoa the sfod may find comm unications systems of the guerrilla forces are of low quality lack reliability and are unsecured or nonexistent the sfod must take immediate steps to develop secure reliable communications between various guerrilla groups and within the guerrilla elements themselves du to the likelihood of high epw threat especially in the initial phases of the resistance mo vement nontechnical communications should prevail messengers b18 although slow messengers ar the most secure means of communications they can carry an encry pted message or signal or memorize traffic to be delivered orally to the intended party messengers m ust be absolutely loyal to the guerrilla organi zation and thoroughly familiar with the terrain and the indigenous people this familiarity allows them to b4 fm 305201 operate without suspicion and move about freely to pick up and deliver messages b19 messenger systems allow the fl exibility to send written messages maps charts equipment or other arti cles however dist ance weather and the tactical situation in the area of the messenger service ca n decrease the effectiveness of the messenger the need for speed must be weighed against the need for security since messenger s are relatively slow in addition information memorized may be forgotte n or distorted and then delivered inaccurately training for prospectiv messengers should include memory enhancement as well as basic moveme nt techniques common to infantry squads fm 78 provides further information radios b20 radio communication is fast but the least secure of all types of communication radios provide timely and accurate communications from one location to another if radio communications have already been incorporated their effectiveness reliability and security mu st be evaluated communicators must decide if the curre nt radio nets should be maintained upgraded or replaced with other systems in addition the pw threat must be evaluated to decide if using radio communications poses an undue risk to the sfod or the guerrilla elements communicators should use radio communications only when the need for speed and accuracy outweig hs the need for security telephones b21 communicators should limit the use of commercial telephon systems in the jsoa during the initial phases of operations the enemy can trace telephone calls quickly and easily even conversations consisting of few code words are risky and should be avoide d in favor of more secure systems of communications if telephone communications between guerrilla mbers must be made they should be kept to an absolute nimum wire communications using field telephone and manual switchboards are also risky in the jsoa wires are very easy to find and can be followed directly to the points of termination even if the points of termination are used sporadically the enemy can surveil wire for indefinite periods rendering them compromised and useless b22 communicators could use wire co mmunications effectively at the op or lp net in patrol base or gue rrilla base complex they could use expedient ground return circuits and existing conductors such as barbed wire fences or railroad rails when th ey use the expedient ground return circuit they must ensure the appropriate parties are hooked t the circuit at the proper time visual signals b23 visual signals can be seen by anyo ne who happens to be looking in the wrong direction at the right time visual communication ca n relay information using any device such as lights mirrors and flags that can be b5 fm 305201 seen from distance when communicators use these devices detail ed planning and coordination are needed to ensure security visua l signals need an encryption system to ensure the meaning is discernible onl to the intended party and to secure the information signal operators can achieve longdistance communication in relatively short time when t hey use binoculars to send and receive message s in relay from hilltop to hilltop b24 communicators can use any device or object as signal that can be displayed in way to produce specific meaning particular color bedsheet hung on clothesline at particular time of day at par ticular place could mean for example that threat patrols were seen in the area wi thin the last 24 hours the important point is that visual signal must have unique way of being identified way that is unm istakable yet not unusual for the area and have specific meaning known only to the receiver flashlights b25 communicators can use flashlights equipped with lens hoods and expedient lightguns form of flashlig ht equipped with sights and trigger mechanism to turn the light on and ff rapidly to send manual morse code four trained operators are required one at each end of the circuit for sending and receiving the message the othe r two for recording the message experienced operators can use this method to send and receive up to 12 coded groups of characters per minute mirrors b26 mirror reflections can be seen at great distances but are very susceptible to interception communica tors should use mirrors to send messages only when bright sunlight is available they use them in an area where the sun reflecting from shiny rfaces is normal such as wet brush and leaves in the morning the distance obtained using mirror s can vary by many miles depending on current weather conditions singleflag method b27 wigwag is visual communication system that uses one single flag on staff to send manual morse code messages the communicator waves the flag in figureeight fashion on the ri ght side of his body to indicate dot and on the left side to indicate dash the communicator then repeats the figure eights on the correct sides of the body to produce character for example one figure eight on the righ t and one figure eight on the left produces an or ditdah the receiver observes the and s ays alpha to his buddy who records it the comm unicator separates the characters by holding the flag in vertical position momentarily the sy stem is slow and has limited usefulness an experienced crew can only exchange five to seven letters per minute doubleflag system b28 the semaphore visual communications system uses two flag s one for each hand held in predetermined patterns to send letters of the alphabet one flag is white with red square in the center the other fl ag is the opposite red flag with white square in the center trained communicators b6 fm 305201 b7 are needed to operate the system which can transmit 12 lett ers per minute the navy used this system during world war ii audio signals b29 anyone in the area whether or not they are paying attenti on can hear unusual sounds audio signals should be totally natural to the area but easily recognizable to the receiver with the meaning clear yet natural and meaningless to others similar to us ing visual signals the communicator should send signals not text since mo rse code sent from horn or other audio device would be instantly recogniz able to anyone in the area regardless of their training or cultural sophistication animals and birds b30 communicators can use dogs to carry messages from point to point but food weather and fear can easily distract them trainers must actually use the routes to be traveled from th intended locations and acquaint the dogs with personnel on both ends of th route they make the dogs aware of other personnel including enemy soldie rs and civilians dogs should be well cared for and stay with their handlers or trainers althoug h some dogs could carry considerable weight messages should be small and hidden in collar or similar device so the dog looks less suspicious from distance b31 carrier pigeons are more effective and reliable messengers t han dogs they must remain at central message location for few days to acquire sense for the home roost pigeons carry messages best when the ssage container is tied to the leg the army used pigeons during worl d war ii in europe appendix c medical aspects before uw deployment the sfod medic should acquire as much medical information as possible at home station to ensure he has current medical intelligence about the jsoa an sfod medic prepares medical area study of the jsoa as part of the overall area study some of the sources he will use to prepare this study include ca area st udies available through the ca database reports by agencies and ngos operating in the area because the study is continuous he up dates it whenever he receives new medical intelligence general

upon infiltration the medic establishes ra pport using his impressive medical skills with the local population and guerrillas he gains valuable opportunity to receive intelligence and information not available elsewhere this information may include captured medical order of battle intelligence from medical supplies and documents th rough battlefield recovery and from indigenous sources it assesses the actu extent of medical training for the resistance force availability of medical supplies and facil ities and the state of the sanitation and health within the jsoa medics should consider the following when conducting the initial medical area assessmen t physical condition and morale of the sfod medical status of the guerrilla forces identification of any immediate thre ats to the health of the command to include epidemics and environmental conditions weather ter rain lack of sanitation food and water problems c3 the medical area assessment is continuous process bas ed on observations and firsthand factual repo rts by the deployed sfod medic the medical area assessment is continuation of the initial dical area assessment it confirms refutes or clarifies previously researched information in the medical area study the medical area as sessment provides intelligence to other units supplements and supports area studies and forms the basis of the aar results of and information on the medic area assessment should not be transmitted out of the jsoa unless significant differences exist between previous inte lligence reports and impact on current or planned operations the following ar suggestions and questions to guide sfod medics in making medical area assessment indigenous personnel c4 sfod medics indicate the name of the tribe or native gr oup and describe them in

local medical practices c15 sfod medics describe the types of local medical practitioners are there conventional doctors available to include missionaries nd other nonindigenous personnel what is th eir level of formal training and specialization do their techniques conf orm to american practices do they have government support or affiliation who is the local medica l leader is he licensed doctor

the general char acteristics of language dress and physique the same what other forms of cooperation occur and for wha t purpose c4 fm 305201 fauna c20 sfod medics record species of wild animals birds reptiles and arthropods found on the march around campsites and in villages if their names are unknown medics describe th em medics note relationships among these species including burrows and nesting sites to human habitation food supplies and watering sites c21 sfod medics note the occurrence of dead or dying animals especially if they involve large numbers of given species they note the rel ationship of any dieoff to the occurrence of human diseases c22 sfod medics report any methods used by indigenous personnel to defend against local ectoparasites leec hes how effective are these methods compared to standard us protective measures insect repellent organization of medical ements within the jsoa c23 the goals of medical operations in support of uw are to cons erve the fighting strength of guerrilla forces and to help secure local population support for us and guerrilla forces operating within the js oa medical requirements within the jsoa differ from those posed by conventional force doing operations for two reasons guerrilla forces normally suffer fewer battle casualties and their incidence of diseases and malnutrition is often higher c24 in uw commanders tailor the organization of medical elemen ts to fit the particular situation depending on the skills required organizers might be able to bring personnel from other medical units into the jsoa the basic medical organization can expand by using guerrilla force mbers and recruiting professional medical personne l to establish and operate guerrilla hospitals c25 clandestine facilities are at firs t confined to emergency and expedient care with minimum preventive medici ne once the area command develops sufficiently the clandestine facilities can expand and become part of the units medical organization wounded guerrilla allowed to fall into enemy hands can be forced to reveal what he knows and may compromise the mission patients with appropriate co ver stories can be infiltrated into civilian or enemy military hospitals to receive the care not ot herwise available medical requirements c26 guerrilla forces frequently igno re minor injuries and illness due to high motivation and adaptation to frequent hardship and di scomfort historically the lack of proper medi cal attention has led to serious illness and disability causing reduced unit combat effectiveness c27 health standards in many areas will be below those of th united states indigenous personnel may not ccept treatment that is desirable for us personnel because of religious belie fs or superstitions also natives may have an acquired immunity to certain diseases of the area c5 fm 305201 c28 broad range of medical support may be available in t he jsoa although at first treatment may be limited to rudimentary medical procedures such as first aid and pers onal hygiene some guerrillas in the past have developed highly organized and effective medical support units and installations their organizations paralle led those of conventional forces to include field hospitals in inaccessible areas c29 medical elements supporting the resistance forces must be mobile responsive and effective in preventing disease and restoring the sick and wounded to duty there may be safe rear area where the guerrilla can take casualties for treatment wounded and sick personnel become tactical problem rather than logistics problem medical support i s major tactical consideration in all operations the civilian infrastructure of the guerrillas contributes to medical support by setting up and operating medical facilities medical personnel help during combat operations by starting casualty collection points permitting the remaining members of the guer rillas to keep fighting casualties at these points are evacuated to guerrilla base or civilian care facility c30 in uw the attitude of the sick and wounded is extremely important the emotional importance the individual soldier attributes to t he medical service goes long way in his care and treatment because th sick and wounded can find themselves in difficult conditions they have simple wants for shelter food and medical treatment standards of care are not lowered these soldiers may just be unaware of any shortcomings in the medical care they receive experience has shown th at soldier may have major surgery under extreme hardship conditions and yet demonstrate remarka ble recuperative power medical net c31 the medical net in the jsoa is kept as simple as possible just enough to provide security and fit the estimated needs of future expansion of the jsoa medical personnel refine and modify the net after it is functioning and secure when setting up medical net personnel must consider the following scale of activities already in existence and those planned potential increase in strength activities and operations physical factors including topograp hy climate and geography plus transportation and communications the number availability and dependability of medically q ualified and semiqualified personnel in the jsoa the attitude of the population government and guerrilla towar d medical problems and the medical standards accepted in the area existing nonmedical operational facilities of the area command c32 medical personnel may use the exis ting intelligence and security nets to start separate medical net for co llecting medical intelligence they can also use the existing logistics ne t to transport medical supplies c6 fm 305201 aid station c33 overall mission planning includes locating and oper ating an aid station medical personnel provide em ergency medical treatment at this location evacuation of wounded perso nnel from the battle area begins here because the condition of the wounded may preclude movement to the unit base they are hidden in secure locations and the auxiliary is notified the auxiliary will care for and hide the wounded or evacuate them to treatment facility c34 the evacuation of the dead is important for security reason s if the enemy identifies the dead the safety of the guerrilla families may be jeopardized personnel evacuate and cach the bodies of those killed in action until they can be properly buried or disposed of iaw the customs of the local population removal and burial of the dead will deny the enemy valuable intelligence concerning indigenous casualties c35 as the operational area develops and the situation favors the sponsor evacuation of the more seriously injure d or diseased personnel to friendly areas may become possible this action will lighten the burd on local facilities and provide higher standard of medical care for the remaining patients air evacuation is the most logical evacuation mean s but the disadvantage is its inherent threat to security landing site s must be located well away from sensitive areas and gu errilla forces must secure and control the surrounding area until the aircraft leaves convalescent facility c36 the area where patients are sent to recuperate is called convalescent facility these patients are discharged as soon as possible convalescent facility may be safe house in which one or two convalescents re recuperating with their ne cessary cover stories or it could be in any base camp in guerrillacontrolled areas guerrilla hospital c37 the guerrilla hospital is medi cal treatment facility or complex of smaller facilities providing inpatient medical support to the guerrilla force guerrilla hospital is established during the organization and buildup phase of resistance organization must be read for operation at the start of combat operations and must continue to pr ovide medical support until directed otherwise the hospital is generally in the jsoa it supports but considerations of metttc may dictat otherwise an indigenous medical officer with advice and assistance of the us sf group or bat talion surgeon will usually command the guerrilla hospital however dependi ng on circumstances within the jsoa the group or battalion sur geon may be the commander c38 the guerrilla hospital rarely if ever outwardly resembles conventional hospital the requirement for strict security flexibility and rapid mobility precludes visible compar ison with conventional military or any civilian medical facilities as the gu errilla force consolidates its hold on the jsoa all medical support functions will tend to consol idate safe areas allow the establishment of centralized system of medical care c7 fm 305201 sophisticated hospitals permit care th at is more elaborate because they provide wider selection of trained pe rsonnel specialized equipment and the capability of more extensive and prolonged treatment hospita l considerations will depend on the following factors location c39 the guerrilla hospital staff co nducts reconnaissance for possible hospital sites and coordinates the training of guerrilla mem bers who will support hospital operations the hospital should be in secur area but accessible to casualties site planners must consid er security topography distance mobility and enemy counterguerrilla activities sanctuary across an international border is ideal for guerrilla hospital security c40 there must be strict security meas ures to protect the covert nature of the guerrilla hospital operations curity compromises can lead to the capture of the hospital staff patien ts and supplies which may compromise members of the auxiliary or underground or jeopardize the entire operation communications c41 rapid communications are essential between the hospital command and the area or sector commander to maintain adequate medical support and ensure survival coordinating hospital movement receiving casualties and supplies requesting support and disse minating intelligence all depend on rapid and secure communications medical supplies c42 after infiltration the sfod requests adequate medical s upplies for initial hospital operations plans must provide for automatic and oncall medical resupply although the staff should make ma ximum use of locally available supplies the staff coordinates with the guerrilla force to acquire food and rations for the hospital patients sections c43 guerrilla hospital has several ctions some sections are collocated others should be dispersed for security reasons staffing guerrilla hospital depends on the mission and availability of trained medical personnel personnel must be attached to th hospital to provide security communications and logistic support there are seven recommended sections of guerrilla hospital c44 the c2 section provides command over hospital personnel and supervision of hospital functions it maintains communications with the area or sector commander of the hospital it coordinates security for the hospital c45 security is primarily function of location early warnin g and movement the guerrilla hospital should be located in an area where the local populace is friendly or sympatheti c to us personnel and the guerrillas c8 fm 305201 security should rely heavily on earl warning diversionary tactics and movement to alternate locations c46 this section provides logistic support to include supply transportation and graves registration c47 personnel in this section establish and maintain one or more sites that serve as staging areas for limited medical care and movement of patients and supplies to the treatment section for security reasons these sites are the only contact the gue rrilla force has with the hospital c48 medical surgical and immedi ate postoperative care comes from this section it is the central activity of the hospital and all other sections support it individuals staffing triage sites should not be told the location of the treatment center only treatment center staff memb ers will pick up patients at triage sites to ta ke them to the central treatment center c49 this section establishes facilit ies to care for patients longer requiring the intensive support provided by the treatment section such facilities increase the dispersion of patients depending on the condition of the patients placed in convalescent facilities hospital personnel may not be required to continually staff this area c50 this section establishes sites where patients may be transported once they have received ma ximum benefits from hospitalization these sites are basically unmanned g eographic points used as dropoff locations where patients may be return ed to their units ready for combat medical training of guerrilla forces c51 the sfod medic begins medical training of guerrilla for ces at the earliest possible opportunity he sele cts the personnel to be trained and screens them for their abilities those with potential are trained as company medics or nurses he then develops the training program for each of the different functions needed within the guerrilla medical system he teaches the principles of self help and buddy aid to the entire guerrilla force other training includes preventive dicine procedures basic sanitation personal hygiene and individual pr otective measures he also ensures immunizations of the guerrilla force and their families c52 the newly trained medical personnel should make maximum use of all medical facilities they also help the medic train addition medical personnel the amount and quality of th training depends on the situation facilities and instructors however the knowledge and ability of the sfod medic will ultimately decide the success of the program periodic medical reports c53 depending on the tactical and medical situations in the jsoa the sfob or fob will determine the frequenc and contents of periodic medical reports before infiltration the sfob or fob briefs the sfod on the health of the guerrilla forces casualty rate wounds or diseases and overall guerrilla medical condition c54 the training status report will include c9 fm 305201 c10 new training programs since last report change in number of trainees change in number of graduates from training programs adequacy of training aids c55 the medical program report will include medical supply status to include the following supplies reduced to critical level success rate with supply procurement within the ao general condition of supplies and equipment following air resupply operations new projects and facilities since the last report and any ses due to enemy activity any serious medical problems that may exist and the level of care patients are receiving in facilities of friendly forces whether other medical personnel are aiding friendly forces more than expected number of new guerrilla personnel both full and parttime

strikes or invasion not other forms of coercion international law contains general prohibition on the use of force that is physical violen ce or the threat of physical violence this prohibition is memorialized in the charter article 24 all members shall refrain in their international relations from t he threat or use of force against the territorial integr ity or political independence of any state d7 the charter also outlaws aggre ssive war aggression is the use of armed force bombardment or blockade inconsistent with the charter the sponsoring of terrorists mercenari or irregular combatants is also considered aggression d8 the international court of justic in nicaragua versus united states has ruled state is not permitted to resort to selfdefense against aggression unless it is subjected to an armed attack the state may be able to take proportionate countermeasures it is us policy that once terrorist or other attack occurs or is expected to occur the united sta tes can use force to prevent or deter attacks unless reason able grounds exist to believe that further attack will be undertaken the united states is commi tted to using d2 fm 305201 force in its selfdefense only when ne cessary and only to the extent it is proportionate to the specific threat d9 recognized exception to the prohibition on the use of force is t he law of selfdefense this inherent right of selfdefense is also codified in the charter article 51 this article states nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs against member of the united nations until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain internati onal peace and security also recognized by customary international law is the doctrine of anticipatory selfdefense that is defe nsive action taken in response to an imminent armed attack by another stat or recognized international state abductions d10 abduction is the forcible nonconsensual removal of person by one state from the territory of another state american law enforcement officials refer to such abductions as arrests to be acceptable under international law abduction must satisfy more exacting standards tha n the availability of an arrest warrant issued by the state responsible for the act ion abduction may be considered criminal conduct in the state from which person was taken additionally regardless of whether the state from which an individual was taken is hostile to the abducting state abductions constitute an extremely sensitive operation that ca n significantly affect international relations the united states reserves the right to engage in non consensual abductions for three specific reasons if state for internal political reasons may be unwilling t extradite target or give its public consent to the targets removal u nofficially the state may be prepared to have the target removed without granting formal consent and may even offer some cooperation in carrying out the action when the target is an extremely dangerous individual and is accused of grave violations of internat ional law such as air piracy to prevent terrorists other dangerous individuals and thei r state supporters from assuming they are safe from such unilateral ac tion d11 1989 abduction of mexican nati onal from mexico by other mexican nationals was in response to an offer by the united states to pay his bounty upon delivery to the united states the u s trial court judged this action an illegal acquisition of jurisdiction the charges that led to the us offer were dismissed for lack of legally acquired custody over the accused under us law custody of the accused cannot be obtained in such way as to shock the sensitivities of the court attacks on terrorists and terrorist camps d12 the united states recognizes an d strongly supports the principle that state subject to continuing terrorist attacks may respond with appropriate use of force to

12333 states person employed by or acting on behalf of the united states government shall engage in or conspire to engage in assassination article 23b of the hague conventi ons of 1907 essentially prohibits wartime assassination outlawing th treacherous wounding or killing of the enemy or offering reward for an enemy dead or alive neither executive order nor the hague conventions prohibi t attacks on individual soldiers or officers of the enemy whether in the zone of hostilities occupied territory or elsewh ere an individual combatant can be targeted lawfully whether he or she is directly involved in com bat providing support or acting as staff planner harsh but accept ed consequence of such military operations is the collate ral death of noncombatants following lawful attacks enemy prisoners of war d14 the sfod captures prisoner and is now at an immediat disadvantage one or two men must guard the epws which redu ces the strength of the sfod and impacts on its capability to compl ete the mission epws will hamper the movement of th sfod and increase the likelihood of the sfods compromise treatment of an epw d15 the sfod must treat the epws humanely and afford them ll rights and privileges required under the geneva convention for the treatm ent of prisoners of war epws will not be targeted even if their presence jeopardizes the mission the sfod has four options with regard to epws take the individuals into custody and evacuate them later take the individuals into custody hold them and later leav them where they are likely to be found while in us custody they m ust be treated iaw the geneva conventions take the individuals into custody and later turn them in t an allied power the allied power must be signatory to the geneva conventions and willing to treat the epws as required by the geneva conventions take the individuals into custody just let them walk aw ay use of the enemys uniform d16 article 23f of the hague conven tions of 1907 prohibits the improper use of the enemys uniform that is wearing its uniform while engaged in combat the difficult issue is that of finding proper use of the uniform although wearing the uniform while engaged in actual combat is unlawful us forces may wear it to allow movement into and through th enemys territory us policy states that the enemys uniform may b used for infiltration behind enemy lines however article 39 of protocol i to the geneva conventions prohibits this and other uses of the enemys uniform an enemy nation party to protocol i may consider the use of its uni form by us forces as war crime and take remedial action appendix logistics considerations the types quantity and phasing of supplies influence the gu errillas their capabilities and limitations and the type of mission s they undertake supplies and equipment made available to the guerr illas may influence their morale since each shipment represents encouragement and assurance of support from the outside world once channel of supply is established the guerrillas w ill continue to rely on that source for support resources e1 historically guerrillas have lived off the land the resour ces of country and distribution of these reso urces affect the size and number of guerrillas that may be organized and maintained in jsoa the area command provides supplies to the guerrillas within the jsoa the command must consider resources in foodproduci ng areas when it organizes additional guerrillas guerrillas in the jsoa at first depend heavily on these local sources for their support logistic plan s are based on an equitable system that limits potential hardships to civilians and does not alienate them this system gives the sfod strong leverage to guide and mentor the g uerrilla leaders logistic support to the guerrilla forces e2 logistic support of guerrilla force s includes the same functions as those of conventional forces labor mainte nance construction hospitalization evacuation supply and transportation problems of transpor ting supplies and equipment over or through territory under enemy control compl icate this support it creates requirement for clandestine delivery which limits the amount of external logistic support fo r the jsoa external sources have not always furnished extensive transporta tion maintenance hospitalization evacuation and construction to the jsoa metttc and the delivery means available determine the nature and ex tent of external logistic support external support will eventually end an d the guerrillas must be prepared to continue without these supplies logistic support to the theater e3 logistic preparation of the theater lpt combines pe acetime planning actions to maximize means of providin g logistic support to the commanders plan lpt would reduce the time and resources required to support the uw operation intheater by maximizing the use of contracting and w ar reserves strategic lift resources three primary co nsiderations that affect support for the guerrilla forces are explained below e1 fm 305201 geographic location e4 geographic location determines the type and extent of the logi stic support needed in agriculturally producti ve areas the guerrillas need for an external source of food will be less than in those areas unsuitab for agriculture location affects the type and amount of personal c lothing equipment and life expectancy of these items it also has bea ring on diseases and noncombat injuries the geography of an area and the enemy situation influence the type of targets to be attacked size of force e5 when local food procurement is only adequate for the existing for ce food supply problems will limit the size of forces intelligence in the jsoa enables the sfod and the area commanders to forecast needs and p lan appropriate procurement in advance type of operation e6 available support determines the type of operation that can be conducted support for various operat ions can range from rifle for one sniper to weapons communications food and medicine for company raiding an enemy supply depot or troop installation the expec ted nonavailability of these logistics in the early phases will dictate doing small easy combat operations planning e7 logistic plans traditionally have provided support to the guerrilla forces on an increasing scale within the limits and capabiliti of the sponsoring power initial plans are based on forecasts prepared by the st aff of the theater so commander the ability to meet requirements for any pr otracted operation depends on the validity of the initial assessment mad during isolation e8 the organizations and agencies that execute logistic plan s must be able to adjust rapidly to changes high er hq enemy action weather and unforeseen developments within the jsoa may impose changes the s upport provided the guerrilla forces should be continuous and plans to provide that support must be kept flexible to m eet changing conditions flexibility is achieved by having primary alternate and contingency plans locating installations throughout th area to reduce to the minimum the travel time of guerrilla forces providing adequate reserves of supplies personnel equipment communication and transportation assets from which prompt deliveries can be made having several principal and alternate points and routes for delivery of equipment and supplies for the guerrilla forces e9 the time between planning and executing and the time i nvolved in executing an operation expose the logistic situation to unforeseen developments to be successful the enti re logistic scheme must be highly e2 fm 305201 flexible during joint planning th sfob or fob and the sfod develop tentative supply plans for each jsoa the sfod may alter thes plans based on its area assessment e10 the guerrilla force has two source s of logistic support those sources are either internalfrom within the jsoaor they are external from the sponsor internal support e11 the jsoa must first provide the required internal logistic support the area command must develop an effect ive internal logistic system tailored to the needs of the operation it must balance its support requi rements against the need to gain and mainta in civilian goodwill and cooperation imposing excessive demands on the civ ilian population may adversely affect this cooperation e12 battlefield recovery is the prim ary method of resupply in the jsoa using enemy equipment and supplies through offensive operations the guerrilla force can satisfy its logistic requirements and at the same time deny the enemys use of these supplies with good intelligence and proper planning guerrillas can conduct raids and ambushes ag ainst small isolated enemy installations and unescorted convoys to capture the needed items from these targets of opportunity e13 personnel may use currency to purchase supplies from internal sources money may be of the area or be suitable substitute such as gold or promissory notes procurement throug h purchase is usually restricted to critical or scarce items not available elsewhere the guerrilla force must ensure that the infusion of outsid currency does not disrupt the local economy unless economic disruption is also goal e14 the guerrilla force may organize levy system based on the ability of each family or group to contribute this system ensures that the burden of supplying the guerrillas is distributed evenly throughout the civilian population the local population is told that payment will ev entually be made for the supplies taken the area command supply officer may give receipts to individuals he also keeps records of the transactions when establishing the levy system the commander considers many obstacles that coul d affect procurement in his operational area among them are chronic food shortages enemy interference or competition for supplies impact of combat actions such as scorched earth policies and nuclear biological and chemical nbc or radioactive contam ination competition from other rival guerrilla units e15 the area command may not want to engage in barter with the civilian population because of possible adverse effects on the levy system sometimes it is mutually beneficial to exchange critical items for example medical supplies for food clothing or services e16 guerrilla forces cut off from most civilian production fac ilities and support often find it necessary to impr ovise their own field expedients they e3 fm 305201 may have to plant and raise some of their own foodstuff and lives tock based on the percentage of supplies available from external sources and those available internally the area commander may consider establ ishing farms and even factories for the production and repair of hardtofind item s e17 confiscation is supply method that the guerrilla force may use to fulfill requirements that cannot be met by other methods of int ernal supply it often confiscates items when civilians refuse to cooperate or are actively collaborating with the enemy confisca tion alienates the civilian population the guerrilla force uses this method only in emergencies or to punish collaborators the area command must stri ctly control confiscation to be sure it does not deteriorate into indiscrimina looting confiscation is the least desirable method of gaining internal logistic support external support e18 the area command normally limits supplies from an extern sponsor to items essential for support of combat operations these items us ually consist of standard arms ammuniti on demolitions and communications equipment under certain conditions sponsor may expand its logistic support to include evacuation of the sick and wounded food clot hing medicine and nonstandard items unavailable in the area characteristics of logistics e19 various services and organization s under theater control render their support to sf through theater directiv the theater supplies requirements peculiar to sf from local sources and agencies within the jsoa the plans and preparations for combat operatio ns include many difficult logistic problems theater command lower commands under theater and the jsoa must wrestle with these problems e20 the army supply system provid logistics support for deployed sfods with funds allocated to the sf commander for local purcha and contract or both the existence and capability of army suppor t activities in the area the mission and duration of the mission determine th level of support an allocation of funds is requ ired to support deployment for critical or unprogrammed requirements in areas where the army supply system cannot provide support the guerrilla force uses these funds for barter local purchase local hire and contractual services in support of the sfods sometimes funds are required to support indigenous paramili tary or irregular units organized by the sfod e21 once the sfod is assigned or attached to command for employment the operational base sfod fob or aob provides logistics support the base then contacts the special operat ions support element sose sose coordinates external logistics support and sustainment for the operational bases in the rear area this support follows conventional logistics support procedures and provisions for it are included in existing unified command uw plans the theater soc serves as the agency to prepare uw log istics support estimates which the sfob or fob coordinates and e4 fm 305201 processes the quantity and types of supplies and equipment carried by sf on their infiltration accompanying supply are determined by physical capabilities responsiveness to friendly control contacts existing with guerrilla forces size and status of training enemy capabilities infiltration agency limitations land and sea infiltration limitations requirements for survival available resources in the jsoa e22 preparation for logistics support of the guerrilla forces requires much time it is often necessary to move men and equipment to start the buildup of needed facilities and supplies before assigning detailed tasks in these circumstances the logistics support activities are based on the broad missions assigned to the sf elements time distance and emy action and capabilities affect all logistic activiti the projected jsoa and the enemys dispositions and capabilities may require special transpor tation facilities and close coordination with other forces within the theater phases of supply e23 included in phases of supply are accompanying resupply automatic and emergency and oncall or routine each of these is discussed in the following paragraphs accompanying e24 the sfod may take accompanying supplies into the jsoa at the time of infiltration it receives these supp lies in isolation at the sfob or fob while undergoing mission preparation in isolation the sfod prepares and rigs its accompanying supply for delivery the threat in th jsoa dictates the quantity and type of supplies an d equipment to be included other influences are the capabilities size and responsiveness of the guerrilla force to sponsor assistance enemy capabilities and situation metttc method of infiltration air land or sea requirements for sere available resources in the jsoa size and capability of the reception committee requirements for sustaining operations pending receipt of an automatic resupply e5 fm 305201 need for key items of equipment to partially equip cadre nucleu s of the guerrilla force when reception committee is expected on infiltration other items of equipment and supplies to help establish rappor t with the guerrillas resupply e25 the sfod preselects resupply it ems in isolation to replenish or supplement consumed supplies the sfod receives these items after infiltration in the past these items were called followup sup plies because they followed infiltration resupply is delivered automatically on time schedule or conplan when an event happens or does not happen e26 the sfob or fob schedules the delivery of automatic and emergency resupply to the sfods preplanned automatic resupply provides the guerrilla force with immediate supplies and equipment until oncall or routine resupply procedures are establis hed supply personnel normally pack equipment and supplies in appropriate ae rial delivery containers that have cargo capacity of 500 pounds or less to ease handling and tr ansportation within the jsoa packers mark door bundles for easy id once t hey arrive on the dz to allow rapid clearance of the dz the contents of each container are further packaged in manportable units of about 50 pounds each packers must brief dz parties on these manport able containers if the containers are to be carried long distances the sf od must arrange transportation assets with the guerrilla support arm auxiliary automatic resupply e27 the sfod plans for automatic resu pply before infiltration for delivery time location contents and the id marking system or auth entication automatic resupply is delivered after the sfod successfully infiltrates and establishes radio contact unless the sf od cancels modifies or reschedules the delivery automatic resupply augm ents equipment that could not be carried in on the initial infiltration automatic resupply so reinforces us support of the guerrillas in addition it fulfills the need for selected items to equip nucleus of the guerrilla force should the reception commit tee not appear on infiltration emergency resupply e28 emergency resupply items include missionessential equip ment and supplies to restore operational capability and survivabilit of the sfod the detachment plans delivery times meth ods and locations and contents of emergency resupply before infiltration e29 as minimum resupply should consist of communicati ons equipment and enough missionessential supplies to establish base contact emergency resupply may contain complete table of organization and equip ment toe issue with contents to be determined in isolation e30 arrangements for emergency resupply delivery begin when ra dio contact has not been established between the deployed sfod and t he sfob or fob within 144 hours the process is started after 72 hours of radio e6 fm 305201 contact it then takes the united stat air force usaf 72 more hours to drop supplies on the dz another triggering event is when d eployed sfod loses communications with the sfob or fob for predetermined consecutive number of scheduled callups oncall or routine e31 when communications have been established between the sfod and the sfob or fob external supply begins oncall personnel u the abbreviated code in the catalog supply system contained in t he soi to request supplies based on operational need these supplies consist of major equipment items that are not consumed at predictable rate they are held in readiness at theater army area command taacom depots or at the sfob or fob for immediate delivery on specific missionrequest basis e32 to determine the quantity of pplies to request the sfod considers the guerrilla forces rate of expansion the anticipated tempo of operations and its ability to receive transport store and secure incoming supplies e33 the sfod also anticipates its operational needs for suppli and equipment in the jsoa the moc at the sfob or fob packs nd rigs the supplies into manportable loads and colo r codes them before infiltration the moc color codes the supplies iaw the type of supplies in the loa d so they will not have to be opened for identification e34 as the guerrilla force expands and logistic requirements increase internal popular support can longer provide subsistence wi thout creating hardships or lowering the living standards of the civilian s at this point the force must obtain logistics support from an external source this dependence on the external source requires routine supply system as th jsoa grows the need for external supply normally outgrows the oncall method of requesting supplies organization of supply e35 the area command with advice from the sfod plans develops operates and controls the guerrilla forces logistics system each element of the area command has specific role in the logistics system and each system is developed to meet the specific need s and peculiarities of the jsoa supply organization systems may be centralized or decentralized during the organizational and buildup phase the command may centrali ze logistic operations all supplies are moved into one collection area the s fod procures logistics from throughout the jsoa processes them thr ough centralized or decentralized collection poin t and distributes to all units of the guerrilla force e36 as the jsoa matures subordinate units take over sector where they are responsible for establishing separate and decentralized pply procurement system they distribute all supplies throughout the jsoa to several distribution centers this centralization improves security since the compromise or destruction of the procurement system in one sector will not destroy the entire apparatus another advantage of this sy stem is that it permits an equitable distribution of the logistics burden on the civilian population movement of supplies between sectors is kept to minimum and e7 fm 305201 names storage sites and caches are not passed from sector to sector the area commander delegates supply oper ations to sector commanders he retains the responsibility for the overa ll plans he also reports supply needs to the sponsoring power and issues dire ctives covering operations plans and directives may include organization of supply and service support units organization and employment of civilian support units systems of levy and barter on civilians receipt of payment for supplies collection storage transportation and distribution of supp lies quantity and type of supplies to be maintained allocation of supplies to major lower commands e37 the area commander provides all supply items to the sect or commander the sector commanders pply their units and conduct supply operations according to the plans di rectives and orders of higher hq individual units within their assigned sectors conduct decentralized supply operations the sector commander makes his needs known to the next higher hq for supplies and equipment not avail able within his area he distributes all supplies and equipment received fr om higher hq besides supplying his sector he may be charged with supplyi ng adjacent sectors as directed by higher hq types of supplies e38 when compared to similarsize d conventional force guerrilla force has fewer supplies but an even greater need for more basic logist ic requirements and equipment for combat operations these needs consi st of food clothing shelter weapons and ammunition e39 areas suitable for guerrilla base camps may have some natural foods such as berries edible plants and small game these foods are not sufficient to sustain the energy of active guerrilla s they need highcalorie foods such as rice sugar and protein e40 guerrillas must have seasonal clothing for areas where r adical climatic changes occur warm and wate rproof clothing is necessity gore tex is nicetohave item for the guerrilla because sfod members w ill be wearing their issued goretex guerrilla depends on his feet as the primary mode of transportation he needs highquality wellfitting boots e41 shelters such as natural caves offer the best protection fr om the elements and enemy observation guerrillas can build sturdy weatherproof huts from boughs and branches but th ey should build them under living foliage for longterm concealment from air observation equipment and logistics e42 during mission pla nning command personnel id entify threat weapons and request and issue similar rifles and ammunition at first captured weapons provide the primary source of weapons resupply and repla cement e8 fm 305201 parts in addition personnel may set up underground facili ties to manufacture or repair weapons they establish accountability by weapon type and quantity to find the rate of ammunition consumption and resupply e43 usually replacement of weapon s exists except for those captured and provided by the sfob or fob proc edures need to be set up to acquire pll stock replace burned out machine gun barrels and provide armorer repair parts and cleaning kits ammunition e44 in the early stages of organization and development ammun ition resupply requirements are limited once committed to fullscale combat operations guerrillas will use more ammunition and must d etermine resupply rates more accu rately personnel should draw ammunition for combat operations from cache system the guerrilla support elem ent normally draws ammunition from the area command or sector comm and supply caches ammunition is distribu ted on regular basis the schedule for distribution is consistent with th tempo of combat operations personnel may obtain resupply by setting up caches at preselected rps or msss they must consider the following when deciding ammunition requiremen ts each engagement is influenced by the rate of ammunition expendituremeasured in the basic load carried and expenditur per weapon guerrillas because they fight on their terms may use less ammunition than conventional forces strict fire discipline should be imposed to conserve the limited amount of ammunition initially available guerrilla forces are projected to fire onehalf to twothirds of their basic load in any one engagement for planning considerations guerr illa forces will engage in combat operations once month explosives e45 personnel calculate the amount and type of explosives needed depending on the target interdicting complex target systems by multiple attacks at different locations througho ut the jsoa requires vast amounts and different kinds of explosives individual equipment e46 to determine priorities for suppl ying individual equipment personnel must study climatic conditions topogr aphy ethnic groups and the morale of the guerrillas items that are highly ranked include good quality footgear warm goretex clothing ponchos and firstaid kits intermediate priority items may be uniforms extreme weather clothing sleeping gear mission oriented protective posture mopp gear loadbearing eq uipment pll and petroleum oils and lubricants pol requirements for all weapons and equipment normally 6 months after infiltration replacement items may be pair of boots two or three pairs of w oolen socks and one pair of trousers for e9 fm 305201 each guerrilla later another pair of boots more pairs of woolen socks and uniform for each guerrilla co uld be expected metttc medical supplies e47 providing medical supplies and medical treatment is strong morale factor units require basic medicines an d supplies to treat sick and wounded guerrillas and the local population the most important med ical supplies are preventive medicines such as antimala ria pills sulfa iodine and various serums for protection against contagio us diseases also each platoonsized element needs at least one firstaid kit replacement medical pplies may be made for planning purposes one third of basic issue after 6 months and one third of total issue after 12 months in the jsoa appendi x c includes medical aspects transportation e48 the local auxiliary provides tran sportation support to the guerrilla forces in remote or underdeveloped ar eas the means of transportation will be on foot or by pack animal more sophisticated environments will normally have modern forms of transportation available the guerrilla forc may find it advantageous to first acquire and then later operate its ow n fleet of vehicles it also requires supply of pll and pol storage e49 the guerrilla force carefully pres erves packs transports and stores its equipment as soon as possible to prevent its discovery and loss it disperses similar equipment throughout cache sites to prevent complete loss if one cache would be found excellent locations are cellars of factories underground passages sewers empty buildings gardens an d even churches in palestine after world war ii sma ll weapons cache sites were concealed within double walls of houses they also were buried and sealed inside lead pipes the force usually constructs rger underground caches with special material to withstand the rigors of longterm storage caches e50 the protected storage of supplies and equipment is importa nt to the area command logistics plan caches may be used to support current or future operations or be reserved fo r emergencies supplies in excess of current requirements are carefully packaged to prevent damage fr om exposure they are then cached in number of isolated locations known only to the area commander sfod members and key personnel who hav access to the cache site map e51 the guerrilla force may establis h caches in friendly areas or in enemyheld areas after hostilities have begun the guerrilla force may locate them in caves swamps forests cemete ries rivers or lakes dispersed cache systems permit the guerrilla force to operate throughout the jsoa independent of their base areas four major considerations for caches are locations that will help all operations probability that the particular cache will be needed e10 fm 305201 maximum storage life of the items involved problems of providing security to or from the cache e52 sfod members hide their supplies in remote rural areas to ensure their survival in case of compromise possible cache sites are wells caves hollow trees cisterns unused culverts an d banks below water level of lakes streams or rivers sfod members must properly prepare the c ache site otherwise the supplies may be damaged or discovered they must choose ground that affords adequate drainage of ground water when cach ing supplies for more than few days the sfod must be sure the ca che is camouflaged ventilated and insulated against dampness it is very important to camouflage the ventilators sfod members must lso properly preserve the equipment to protect against rust and mildew ap pendix k provides additional guidance on caching mission support sites e53 guerrillas set up temporary base or mss to use when way from their primary base camp during an oper ation for extended periods guerrillas use the mss for food shelter medical support ammunition or explosives using an mss eliminates unnecessary mo vement of supplies and allows the guerrilla force to move rapidly to and from target sites when selecting an mss sfod members consider cover an d concealment distance to the objective and supply sources and the presence of enemy security forces in the area maintenance and repairs e54 the sfod obtains materials from the local civilian economy or through combat operations against the enemy at first basic maintenance and minor repair of equipment is limit ed to operator maintenance as the movement expands personnel establish clandestine makeshift ordnance and repair facilities the sponsorprovid ed supply packages contain necessary maintenance and repair items such as tools small arms r epair kits replacement parts and pol cleani ng materials sfod members must consider the use of special or highsp eed equipment that may only complicate the maintenance system by requir ing highly trained technicians delivery systems e55 the sfod in the jsoa delivers all external supplies and equipment to the guerrilla force it is essential th at sensitive items such as weapons ammunition demolitions radios drugs or special equipmen t be controlled an sfod member must be present at all deliveries of external pplies to ensure positive control and account ability usually sponsorprovided supplies are delivered directly to the indi vidual user if direct delivery to the user is not desirable or possible supp lies will be delivered to designated location where they are distributed although this system ta kes much time and effort it permits centralized cont rol over sponsorprovided supplies and may be the preferred method e11 fm 305201 e12 delivery means e56 the preferred mission delivery thod is by sponsor aircraft surface ship or submarine at first aerial delivery by parachute may be the best means of supply to jsoa freedrop techniques may be used for certain hardy items later as the jsoa expands and comes under g reater friendly control sfod members use airlanded supply missions supply personnel normally use surface ships or submarines when jsoas are next to waterways or seas resupply operatio ns require secrecy to protect the resupply platform and the reception element these operations are n ormally conducted during limited visibility packaging e57 the sfob or fob sptcen personnel prepare supplies and equipment for delivery to jsoa the size of the package and the number of packages to be transported determines the delivery means the p ackaging system is based on manportable pack ages weighing about 50 pounds with this weight limitation members of the reception committee transportation party can easily move the packages from the supply point to safe sites manportable packages are equipped with carrying straps an d are mounted on packboards the transportation party color codes the packag so personnel can easily identify their contents upon arrival th sfob or fob sptcen personnel ensure each package is waterproofed to permit aboveground and limited underground or underwater cache packed with instructions in indige nous language for all equipment marked with prearranged code to identify the contents packed with an inventory list to aid in identifying lost or damaged material packed to protect sensitive communications and medical items by using clothing blankets or other padding e58 the sfob or fob sptcen personnel may put combat and moral supply items in the same container they package ammuniti on and cleaning equipment with weapons and batteries with flashlights additional small arms ammunition by caliber may be in cluded as an individual package supply procedures e59 sfod members use catalog supply system code to speed up oncall resupply requests and ensure accurate equipment id and supply items the system also reduces radio transmissi on time to permit maximum user flexibility the system identifies single major equipment items or several associated items by code words pers onnel catalog these items by class of supplies and group them in individual packaged items or s everal associated unit items packed together the catalog supply system is not secured by itself but reduces message length and transmission time when variety of supplies are requested based on mission requirements conplans and sop prepared under the staff supervision of the group s4 reproduced in miniature form for operational missions and publi shed in the soi by the sf group signal officer appendix f infiltration an sf pilot team may infiltrate into the jsoa before the sfod the preferred method is for resistance reception committee to receive the pilot team blind infiltrations may be considered based on m etttc the number and type of pilot team perso nnel will be very dependent on the metttc factors the pilot team may establish contact with th area command element assess resistance potential and perform other missions as specified by higher hq based on these factors an sfod may be infiltrated later into the jsoa to conduct uw or other so the pilot team may exfiltrate on order according to the opord or at th discretion of the team leader pilot team members may exfiltrate anytime before the sfods scheduled infiltrati on or they may remain in the jsoa as the reception committee for pl anned sfod infiltration they could also remain and act as an aob for the infiltration of two or m ore sfods arrival site f1 at the infiltration site sfod members must put the sterilization plan into effect and ensure the site is clean and secure the re sistance may execute deception plans if required f2 after infiltration all personnel must know the assemb ly and contact plans the assembly area

infiltration strongly defended and patrolled coastline may eliminate infiltration by wate r and the enemys air detection and defense systems may reduce air insertion poten tial metttc is always an influencing factor f7 sfods must consider geographic formations when selecting the infiltration method terrain affects th selection of an aircrafts altitude approach and exit routes landing areas or parachute opera tions for any mission aircraft mountains could force aircraft to fly higher than desired altitudes resulting in early aircra ft acquisition by enemy radar and increasing its vulnerability f8 seasonal weather conditions also affect infiltrations fa ctors to consider include temperature precipitation visibility clouds nd wind high altitude or surface winds and their effects on surf conditions or periods of reduced visibility may prohibit the use of parachutes inflatable boats or surface and subsurface swimming as entry or recovery techniques these s ame conditions generally favor land infiltration the adverse weather aerial delivery system awads reduces the impact of adverse weather as li miting factor on air infiltrations hydrography is the science of describi ng the sea and marginal land areas and the effect on water operations the hydrographic conditions on the farshore and the nearshore sea approach influence water infiltration these conditions include the offshore water d epth beach gradients tide surf currents sea bottom and the location of reefs sandbars seaweed or natural and manmade obstacles f9 other considerations for uw infiltrations include light data periods of twilight beginning morning nautical twilight bmnt early evening nautical twilight eent nautical sun rise sunset moon phase moonrise and moonset the distance to the contact site

to infiltrate into the jsoaair land or water combination of the three may also be us ed matrix can be used to determine the type and infiltration method best suited for the mission air infiltration f11 commanders often consider using air infiltration by army special operations aviation arsoa parachute operations are one of the most rapid infiltration methods used by the sfods it provides s exposure and risk to f3 fm 305201 the aircraft usually standard troop ca rrier fixedwing aircraft are well equipped and satisfy airdrop requirements some circumst ances may require nonstandard aircraft these situations may require an aircraft capable of parachute delivery of equipment and personnel from high altitudes using mff parachute techniques other techniques include stat icline operations on small unsurveyed dzs or hazardous treecovered terrain assault aircraft and amphibious or utility aircraft may be available duri ng infiltration certain conditions may require that these aircraft conduct airlanding operations on relatively short unprepared airstrips und er other circumstances longerrange tactical aircraft may be used fm 305210 currently tc 3124 special forces air operations and fm 305211 currently fm 3119 special forces military freefall operations provide detailed planning information on air infiltration land infiltration f12 during land infiltration the sfod should move fr om the launch site clandestinely to an assembly area short of the jsoa border nd establish local security in this scenario the sfod will move to th assembly area conduct reconnaissance of the crossover point and conduct t he infiltration preferably during periods of low visibility the assembly area should provide cover concealment and security th reception committee through prior coordination may meet the sfod at the assembly area to duct final coordination it must establish liaison from higher hq before hand in the event friendly forces occupy the border area the liaison ement should remain near the crossover point until the sfob or fob has received the initial entry report water infiltration f13 waterborne operations provide an expanded capability for all sfods through premission analysis detailed planning and it sustainment training program the sfod can deploy for successful water borne infiltration thorough understanding of all factors aff ecting

sfob or fob sends an acknowledgement back to the deployed sfod if the sfod f ails to receive the acknowledgment with the primary communication asset t acsat radio sfod personnel should use hf radio equipment as an alternat means of communicating upon receipt of the messa ge the sfob will send the sfods acknowledgment at the next scheduled callup using the alt ernate hf radio equipment f16 the sfod should send the ier angus within 24 ho urs after its infiltration time if the sfob or fob does not receive t he ier within 72 hours after infiltration another 72 hours will pass before the emergency resupply is dropped this procedure gives the sfod the necess ary flexibility to carry out conplans precipitated by enemy action if po ssible it will attempt to contact the sfob this flexibility gives the us af the necessary planning and reaction time another option may be to ve preplanned recovery operation on alert for pr edesignated recovery site for any survivors launch and

force during uw operations in the jsoa before th sfods infiltration and contact by the secretary of defense or dod agenci with the governmentinexile or area command the sfob or fob can guide the establishment of pa scales rank structure codes and lega l systems this guidance will ensure uniformity in all aos throughout the country and will preclude inflated rank structures unrealistic pay scal and kangaroo courts necessary forms to support this administrati ve machinery may be drafted and printed during the sfod isolation phase final decisions on t he administrative organization must be delayed until after infiltration by then the area commander in concert with the sfod will have resolved the majority of outstanding issues planning considerations i1 administrative systems can be est ablished early in the planning stages of deployment and finalized in the jsoa they should be simple and effective and as minimum include accountability of sensitive items to include weapons radios crypto graphic material and drugs accurate and updated personnel file s on the guerrillas fingerprints and photos can be used for id id cards can serve as pay receipt records of the sick wounded and deceased records of awards decorations schools and special skills daily staff journal written opords and reports will be kep t to minimum coded for security and issued on needtoknow basis records i2 each guerrilla base camp must have an administrati ve section to maintain essential records as the area complex develops personnel can centralize administration and duplicat information and records that could compromise the operation these records should be forwarded to the administrative section of the ar ea command for miniaturization classification and disposition i3 because of its ultimate historical importance personnel s hould maintain an operational journal reports of combat engagements must include the following information concerning the guerrilla forceth designation and commander the type of action approximate str ength and i1 fm 305201 casualties this data should be made available to psyop and ca personnel for their operations i4 the command structure record should reflect the designation of the various units within the guerrilla force similar to an mtoe and the auxiliary it should also include the na mes and designation of key personnel i5 the personnel dossier should list members of the various org anizations within the area command and it must be kept current in the initial stages of individual unit development duplicate copies of their dossier can be sent forward to the nexthigher command when feasible i6 personnel records should be ma intained on guerrillas and other key personnel in the resistance movement to prove or refute posthostility claims for wartime service opposition may be expected when someone recommen ds to the area commander that all personne l be photographed and fingerprinted such opposition can be ov ercome however with ssurances that viable secure system can be established and that the records will b exfiltrated from the jsoa and maintained at the sfob or fob records may be m icrofilmed and placed in secure cache in the jsoa as an alternate m eans to exfiltration photographing these documents and subsequently caching or exfiltrating the negatives provides method of preserving and securing records not obtainable by other means the sfod will find its organic photographic equipment useful in making id photographs for pop ulation control photographs are also helpful in organizing and controlling resistance forces personnel should take photogra phs at frequent intervals to send forward and avoid having lot of sensitive material on hand after processing the negatives and determin ing their acceptability personnel may destroy the originals of unit records or send them to higher hq i7 the information placed on personnel records should include t he full name of the individual and his home village or city the date he joined the resistance force whether an oath of enlistment was taken the date he was discharged promotions and demotions acts of bravery awards and decorations rank or position attained in the resistance force any disciplinary action taken against him i8 posting to the initial records may be by serial number thus there is reference to individuals by name and incriminating data to associate them with the resistance organization code names and simulated records should be maintained to prevent any possibility of compromise if captu red oath of enlistment i9 resistance leaders must be convin ced of the need for formal oath of loyalty to the resistance movement this formality will solid ify the union of i2 fm 305201 us and indigenous troops to common goal the freedom of their country at an appropriate ceremony the local indigenous leader may administer an oath of enlistment to each new member of the resistance force after hostilities the local government can then recognize the jurisdictional authority commanded by guerrilla leaders over individual gu errillas i10 personnel must sign the oath it will become part of t he individual personnel record it should be secured ccordingly ideally the oath refers to the guerrilla code and to punishment for violations other documents i11 casualty records include the names of personnel killed wounded missing in action or separated from the guerrilla force becaus of illness or for other reasons grave registration information at minimum should include name date cause of death and location of the remains as accurately plotted as possible i12 medical records must include data on the type of prevalen t diseases preventive medicine actions taken ty pes of wounds and general information on the organization of the medical structure for the area command i13 the administrative section must maintain appropriate payroll records to support any commitment made to mbers of the resistance force for services rendered the area command should maintain sufficient records to help settle claims after hostilities awards and decorations i14 guerrillas should formalize an d establish valorous actions and meritorious acts and service within th force sometimes us awards may be recommended however the group s1 is responsible for guidance in this area he can provide such guidance in the isolation phase governmentin exile or the area command may wish to act as the final approving authority and can provide general guidelines for the establishment of an awards and decorations program once the s1 approves an award or decorati on it is awarded at an appropriate ceremony co nsistent with security regulations discipline i15 strict discipline is an integral pa rt of c2 procedures instigated over any paramilitary force without discipline the force cannot s urvive let alone carry out effective operations against the enemy since guerrillas are usually not in similar uniforms and often appear dirty or bedraggled an impression persists that discipline is loose in guerrilla units discipline must be hard but fair in guerrilla units orders should be executed without delay or question minor infractions of orders especially during the conduct of oper ations may have broad negative consequences fo r guerrillas and supporting resistance elements i16 more often than not guerrilla force will have code possibly not in writing but certainly an understanding of what is expected of all guerrillas the resistance leader with assistance from the sfod can develop written code each new recruit must know and understand its provis ions and the i3 fm 305201 i4 penalties for treason desertion and reliction of duty codes for guerrilla forces are usually simple but call for ex treme punishment for what would be called minor infractions in conventional forces i17 any legal code for guerrilla forces should if possible be in line with the one that existed for the regular military forces of that count ry if this code is impractical the area command er and his staff may draft new code i18 provisions must exist for punishments similar to those imposed under article 15 uniform code of military justice and for more sever punishments the area commander will be advised to establish courtmartial or tribunal to try cases rather than arbitr arily decide the fate of the alleged perpetrator i19 as soon as possible after inf iltration all parties must reach an understanding concerning the exercise of disciplinary and judicial authority over the sfod the sf commander w ill not give up his disciplinary or judicial authority to the area commander or to any other resistance official unless directed by us higher hq i20 with decentralization of command and widely dispersed operations individuals are habitually given missi on orders with little guidance or supervision they are expected to co mplete their missions excuses are accepted therefore guerrillas must understand that their pers onal conduct has to be above reproach when inte racting with the civilian population every act that loses civilian supporters is harmful to the resistance movement psyop forces impress on the resistance organizations leaders that producing favorable reactions among the populace is vita l such programs must stress proper individu and official conduct toward the populace they must also point out the need for stringent disci plinary action against offenders i21 the area commander ensures discipline is maintained t he sf commander normally provides advice th at will ensure fair and consistent discipline the ethnic culture of group may indicate the m ost effective way to encourage selfdiscipline appendix j example of training program of instruction for resistance forces section i example of master

equipment or materials in secure storage place with the view to future recovery for operational use the ultimate success of caching may well depe nd upon attention to detail that is professional competence that may seem of minor importance to t he untrained eye security factors such as cover for the cachin g party sterility of the items cached and remova l of even the slightest trace of the caching operations are vital highly important too are the technical factors that govern the preservation of the items in usable condi tion and the recording of data essential for recovery successful caching entails careful adherence to the basic principles of clandestine operati ons as well as familiarity with the technicalities of caching caching considerations k1 caching considerations that are vital to the succes s of the caching operation may be done in variety of operational situation s figure k1 page k2 for example cached supplies can meet the emerg ency needs of personnel who may be barred from thei r normal supply sources by sudden developments or who may need travel documents and extra funds for quick escape caching can help solve the supply problems of lon gterm operations conducted far from secure base cach ing can also provide for anticipated needs of wartime operations in areas likely to be overrun by the enemy planning for cac hing operation k2 caching involves selecting items to be cached procuring those items and selecting cache site selection of th items to be cached requires close estimate of what will be needed by pa rticular units for particular operations procurement of the items usually presen ts special problems in fact the relative ease of procurement before an emergency arises is one f the prime considerations in favor of caching when selecting cache site planners should always ensure that the site is accessible not only for emplacement but also for recovery when planning caching operation the plan ner must consider the following six basic factors purpose and contents of the cache k3 planners must determine the purpose and contents of eac h cache because these basic factors influence the location of the cache as well as the method of hiding for instance sma ll barter items can be cached at any accessible and secure site because they can be concealed easily on the person once recovered however it would be di fficult to conceal rifles for guerrilla band once recovered therefore this site must be in an i solated area where k1 fm 305201 the band can establish at least tempor ary control certain items such as medical stock have limited shelf life and require rotation periodically or special storage considerations necessitating easy access t service these items sometimes it is impossible to locate cache in the most convenient place for an intended user planners must compromise be tween logistical objectives and actual possibilities when selecting cac he site security is always the overriding consideration figure k1 logistics cell anticipated enemy action k4 in planning the caching operation planners must sider the capabilities of any intelligence or security services not participating in the operation they should also consider the potential hazards the enemy and its witting or unwitting accomplices present if caching is done for wartime operational purposes its ultimate success will depend l argely on whether the planners anticipate the various obstacles to recovery wh ich the enemy and its accomplices will create if the enemy occupies the area what are the possibilities that the enemy will preempt an ideal sit for one reason or another and deny access to it vacant field surrounded by brush may seem ideal for particular cache because it is near several highways but such location may also invite the enemy to locate an ordnance pot where the cache is buried k2 fm 305201 activities of the local population k5 probably more dangerous than deliberate enemy action re all of the chance circumstances that may result in the discovery of the cache normal activity such as construction of new building may u ncover the cache site or impede access to it unlucky circumstanc cannot be anticipated but it can probably be avoided by careful and imag inative observation of the prospective cache site and of the people who live near the site if the cac he is intended for wartime use the planners must project how the residents will react to the pressures of war and conquest for example one of the mor likely reactions is that many residents ma resort to caching to avoid having their personal funds and valuables seized by the enemy if caching becomes popular any likely cache site will receive more than normal attention intended actions by allied forces k6 using one cache site for several clandestine operati ons involves risk of mutual compromise therefore some planners should rule out otherwise suitable caching sites if they have been selected for other clandestine purposes such as drops or safe houses site should not be located where it may be destroyed or rendered inaccessible by bombing or oth er allied military action should the area be occupied by the enemy for exampl installations likely to be objects of special protective efforts by the occu pying enemy are certain to be inaccessible to the ordina ry citizen therefore if the cache is intended for wartime use the caching party should avoid reas such as those near key bridges railroad intersec tions power plants and munitions factories packaging and transportation k7 asset planners should assess the curity needs and all of the potential obstacles and hazards that prospective cache site can present they should also consider whether the operational assets could be used for pa ckaging and transporting the package to the site best results are obta ined when experts at packaging center do the packaging the first questi on therefore is to decide whether the package can be transported from the hq or th field packaging center to the cache site securely and soon enoug h to meet the operational schedules if not the packag ing must be done locally perhaps in safe house located within few miles of the cache site if such an arrangement is necessary the choice of cache sites may be restricted by limited safe house possibilities personnel assets k8 all who participate directly in emplacement will know where the cache is located therefore only the fewest possible and the most re liable persons should be used planners must consider the distance from th persons residence to the prospective cache site consideration mus t be given to the reason or story of why someone is involved in conducting thi s activity sometimes transportation and cover diffic ulties require the cache site to be within limited distance of the persons residence the abov considerations also apply to the recovery personnel k3 fm 305201 caching methods k9 which cache method to use depends on the situation it is therefore unsound to lay down any general rules with one exception planners should always think in terms of suitability for example the method most suitable for each cache considering its specific purpose the actual situation in the particular locality and the changes that may occur if the enemy gains control concealment k10 concealment requires the use of permanent manmade or na tural features to hide or disguise the cache concealment has severa l advantages both employment and recovery can usua lly be done with minimum time and labor and cached items concealed inside building or d ry cave are protected from the elements thus they require less elaborate packagi ng also in some cases concealed cache can be readily inspected from to time to ensure that it is still usable however ther is always the chance of accidental discovery in addition to all the hazards of wartime th at may result in discovery or destruction of concealed cache or denial of ccess to the site the concealment method therefore is most suitable in cases where an exceptionally secure site is available or where need for quick access to the cache justifies calculated sacrifice in security concealment may range from securing small gold coins under tile in the floor to walling up artillery in caves burial k11 adequate burial sites can be found almost anywhere fig ures k2 and k3 page k5 once in place properly buried cache is ge nerally the best way of achieving lasting security in cont rast to concealment however burial in the ground is laborious and timeconsuming method of c aching the disadvantages of burial are that burial almost always requires highquality container or special wrapping to protect the cache from moisture chemicals an d bacteria in the soil emplacement or recovery of buried cache usually takes so long that the operation must be done after dark unless the site is ex ceptionally secluded it is especially difficult to identify and locate buri ed cache figures k2 and k3 k4 fm 305201 figure k2 cache locations figure k3 cache location adjacent to southwest corner of church on south side submersion k12 submersion sites that are suitable for secure concealmen t of submerged cache are few and far between also the container of submerged cache must meet such high standards for waterproofing and resistance to external pressure that the use of field expedients is sel dom workable to ensure that submerged cache remains dry and in place planners must determine not only the depth of the water but the type of bottom the k5 fm 305201 currents and other facts that are relati vely difficult for nonspecialists to obtain figures k4 and k5 figure k4 submersible cache example 1 figure k5 submersible cache example 2 emplacement k13 emplacement likewise requires high degree of skill at least two persons are needed for emplacement and it requires additional equipment in view of the difficultiesespecially the difficulty of recoverythe k6 fm 305201 submersion method is suitable only on rare occasions the most noteworthy usage is the relatively rare maritime resupply operation where it is impossible to deliver supplies directly to reception committee caching supplies offshore by submersion is often preferable to sen ding landing party ashore to bury cache selection of the site k14 the most careful estimates of future operational condit ions cannot ensure that cache will be accessible when it is needed the following paragraphs address site selection considerations criteria for selection k15 criteria for site selection can be met when the following three questions are answered 1 can the site be located by simple instructions that are unmistakably clear to someone who has never visite d the location site may be ideal in every respect but if it has dis tinct permanent landmarks within readily measurable distance it must be ruled out 2 are there at least two secure routes to and from the site both primary and alternate routes should provide natural concealment so tha t the emplacement party and the recovery party can visit the sit without being seen by anyone normally in the vicinity 3 can the cache be emplaced and recovered at the chosen site in all seasons of the year snow and frozen ground create special problems snow on the ground is haza rd because it is impossible to erase trail in the snow planners must sider whether seasonal changes in the foliage will leave the site and t he route dangerously exposed map survey k16 finding cache site is often difficult usually thorough systematic survey of the general area designated fo r the cache is required the survey is best done with largescale map of the area if available by scrutinizing the map the planners can determine whethe r particular sector must be ruled out because of its nearness to factorie s homes busy thoroughfares or probable military targets in wartime good militaryty pe map will show the positive features in the topography proximity to adequat roads or trails natural concealment for example surrounding woods or gro ves and adequate drainage map will also show the natural and manmade features in the landscape map will provide the indispensabl reference points for locating cache site confluences of streams dams and waterfalls road junctures and distance markers villag bridges churches and cemeteries personal reconnaissance k17 map survey should normally show the location of several promising sites within the general area designated for the cache to select and pinpoint the best site however wellqualified observer must exa mine each site firsthand if possible whoever examines the site should c arry adequate maps compass drawing pad or board for making sketch maps or tracings and metallic measuring line wire knotted at regular i ntervals is adequate for measuring twine or cloth measuring tapes should not be used because k7 fm 305201 stretching or shrinking wi ll make them inaccurate if they get wet the observer should also carry probe rod for probing prospe ctive burial sites if the rod can be carried securely k18 since the observer seldom completes field survey wit hout being noticed by local residents his story for his actions is of great importance the observers story must offer natural explanation for his exploratory activity in the area ordinarily this means that an observer who is not known resident of the area can pose as tourist or newcomer with some reason for visiting the area however his story must be developed over an extended period before he undertakes the actual reconnaissance i f the observer is known resident of the area he cannot suddenly take up hunt ing fishing or wildlife photography without arousing interest and perhaps suspicion the observer must build up reputation for being devotee of his sport or hobby reference points k19 when the observer finds suitable cache site he prepa res simple and unmistakable instructions for locating the reference points figure k6 page k9 these instructions must iden tify the general area the names of general recognizable places from the country down to the nearest village and an immediate reference point any durable landmark that is identified by its title or simple description can be an immediate reference point for example the only roman catholic church in certain vi llage or the only bridge on named road between two vi llages the instructions must also include final reference point frp which must meet the f ollowing four requirements the frp must be identifiable including at least one feature that ca n be used as precise reference point must be an object that will remain fixed as long as the cache may be used must be near enough to the cache to pinpoint the exact l ocation of the cache by precise linear measurements from the frp to the cac he should be related to the immediate reference point by simple route description which proceeds from th immediate reference point to the frp k20 since the route description should be reduced to the minimum essential the ideal solution for locating the cache is t combine the immediate reference point and the frp into one landmark rea dily identifiable but sufficiently secluded k21 the following objects when available are sometimes ideal reference points small unfrequented bridges and dams boundary markers kilometer markers and culverts along unfrequented roads geodetic survey marker battle monuments and wayside shrines k8 fm 305201 k22 when such reference points are not available at an othe rwise suitable cache site natural or manmade object s may serve as frps distinct rocks posts for power or telephone lines intersections in ston fences or hedgerows and gravestones in isolated cemeteries figure k6 reference points pinpointing techniques k23 recovery instructions must identify the exact location of the cache these instructions must describe the point where the cach is placed in terms that relate it to the frp when the concealment method is used the cache is ordinarily placed inside the frp pinpointed by precise description of the frp submerged cache is usually pinp ointed by describing exactly how the moorings are attached to the frp figure k7 page k10 with buried cache any of the following techniques may be used placing the cache directly beside the frp k24 the simplest method is to place the cache directly beside the frp then pinpointing is reduced to specifying the precise referenc point of the frp sighting the cache by projection k25 this method may be used if the frp has one flat s ide long enough to permit precise sighting by projecting line along the sid of the object the burial party places the cache measured distance along t he sighted line this method may also be used if two precise frps are avail able by projecting line sighted between the two objects in either case the ins tructions for finding the cache must state the approximate direction of the cache from the frp since small errors in sighting are magnified as the s ighted line is extended the cache should be placed as close to the frp s other factors k9 fm 305201 permit ordinarily this method becomes unreliable if t he sighted line is extended beyond 50 meters figure k7 pinpointing techniques placing the cache at the in tersection of measured lines k26 if two frps are available within several paces the ca che can be one line projected from each of the frps if this method is used the approximate direction of the cache from each frp must be stated to ensure acc uracy neither of the projected lines from the frps to the point of emp lacement should be more than twice as long as the base line between the two frps if this proportion is maintained the only limitation upon t he length of the projected lines is the length of the measuring line that the recovery party is k10 fm 305201 expected to carry the recovery party should carry two measu ring lines when this method is used sighting the cache by compass azimuth k27 if the above methods of sighting are not feasible on measured line may be projected by taking compass azimuth from the frp to the point where the cache is placed to avoid confusion an azimuth to cardinal point of the compass north east south or west is used since compass sightings are likely to be inaccurate cache that is pinpointed by this method should not be placed more than 10 meters from the frp measuring distances k28 the observer should express all measured distances in linear system that the recovery party is sure to understandordinarily the standard system for the country where the cache is located he shou ld use whole numbers 6 meters not 63 or 65 to keep his instructions as brief and as simple as possible to get an exact location for the c ache in whole numbers the observer should take sightings and measurements first k29 if the surface of the ground between the points to be meas ured is uneven the linear distance should be asured on direct line from point to point rather than by following the contour of the ground this method requires measuring line long enough to reach the full distance from point to point and strong enough to be pulled taut without breakin g marking techniques k30 the emplacement operation can be simplified and criti cal time saved if the point where the cache is to be buried is marked during the reconnaissance if night burial is planned the point of emplacement may have to be marked during daylight reconnaissance this method should be used whenever operational conditions pe rmit the marker must be an object that is easily recognizable but that is meaningless to an unwitting observer for example small rock or branch with its butt plac ed at the point selected for the emplacement may be used k31 since marking information is also essential to the recovery operation it must be compiled after emplacement and included in th final cache report therefore the observer should be thoroughly familiar with the twelvepoint cache report before he starts person reconnaissance this report is checklist for the observer to record as much information as possible points 6 through 11 are particularly importan t the personal reconnaissance also provides an excellent opportunity for preliminary estim ate of the time required for getting to the site alternate site k32 as general rule planners should select an alternate site in case unforeseen difficulties prevent use of the best site unless the primary site is i n c m p l t l d s r t d r t h r i s l w s s m d n g r t h t t h emplacement party will find it occupied as they approach or that the party will be observed as they near the site the alternate site sh ould be far enough k11 fm 305201 away to be screened from view from th primary site but near enough so that the party can reach it without making second trip concealment site k33 site that looks ideal for concealment may be re vealed to the enemy for that very reason such site may be equally attractive to native of an occupied country to hide his valuables the only real ke to the ideal concealment site is careful casing of the area combined wit h great familiarity with local residents and their customs the following is list of likely concealment sites walls hidden behind loose bricks or stones or plastered rface abandoned buildings infrequently used structures stadiums and other recreation facilities railroad facilities on spur lines memorial edifices mausoleums crypts monuments public buildings museums churches libraries ruins of historical interest culverts natural caves and caverns and abandoned mines and qu arries sewers cable conduits k34 the concealment site must be equally accessible to the person emplacing and the person recovering ho wever visits by both persons to certain interior sites may be incompatible with the story for instance site in house owned by relative of the emplacer may be unsuitable because there is adequate excuse for the recovery person to enter the house if he has connection with the owner k35 the site must remain accessible as long as the cache is needed if access to building depends upon personal relationsh ip with the owner the death of the owner or the sale of the property might render it ina ccessible k36 persons involved in the operation should not be compro mised if the cache is discovered on the site even if cache is completel sterile as every cache should be the mere fact that it has been placed in particular site may compromise certain persons if the police discovered the cache they might suspect the emplacer because it was found in his relativ house k37 the site must not be located where potentially hostile persons f r q u n t l v i s i t f r i n s t n c s i t i n m u s u m i s n t s c u r i f p l i c guards or curious visitors frequently enter the museum k38 to preserve the cache material the emplacer must sure the site is physically secure for the preservation of the cached materia l for example most buildings involve ri sk that the cache may be destroyed or damaged by fire especially in wartime the emplacer should consider l risks and weigh them against the advantages of an interior site k12 fm 305201 k39 custodian may serve to ease access to building or to guard cache however the use of such person is inadvisable as custodian poses an additional security risk he may use th contents of the cache for personal profit or reveal its location burial site k40 in selecting burial site consider the following factor s along with the basic considerations of itability and accessibility drainage k41 drainage considerations include the elevation of the site and the type f s i l t h i m p r t n c f g d d r i n g m k s s i t n h i g h g r u n d preferable unless other factors rule it out moisture is one f the greatest natural threats to the contents of cache swamp muck is the most difficult soil to work in if the site is near stream or river the emplacer should ensure that the cache is well above the allyearhighwat er mark so that the cache will not be uncovered if the soil is washed away ground cover k42 the types of vegetation at the site will influenc the choice roots of deciduous trees make digging very difficult coniferous t rees have less extensive root systems also the presence of coniferous trees usually means that the site is well drained does the vegetation show paths or other indications that the site is frequented too much for secure c aching can the ground cover be easily restored to it s normal appearance when burial is completed tall grass reveals that it has been trampled b ut an overlay of leaves and humus can be replaced easily and will effecti vely conceal freshly refilled hole natural concealment k43 the vegetation or the surrounding terrain should off er natural concealment for the burial and recovery parties working at th site planners should carefully consider seasonal variations in the f oliage types of soil k44 sandy loam is ideal because it is easy to dig and drains well clay soil should be avoided because it becomes quite sticky in we t weather and in dry weather it may become so hard that it is almost impossible to dig snowfall and freezing k45 if the cache must be buried or recovered in winter d ata on the normal snowfall the depth to which the ground freezes in winter and the usual dates of freezing and thawing will influence the choice of the site frozen ground impedes digging and requires additional time for bur ial and recovery snow on the ground is especially hazardous for the buria l operation it is practically impossible to restore the snow over the burial s ite to its normal appearance unless there is more snowfall or brisk wind also it is very k13 fm 305201 difficult to ensure that traces of the operation are ft after the snow has melted rocks and other subsurface obstructions k46 large obstructions that might prev ent use of particular site can be located to some extent before digging by probing with rod or stake at the exact spot selected for the cache submersion site k47 to be suitable for submerged cache body of water mu st have certain characteristics the presence of these characteristics can be determined only by thorough survey of the site their impo rtance will be understood after familiarization with the technicalities of submersion emplacement k48 submersion usually requires bo at first for reconnoitering then for emplacement thus the accessibility problems involved in submersion usually narrow down to the availability of boat and the story for using it if there is fishing or pleasure boating at the site the stor for this peculiar type boating may be real problem in tropical areas the course of streams or rivers is frequently changed by seasonal rainfall and can cause many problems planners should keep this fact in mind when choos ing the site and when selecting reference points recovery k49 since the method for recovering cache is genera lly similar to that for emplacing cache it need not be described in full however several important considerations should be stressed in training for recovery operation cache recovery k50 the following paragraphs disc uss considerations for recovery operations practical exercises k51 anyone who is expected to serve as recovery person should have the experience of actually recovering du mmy caches if fiel d exercises can be arranged securely it is especially desira ble for the recovery person to be able to master the pinpointing techniques mastery is best atta ined by practice in selecting points of emplacement and in drafting as w ell as in following instructions equipment k52 although the equipment used in recovery is gene rally the same as that used in emplacement it is important to include any additi onal items that may be required in recovery in the cache report pr obe rod may not be essential for emplacement but it is necessary to have some object roughly the k14 fm 305201 same size as the cache container to fi ll the cavity left in the ground by removal of buried cache some sort of container of wrapping material may be needed to conceal the recovered cach while it is being carried from the cache site to safe house recovery of submerged cac he may require grappling lines and hooks especially if it is heavy sketch of the site k53 if possible the observer should provide the recovery person with sketches of the cache site and the route to the cache site if the recovery person must rely exclusively on verbal instructions as in the case when communications are limited to radiotelephone rt messag he should draw sketch of the site before starting on the recove ry operation he should use all the data in the verbal instructio ns to make the sketch as realistic as possible drawing sketch will help to clarify any misunderstanding of the instructions also sketch can be followed more easily than verbal instructions it may also be helpful for the recovery p erson to draw sketch of the route from the immediate reference point to the site b ut he should not carry this sketch on him because if he were apprehended the sketch might direct the enemy to the cache preliminary re connaissance k54 checking the instructions for cating the cache may be advisable especially when the recovery operation must be performed under stringent enemy controls or when there is extra time for searchin g careful analysis of the best available map can minimize reconnoitering acti vity in the vicinity of the cache and thus reduce the danger of arousing suspicio n if recovery must be done at night the recovery person should find the cache by daylight and place an unnoticeable marker directly over it probe rod k55 the recovery person can avoid digging at the wrong spot by using probe rod before starting to dig he should push and turn the probe rod into the ground by hand so that it will not puncture the cach container the recovery person should never pound the probe rod with mmer k56 the recovery procedure is the same as for the burial except for the following two points first pick should never be used for digging the hole b ecause it might puncture the container and damage the cached items second it may be necessary to fill the hole with other objects in addition to soil after the cache is removed k57 sometimes it is possi ble to fill the hole with rocks sticks or other readily available objects at the site if such objects are found during the preliminary reconnaissance the recovery person should carry to the site an object roughly the same size as the cache container sterilization of the site k58 as with emplacement the recovery operation must be preformed in such way that traces of the operation are left alt hough sterilization is k15 fm 305201 not as important for recovery as for emplacement it should be done as thoroughly as time permits evidence that cache has b een recovered might alert the enemy to clandestine activity in the area and p rovoke countermeasures packaging k59 packaging usually involves packing the items to be cached as well as the additional processing in protecting these items from advers storage conditions proper packaging is important because inadequat packaging very likely will render the items unusable since special equipment and skilled technicians are needed for best results packaging sh ould be done at hq or field packaging center whenever possible however to familiarize operational personnel with the fundamentals of packaging so t hat they can improvise field expedients for emergency use this section di scusses determining factors steps in packaging wrapping materials and criteria for the container determining factors k60 the first rule of packaging is that all processing is tailored to fit the specific requirements of each cache the method of packaging as well as the size shape and weight of the package is determined by th items to be cached by the method of caching and especially by the way the cache is recovered and used for instance if ci rcumstances require one man to recover the cache by himself the container should be larger than small suitcase and the total weight of the container and contents more than 30 pounds of course these limits must be exceed ed with some equipment but the need for larger packages should be weighed against the difficult ies and risks in handling them even if more than one person is availabl for recovery the material should be divided whenever possi ble into separate packages of size and weight readily portable by one man k61 another very important factor in packaging concerns adverse storage conditions any or all of the following conditions may be present moisture external pressure freezing temperat ures and the bacteria and corrosive chemicals found in some so il and water animal life may present hazard insects and rodents may attack the package if the cache is concealed in an exterior site larger animals also may threaten it whether the packaging is adequate usually depends upon how carefully the conditions at the site were analyzed in designing the cache thus the method of caching b urial concealment or submersion should be determined before the pa ckaging is done k62 it is equally important to consider how long th cache is to be used since one seldom knows when cache will be needed sound rule is to design the packaging to withstand adverse storage conditio ns for at least as long as the normal shelf life of the contents to be cached k16 fm 305201 steps in packaging k63 the exact procedure for packaging depends upon the spec ific requirements for the cache and upon the packaging equipment vailable the following eight steps are almost always necessary in packaging inspecting k64 the items to be cached must be inspected immediately befor packaging to ensure they are complete in serviceable c ondition and free of all corrosive or contaminated substances cleaning k65 all corrodible items must be cleaned thoroughly imm ediately before the final preservative coating is applied all foreign m atter including any preservative applied before the item was shipped to the field should be removed completely throughout the packaging operation all contents of the cache should be handled with rubber or freshly cleaned cotton gloves special handling is important because even minute particles of huma n sweat will corrode metallic equipment also any fingerprints on the c ontents of the cache may enable the enemy to identify those who did the packag ing drying k66 when cleaning is completed every trace of moisture mus t be removed from all corrodible items methods of drying include wipi ng with highly absorbent cloth heating or applying desiccant usually heating is best unless the item can be damaged by heat to dry by heatin g the item to be cached should be placed in an oven for at least 3 hours at temperature of about 110 degrees fahrenheit f an ov can be improvised from large metal can or drum in humid climates it is especially important to dry the oven thoroughly before using it by preheating it to at least 2 12 degrees f then the equipment to be cached is inserted as soon as t he oven cools down to about 110 degrees f if desiccant is used it should not touch any metallic surface silica gel is satisfactory desiccant and it is commonly available coating with preservative k67 light coat of oil may be applied to weapons tools and other items with unpainted metallic surfaces coat of paint may suffice for other metal items wrapping k68 when drying and coating are completed the items to be c ached are wrapped in suitable material the wrapping should be as nearly waterproof as possible each item should be wrapped separately so tha t one perforation in the wrapping will not expose all items in the cache the wrapping should fit tightly to each item to eliminate air pockets and all folds should be sealed with waterproof substance k17 fm 305201 packing k69 the following rules must be observed when packing items i n the container all moisture must be removed from the interior of the tainer by heating or applying desiccant nglasting desiccant should be packed inside the container to absorb any residual moisture if silica gel is used the required amount can be calculated by using the ratio of 15 kilograms of silica gel to 1 cubic meter of storage spa ce within the container this figure is based on two assumptions the container is completely moisture proof and the contents are slightly mois t when inserted therefore the ratio allows an ample margin for in complete drying and can be reduced if the dryi ng process is known to be highly effective air pockets should be eliminated as much as possible by tight packing thoroughly dried padding should be used liberally to fill air pockets and to protect the contents from shock clothing and other items which will be useful to the recovery party should be used for padding if possible items made of different metals should never t ouch since continued contact may cause corros ion through electrolytic action enclosing instructions for using cached equipment k70 written instructions and diagrams should be in cluded if they facilitate assembly or use of the cached items instructions must be written in language that recovery personnel can understand the wording should be as simple as possible and unmistakably clear diagrams shou ld be selfexplanatory since the eventual user may not be able t comprehend written instructions because of language barriers sealing and testing seals by submersion k71 when packing is completed the lid of the tainer must be sealed to make it watertight testing can be done by entirely submer ging the container in water and watching for escaping air bubbles hot water should be used if possible because hot water will bring out leaks that woul d not be revealed by coldwater test wrapping materials k72 the most important requirement for wrapping material i s that it be moistureproof also it should be selfsealing or adhesive t sealing material it should be pliable enough to fit closely with tight folds and it should be tough enough to resist tearing and puncturing pliability and toughness may be combined by using two wrappings an inn er one that is thin and pliable and an outer one of heavier material tough outer wrapping is essential unless the container and the padd ing are adequate to prevent items from scraping together inside the cache fiv wrapping materials are recommended for field expedient use because th ey often can be obtained locally and used effectively by unskilled person nel k18 fm 305201 aluminum foil for use as an inner wrapping k73 aluminum foil is the best of the widely available mat erials it is moistureproof as long as it does not become perforated nd provided the folds are adequately sealed the drawbacks to its use for cachi ng are that the thin foils perforate easily while the heavy ones over 2 mil limeters thick tend to admit moisture through the fold s the heavyduty grade of aluminum foil generally sold for kitchen use is adequate when used with an outer wrapping scrimbacked foil which is heatsealable is widely used commercially to package articles for sh ipment or storage portable heat sealers that are easy to use are availa ble commercially or sealing can be done with standard household iron moistureresistant papers k74 several brands of commercial wrapping papers are resis tant to water and grease they do not provide lasting protection agains t moisture when used alone but they are effective as an inner wrapping to prevent rubber wax and similar substances from sticking to the items in the cache rubber repair gum k75 this is selfsealing compound generally used for r epairing tires it makes an excellent outer wrapping standard commercial bra nds come in several thicknesses 2 millimeters is the most satisfacto ry for caching watertight seal is produced easily by placing two rubb er surfaces together and applying pressure manually the seal should be at lea st 12 inch wide since rubber repair gum has tendency to adhere to items n inner wrapping of nonadhesive material must be used with it an d the backing should be left on the rubber material to keep it from st icking to other items in the cache grade c barrier material k76 this is cloth impregnated with microcrystalline w ax that is used extensively when packing for storage of items for overseas shipment thus it is generally available and it has the additional adv antage of being self sealing although it is not as effective as rubber rep air gum it may be used as an outer wrapping over aluminum foil to prevent perforati on of the foil used without an inner wrapping three layers of grade c ba rrier material may keep the contents dry for as long as three months but it is highly vulnerable to insects and rodents so the wax wrapping has low melting point and will adhere to many items so it should not be u sed without an inner wrapping except in emergencies wax coating k77 if wrapping material is available an outer coating of microcrystalline wax paraffin or si milar waxy substance can be used to protect the contents against moistu re wax coating will not provide protection against insects and rodents the package should be hotdipped in the waxy substance or the wax can be heated to molten for m and applied with brush k19 fm 305201 container criteria k78 the outer container serves to protect the contents from shock moisture and other natural hazards to which the cache may be exposed the ideal container should be as follows completely watertight and airtight after sealing noiseless when handled its handles should not rattle again st the body of the container resistant to shock and abrasion able to withstand crushing pressure lightweight in construction able to withstand rodents insects and bacteria equipped with sealing device that can be closed and reop ened easily and repeatedly capable of withstanding highly acidic or alkaline soil or water standard stainless steel container k79 the standard stainless steel cont ainer comes in several sizes since the stainless steel container is more satisfactory than any that could be improvised in the field it should be used whenever possible ideally it should be packed at hq or at field packaging center if the items t be cached must be obtained locally it is still advisable to use the sta inless steel container because its high resistance to moisture eliminates the ne ed for an outer wrapping packers should however use single wrappin g even with the stainless steel container to protect the contents from any r esidual moisture that may be present in the container when it is sealed fieldexpedient container k80 the ideal container cannot be improvised in the field but the standard military and commercial containers discussed below can meet caching requirements if they are adapted with care and resourcefulness first container must be sufficiently sturdy to remain unpunctur ed and retain its shape through whatever rough handling or crushing pressur it may encounter even slight warping may cause joint around the lid to leak second if the lid is not already watertight and airtight packers can make it so by improvising sealing device the most common ty pe of sealing device includes rubbercomposition gasket or lining and sharp flat metal rim that is pressed against threaded lid applying heavy grease to the threads can increase its effectiveness metallic solder should not be used for sealing because it corrodes metal surfaces when exposed to moisture whenever any nonstainless metal container is used it is important to apply several coats of highquality paint to all exterior surfaces instrument containers k81 ordinarily aircraft and other precision instrumen ts are shipped in steel containers with waterproof sealing device the stan dard instrument containers range from 12gallon to 10gallon sizes if one of suitable size can be found only minimum modifications may be needed in the most common k20 fm 305201 type of instrument container the only weak point is the nu t and bolt that tighten the locking band around the lid these should be replaced with stainless steel nut and bolt ammunition boxes k82 several types and si zes of steel ammunition boxes that have rubber gasket closing device are satisfactory for buried caches an advantage of using ammunition boxes as cache container is that they are usually available at military depot steel drums k83 caching container of suitable size may be found among the commercially used steel drums for shipping oil grease nails soap and other products the most common types however lack an adequ ate sealing device so waterproof material should be used around the lid f ully removable head drums with lockring closures gene rally give satisfactory seal glass jars k84 the advantage of using glass is that it is waterpro of and does not allow chemicals bacteria and insects to pass throug h it although glass is highly vulnerable to shock glass jars of sturdy qualit can withstand the crushing pressure normally encountered in caching however none of the available glass containers have an ad equate sealing device for the joint around the lid the standard commercial canning jar with spring clamp and rubber washer is watertight but the metal clamp is v ulnerable to corrosion therefore glass jar with spring clamp and rubber washer is an adequate expedient for shortterm caching of small items b ut it should not be relied upon to resist moisture for more than year paint cans k85 standard cans with reusable li ds require waterproof adhesive around the lids it is especially import ant to apply several coats of paint to the exterior of standard commercial cans because the metal in these cans is not as heavy as that in metal drums even when the exte rior is thoroughly painted paint cans will not resist moisture for more than few months methods of emplacement k86 since burial is the most frequently used method of emplacement this section describes fi rst the complete procedure for burial followed by discussion of emplacement procedures peculiar to submersion nd concealment the last area discussed is the preparation of the cache report vital part of caching operation burial k87 when planners have designed cache and selected t he items for caching they must carefully work out every step of the bu rial operation in advance k21 fm 305201 horizontal and vertical caches k88 ordinarily the hole for buried cache is vertical the hole is dug straight down from the surface someti mes horizontal cache with the hole dug into the side of steep hill or ba nk provides workable solution when suitable site on level or slightly sloping ground is not available horizontal cache may provide better drainage in areas of heavy ra infall but is more likely to be exposed by soil erosion and more difficult t refill and restore to normal appearance figure k8 figure k8 burial procedures for horizontal and vertical caches dimensions of the hole k89 the exact dimensions of the hole either vertical or horizontal depend on the size and shape of the cache co ntainer as general rule the hole should be large enough for the container to be inserted eas ily the horizontal dimensions of the hole should be abou t 30 centimeters longer and wider than the container most importantly it should be deep enough to permit covering the container with soil to about 45 cent imeters this figure is recommended for normal usage because more shallow burial risk s exposure of the cache through soil erosion or inadvertent unco vering by normal indigenous activity k22 fm 305201 deeper hole makes probing for recove ry more difficult and unnecessarily prolongs the time required for burial and recovery excavation shoring k90 if there is risk that the surrounding soil will cave in during excavation boards or bags filled with subsoil may be use d to shore the sides of the hole permanent shoring may be needed to protect an improvised container from pressure or shock equipment k91 the following items of equipment may be helpful or indispensable in burying cache depending upon the conditions at the site measuring instruments wire or metal tape and compass for pinpointing the site paper and pencil for recording the measurements probe rod for locating rocks larg roots or other obstacles in the subsoil two ground sheets on which to place sod and loose soil an article of clothing may be used for small excavation if nothing else is available sacks sandbags flour sacks tr ash bags for holding subsoil spade or pickax if the ground is too hard for spading hatchet for cutting roots crowbar for prying rocks flashlight or lamp if burial is to be done at night burial party k92 aside from locating digging and refilling the ho the most important factor in this part of the emplacement operation may be express ed with one word personnel since it is almost impossible to prevent every member of the burial party from knowing the location of the cache eac h member is prime security problem as long as the cach remains intact thus planners must keep the burial party as small as possible and select each member with utmost care once selected each memb r m u s t h v n d q u t s t r t explain his absence from home or work during the operation his trip to and from the site and his possession of whatever equipment cannot be concealed on the way transportation for the burial party may be problem depending on the number of persons how far they must go and what equi pment they must take when planners have worked out all details of the operation they must brief each member of the burial party on exact ly what he is to do from start to finish operational schedule k93 the final step in planning the emplacement operation is to make schedule to set the date time and place for every step f the operation that requires advance coordination the schedule will depend mai nly on the k23 fm 305201 circumstances but to be practical it mu st include realistic estimate of how long it will take to complete the buri here generalizations are worthless and the only sure guide is actual experience under similar conditions planners should consider the follo wing with respect to scheduling k94 careful burial job probably will take longer than most novices will expect therefore if circumstances require tight schedu dry run or test exercise before taking the package to the site may be dvisable unless the site is exceptionally well concealed or isolated night bu rial will be required to avoid detection because of the difficulties of working in t he dark nighttime practice exercise is especially advisable k95 the schedule should permit waiting for advantageous w eather conditions the difficulties of snow have already been mentioned rainy weather increases the problems of digging and complicates the story if the b u r i l i s t b d n t n i g h t m n l s s r h v v r c s t n i g h t i s desirable site approach k96 regardless of how effective the indi viduals story is during the trip to the cache site the immediate approach must be completely unobserved to avoid detection of the burial to reduce the risk of th party being observed planners must carefully select the point where the burial par ty disappears perhaps by turning off road into woods they should just as carefully select the reappearance point in addition the return trip sh ould be by different route the burial party should stri ctly observe the rule for concealed movement the party should proceed ca utiously and silently along route that makes the best use of natural concealment concealed mo vement requires foresight with special attention to using nat ural concealment while reconnoitering the route and to preventing rattles when pr eparing the package and contents security measures at the site k97 the burial party must maintain maximum vigilance at the cache site since detection can be disastrous the time spent at the sit is the most critical at least one lookout should be on guard cons tantly if one man must do the burial by himself he should pause frequently to look and listen the burial party should use flashlights or lanterns as littl as possible and should take special care to mask the glare planning should include emergency actions in case the burial party is interrupted the party should be so thoroughly briefed that it will respond instantly to ny sign of danger planners should also consider the various escape routes and whether the party will attempt to retain the package or conceal it ong the escape route steps in digging and refilling k98 although procedures will vary slig htly with the design of the cache persons involved in caching operations must never overlook certa in basic steps the whole procedure is designed to restore the site to normal as far as possible k24 fm 305201 site sterilization k99 when the hole is refilled special effort should be made to ensure that the site is left sterile and restored to normal in ever way with clues left to indicate burial or the burial partys visit to the vicinity since sterilization is most important for the security of the op eration the schedule should allow ample time to complete these final steps in an unhurried thorough manner these final steps are to dispose of any excess soil far enough away from the site t avoid attracting attention to the site flus hing the excess soil into stream is the ideal solution check all tools and equipment against checklist to ensu re that nothing is left behind this checklist should include all personnel items that may drop from pockets to keep this risk to m inimum members of the burial party should carry nothing on their p ersons except the essentials for doing the job and disguising t heir actions make final inspection of the site for any traces of th burial because this step is more difficult on dark night use of carefully prepared checklist is essential with night burial returning t the site in the daytime to inspect it for telltale evidence may be advi sable if this can be done safely submersion k100 emplacing submerged cache always involves two basic steps weighting the container to keep it from floating to the s urface and mooring it to keep it in place k101 ordinarily container weights rest on the bottom of the lake or river and function as anchors and the moorings connect the anch ors to the container the moorings must also serve second function which is to provide handle for pulling the cache to the surface when it is recovered if the moorings are not accessible for recovery another line mus t extend from the cache to fixed accessible object in the water or on shore there are four types of moorings spider web mooring k102 the container is attached to veral mooring cables that radiate to anchors placed around it to form web the container must b buoyant so that it lifts the cables far enough off the bottom to be read ily secured by grappling the site must be located exactly at the time of emp lacement by visual sightings to fixed landmarks in the water or along the shore using several frps to establish point where two sighted lines in tersect for recovery the site is locate d by taking sightings on the reference points when mooring cable is engaged by dragging the bottom while di ving this method of mooring is most difficult for recovery it can be used only where the bottom is smooth and firm enough for dragging or where the water is not too deep cold or murky for diving k25 fm 305201 linetoshore mooring k103 line is run from the weighted container to an im movable object along the shore the section of the line that extends from th shore to the container must be buried in the ground or otherwise well c oncealed buoy mooring k104 line is run from the weighted container to bu oy or other fixed floating marker and fastened well below the waterline thi s method is secure only as long as the buoy is left in place buoys are genera lly inspected and repainted every six months or so th inspection schedule should be determined before buoy is used structural mooring k105 line for retrieving the weighted container is r to bridge pier or other solid structure in the water this line must be fast ened well below the lowwater mark essential data for submersion k106 whatever method of mooring is used planners must c arefully consider certain data before designin g submerged cache the cache very likely will be lost if any of the following critical fa ctors are overlooked buoyancy k107 many containers are buoyant even when filled so the container must be weighted sufficiently to submerge it and keep it in pl ace if the contents do not provide enough weight emplacers must make up the bala nce by attaching weight to the container the approximate weig ht needed to attain zero buoyancy is shown in table k1 table k1 buoyancy chart container dimensions inches empty container weight pounds approximate weight that must be added to empty container weight to attain zero buoyancy pounds 7 x 9 x 8 12 5 15 7 x 9 x 16 12 8 31 7 x 9 x 40 16 77 7 x 9 x 45 17 12 88 7 x 9 x 50 19 97 k108 this table applies to several si zes of stainless steel containers the weighting required for any container can be calculate d theoretically if the displacement of the container and the gr oss weight of the container plus its contents are known this calculation may be useful for design ing an anchor but it should not be relied upon for actual emplacement to avoi d hurried improvisation during emplacement emplacers should alway s test the k26 fm 305201 buoyancy in advance by actually submerging the weighted container this test determines only that submerged cache will not float to the surface additional weighting may be required to keep it from drif ting along the bottom as general rule the additional weight should be at least onetenth of the gross weight required to make the container sink more weight is advisable if strong currents are present submersion depth k109 planners must first determine the depth that the c ontainer is to be submerged to calculate the water pressure that the contai ner must withstand the greater the depth the greater the danger tha t the container will be crushed by water pressure for instance the standa rd stainless steel burial container will buckle at depth of approximately 43 meters the difficulty of waterproofing also incr eases with depth thus the container should not be submerged any deeper than necessary to avoid detection as general rule 22 meters is the maxi mum advisable depth for caching if seasonal or tidal variations in the water level require deeper submersion the container should be tested by actual submersion to the max imum depth it must withstand depth of the water k110 emplacers must measure accurately the depth of the w ater at the point where the cache is to be placed this depth will be t he submersion depth if the cache is designed so that the container rest s on the bottom of the lake or river the container may be suspended some distan ce above the bottom but the depth of the water must be known to determine the length of moorings connecting the containers to the anchors high and lowwater marks k111 any tidal or seasonal changes in the depth of the wate r should be estimated as accurately as possible emplacers must cons ider the lowwater mark to ensure that low water will t leave cache exposed the highwater mark should also be considered to ensure that the increas ed depth will not crush the container or prevent recovery type of bottom k112 emplacers should probe as thoroughly as possible the bed of the lake or river in the vicinity of the cache if the bottom is so ft and silty the cache may sink into the muck become covered with sediment r drift out of place if the bottom is rocky or covered with debris the moorings may become snagged any of these conditions may make recovery very di fficult water motion k113 emplacers should consider des currents and waves because any water motion will put additional strain on the moorings of the cache moorings must be strong enough to with stand the greatest possible strain if the water motion tends to rock the cache emplacers must take special care to prevent the moorings from rubbing and fraying k27 fm 305201 clearness of the water k114 when deciding how deep to subm erge the cache emplacers must first determine how far the cache can be seen through the water if the water is clear the cache may need to be camouflaged by painting the c ontainer to match the bottom shiny metallic fixtures should alway s be painted dull color very murky water makes reco very by divers more difficult water temperature k115 planners must consider seasonal changes in the temper ature of the water recovery may be im possible in the winter if the water freezes the dates when the lake or river usually freezes and thaws shoul d be determined as accurately as possible salt water k116 since seawater is much more corrosive than fresh water tidal estuaries and lagoons should not be used for caching th only exception is the maritime resupply operation where equipment may be sub merged temporarily along the seacoast until it can be recovered by shore party concealment k117 there are many different ways to conceal cache in natu ral or ready made hiding places for instance if caching party was hiding weapons and ammunition in cave and was relying entirely on natural concealment the emplacement operation would be reduced to simply locating the site tools would be needed except paper pencil and flashlight on the other hand if the party was sealing packet of jewels in brick w all skilled mason would be needed along with his kit of tools and supply of mortar expertly mixed to match the original brick wall k118 when planning for concealment planners must know the local residents and their customs during the actual emplacemen t the caching party must ensure the operation is not observed the final sterilization of the site is especially important since concealment site is u sually open to frequent observation caching communications equipment k119 as general rule all equipment for particular purpose demolitions survival should be included in one container some equi pment however is so sensitive from security s t n d p i n t t h t i t s h u l d b p c k d i n s v r l containers and cached in different locations to minimize th danger of discovery by the enemy this is particularly true of commu nications equipment since under some circumstances anyone who ac quires whole rt set with signal plan and cryptogra phic material would be able to play back the set an especially dangerous type of penetration would result in the face of this danger the signal plan and the cryptographic material must never be placed in the same container ideally communi cations kit should k28 fm 305201 be distributed among three containers and cached in different locations if three containers are used the distribution may be as follo ws container 1 the rt set including the crystals container 2 the signal plan an d operational supplies for the rt operator such as currency barter and small arms container 3 the cryptographic material k120 when several containers are used for one set of equi pment they must be placed far enough apart so that if one is discovered t he others will not be detected in the immediate vicinity on the other hand th ey should be located close enough together so that they can be recovered conven iently in one operation the distance between containers will depend on t he particular situation but ordinarily they should be at least 10 meter s apart one final reference point ordinarily is used fo r multiple cache the caching party should be careful to avoid placing multiple caches in repeated pattern discovery of one multiple cache would give the opposition guide for probing others placed in similar pattern caching medical equipment k121 feasibility study must be performed to determi ne the need for the caching of medical supplies the purpose of caches is to store exc ess medical supplies to maintain mobility and deny access to the enemy also caching large stockpiles of medical supplies allows preposition ing vital supplies in anticipation of futureplanned operations twelvepoint cache report k122 the final step which is vital in every emplacemen t operation is the preparation of cache report this re port records the essential data for recovery the cache report must provid all of the information that someone unfamiliar with the locality needs to fi nd his way to the site recover the cache and return safely the report is intended merely to point out the minimum essential data whatever format is used the import ance of attention to detail cannot be overemphasized careless err or or omission in the cache report may prevent recovery of the cache when it is needed content k123 the most important parts of the cache report must include instructions for finding and recovering the cache it should also include any other information that will ease planning the recovery operation since the details will depend upon the situation and the particular needs of each organization the exact format of the report may vary slig htly format for cache report and sample message is included in the sav ser sup 6 procedures k124 the observer should collect as much data as possib during the personal reconnaissance to assist in selectin g site and planning emplacement and recovery operations drafting the cache report before emplacement is also advisable following these procedures w ill reveal the k29 fm 305201 k30 omissions then the missing data can be obtained at the s ite if this procedure is followed the preparation of the final cache report will be reduced to an afteraction check this check ensures that th cache actually was placed precisely where planned and that all other descriptive details are accurate although this ideal may seldom be realized t wo procedures always should be followed the caching party should complete the final cache report as soon as possible after emplacement as details are fresh in mind someone who has not visited the site should check the instr uctions by using them to lead the party to the site when such person is available someone should visit the site shortly after emplac ement provided he can do so securely if the cache has been empla ced at night visit to the site in daylight may also provide an opportunity to check on the sterilization of the site appendix l linkup operations the jsoa

links with the area commander the linkup operation is complete multiple linkups l11 linkups can occur at several poin ts and at separate times planning and conducting multiple linkups simu ltaneously is difficult all guerrilla forces should not be involved in the linkup because deception and interdictions should continue during the linkup physical linkup with large guerrilla force may not even be

tacon measures with the guerrilla force commanders to assist linkup in addition it establishes fire control measures to provide support for the linkup both forces must understand the plans for securing objectives and have access to dedicated assets to sure mission success before physical linkup occurs the guerrilla force first confirms the location of the linkup contact point and secures it the sfod ensures security is emplaced and maintained at this location until the linkup is complete contact procedures l14 the participating forces establish simple primary and alternate contact

coordination with us and allied offi cials determines the further use of guerrilla forces following linkup with this guidance the tactical commander may employ these guerrilla forces the sfod stays with and help s them become an effective combat unit operating under the jtf or higher commanders l4 fm 305201 postlinkup employment considerations l17 conventional force commanders sh ould be aware of several important factors when they employ guerrilla fo rces following linkup some of those factors are as follows know the guerrillas their organi zation concepts of operation capabilities and limitations make sure the subordinate leaders understand the value of guerri lla forces and know how to use them anticipate the problems of providing administrative logisti c and operational support to attached guerrilla forces anticipate possible language and political problems in blishing liaison know that the high value of gue rrilla forces is limited to those operations conducted in areas familiar to them maintain guerrilla force integrity as much as possible work through existing channels of the guerrilla command impos ing new organizational structure may hamper their effectiveness respect guerrilla leaders give them the same consideration as officers of the conventional forces maintain guerrilla morale by awarding decorations and let ters of commendation express appreciation whenever such action is justified and warranted do not make political commitments or promises to guerrilla forces unless authorized by higher hq recognize when the value of the guerrilla forces has ended and promptly return them to the control of the unified commander postlinkup missions and operations l18 if the guerrilla force is to be employed as light infantry it must undergo period of retraining and r eequipping before its commitment in the new combat role also commanders may reorganize retrain and reequip sf advised guerrilla forces to conduct reco nnaissance airmobile or other
