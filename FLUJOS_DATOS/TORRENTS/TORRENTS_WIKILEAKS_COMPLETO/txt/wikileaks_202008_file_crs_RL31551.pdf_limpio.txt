economic and tax issues summary the loss of retirement assets held in enron stock by enron employees has stimulated proposals to restrict the holding of employer stock in retirement plans and other proposals to regulate these plans stock in the enron plan came from firm contributions in the form of stock that wa s not allowed to be sold and from voluntary investment by employees this report fo cuses on rationales for providing employer retirement plans and for holding or not holdi ng employer stock in these plans both from the perspective of the private s ector and of government policy retirement plans fall into two types defined benefit plans where pension based on earnings and years of service is provided and define d contribution plans where individuals receive benefits base d on accumulated principal and interest either plan can hold employer stock but holdings are limited to 10 of assets in the case of defined benefit plans these plans receive tax subsidies as do employee stock purchase plans and certa in types of stock options the analysis suggests that there are economic reasons that firms and employees may engage in pension and profit sharing or stock ownership plans even in the absence of tax subsidies pension plans primarily defined be nefit plans may be attractive for administrative and riskreduction reasons for dealing with inadequate investment in onthejob training and for smoothing the retirement of older workers stock options and stock owners hip plans may be useful fo r addressing inconsistency in objectives between shareholders and ma nagers and worker monitoring problems although these benefits are not likely to accrue to stock ownership by the rank and file of large companies these employ ee stock ownership plans may also deter hostile takeovers which ma undermine economic effi ciency and stockholder interests stock contributions are also popular because they do not reduce cash flow which has both benefits nd costs from an economic efficiency perspective government subsidies to plans may be justified to increase retirement incomes and access to annuities because of shortf all in optimal saving s and certain economic problems with self selecti on in purchasing annuities these objectives also underlie the justification of social security pu rsuing these goals may actually conflict with another worthy objective onthejob trai ning however objectives that are addressed via employee stock ownership do not appear important in shaping the nature of large broadlybase d retirement plans diversif ication of plan assets and prudent investment portfolio s do appear consistent with rationales for government intervention attempts to address this issue might take several forms restrictions on shares of employer stock in plans prohibiting employer stock contributions or lifting restrictions on sale denying tax deduction on employer contributions until they could be sold and requiring independent inves tment advice the last proposal is not costless and could undermine pa rticipation for small firms for administrative and other reasons it may be rational to impos share restrictions on allocations of contributions rather than on assets th ere are plans to update this report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31551contents b s i c t p s f p l n s 2 p r i v t r t i n l s f r p n s i n n d p r f i t s h r i n

tax issues the enron bankruptcy caused many employ ees to lose large portion of their retirement savings that was invested in ron stock approximate ly 60 of enrons 401k plan was in enron stock some of the concentration was because enron matching contributions were in stock and that stock could not be sold until age 50 or upon leaving the company however large fraction was due to employees choosing to purchase enron stock the loss was somewhat exacerbated because of blackout period when individua ls were not allowed to trade because of change in plan administrators critics have also argued that enron officials were touting the soundness of the stock as an investment and deducting stock contributions at full value even as they were aware of looming problems for the firm while the enron case was probably the most publicized instance of employee loss of retirement assets due to holdings of company stock it is not an isolated case several legislative proposal s have been advanced to address these problems including dramatically shortening to three years the required holding time for company donated stock restricting the am ount of employer stock held in 401k plans and requiring firms to provide i ndependent investment advice critics of these proposals have argued that some of these restrictions particularly those restricting the ability of firms to contribute in the form of stock would lead to reduced employer contributions moreover proposals that might seem reasonable for large firms but that add cost and co mplexity such as providing investment advisors may reduce the participation of smaller firms in 401k plans this report provides an economic perspective on the issue focusing on the potential rationale for government intervention into employer retirement and profit sharing plans readers are referred to another crs report that contains more detailed discussion of the ron bankruptcy the general issues associated with the holding of employer stock by retirement pl ans and legislative proposals crs report rl31507 employer stock in retirement pl ans investment risk and retirement security by pat purcell the next section of this report discu sses briefly the kinds of retirement and profit sharing plans firms use the follo wing section discusses why pension and profit sharing or stock ownership plan s might exist even without government intervention understanding those rationale s is key to understanding the behavioral response to government regulatory chan ges and determining whether government policy should further encourage or restrict such plans the next section discusses economic rationales for government interv ention and the final section discusses implications of these rationales fo r possible legislative revisionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31551crs2 1 see crs report rl31458 employer stock options tax treatment and tax issues by jack taylorbasic types of plans broad range of plans that involve benef its to workers not in the form of cash currently exist including wide variety of plans that are for retirement purposes and that employees cannot receive until they leave the firm these plans receive tax benefits in that contributions and earning s are not taxed to individuals until received as pensions or payments on separation these plans fall into two basic types defined benefit plans where workers are guaranteed certain benefit related to earnings and years of service and defined contribution plans where employees receive benefits based on the size of assets and accumulated earnings for most types of plans contributions to these plans are typically made by employers and thus do not permit employees to choose be tween them and cash wages for variety of reasons defined bene fit plans which once dominated the pension landscape have been in declin over the past quarter of century and defined contribution plans are on the increase this rise in defined contribution plans particularly reflects popular form of defi ned contribution plan 401k plan where individual accounts are maintained both em ployers and employees contribute and employee contributions are vol untary employees have so choice in the allocation of their own contributions employer st ock may be one of the choices employer contributions may also be made in the form of employer stock while all pension plans are subject to re gulations of some type the restrictions are greatest for defined benefit plans defined benefit plans are also covered by pension insurance which insures against total loss of assets some of the restrictions on plans particularly defi ned benefit plans were designed to insure sound investments and to make sure that the plans were not simply tax shelter for high ranking employees and managers only fined benefit plans ve restrictions on the amount of employer stock that can be held 10 for defined contribution plans employees bear the risk of loss of investment or low retu rns some types of plans with retirement features employee stock ownership plans or esops must hold assets primarily in the form of em ployer stock plans may be combined tax benefits are also provided for acquiring employer stock that is not restricted to retirement plans these benefits incl ude benefits for stoc k options and stock purchase plans the former are generally directed to high ranking employees and managers while the latter are generally available to all employees1 private rationales for pension and profitsharing plans why should firms pay employee compensati on in the form of pension or profit sharing plans or other fringe benefits rather than in cash does the existence of these plans hinge solely or largely on tax bene fits in this section we briefly discusshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31551crs3 several reasons that firms mig ht desire to pay compensati on or that individuals might like to receive it in the form of pensions or stock the first three reasons are largely associated with defined benefit pension plans while the last two are associated with profitsharing or stock owners hip plans defined contri bution plans not in the form of stock may indeed have rgely arisen from desire to exploit tax benefits as it is difficult to discern anot her reason for using them administrative savings in surance and riskpooling one reason for the popularity of these retir ement plans might be that collective plans such as pension plans could be c onsidered desirable because of administrative savings and risk reduction pension plan s are also often c onstructed to provide insurance elements such as disability and survivor paymen ts and life annuities insurance of this nature is often not efficiently provided in private markets because of adverse selection advers selection occurs when indi viduals sort themselves out due to private knowledge of risks for example person with terminal illness might desire to buy life insurance but would not purchase life annuity while administrative savings could pply to any plan riskpooling and insurance elements would tend to apply mo st strongly to defi ned benefit pensions plans with diversified asse ts and would not apply to stock ownership plans which tend to increase risk administrative nd risk reduction bene fits have probably declined over time with the current availab ility of large mutual funds and the benefits are particularly less importa nt for defined contribution plans that do not have unique elements of insurance and risk reduction ssociated with definedbenefit plans human capital investment investment in human capital is genera lly underprovided in market economy because individuals cannot engage in i nvoluntary servitude or commit to certain form of employment to insure that future earnings are used to repay human capital investments these problems apply both to general education and to certain types of onthejob training returns to onthejob tr aining that teaches skills specific to the firm can only be exploited by remaining with the firm however returns to onthe job training that teaches sk ills transferable to other jobs can be realized by either staying with the firm or moving to another firm it is in the interest of the firm to retain employees when the firm has invest ed in their training and whose net product is low or even negative in the early peri od of the career defined benefit pension plans that are not quickly vested and whos benefits become greatest when spending long career with company can be used to allow firms and employees to mutually exploit gains from these types of human capital investment government pension regulations which require early vesting and portability as ways to protect worker retirement security and guard against tax sheltering may howev er have eroded this benefit facilitating retirement pension plans may also be way of couraging employees to retire as their marginal product falls wit hout undermining morale by firing older workers who havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31551crs4 2 there is an extensive literature on the effects of employee ownership see douglas kruse research evidence on prevalence and effect s of employee ownership presented in testimony before the subcommittee on employeremployee relations committee on education and workforce us house of representatives feb 13 2002

extensive list of refe rences linda bell and david neumark lumpsum payments and profitsharing plans in the union sector of the united states economy the economic journal vol 103 may 1993 become less productive or these days placing the employer in the position of potentially violating the law defined benef it pension plans are pa rticularly effective because workers who have reached full retir ement and remain at work forgo their pensions and their net wage is reduced creating powerful substitution effect that encourages retirement while also offsetting lost income defined contribution plans permit retirement but do not create as powerful an incentive to retire and thus do not perform this function as well the principalagent and workermonitoring problems another problem that large firms with many stockholders andor employees face is the problem of misalignment of shareholder and worker interests in the case of managers this problem is of ten referred to as the principalagent or agency cost problem managers who run the company as an agent for shareholders may make decisions that do not necessarily maximiz stockholder profits moreover large firms may find it difficult to monitor the performance of workers in particular they cannot easily distinguish between the effects of work effort vers us outside influences on productivity one way that firms may atte mpt to remedy this problem is through use of stock options which provide empl oyees an incentive to increase the firms value and stock ownership plans wh ich provide some alignment with the shareholders objectives of course in theory this approach would not be particularly beneficial for th rank and file employees of large firms where additional work effort by any one employee would have negligible effect on the value of that employees stock stock options and ow nership could have an effect on top management whose actions ve important consequences and on closely held firms moreover many managers be lieve that employer ownership boosts employee loyalty and morale2 employee stock ownership can also work against shareholder interests and economic efficiency firms where employees hold large fraction of stock are more impervious to hostile takeovers as employees and managers may otherwise fear loss of pay and jobs in such circumstance however threats of takeovers are also market mechanism that may keep the prin cipalagent problem under control and both takeover threats and actual takeovers may lead to more efficient company reducing takeovers may be dvantageous for managers and workers but may not be desirable socially httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31551crs5 3see crs report rl31498 social security reform economic issues by marc labonte and jane g gravelleminimizing cash flow effects providing compensation in the form of stock is often considered cheaper because it does not reduce current cashflow such an approach may be particularly attractive to new and fast growing firms where access to capital markets is difficult and initial profitab ility is low th is motive may lead to more ec onomic efficiency if capital markets consistently overestimate expected risk it may lead to less efficient markets if the dilution of stock makes information on the firms profitability more difficult to assess by investors rationales for government intervention the previous section has suggested privat motives even in the absence of tax benefits for defined benefit pension plans and for stock ownership plans but there does not appear to be strong private rationale for defined contribution plans not held in the form of employer stock cl early another reason for pension and profit sharing plans that may play crucial role in encouraging these plans particularly defined contribution plans not invested in employer stock is the tax benefits associated with them amounts contributed to pension plan and their earnings are not subject to tax until received as pensions usually many years into the future the combination of deferral of tax on the initial contribution and deferral of tax on earnings is the equivalent of an exemp tion of earnings from tax and is thus valuable tax benefit why should the government intervene w ith tax subsidies and regulations to shape the compensation package and wh should it intervene with mixed signals including both benefits for and restric tions on ownership of employer stock in pension plans the first set of rationales for supporting pension plans are also are among the reasons for establishing social security adverse selection in annuity markets and failure of individual optimization fa ilure to save desirable amount3 adverse selection in annuity markets occurs because individuals expecting to have shorter life span will avoid the annuities market thereby making the annuities unattractive for the average individual this rationale would justify tax subsidies to pension plans that provide retirement annuities early vesting and mandates for broad coverage of employees the latter rule is probably necessary in any case to prevent the tax benefits from becoming tax shelter for highly compensated employees of course it is not clear that individuals do not sa ve enough and it is not clear why using resources in the form of reduced taxes to encourage private pension system that covers about half of workers should be pr eferred to devoting those resources to an expansion of social security the entire pension system has been shifting away from plans that address these goals many defined contribution plans ve lumpsum payoff option and definedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31551crs6 4considerable research on tax benefits for re tirement often focused on individual retirement accounts and 401k plans has found mixed results for summary see crs report rl30255 individual retirement accounts iras issues and proposed expansion by jane g gravellebenefit plans have been increasingly displ aced by defined contribution plans 401k plans which have become very popul ar allow voluntary not mandatory contributions outside of certain define d benefit plans the current systems have simply become primarily ways to obtain tax benefits of course arguments are made that thes tax benefits have encouraged saving but neither economic theory nor empirical evidence has confirmed that view4 in any case this rationale suggests that prudence in investment is important to encourage in that case many of the proposals for revision including limits on employer stock holding in any type of pension plan and reducing or eliminating any required holding period might be justified of course such an approach also suggests that employee stock ownership plan subsidies be discontinued or modified some of the rules made to insure safe and broadly available worker pensions have been in conflict with solutions to other economic problems for example as noted earlier market economy tends to underinvest in human capital there are obviously massive government interventions through direct spending lowinterest loans and tax benefits to provide for fo rmal education and training pension rules may however have undermined the use of defined benefit pensi ons for encouraging spending on onthejob training for exam ple rules mandating early vesting are in conflict with objectives to increase onthejob training objectives that might be worthy of pursuit by the government as well although they ma be appropriate to increase pension coverage and employee security similarly nondiscrimination requirements have been used to prevent the use of the tax subsidies as tax shelter for highly compensated employees and in crease coverage even though onthejob training benefits may not be uniform across employees diversification of assets is consistent however with bot h government and private ra tionales for defined benefit pension plans economic problems arising from principa lagent costs or worker monitoring costs may be argued to justify governme nt subsidies to stock ownership plans to increase efficiency beyond what private markets may do however they are unlikely to be addressed by owners hip of employer stock among rank and file employees of large companies where most tax subsidie s for pensions are directed moreover encouraging practices that make companies resistant to takeover may reduce rather than increase economic efficiency nor is it clear that stock ownership plans benefits in preserving cash flow outweigh the po ssible negative effects of using stock as compensation on stockholder information thus the justification for government subsidies to stock ownership is not really established httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31551crs7 implications for reform proposals as discussed above the discussion of ju stifications for government intervention based on economic problems suggests rationales for tr aditional pension plans particularly those with defi ned benefits but do not necessa rily suggest justification of tax subsidies for plans such as 401k plans where participation by employees is voluntary these subsidies may not even in crease retirement saving however given that subsidies do exist there does appear to be case for increasing the safety of investments by limiting investment in employer stock while the rationale for supporting employer stock owners hip plans appears weak if limits on ownership are to be imposed how should constraints work it would appear better for administrative and other reasons to impose the limits on the share of contributions made rather than the share of assets reason for limiting the share of assets in employer stock in fined benefit plans is in part because of pension insurance and because of limits on excess contributions issues that do not exist for 401k plans in the case of defined contribution plan successful employer stock may simply become larger part of the asset base because it is appreciating rapidly and forced sales may not be sensible other legislative changes might be requirements that employees be able to sell employer contributed stock immediately or within few years which is proposed in some legislation disallowing deductions for stock contributions until employees are allowed to sell or even prohibiting these types of contributions altogether it is not clear whether these restrictions will be successful how ever if esops remain as an option another legislative proposal that has b een made to increase the security of individual investment plans which might be used instead of explicit restrictions is to require firms to provide investment advice since firm managers may have conflict of interest of course investment advice is not costless and it could significantly discourage the use of these plans in the case of small firms moreover virtually any independent i nvestment advisor would couns against holding large part of retirement assets in single st ock but many advisors would suggest taking on general stock market risk if explicit restrictions are imposed on ownership of single stock such individual advice might not be necessary alternatively general public information campaign ma be considered moreove r the publicity associated with the enron bankruptcy along with other firm failures and the decline in the stock market may be adequate to alert individuals to the need for portfolio diversification one criticism that has been made of th proposals is that firms may respond by reducing their contributions it is not clear that such reduction would occur or should be problem if it did and many c ontributions are currently made in cash rather than stock if stock contributions have any value then they are likely to substitute for cash wages it is not cl ear that policy shoul d be concerned about employer matches in risky asset as substitution for cash wages particularly when the participation is voluntary both on the part of individuals contributing to plans and firms setting up plans the beneficiaries in both cases are only part of the population and the more affluent part an argument could be made that the revenue derived from increased taxes on cash wages might be better used for other purposes
