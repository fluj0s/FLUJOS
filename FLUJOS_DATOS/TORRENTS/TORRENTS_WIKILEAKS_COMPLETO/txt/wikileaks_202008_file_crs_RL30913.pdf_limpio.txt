industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913pharmaceutical research and development description and analysis of the process summary central element of the debate about inclusion of prescription drug benefits in medicare is the price of prescription drugs key issue in the debate concerns the relationship between those prices and the pharmaceutical research and development rd costs while this report will not analyze that relationship directly it does present description and assessment of the pharmaceutical rd drug development process and the factors that affec t costs such an analysis should be useful in addressing questions about the cost of pharmaceutical rd and the dependence of prescription drug prices in the united states on those costs pharmaceutical rd drug development consists of several stages it begins with drug discov ery followed by preclinical drug development where thousands of candidate chemicals may be screened for attractive therapeutic pharmacological and toxicity properties successful candidates usually 5 or fewer from an original pool that may total 10000 are then subjected to three stages of clinical trials testing the drugs effectiveness and side effects if drug emerges from the trials showing significant therapeutic benefit it is submitted to the food and drug administration for marketing approval if approved postmarketing surveillance ensues looking for possible safety concerns that did not emerge in the earlier trials the entire drug development process typically takes nearly 15 years the largest share of that time is devoted to the three stages of clinical trials although there is firm figure for the cost of drug development estimate s have run as high as 500 million for the costs associated with typical drug while these costs cannot be stated with any real precision the true cost is still probably high and the major share of those costs is for clinical trials recent advances in molecular biology making use of genetic data developed in the human genome project offer the promise of significantly shortening both drug development and clinical trial time although it may be several years before these goals are routinely realized any significant shortening of the development time could reduce pharmaceutical rd costs and possibly prescription drug prices another factor in the cost equation is the contribution of basic biomedical research funded by the national institut of health such research is very important for drug development and benefits the pharmaceutical industry by reducing its rd costs there are several issues about pharmaceutical rd that congress may decide to monitor closely two which are within the scope of this report concern federal biomedical rd funding and clinical trial practices with respect to the first particular concern is the possibility of unnecessary overlap in research sponsored by both nih and the industry as the latter strives to incorporate more of the promise of molecular biology into the pharmaceutical rd process with respect to clinical trial practice of specific concern are human subject protection and the potential for conflict of interest on the part of academic researchers taking part in clinical trialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913contents introduction 1 background 2 biological basis of disease 2 basics of pharmaceuticals 3 the research process 4 overview 4

httpwwwphrmaorgpublicationspublicationsprofile00pharmaceutical research and development description and analysis of the process introduction perhaps the central issue in the debate about inclusion of prescription drug benefits in medicare has been whether such action would lead to some type of price controls for these drugs1 key element of that debate is the relationship between prescription drug prices and the research and development rd activities of the pharmaceutical industry in 2000 the worldwide researchbased pharmaceutical industry spent an estimated 264 billion on rd including 224 billion in the united states2 the us and worldwide totals were up by about 24 billion or 10 from 1999 for 2000 these rd expenditures constituted an estimated 20 of the sales of these companies it is the contention of the industry that current prices are required if that rd is to continue at level suffici ent to develop drugs to attack many of the diseases now afflicting humankind critics however argue that those prices are higher than can be justified by rd costs the purpose of this report is to help the reader understand the pharmaceutical rd process as part of the knowledge needed to evaluate the debate about drug pricing in addition however the pharmaceutical rd process and future prospects raise number of issues on their own this report provides description of that process and analyzes number of those key issues the steps of the research process drug discovery preclinical testing clinical trials and post approval monitoring are described in addition various factors affecting the duration and costs of the process are discussed including the possible consequences of recent advances in biomedical research finally an analysis is presented of topics pertinent to the rd process that may be of interest to congress although the report discusses pharmaceutical rd costs it does not present an analysis of the validi ty of various cost estimates those and other areas

vitamin d and cholesterolpharmaceuticals rd and prescription drugs including patent protection regulation and advertising are now or will be covered in other crs studies3 background description of the pharmaceutical rd process requires brief review of the relevant biology both to help the reader understand the origins of most human disease and how most drugs work in combating disea ses the section begins with brief discussion of the basic biological mechanisms of living systems and how disease attacks those systems it next presents short discussion of the biological processes by which pharmaceuticals work in combating disease biological basis of disease of the different chemical compounds that are essential for human organisms proteins play crucial roles in most human biological functions and provide much structural support proteins provide structural support for the body as critical components of ligaments tendons and skin enzymes are proteins that accelerate the essential chemical reactions in the cell antibodies are proteins that protect cells from attack by foreign substances called antigens hormones that regulate cell metabolism are proteins4 within the membrane wall of the cell proteins act as receptors attaching to and transporting essential chemicals into the interior of the cell proteins perform many other functions as well the instructions contained in the genetic code are translated to control of cellular behavior through the synthesis of proteins the genes contained in the dna molecule code instructions for the chains of amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins furthermore this gene expression is itself regulated by other proteins proteins are large molecules containing hundreds to thousands of atoms and are arranged in very complex shapes for those proteins responsible for controlling functions enzymes receptors hormones etc both the chemical structure and the shape determine how they react with other chemicals because proteins are so important to the functioning of living systems they are naturally almost always involved when something goes wrong in most cases thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs3 5for general discussion of the role of proteins in disease see susan aldridge magic molecules how drugs work cambridge cambridge university press 1998 6eric s grace biotechnology unzipped promises and realities washington joseph henry press 1997 62 7see aldridge magic molecules 611 73 and jurgen drews in quest of tomorrows medicines new york springer 1998 118121problems occur with proteins that are either enzymes receptors or hormones5 many cancers result when proteins that control the rate at which cells divide longer function properly and cells begin to multiply in an uncontrolled manner infections can damage living organism when bacteria or viruses produce toxins that inhibit protein synthesis resulting in the death of cells these microbes can also cause damage by invading and multiplying within cells and tissues fever and inflamation result through the action of the bodys immune system attacking the intruders in the case of aids proteins on the human immunodeficiency virus hiv bind to receptor proteins on cells of the immune system the virus is then able to invade those cells reproduce and eventually destroy the cells as result the immune system weakens and is unable to stop other microbial invasions called opportunistic infections other diseases result from problems with hormone production or utilization diabetes i occurs when the body does not produce the hormone insulin while diabetes ii occurs when insulin production is norma l but the body cannot use it in the cardiovascular system proteins called low density lipoprotein ldl deposit cholesterol stored in fat cells on body tissue including the insides of blood vessels high density lipoprotein hdl on the other hand carries the cholesterol to the liver for recycling therefore if the ratio of ldl to hdl is too high the individual is at risk for heart disease identifying and understanding protein behavior therefore are primary objectives of research into disease and its causes because of the connection between genes and proteins it is also clear that genes play an important role in disease mechanisms indeed protein behavior that leads to disease can often be attributed to genetic mutations that result in creation of proteins that do not behave normally or of failure to create needed proteins for example cystic fibrosis results from genetic mutation that prevents the formation of proteins allowing chloride to pass through cell walls over 4000 diseases have been identified as having genetic origin6 although many of those are rare some are the result of single gene mutations while others result from combin ation of multiple gene mutations and other factors because of this geneprotein linkage genetics has been and continues to be the target of research in understanding disease and its origins basics of pharmaceuticals given the role of proteins in disease it is natural that the focus of most drug therapy is to inhibit protein activity that causes physiological harm to humans or to stimulate protein activity that is needed by the body but is lacking7 for example aspirin works for pain mitigation by inhibiting the action of protein that when stimulated is responsible for producing chemical that results in pain aspirinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs4 8 in the case of aspirin and penicillin the biological basis of the drugs actions were not discovered until many years after the drugs themselves were discovered contains chemicals that bind with that protein preventing it from acting as stimulant for protein activity drugs can bind with receptors causing the cells on which they are located to carry out desired biochemical activity for example when insulin binds with its target receptor the cells act to maintain steady levels of glucose in the blood stream many cancer drugs work by actions that inhibit proteins responsible for maintaining multiplication of cancerous cells resulting in the death of those cells as well as other rapidly dividing cells antibiotics kill bacteria by inactivating enzymes on bacterial cell membranes causing them to stop forming or by halting the synthesis of proteins needed to sustain the microbes life while the basis of most pharmaceutical action sounds straightforward implementing such action is usually very difficult determining targets for drugs can be daunting costly task as has been repeatedly demonstrated from the history of biomedical research for example the research effort to discover the proteins responsible for cancerous cell growth and how they work has consumed many billions of dollars and several decades and complete understanding still appears long way off furthermore once target is determined discovering chemical that will bind with that target protein and either inhibit or aid its actions as need be is not assured8 as stated above proteins have very complex shapes that determine how other molecules bind with them and even if one can discover such molecules the drug still may not work in humans human biological processes on the molecular level are extremely complicated and research efforts to understand those processes and bring about chemical therapies for disease are substantial just how is that research carried out how are the fundamentals outlined above applied to bring about the development of prescription drugs the next section provides description of the pharmaceutical rd process as it is typically performed reference is made wherever appropriate to the biological basis of disease and pharmaceuticals just presented the research process this section discusses the pharmaceutical research process the section begins with brief overview of the entire process it then describes in more detail the basic research phase of pharmaceutical research drug discovery followed by discussion of preclinical research description of the clinical trial phase is given next followed by review of the postapproval process brief survey of the history of pharmaceutical rd is given in appendix overview drug research and development begins with the drug discovery phase typically at this stage chemical compounds either naturally occurring called biologics or synthetic are investigated in laboratory settings for their potential to bind to andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs5 9most illness and death from illness is result of viral or bacterial infection proteins are still the target of antibiotic and antiviral drugs although they belong to the invading microbes and not the host blocking bacterial enzymes or inhibiting protein synthesis are the principal objectives of antibiotics drugs that work with viruses usually bind on viral enzymes inhibiting their action vaccines against infectious diseases work by presenting an antigen to the hosts immune system antigen proteins carried on the surface of virus stimulate the immune system when virus enters aldridge magic molecules 7282modify target molecules once promising candidates are identified preclinical testing begins in this stage actual drug development begins and pharmacological studies are carried out basically that research focuses on how the drug candidates react when delivered to the body if promising candidates emerge from these first two stages they enter the most arduous and timeconsuming portion of the rd process clinical trials there are three stages to clinical trials called phase i phase ii and phase iii that candidate drug must pass through before it can be considered for market approval in phase i the safety of the candidate drug is tested on healthy volunteers once safety screening is complete testing begins on population of patients who have the disease then phase ii trials are held to establish the parameters end points for the quantitative measurement of the effectiveness of the drug phase iii trials are basically largescale version of phase ii trials in phase iii however the focus is on obtaining quantitative measurements of the effectiveness of the drug based on the end points determined in the phase ii trials and on monitoring for any important side effects if the results of the phase iii trials provide clear indication of the candidate drugs effectiveness and that any side effects can be reasonably managed it is submitted to the food and drug administration for approval to market during that process it is possible that fda may require additional phase iii trials if approval is granted postmarketing surveillance is carried out to monitor the drug for additional safety concerns that may not have appeared during the preapproval clinical trials additional trials phase iv may also be required at this point each of these steps is complex and uncertain and each require s substantial commitment of time and resources to gain some insight into those characteristics each step will now be described in more detail drug discovery drug discovery usually begins with research to identify potential drug targets targets are biochemical compounds in the body usually proteins as noted above whose action or absence of actions results in diseased condition9 in some cases drugs have been discovered without researchers knowing an underlying cause of the disease aspirin was discovered long before the mechanism by which it works was determined much more often however particularly in recent years identification of drug targets has launched the search for therapies usually the search is aided by new knowledge of biological processes and disease mechanisms resulting from

research much of which is funded by the national institutes of health nih diseases often have multiple biochemical causes or factors discovery of single factor in such case may not lead to useful drug target as noted above the complexity of most diseases means that identification of targets is generally quite difficult it is estimated that thousands of potential targets exist in the body10 by 1996 however survey of drug targets on which current drug therapy was based found that only about 500 targets were being used 45 of which were receptors and 28 of which were enzymes11 the remaining 27 consist of variety of targets including hormones dna molecules and cell nuclei receptors or are unknown the actual process of drug discovery is characterized by search for molecules that can bind to targets and result in an action that produces therapeutic result until the last few decades this search was largely trial and error process12 pharmaceutical companies would develop libraries of thousands of molecules over the years from variety of sources13 when promising target was identified researchers would test molecules from these libraries largely by trial and error or random screening to look for potential therapeutic activity many different natural and synthetic compounds thousands to tens of thousands were tried in laboratory experiments often using animals to see whether they showed therapeutic promise often the biochemical basis for any therapeutic effect was not understood and at times substance being screened would be found to treat an ailment different from the one for which the screening was intended14 in addition to being timeconsuming and resource intensive discoveries obtained in this fashion usually did not yield findings that could be generalized to aid in the search for therapies to other diseases consequently while this method of drug discovery has resulted in many new drugs over the years the industry has put major efforts into development of more rational approaches in recent years search metho ds have become more systematic15 using technique known as combinational chemistry literally thousands of candidate drug compounds can be produced in systematic and automatic fashion in this situation candidate molecule is modified atombyatom producing large number of similar molecules to be tested for therapeutic action testing itself is done using automatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs7 16robert service winning combination technology review 101 1998 3442 17national research council us industry in 2000 studies in

objective is to understand the behavior of the molec ules that make up an organisms cells and the interactions between those molecules the principal foci of molecular biology research are the molecular structure of genes in particular the dna mole cule and the structure and behavior of protein molecules biotechnology the technique of using living cells to make useful products and provide services modern biotechnology involves the manipulation of the molecules making up cells such as dna and rna genetic engineering type of biotechnology that involves manipulation of genetic material to produce desired types of living organisms or to correct genetic defectsmethods including monitoring the interactions using highthroughput screening process results which modify the targets are explored further giving rise to more information about those compounds the use of combinational chemistry expanded rapidly in the 1990s and huge library of potential drugs exists in those companies employing this technique16 advances in molecular biology see box are also having profound effect on drug discovery first they are leading to substantial increase in understanding the origin and causes of diseases application of molecular biology developments is changing the way researchers identify drug targets more about this application will be discussed below second biotechnology see box has been used to bring about dramatic incre ases in the production of certain drugs eg insulin whose efficacy was already established third new results from molecular biology research are being used to enhance the search for other drugs17 as research tool genetic engineering see box is used to produce pure screens on which to test new drug candidates18 therefore rather than relying on screen that may contain the target in question among others the receptor can be synthesized and made to exist alone allowing more rational and effective test of the drug19 recent developments in biotechnology are only just beginning to make major contributions to drug discovery however and they promise to revolutionize the entire pharmaceutical rd process preclinical testing once promising drug candidates have

the about 5000 to 10000 drug candidates screened during the drug discovery stage about 250 will typically make it to the preclinical research stage20 during this phase the pharmacological concerns of toxicity bioavailability21 and efficacy are investigated in addition at this point an investigational new drug ind application is filed with the food and drug administration fda patents are applied for and efforts are started to develop economic and quality manufacturing processes22 safety testing takes place in animals that are administered ever increasing doses to look for onset of toxicity also key feature of this stage is to determin the best method of delivery eg oral intravenous etc drug with low bioavailability at or near zero either must have its dosage increased when administered orally or it must be administered in some other way other tests include determining drug candidates shelf lifetime and shipping durability the first step in preclinical pharmacologi cal testing is to determine toxicity including the relationship between dosage and toxicity how those effects vary over time the organs affected and the reversibility of any effects23 to determine how the effects change over time or whether there are longterm toxic effects extended tests are performed they usually last more than year and attempt to determine number of factors in addition to cataloging of any risks of longterm use included are tests to determine dosage range maximum dosage for side effects and largest tolerable dosage in parallel carcinogenicity studies involving various dosage levels and lasting up to two years are carried out other conditions studied include local side effects allergenic reactions and effects on reproduction during the safety testing animals are used for studies of toxicity including chronic toxicity24 the drugs cancercausing potential is also investigated by examining how it may damage the animals dna pregnant animals are used to look at the drugs effects on pregnancy animal testing is opposed by some however and other methods are being sought including the use of tissue cultures bacteria cells and computer models many of these methods are now used for preliminary screening to reduce the number of animals used in safety testing drug delivery is also an important objective of preclinical research this stage involves the study of how the drug is

drug by healthy tissue before it can reach the target25 for example many drugs that are proteins would be digested rapidly by the stomach and small intestine enzymes in the liver can deactivate many drugs if they circulate in the blood stream if as result of such actions drug candidate will not work if taken orally the major alternative at present is needle injection because injections cause discomfort and can be difficult to administer much pharmaceutical rd is directed at ways to deliver drugs to avoid needle injections the dosage level of drugs must also be controlled so that they are effective but not toxic in addition timing of drug delivery may be important because of disease rhythms and natural body cycles and to minimize toxic effects the final objective of preclinical research is the development of manufacturing methods26 most often production is done by synthetic chemistry but the use of genetic engineering recombinan t dna is growing other methods include fermentation27 and extraction from natural sources primarily plants once method is chosen production is scaled up to levels needed for clinical trials clinical trials of the approximately 250 drug candidates that enter the preclinical research stage for typical drug development project about five will emerge as inds to be tested in the clinical trial stage clinical trials which constitute the most time consu ming and costly portion of drug development consist of three phases each more complex than the preceding before clinical trials can begin the sponsoring pharmaceutical company must have approval from fda about trial protocols see below description phase i clinical trials are designed to test drug safety in particular to determine maximum safe dose small single doses are used at first with the dosage level increasing until side effects are observed concentrations of the drug in the blood are then measured these tests are followed with multiple dose tests and range of concentrations that do not produce unacceptable side effects is determined typically phase i trial will include 10 to 100 participants last about 15 years and cost about 10 million28 participants are usually healthy although if very serious side effects are possibility the tests may be made on the targeted patient group the purpose of phase ii trials is to determine the parameters for the final test phase iii trials these parameters among others are the class eg age genderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs10 29drews in quest of tomorrows medicine 132 3021 cfr 314510 31zivan understanding clinical trials 73 32ibid 73and condition of the patients to include in the trial what end points to measure and what constitutes an effective dose and duration of treatment end points are those conditions that yield an unambiguous indication of the drugs success or failure to test drugs effectiveness often it is necessary to look for surrogate markers rather than survival absence of the disease or some other measure of longterm success29 for example in aids testing for period long enough to determine whether there is high longterm survival rate would not be appropriate because of the large number of years it would take such trial be impractical in this case surrogate such as decline in viral particles in the blood may be consider ed an acceptable marker similarly markers are used for chronic diseases such as diabetes because of the length of time needed to prove that the drug actually inhibits the onset of complications there is risk of using surrogate markers however because they may not adequately predict the therapeutic effectiveness clinical benefi t of the drug candidate in such case trial could show significant positive results based on the surrogate chosen and the drug would be approved when used by the general patient population however it is possible that drug may not improve the patients wellbeing to any significant degree for this reason for any drug that uses surrogate endpoints to gain market approval the fda will require clinical trial after that approval to resolve remaining uncertainty about the ability of the surrogate endpoint to accurately predict clear clinical benefit30 phase ii involves the first use of control group test group of patients to whom placebo or another drug is given which allows the clearest means of proving whether the drug is successful and of determining its side effects the use of placebos is becoming less common in favor of existing treatments where possible control groups also provide the means of eliminating confounding factors factors that may have the same effect as the drug being tested but are unrelated to the drugs actions drug effect desired or otherwise must show up in statistically significant manner among the participants of the test group in order to be considered definitive31 use of control group should be doubleblind procedure neither the patients nor the physicians administering the treatment should know which group is gettin g the therapy being investigated typically phase ii trials include 50 to 500 participants last about two years and cost about 20 million32 phase iii trials determine the effecti veness of the drug and any important side effects the testing in this phase is designed to match as closely as possible how the drug would be used if marketed often several controlled studies studies using control groups take place at different locations called multicenter studies and each study must follow the same protocols the group of patients included in the test are selected based on characteristics defined in the phase ii trials an important factor for this phase is to get patients with just the right level of illness to test efficacy patients too ill may not live through the trial and those not ill enough may not showhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs11 33aldridge magic molecules 48 34drews in quest of tomorrows medicine 134 35zivan understanding

of the phase iii trial is authoritative demonstration of drugs effectiveness as defined by the end points determined in the phase ii trials control group is used and statistically significant number of test group patients must attain those end points for the study to be considered pivotal usually two or more pivotal trials are required to secure fda approval unless the first trial is particularly positive large fraction about 80 of the data used for fda approval applications arises from phase iii trials34 if the results of the first phase iii trial are ambiguous redesigned trial is usually held with more restricted group of patients or with other changed factors the data from the first trial usually determines the changes if any that need to be made in the followup trial the ideal phase iii trial is doubleblind crossover trial crossover means that the test and control groups switch halfway through the trial if the tested drug produces dramatic improvements trials may be stopped before scheduled completion with the approval of fda to make the drug available to everyone suffering from the disease phase iii trials typically involve anywhere from 300 to 30000 participants run for three to five years and cost about 45 million35 general features during the clinical trials companies are required to follow certain standards and procedures to ensure good clinical practice36 as part of the ind filed with the fda the company must provide complete description of the procedures it will follow in the clinical trials including how it will meet the standards of good clinical practice the fda must approve those procedures before trials begin the fda issues guidelines about trial procedures but they do not have the force of law the fda also has oversight responsibility over the trials and has the right to stop them at any time if it believes the participants may be at excessive risk the fda also requires two other conditions to be met before trials can begin informed consent by the participants and the establishment of an institutional review board irb37 patients participating in trials must sign written informed consent form explaining to the extent possible all of the potential risks about the study the irb made up of patients advocates healthcare professionals and nonprofessionals must oversee the trial permit it to begin and stop the trial if necessary

the phases are substantial and are usually borne by the drug companies the costs include organizing and running the trials done by physicians data verification analysis and support personnel as well as payments to physicians and nurses caring for participants they do not include the cost of capital which as noted below is usually included when calculating total pharmaceutical rd costs and is substantial because of the cost of these trials pharmaceutical companies will almost always limit the drugs tested to those that have the potential for large markets38 upon completio n of phase iii trials if the results prove positive new drug appr oval application nda is filed with the food and drug administration requesting approval to market the drug39 this application must contain description of the drug chemistry manufacturing processes labeling instructions for use of the drug preclinical pharmacology and toxicology pharmacokinetics drug action in the body and bioavailability in humans and data and analysis from the clinical trials supporting information includes description of clinical safety patient information and other relevant information these applications are quite extensive ranging up to several tensofthousands of pages in length40 if approval is granted the drug can be marketed assessment of the drug however does not stop at that point even though phase iii trials consist of large numbe r of participants it is impractical to make them so large that all conceivable adverse reactions can be determined therefore postmarket surveillance must be carried out to determine if there are any safety concerns that did not show up during the clinical trials this activity usually does not use controlled studies as is the case for phase ii and phase iii trials but rather relies on observations of physicians prescribing the drug pharmaceutical companies are required to file adverse drug reaction adr reports with the fda on regular basis the marketing pharmaceutical company usually recruits physicians to monitor the actions of the drug on patients to whom it has been prescribed on occasion serious reactions show up that result in the drug being removed from the market such as was the case with the diabetes drug rezulin which caused the deaths of several people taking the drug41 it is also possible that fda as condition of marketing approval may require firm to carry out study to obtain more safety information after the drug is on the market as noted above such is the case for preapproval trials that are based on surrogate endpoints if such study involves clinical trial it is labeled as phase iv trial it is also possible that new uses indications for the drug will be found during the phase iv

to complete the process drug development time the cost of rd to bring drug to market and the allocation of costs among the various components of the drug development cycle development time as indicated above the time it takes to go from the start of the drug discovery phase to the successful marketing of drug is typically several years in addition there is substantial attrition of drug candidates along the way figure 1 adapted from the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma 2000 industry profile shows both of these characteristics42 the figure shows that the entire process takes on average about 15 years to marketing approval with the clinical trials phase taking up about 7 years or 47 of the time furthermore total drug development time has lengthened over the past 40 years43 in the 1960s the average development time to approval from the onset of drug discovery first synthesis of drug candidate for initial laboratory screening was about 81 years in the 1970s the average time was 11 years in the 1980s it was 142 years and in the early 1990s it had grown to about 149 years the attrition rate of drug candidates is also evident in the figure which

gene and drug discovery drug discovery today 5 april 2000 1365000 to 10000 candidates were initially considered of course nearly all of those candidates were eliminated by the time clinical trials commenced the length of the process has resulted in substantial effort over the years of trying to reduce the time taken for the various stages for example the chart shows that the average time for fda approval is about two years the average period for approval has dropped significantly in recent years going from about 30 months in 1990 to about 126 months in 199944 sharp drop occurred from 1993 to 1994 and again from 1997 to 1998 the former was result of the prescription drug user fee act of 1993 which provided fda with funds to hire several hundred additional examiners the latter coincides with the year the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 took effect nevertheless the approval period remains relatively short about 15 of the entire process and the declines in recent years have not stopped the trend toward longer drug development cycle the lengthy period for clinical trials has made them major target for acceleration as well there has been some progress on that front as the average length of trials has dropped from 72 years for those underway during the 1993 to 1995 period to 59 years for those underway during the 1996 to 1998 period45 nevertheless the need to obtain detailed information about potential side effects and the requirements for unambiguous results on an investigational drugs effectiveness mean that trials are likely to continue to require substantial periods of time several years for the foreseeable future the other major contributor to development time is the preclinical phase consisting of drug discovery and preclinical testing how long drug discovery takes of course depends on how many compounds must be screened to come up with attractive drug candidates if candidate is discovered early in the process the period can be considerably shortened that is the basic reason for the wide range estimated for drug discovery 2 to 10 years given in the above chart drug discovery now is largely rational systematic process compared to the trial and error approach that was dominant few decades ago see above although the number of candidates that must be screened has not greatly changed indeed with the growing application of combinational chemistry the number of candidates screened has probably grown the bottleneck in drug discovery is not finding promising candidates ie those that bind with the targets but selecting those candidates that are also likely to become successful drugs46 drug researchers however hope that recent advances in biotechnology will result in substantial decrease in time required for drug discovery biotechnology appears to be providing way to accelerate and systematize the research process athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs15 47phrma industry profile 2000 913 48ken howard the

production on large scale of replacement human proteins eg insulin for diabetes treatment and erythropoietin for cancer treatment and elimination of contamination resulting from the use of human or animal raw material sources for drug chemicals the science of genomics the study of the human genome facilitates the investigation of the underlying genetic cause of diseases and how drugs work this approach opens up the possibilit of developing theoretical frameworks to identify therapies technologies emerging from genomics might be able to provide ways to systematically produce and test new molecules that are candidate drugs one such process already in use is the comparison of dna sequenced from diseased tissue with those in dna databases48 if match is found and the protein expression characteristics of the dna in the database are known it may be possible to determine the proteins encoded by the diseased sample if so drug target identification can be significantly facilitated with consequent reduction in drug discovery time such comparisons are made possible by the field of bioinformatics which applies advanced computer systems and technology to biology eventually it is likely to be possible to extend bioinformatics to play major role in identification of drug candidates such computeraided design processes have already been put to use and played critical role in developing aids drugs the hiv protease the enzyme used by the virus to make proteins needed to infect cells was modeled in this way and led to the proteas inhibitor49 full realization of this step toward computeraided design of drugs is likely to be facilita ted by identifying and determining the properties of all the proteins expressed by the human genome this operation called proteomics involves both the identification of the protein and determination of its physical structure50 finally gene therapy the replacement of errors in the genetic code to prevent the expression faulty proteins or to ensure the expression of needed proteins is being examined as potential way to prevent the onset of genetically caused disease in the first place because thousands of diseases are completely or primarily the result of genetic defects such methods could prove to be very important for future drug development advances in molecular biology also give promise to reducing the cost and duration of clinical trials there is hope that the emerging field of pharmacogenomics or pharmacogenetics understanding the genetic basis for differing drug response will result in the development of drugs that will be more effective and have fewer adverse side effects than current drugs basically this process uses the genetic profile of an individual affected by disease to predict the response of that person to given medicine researchers hope that such predictions can remove much of the uncertainty that now exists about whether drug will work as result faster and more

1956clinical trials for new drug therapies should be possible leading to more rapid drug approval51 finally drugs could be designed that are tailored to an individual52 in that last case of course the clinical trials would be meaningless if drug development does reach this level of sophistication different drug approval processes will be required while there is much promise in these advances there are numerous and difficult challenges to surmount if they are to be widely applied to drug development the mapping of the human genome while substantial achievement is only one step the targets of drugs proteins remain to be understood and surveyed in way that will facilitate the search for new drug candidates53 the enterprise of proteomics will be long and costly and is just now getting underway54 because protein structures are very complicated and are an essential feature in determining proteins function such surveys require threedimensional image of the protein structu ral genomics obtaining these images requires the use of complex xray crystallography as noted above only about 500 drug targets have currently been identified very small fraction of all of proteins in the body while not all proteins will end up as drug targets some estimates are that the human genome map will eventually yield up to 10000 new targets55 another challenge is that the proteins most important for drug design eg membrane proteins that control input to cell appear to be those most difficult to survey because of difficulties in determining their structure56 identification of drug targets of course is only part of the battle drug candidates must be discovered that bind to the target identifying such candidates require experimental procedur that are still very complex and subject to many failures furthermore while particular molecule might bind with given drug target and result in apparent therapeutic action that is guarantee that it will be successful as drug doses at toxic levels may be required to achieve the desired results in other cases the investigatory drug molecule may bind to other proteins resulting in unwanted side effects in addition it is too soon to tell just how effective the genetic advances will be in shortening the time required for clinical trials the response of an individual to drug is very complex and it is likely to take some time before researchers regulators and consumers will accept more specific shorter trials to prove drug safety and efficacy nevertheless recent advances are substantial and hold out much hope for dramatically improved

the cost of developing typical drug pharmaceutical rd is not well established one source cites costs for rd for successful drug of about 116 million in 1976 about 287 million in 1987 about 359 million in 1990 and about 500 million in 199657 all are in 1990 dollars the 1990 figure was obtained from study carried out by the office of technology assessment and is the cost estimated before taxes58 the most recent figure is an estimate provided by phrma and is based on drugs introdu ced in 199059 these estimates are before taxes and cover both successful and unsuccessful drug development attempts also important is how rd costs are allocated among the various components of the rd process the chart shown in figure 2 based on data from phrma provides graphical display of how those costs are allocated60 it is clear from the chart that clinical trials consume the major share of the costs about 283 for phases i through iii and an additional 58 for phase iv in addition the actual drug discovery phase synthesis and extraction and biological screening requires about 271 general cost issues major importance of the cost of pharmaceutical rd lies in the claim made by the industry that prescription drug prices in the united states are justified by the high cost of developing new drugs as consequence any debate about those prices usually includes debate about the costs of doing

the wall street journal november 9 1993 b1 65ibid b5rd while it is beyond the scope of this report to present detailed analysis of those costs few points can be made about them that may be important for any debate over costs first there have not been many detailed studies of the costs done by disinterested groups the last such study was the ota effort which was completed in 1993 data used for that study were obtained on drugs developed during the1980s61 results have been reported on drugs developed in the last 10 years that might have benefitted significantly from the recent advances in molecular biology second the calculation of those pharmaceutical rd costs that have been reported all contain factor accounting for the cost of capital62 this cost element accounts for the opportunity cost of money invested in the rd process in other words the funds used for rd could have been used for other investments opportunities that will yield return those lost opportunities are accounted for by including the forgone returns as part of the cost of performing rd including such costs is standard accounting practice used by all of industry in computing rd costs in the ota estimate opportunity costs constitute about 65 of the total rd cost for typical drug the key element in calculating the foregone returns is the cost of capital which is determined by the discount rate assumed change of few percentage points in that rate can make substantial difference in the total rd cost63 while most analysts agree with the inclusion of opportunity costs there is dispute over the size of the discount rate assumed industry officials generally agreed with the rates used by ota but some critics argued they were too high64 third there is disagreement about whether pretax or aftertax costs are the more appropriate figure for pharmaceutical rd costs65 for the ota study the aftert ax estimate is 194 million compared to the pretax estimate of 359 million this difference is substantial it should be noted however that the marginal tax rate used in the ota study 46 has since been reduced to 34 as result the pretaxafter tax differences calculated on current pharmaceutical rd costs would be considerably smaller than in the ota case but still large on the other hand thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs19 66congressional research service the research and experimentation tax credit

experimentation tax credit66 or any tax credits available for orphan drug development67 fourth consideration is whether the sales of successful drugs cover pharmaceutical rd costs according to the industry 1994 study found that only three out of ten pharmaceuticals introduced from 1980 to 1984 had enough sales to cover average rd costs per drug68 those sales however were sufficient to cover the industrys total rd costs in fact the ota study found that the internal rate of return irr for the entire pharmaceutical industry from 1976 to 1987 exceeded the returns to other firms by about two to three percentage points69 this irr differs from the standard accounting return on assets that are usually reported in publically available statements from individual firms70 comparison of the return on assets for the same companies for which the ota irr comparison was made showed that pharmaceutical companies outperformed other firms by four to six percentage points over the 1976 to 1988 period while there has been more recent study of irr comparison data on return on assets from 1995 through 1999 continues to show that pharmaceuticals as group outpaces all other industry groups and in nearly all cases the margin is greater than two percentage points71 it should be noted that the pharmaceutical industry genera lly contends that return on assets overstates the industrys profitability because drug patents are not counted as assets in standa rd accounting practices used to determine this measure contribution of federal rd funding another point of discussion is the contribution of federallyfunded biomedic research to pharmaceutical development72 nearly all of that research is supported by the national institutes of health nih73 in fy2001 nihs total budget was 2031 billion about 60 of which goes for basic biomedical research and most of the remainder for clinical research nih basic research focuses on the biological chemical and molecular understanding of disease drug

under these circumstances would likely mean that fewer new drugs would be developed 81zivan understanding clinical trials 75result from discoveries made by nihfunded research74 while in some instances testing of actual drug candidates may be funded by nih75 in most cases it is the knowledge of the disease mechani sms gained from the nihfunded research that allows pharmaceutical companies to proceed with drug discovery76 it is common for the pharmaceutical industry to develop drugs from scientific discoveries made by researchers supported by the nih77 in addition over the last 20 years congress has enacted number of laws to enable cooperative research arrangements between industry and government in order to facilitate the commercial application of knowledge discovered through federallyfunded research78 these laws have been particularly successful in the areas of biomedical research79 it seems clear that the pharmaceutical rd cost estimates reported above understate the true cost by not including federally funded rd that contributed to the ultimate development of the drug that is if the pharmaceutical industry had to pay for all of the basic research now funded by nih it is likely that the average cost of rd to bring drug to market would increase perhaps substa ntially80 while the industry does fund significant amount of basic research most of its rd funding is directed at drug discovery and development and clinical trials estimates of the contribution of nihfunded research to pharmaceutical rd costs are usually not attempted because of the great difficulty of assigning basic research costs to specific innovations there is generally not direct linear relationship between basic research and specific innovations but rather the connections are quite complex for the nihfunded research that is focused on specific drug development the allocation of costs is less difficult but still uncertain the ota study estimated that about 14 of preclinical pharmaceutical rd in 1988 was funded by nih nih also funds clinical research as noted above although most of that support is usually reserved for highrisk therapies not likely to yield high profits and that would be of limited benefit to the industry81 certain fraction of nih clinical trial funds does directly support pharmaceuticals however and ota estimated that about 11 of all pharmaceutical rd funds allocated to clinical trials in 1988 came from nih httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs21 82cockburn publicly funded science 18these figures suggest that the cost of pharmaceutical rd to the industry for typical drug would increase significantly if it had to absorb all of the costs that now directly support drug development but which are funded by nih it would likely be an even greater increase if the costs of all of the contributing basic research now funded by nih could somehow be allocated to drug development the outcome of such situation could be noticeable increase in the price of an average drug to the extent those prices cover rd costs furthermore to the extent the total industry expenditures on rd did not grow the number of new drugs developed would likely decrease therefore one could argue that federal funding of biomedical research is helping to keep drug prices down this possibility is indirectly raised by analysis that puts the rate of return to the industry of public biomedical research funding at 3082 this benefit appears substantial but that is guarantee that another allocation of public and private rd resources eg the pharmaceutical industry supporting all biomedical research could not produce higher return while it is not the purpose of this report to present an analysis of this issue it is worthwhile to present some considerations important to that analysis if industry had to fund the basic research that contributes to drug development that is now funded by nih it probably would not support all of the research now funded by nih industry would very likely restrict funding to that it believed most relevant to pharmaceutical development and total national spending on biomedical rd public and private sectors would be less than is now the case in this hypothetical situation where industry would absorb all basic biomedical research costs needed for drug development the cost of rd to develop typical drug would increase from current estimates because total spending on basic biomedic research would be lower than is currently the case however the return on that investment in terms of pharmaceuticals produced would be higher than current estimates provided change in output discovery and marketing of new pharmaceuticals occurred whether productivity could remain the same under this scenario would depend primarily on the pharmaceutical industry being able to select just the basic research now funded by nih needed to maintain industry productivity as discussed above such research includes both basic research that is directly related to drug development and basic research that advances general biomedical knowledge important for drug discovery it is very unlikely that the industry would be able to make such selection given the uncertain nature of basic research in addition it is possible in this hypothetical situation that important knowledge that would be essential to the advances of biomedicine in the more distant future 10 to 20 years would not be forthcoming because the research had not been done another concern about this scenario is what happens to the basic research results it is unlikely that firm would be willing to make these results widely available if it believed they were important for its economic future as result researchers outside that firm would not have access to new biomedical knowledge that may be critical to other advances in medicine with consequent loss to the public also even though the economic benefit from nih research quoted above appears substantial that is guarantee that the public is adequately compensated forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs22 83crs federal rd drug discovery and pricing 1819 84the orphan drug act see footnote 67 provides incentives to pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop drugs for diseases that afflict 200000 people or fewer and may not otherwise generate sufficient returns to justify the necessary rdthe subsidy that federally funded biomedical rd provides to the industry there are other factors that must be accounted for to assess that issue thoroughly83 implications of biomedica l advances the high and apparently growing cost of pharmaceutical rd puts premium on any advances that will slow that growth or even reduce costs shorter drug development time would mean smaller direct outlays for rd furthermore because the opportunity costs described above accumulate on an annual basis shorter development time would mean that this contribution to pharmaceutical rd costs would decline as well the biomedical advances discussed above in the section on drug development time if successful offer that opportunity cost mitigation would be especially true if those advances allowe d significant decrease in the time required for the clinical trials which are the biggest single component of the cost of drug development reduced pharmaceutical rd costs for typic drug could in turn have at least two advantages first it is possible that lower pharmaceutical prices will result second drug compan ies may be more willing to undertake research on drugs that have more limited market that is on drugs that attack diseases that afflict only relatively small number of people now such research is generally limited because the companies cannot expect to recover their rd costs with sales of those drugs84 if shorter development times significantly reduce such costs the prospect of being able to recover costs from more limitedmarket drug should increase coupled with the increase in precision in targeting diseases that is promised by these new techniques research on such drugs could expand another benefit of shorter development time would likely be greater total revenues to the firm patenting the drug because less of the patent period would be taken up by drug development it is possible that such an occurrence could also lower drug prices because the firm would have more time to make return on its drug development investment there are factors however that may limit the extent to which application of these biomedical advances can result in lower drug development costs first as noted above there is uncertainty about how well these advances will translate into more effective drug development with shorter development times second application of these techniques is likely to require very large initial investments in equipment and facilities the genetic profile process for example requires complex and extensive robotic systems that are not typically found in conventional drug discovery processes nevertheless to the extent these new drug development techniques are successful the promise of lower drug rd costs and more specific drugs appears real congressional concerns there are several issues associated with drug development pharmaceutical rd that may be of interest to congress three of the more important issues concern the cost of pharmaceutical rd and its relation to prescription drug priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs23 85service structural genomics 1954the role of federally funded rd primarily nih in pharmaceutical development and federal oversight of the drug development process drug development costs the options open to congress to affect the cost of pharmaceutical rd appear to be limited it has taken steps as noted above to shorten the time of drug approval further shortening may not be acceptable to congress or the public however and is not likely to affect costs very much while the rest of the development cycle remains as long as is now the case congress has also granted general research and experimentation tax credit as well as specific rd tax credit for the development of orphan drugs as argued above however significant changes in those costs will probably require major advances in drug discovery that also permit much shorter clinical trial periods these advances will be almost solely dependent on progress in science and technology if dramatic shortening of clinical trials appears scientifically feasible however drug approval regulations may have to be modified in order to accommodate those new conditions federal biomedical rd funding one area where congressional action may significantly affect pharmaceutical rd costs in the longerrun is through federal biomedical rd funding congress has provided nih with substantial yeartoyear increases in its budget from fy1998 to fy2001 the budget has grown from 136 billion to 203 billion 49 increase for fy2002 the administration is requesting 231 billion 138 increase over the current fiscal year it is on track to double by 2003 to level of about 27 billion although it is not certain that doubling will happen by that time the primary reason for this increase is to accelerate the push towards the development of effective therapies for the major diseases afflicting humankind as noted above there appears to be little overlap between the rd funded by nih and that funded by the pharmaceutical industry furthermore the research sponsored and performed by nih appears to be quite important to the industry as nih funding grows however there is the possibility that greater portion of it will be used in areas that are also being funded by the pharmaceutical industry including biotechnology firms this is true of the human genome project and is likely to be true of much of the followup work in particular both nih and the industry are funding work in structural genomics85 which is an essential part of proteomics the next step beyond mapping the human genome nih is funding pilot centers to develop methods of determining the structure of proteins while industry has several projects underway because knowledge of protein structures is critical to drug discovery it seems clear that it is important for industry to fund it that does not imply that nih should not fund any research in structural genomics knowledge of protein structures is also important for the understanding of fundamental biological processes but caution is needed to avoid unproductive duplication it should be noted that the synergy between federal and private funding of the human genome project has probably accelerated completion of that effort related issue concerns ownership of the information generated by both public and private funding the debate over whether human genome data

in the case of the genome because protein structure data is likely to be even more important to the pharmaceutical industry than genome data however data ownership issues may become more serious if conflicts do emerge nih may end up duplicating much of the industry work to ensure broad public access congressional oversight of situations where both the industry and nih independently pursue research related to drug development may be heightened clinical trial practice while congress has direct oversight of clinical trials supported by nih congressional authority over trials supported by the pharmaceutical companies is more tenuou s and indirect it is primarily through its oversight of the fda which as noted has oversi ght and some regulatory responsibility over privately run clinical trials aside from the possibility of major changes in clinical trial practice resulting from scientific advances there are some aspects of current practices that congress may wish to examine two such topics are patient protection and conflict of interest while neither is likely to affect the length of time that clinical trials now take they could have significant effect on the quality and safety of such trials the death in september 1999 of patient undergoing an experimental gene therapy treatment at the university of pennsylvania has highlighted the possible dangers of participation in clinical research86 while trials are overseen by an institutional review board and individuals must sign informed consent statements prior to participation in trial there are concerns that adequate protection for patient safety is not always present such protection is essential if trials are to continue to secure the numbers of patients needed to adequately test drug candidates currently the department of health and human services with the establishment of the office of human research protection is significantly expanding its efforts in this area87 recently concern about conflict of interest on the part of physicianresearchers involved in clinical trials has grown88 the potential for conflict is result of growing number of academic researchers being involved in research funded by

of potential conflicts of interest up the individual institutions and there is considerable variation among those institutions93 some argue that certain kinds of financial ties between academic researchers and the pharmaceutical industry should be prohibited altogether94 others argue that such ties do not need to be banned but better job of managi ng financial conflicts of interest is needed

institutions in addition the contract research organizations cros are only addressed to the extent academic researchers are involved in the trials managed by the cros it appears therefore that monitoring of both university and cro efforts will be important to ensure that public confidence in clinical trials and in the academic biomedical research community does not suffer conclusions the debate about whether to include prescription drug benefits in medicare has raised the visibility of pharmaceutical rd as noted in this report pharmaceutical rd is complex costly and timeconsuming process it is also noted however that advances in molecular biology in recent years hold the promise of dramatically changing the way pharmaceutical rd is carried out these changes could shorten substantially the time it takes to bring drug to market from initial research and therefore significantly affect the cost of drug development how fast such changes may come about however could depend heavily on further research in molecular biology and the mechanisms of disease congress has strongly supported biomedical research in recent years and there are calls for continuing to make it high priority in addition to biomedical research funding levels and priorities issues related to human subject protection and conflict of interest are likely to affect the evolution of pharmaceutical rd and therefore its costshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs27 99drews drug discovery historical perspective 1960 100landau etal pharmaceutical innovation revolutionizing human health 3940 101drews drug

history of pharmaceutical research and development although substances have been used to treat disease for centuries systematic pharmaceutical research did not begin until the late 19th century when chemistry had reached the point where its principles could be applied to medical problems and pharmacology became scientific discipline major linkage occurred in the chemical dye industry when it was discovered that certain dyes have chemical affinity for biological materials german scientist paul ehrlich 18541915 pioneer in pharmaceutical research determined that this chemoreceptor property would be different for certain organisms such as parasites and cancer cells than the host tissue and this difference allowed the develo pment of chemicals that could be used for therapeutic purposes99 he based this observation on experiments in which he synthesized large number of compounds and testing each for its ability to destroy the organism without being toxic to the host the basis for this process was ehrlichs observation that certain chemicals would selectively attach themselves to proteins100 at the same time developmen ts in chemistry permitted the isolation of active chemicals from plants that showed medicinal benefits this was followed by efforts to standardize drug preparations medicinal chemistry also developed when it was discovered that coaltar could be used to create synthetic drugs in addition the science of pharmacology the measurement and testing of the effectiveness of drugs was being developed these developments all combined to provide the impetus for the creation from 1880 to about 1930 of the modern pharmaceutical industry the discovery of penicillin in 1929 led to the discovery of other antibiotics using the science of microbiology the concepts of enzymes and receptors arising from the study of biochemistry began to play role in drug discovery when they were found to be good targets for drug research an important discovery was that receptors serve as switches to generate or receive signals to the cell and that these receptors could be either blocked or turned on by chemicals101 during world war ii the demand for penicillin and other antibiotics allowed the drug companies to develop the infrastructure and organization to undertake major rd efforts after the war drug research accelerated because of the numerous opportunities and the large profits new drugs generated102 drug discovery however was still largely trial and error process that is compounds were tried that were obtaine d somewhat haphazardly from libraries of molecules available to drug researchers those libraries were built up over the yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30913crs28 103landau etal pharmaceutical innovation 9192 104this action resulted from

thought that the compounds many of which were obtained from natural substances might have some therapeutic value in the 1960s and 1970s advances in both life science research and chemistry greatly improved the drug research process making it less random103 the focus of the life science research was the physiology of the cell which allowed for design of specific drugs and greater understanding of how drugs worked than had been discovered through trial and error in particular as knowledge grew drugs could be designed to inhibit welldefined proteins also once the actions of certain drugs were understood that knowledge was often used for greater understanding of the underlying disease and in turn the design of new drugs advances in chemistry permitted systematic generation and testing of chemical compounds combina tional chemistry as candidate drugs the advances in both fields combined to make the drug discovery process more rational the 1960s also saw the development of the modern process for getting drug to market beginning in 1938 drugs were required by the federal government to prove that they were safe104 it was not until the thalidomide episodes in the late 1950s however that the requirement for clinical evidence was established to gain approval to market new drug the kefauverharris amendments passed by congress in 1962 required proofofefficacy and gave the fda regulatory control over the necessary clinical trials105 at that time the presentday process of elaborate clinical trials was established for determining the efficacy of candidate drugs advances in molecular biology and biotechnology in the 1970s and 1980s have also contributed to drug research106 biotechno logy was first applied to drug development by bringing about dramatic increases in the production of certain drugs such as insulin whose efficacy was already established biotechnology was also used to enhance the search for new drugs as molecular biology progressed these two paths merged so that medical biotechnology is now primarily focused on the search for new drugs such as protease inhibitors used to treat aids which must be produced by genetic engineering techniques drug research over the last 120 years has evolved from trial and error method where many compounds were tried for their potential therapeutic value with only little understanding of how they might work to much more rational approach that is based on large body of knowledge about the origin of disease and workin gs of pharmaceuticals currently drug discovery makes use of many disciplines including chemistry pharm acology microbiology and biochemistry sources for candidate drugs still include natural substances such drugs are called biologics as well as synthetic molecules created by chemical or biotechnology processes
