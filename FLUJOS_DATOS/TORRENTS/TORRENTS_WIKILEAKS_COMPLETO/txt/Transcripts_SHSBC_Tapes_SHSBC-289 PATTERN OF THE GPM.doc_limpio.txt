pattern of the gpm lecture given on 30 april 1963 thank you all right this is the 30th of april ad 13 saint hill special briefing course now we had record last week we had record last week we had ai think there were more than this but they werent checked out in the week so we didnt count them but we had dozen goals found last week dozen so lets give them hand huh well i had an awful lot of trouble keeping my shoes on its very hard for to keep my shoes on because people keep walking on my heels and slipping them off and this has beenthis has been technically quite rat race because its been necessary for to takeoh i dont knowi was telling suzie this morning my customary attitude toward this thing is take about thousand years and go down on desert island you know and figure it all out but due to the various stresses and strains involved with it that hasnt been possible so it had to be condensed into few weeks and the pattern of the gpmthats been pure slaughter because trying to find this pattern has beenwell its not only difficult to find the pattern but you actually have to hunt and punch through bank to make sure that the pattern is in agreement bank to bank and you havent got any time to run the banks so therefore you have to pick up an early enough bank you see so as to tip the charge off later banks you see and look it all over and that leaves your case in horrible condition let assure you and you go back fifteen goals with fully run goals ahead of those fifteen goals and its slaughter well i dont mean to put up the poor victim to you or even tell you you must appreciate the information all im saying is that its been flat out proposition and we do have the information and that pattern of the bank which you have nowits horrified in the pastbut we continued to get new items and i figured well some of these are certainly lock items on the items weve already gotten so it was necessary to shake them all outwhat were the actual items in the pattern of gpm and were all those items present in gpm its all shaken out now except little band which wont disturb you since its an easy band to find anything in on the level in your bulletin there have game and theres little place where i drew wiggly lines across and said there might be some items in there well its kind of mysterious why the noun of the gpm top noun or action or conditional form final achievement of the goal is what it is its sort of mysterious that that declines completely youve got that completely declined and then you go into the ivities and so forth for it and then you get the goal as an oppterm and well you dont think these things are hard to find man i must have gone across eight banks withoutand i said someplace the goal becomes an oppterm i know it and i thought it might be at the top and it might be in the middle but at someplace the goal became an oppterm it was just in the cards that this would be true and by george it wasnt till i was about fifteen banks back that i finally found the goal as an oppterm wow and there it sits its right in that position exactly well now your goal declines through those same fortunately it repeats its patternand it declines totally all the way down and then goes into the ivities it declinesi mean it goes through absolute and perfect and so forth then it goes down into the ivities and then the end of the goal suddenly takes over after you getyouve gotten down there youve got the end of the goal like to catch catfish youve now got catch catfish you see so youve got catching catfish and mysteriously the end of the goal doesnt decline and i havent been able to find any place it declines it simply goes through itsthe forms which you see there on the have game plot thats mysterious why does it do this but it doesnt decline anything i can find at this particular time but ive got lot of banks to run ive got to clean up all these banks now that ive been through and on my actual auditing time i figure out this will only take twentyfive hundred hours of auditing to do this because each item will have to be cleaned up now and this brings clearthis brings you at least onegoal clear you see some time in the next few weeks and it brings clear in 1973 you see so just be kind to in the meanwhile and dont make snide remarks about it because the worst that happens on this sort of thing is body weight starts knocking you around the front of your body takes beating and at times i thought the machinery of the body was going to cave in on some of this none of that happens in the type of auditing which youre doing at this particular time its the residue the uncleared items and that sort of thing banging into the body which increases body weight people will ask you about this and you occasionally banging into goal unable to get its top oppterm unwilling to spend the next two or three months of auditing just to get this characters top opptermyoure perfectly at liberty to cut into it someplace when the goal is an oppterm and just force that blocked charge off and then force the lower blocked charge off and you know take the bottom of the goal off and then go back and find it because itll now be in view you see the strategy involved with it but if you do this why you will be aware of the fact that your pcs body mass will increase because youve got all that top bank and it settles down on the body it wasnt part of the bodys weight up to the time when it was restimulated and pulled in on the body you see but now it is so that adds some body mass and when you clean it up the body mass will go away see this is one of the oldest findings in the field of havingness and in the field of livingness and this goes back i think to 1950well certainly certainly 54 1 remember it in 54on the subject of making mock ups and pushing them into the body and increasing the bodys weight and then taking and throwing them away and decreasing the bodys weightso that somebody or something was busy and this was used as proof of the existence of thetan rather than theand using the fact that the thetan did have something to do with the construction of mass and the creation of mass and that sort of thingwhat was the source of energy and mass all of that was used by the way in confirmation of the early axioms and that was all axiomatic theoretical work well here we are facing the same principles again that if you dont clean up an ri before leaving it you have residual mass and that residual mass tends to add itself to the body and the body tends to increase in weight and when you have run this out the body then decreases in weight you can almost control the bodys weight with ris itd depend on how thoroughly you handle the situation well anyway that isnt too much the point involved here the point i am making is that the upper masses or any gpm uncleared masses tend to add themselves to the bodys mass because they arethey pin down against the body more thoroughly than they have been and you see here was thetan and hes just been dragging these old tin cans and chains around but if you dont thoroughly clean the thing up why the old tin cans and chains get added onto the bodys mass and it will register on the bathroom scales were not talking about any esoteric mass were just talking about what weighs on scale its as easy as that and you see the stuff youre handling is finite mass just as much as that crayon is mass you see its nothing mental mass is different than physical mass well itsthe only difference is its thinner its less massy and thats about all and somebody here the other day every once in while on the backtrack theyd sayin dianetics scientologyid mentioned something about mass and somebodyd say well i part company with hubbard at that point you know on mass seeing mass and that sort of thing who can see mass and lot of people couldnt see mass in fact i think the bulk of people couldnt see mass and we had somebody here in z unit the other day and all of sudden few ris down bank and all of sudden hey you know there it is you know that isnt all the mass that shows up sometimes very interesting things show up like complete spaceship or steam engine complete with wheels and so forth its solid enough that you feel that you could reach over and kick it and it would clang that isnt gpm thats exterior to gpm or has gotten mixed up in gpm gpm mass is normally steel shelllooks like steel shellor is sphere of some kind or another covered with black or gray cloud the mass on halfdischarged bank looks like gray cotton wool mass thats been black will turn into gray cotton wool sort of look and it has finite finite dimensions it isnt something thats esoterically million miles from here or something like that its seventyfive feet long and twenty five feet wide and you could practically tape measure it and its actual mass and the funny thing is sometimes you get wrong item youll throw mass into restim for the pc and he all of sudden is sitting there looking at black mass that wasnt there moment ago and its one of the tests of whether its right item or notis how much mass did it turn on ive used that great deal in research something didnt turn on mass something did turn on mass something turned on mass at all well it was the one that turned on little bit of mass the way the thing turned out it turned on tiny bit of mass and those that were very comfortable and turned on mass at all didnt turn out to be the item they were outside the perimeter of the thing and this mass isalternates youve got black bank and gray bank and black bank and gray bank as you look on down the track some of them black some of them gray you might say theyre positivenegative charges and theyre all stretched out they look like block islands of mass and black bank when discharged turns gray andthat is partially discharged itll turn grayits still got couple of dozen items scattered through it that you havent got something like that itll turn dirty brown thats one of the weirdest shades its sort of blyyaaah urky orrible mustard brown and it looks very floppy and so forth and you pull couple of more pins and that starts unraveling and you pull couple of more items you can see these things start to shake to pieces and diminish and so forth as they are run and its very funny to stand off and look at bank that you have just partially run lets say its two thirds of the itemsor even less than that half of the items are out of the thing and watch the bank start to shake and start going to pieces its trying to go to pieces and it goes zzzuuuuu and it shakes and the corners shake and it shivers and it sort of folds up and gets smaller and shivers some more and it cant quite make it you see because its still got an awful lot of items in it but taking chargeits almost geometric i wouldnt say that it is geometric in its progression but the first items off take proportionately more charge off than the next items off and then these take proportionately more charge off than the next items off and if youre going down the bank toward the bottom of the bank when you get into the lower areas about the only dangerous thing you can do is leave any of those lower ris alive and walk off and leave the bank you can leave the upper ones alive and it wont kill the pc see that just squashes him and puts him in the wine press and gets him published one way or the other its uncomfortable its just physically uncomfortable to have these things left but you get down to the bottom of the bank and what holds the bank together are those bottom ris goal that one has an ri you see the goal to you know that one has an ri somebody or something with the goal to _________ and couple of those oppterms you walk off and you leave those things and man youve had it because that bank will stay stiff as poker you see these are the fundamental keystones on which that bank is built and its just thereits just there man and if you were to leave those on and go over the bank again the bank would get stiffer and by extrapolationi havent been able to take third time over bank with the bottom items in but apparently it would just go stiffer in other words it gets to point where itll charge up if it is still held in place at the bottom itll continue to discharge if you take the top off you can take lots of charge off the bank you see the top items are not very vital theyre just uncomfortable theyre upsetting theyre annoying pc keeps dragging them through the bank and they keep getting in his road and you get down in the lower third of the bank without the decline of perfect and absolute you know all that sort of stuff and those things will start flying back up to the top of the bank youve dragged them all the way to the bottom of the bank you see and youll say one of those lower oppterms you seevery low opptermsand all of sudden why one of these things will go bzzzzupp and youll sayyoull say to the auditor something silly lets say the top of the goal is catfish and youre trying to run off the decline of catching catfish you see and youll say an absolute catfishoh i meani meanuh uh catching big catfish im uh uh catching just catching catfish is what im trying to say in other words those top items are pulled down but if those bottom items are left in bank why just nothing discharges you get to point of return you could run items and run items and run items and run items and run items and run items and nothing charge is coming off the bank but the pc is getting more and more uncomfortable and the pressure is getting greater and greater and its becoming very upsetting indeed the keystonethe keystoneof the bank that keeps it in the channel is the lowest oppterm that is the real keystone of the bank that keeps it in channel with the other goals that is how that can be kept in because it is always mixture between the goal youre running and the next earlier goal on the track and its crossthat bottom oppterm is cross between those two goals you see lets say to knowit wouldnt beis the lower goal to to catch catfish see all right so that one in the bank to catch catfish that gpm that bottom oppterm is knowing about catching catfish you see or something like that knowing about the nonexistence of catfish oritll be something weirdbut itll be cross between those two banks but i say thats keystone as far as the channel of goals is concerned thats goal one two three four thats how they keep in sequence that bottombottom oppterm but what keeps the bank stiff and what keeps the bank charged up is the goal and theres correction coming out on the plan of handling i got little more data on that and picked up this other data about the stiffening of the bank but you should run outthe only correction is that when you run down one of these banks you shouldnt keep going earlier you should go to present time well all thats okay but its what should you do about these bottom oppterms well you should run them and what should you do about the lowest goalthat goal as an riwhat should you do about that well thats an enormous question theres terrific amount of theory could go on about what you should do about it if you get the pc into the earlier goal he of course is going to be so interested in it that nothing will do but he runs it and the next thing you know youve got pc six goals from the present time goal you see and hes now going earlier and because youve got present time goals on top of it theyre going to follow him back just like the top of the bank is going to follow him back and any time he peels off some ris hes sitting there looking at black wall whats this black wall well thats just the top goals following him down see you take any goal out of the sequence of goals just at random and try to chop it out and as you run the top oppterms you run into the later goal on the track you see and as you hit the bottom youre going to run into the earlier goals on the track so what do you do about these bottom oppterms well youve certainly had better run them well how about thathow about that bottom oppterm you cant get that unless youve got the next goal well unfortunately or fortunately its not necessary to get it just have the pc string long bow at it and put anything that rrs and put it down see and adjust it when you come back down the track after having run to present time well what do you do about this goal as an ri actually i made an actual test after the release of the bulletin which opened my eyes i thought you could leave them on almost killed i thought you could leave it on you cant do it man you got to list that on what goal would it oppose or who or what would it oppose and have the pc put some goals on as an answer to the question and get yourself complete list by george dont leave that list incomplete go fifty beyond your last rr or rs just as though youre going right down there and find that goal see youre going to find that earlier goal even knowing that the pc is liable to cognite on it if he cognites on it god help you you see you cant let him run it you mustnt let him run it because youve got to come back up to pt on these banks not go earlier earlier earlier earlier earlier because he starts running into stuff that the devil himself couldnt handle you see and hes got all these upper banks that are going to follow him down so you cant let him go earlier and if he gets that goal and suddenly realizes what the goal is and that sort of thing just talk him out of it say thats all very interesting were awfully glad to have this goal to be game warden awfully glad to have this goal thats fine thats fine thank you very much make sure you complete the list even if he cognites on the goal because hell arc break you see if you dont complete list its true of any list all right do that ri goal as an ri oppose at the bottom and dont null the list just leave it as complete list pc will be perfectly happy and then go back up to the top of the first bank you run and find its goal with the opposite oppose and go on to pt but what do you do with that thats been one of the major problems this doesnt look like much of problem to you but it looks like bigits looked like big problem to because there are many chances that you take in even approaching the earlier bank at all and the main one is the pc is so interested the top oppterms pop up he even gives you the top oppterms maybe you look like youre running it see youre on your way and you say i have other choice to run it because you do have your hands on goal id say the temptation to run it is enormous and it just must not be done it just must not be done youve got to take him around and go on top of the bank and that list is always harder to do its more difficult to find the later goal than the earlier one and youve now got two live goals firing and for long time i didnt know if you could have two goals firing well ill let you in on something you can have fifteen goals firing all at the same time so dont worry about that that worried for quite while but i found out that it was one of these points one didnt have to worry about anyway this situationof what do you do with the bank and so onis all answered on the basis of what are you trying to do with pc well if youre trying to clear pc then you will audit the pc for the best auditing gains that you could obtain per unit of auditing time not the most you can do mechanically per unit of auditing time but the best gain you can get per unit of auditing time now it is true that it is totally mechanical proposition the more items you get off bank and the more banks you run the less charge there is and the more the pc can cognite that is true that is true there is nothing wrong with that at all but when running pc under special conditions that you yourself as scientologist recognize as special conditionsbut nobody else would youre running thetan in body and that just about ruins 90 percent of the things that you could do heroically you got body it has beating heart it has lung machinery its constructed its piece of electronic construction and it gets in the road and youre auditing bank with frail human body interposed between the bank and the pc now that is what has given trouble in research nothing else has given any trouble in research well all these little minor points come up and stew about them for little while and finally wrap them up and so forth but the restraint point comes under the thing that the universe is most concerned with on these planets and that is care of the bodycare of the body what are you going to do see because the pc is put into danger to this extent how are you going to continue to audit dead body and if youve got him halfway through bank hes sufficiently restimulated that hed probably have difficulty picking up new body do you see that its neat point now i dont intend any scientologist be caught with this one so if the body knocked off in the middle of running bank then hows this character going to function see hes all restimulated and so forth well hed undoubtedly bego key out and be better off eventually and so forth but he feels terribly betrayed because the hope factor is way up you see so therefore auditing is monitored as to what gains you can achieve in spite of the fact that the pc has body between himself and the bank now this is not esoteric this is not something weird this is simply very blunt very very blunt indeed there is body and there is the pc and there is the bank you see and what influences the pc tends to influence the body and what the pc throws into restimulation throws restimulation around the body and its geographical i mean the pcs bank extends around you the auditor to the left and right and back and front asprobably as youre sitting in the auditing chair the pcs bank is up there mile or two that is the total bankand back of him maybe half mile or something like this it may be that big its hardly any bigger than that but the bank that youre running is right in the room that youre auditing in and his bodys in that room and so forth now it isnt going to infect or influence your body dont worry about that you could worry about that far more than is justified but that bank remember is capable of influencing the body which is capable of influencing the emeter how do you think the bank charge gets through to the emeter well it gets through the pcs bodyhis handsto the electrodes to the wire to the meter see so you got closed circuit going on there well there are other closed circuits which exist in this too and the auditor is not much influenced with this bank this bank is physically connected up to the thetan that you are auditing and its not physically connected up to the auditor now what you do run into auditing in an uncleared situation is in trying to figure out the pcs bankyou you knucklehead will occasionally remember what you had there or what it might be in your goal ive only seen this happen once in being audited as pc all of sudden the auditor ducked like somebody had hit her over the head with sledgehammer see and tremendous somatic had practically taken off the side of her skull and we were having little difficulty trying to work out this scale you see and she had said to herselfi finally got this off and we continued on but she said to herself whatwhatwhat would there be at this level in my bank lets see there would be bang you see now an auditor could very easily believe an auditor could easily believe that he was being influenced by the pcs bank or that it was doing something weird to his bank but these are on quite different wavelengths and the collision factor there is so remote as to be totally neglectable but what does happen he gets restimulation because of his own think think and what he is doing and kicks his own bank into restimulation and he could make mistake and think that the pcs bank was knocking him around well the pcs bank could knock him around if he had an item being knocked around by the pcs bank but this physicalness of the bank is saved by thisand this is just guess guesstimate stuff theory not only can radio have onea certain wavelength you see but matter can have wavelength just stretch your imagination little bit further and theres practically an infinite number of potential wavelengths and the matter of the bank apparently exists you occasionally have met some human being that you have said soul mate see every once in blue moon you have suddenly run into somebody and have this feeling likevery great closeness and youve met them before and you knew them and so forth and all that sort of thing well youve probably got nearwavelength proposition you find also this person has the power of irritating you far beyond any other human beings power of irritating you or pleasing you far beyond the power of any other human being in pleasing you you see what youve done is probably get one of these closeclose tuneins of harmonics you havent even got the same wavelength you see and then theres the possibility that you knew the bloke before there are alwaysthat possibility exists it isnt often that you meet the people that you know and itsomesome trickier scientologist in the early days used to notice thisused to use this in order to get the sympathy and interest of girls this is one of their favorite tricks i used to talk them out of it if i possibly could i said i disliked having to procure girlfriends for them as well as clear them and so i thought it was too much but the pointthey would tell them well ive known you in earlier life dont you see and dont you remember something or other and naturally people having lived through all these periods get the period restimulated and all kinds of wild things can occur from that point on but thats crossrestimulation its just overtly restimulating somebodys bank it is true enough however thats thethats the insane harmonic of the true fact you see all things that are good have some harmonic way down below which is awful and this known you before is one of theseone of these perfectly true perfectly true that around you you have run into some people you have known before and thatsno doubt about this whatsoever and any person that you feel very closely drawn to concerned about terribly interested about and that sort of thing falls into either of these two either youve got close close wavelength harmonic going or youve known them before and this is you takes your money and pays your chance the thing is one or the other but maybe you knew them before because of the close harmonic of the banks you see so that also works out peopleyou get some real idiocies this becomes very unpopular very easily because some nut will ride it into the ground you know i cant get off my overt because life after life all ive done is kill ron you see and so forth and so on well i just havent been getting killed its patent lie you know all kinds of wild oddball things can be dreamed up in this and some true facts do exist however below the nonsense and you mustnt totally avoid them now you get people around who claim they are so affected by other peoples energy and masses and so drawn down by it that they just cant stand to confront or audit somebody or speak to people in group or something like that well you eventually will run this down to the fact theyre just dead seared see theyll have some ri saying they mustnt speak to the group you see or people steal their energy or something like this you know the actual phenomenon is not at fault its the restimulative factor which is at fault well all of this stuff is very well worth knowing youll run into it one way or the other but its questions you might be asking yourself about it now in handling bankthis is bankyou are associated with the problem of how you handle banks now lets pull this down in its most finite possible way youve got the problem of the thetan plus body plus bank see thats your problem as it walks up to you see thats thetan plus body plus bank and thats the whole shooting match that bank consists of free track that hasnt been drawn into the gpm it consists of all of the goals all of the gpms all of the locks all of the secondaries all of the engrams the wholetheall of the circuits everything there you see plus the body you see which is in the road of all this and then the thetan is also plus the physical universe and its present time problems and how often as an auditor have you found it necessary to handle pcs present time problem before you could audit the pc well so that gets added on too and you could go out by extrapolation and realize that you were in auditing one pc dont take this as anything but joke in auditing one pc you recognize clearly that you are auditing the whole physical universe and everything in it you see thats the reductio ad absurdum you feel like that sometimes some of these pcshow many ptps they can get well those are simply where the pc impinges it is very seldom necessary for the auditor to handle the environment of the pc but when you get into the field of the very neurotic psychotic families that surround the pcan insane pc and so forth you definitely are in position where you have to handle the environment well were not dealing in that particular sphere at this particular time and have intentions to do so at this particular time but some time later after thereve been some white flags raised over the center of the american medical association health education and welfare building and the congresswhich i think supports psychiatry totallyi think when they get few white flags raised up around there and allow free thought to exist again in the world you may find yourself with some of these problems they wont keep leaving it to the witch doctor believe if somebody can do something about it you see as the years roll along they wont completely neglect this forever were not in that business but it is factor which should be part of your technology you have to handle the environment in that is severely insane personyou have to get that person so he cant knock himself to pieces so that he can be audited this padded cell proposition you see and now lets take the body you know that if you try to audit severely ill pc or try to do much more than give an assist to make him feel happier you know that youre in trouble andthat is in trouble with the body and so forthand therefore you shouldnt go around using scientology to try to heal somebody well let him get well if he can give him an assist make him happier bring him up to present time do what you want to but dont bother to try to treat what is wrong with him that is well outside your province similarly in auditing him dont knock him around to point where the body comes in too muchfor too much of beatingit can stand quite beating i assure youbetween the thetan and the bank this again is factor which you have to take into consideration if you had thisthis person walks up to you and hes just thetan and bank and somehow or another you can get him on an emeter i assure you you could clear him much faster because you would handle him quite brutally you would just chase him down the track man youd pick up basicbasic and shake the bank out you know and then go back up to the beginning and knock out some of the goals and discharge everything that you could discharge and get your hands on and then come back up to present time run it all the way back from present time to the earliest bank and youd have an ot on your hands in other words you probably would proceed on some sort of an heroic basis like that its in the cards if he can run the first bank out right now of course youve taken the kingpin out of every other bank and therefore they run much easier and so forth well you cant do that with body around because at the time he accumulated the first bank he didnt have body and his adventures were far more strenuous than body can stand up to and the mental energy masses contained in those early banks do makemake allowance whatsoever for body this is why people get sick they get restimulations of banks that the body cant handle and it knocks them around most ghastly now you can make somebody quite ill by overtly chasing them down the track into early banks and badly handling them and its something that you must safeguard the pc from therefore you find what you can get your hands on and get him up to pt and run the pt banks back before youve gone too far you probably will be auditing thetan who is not interposing body between himself and the banks but if you run him back early early early early early you will have choice but to continue to interpose this body between the thetan and the bank so the body is an unwanted chip in most respects but you need it as an auditor in order to get something to hold on to the electrodes so regard it as useful adjunct and put up with its liabilities such as it gets hungry and it has to go to the bathroom and other things that get in the road of an auditor just thank the lord that you at least have something to hook the electrodes on and safeguard that to the degree of not interposing it into too savage situation now that doesnt require any adjudication on your part or any doingness on your part beyond this one thing stay with your standard procedures as they are developed because they contain these factors as an inherent part of auditing these are taken care of to that degree and theres sense in your beating somebody up just to find out what would happen because it will happen the point im making here is that you run what you get your hands on that can be run and run it well with minimum of stress on the body and we just dont care how much stress occurs on the pc thetans are indestructible so you just couldnt care less how much stress where that stress moves over into concern about the body the fact that the lungs arent breathing too well and the heart isnt beating too well and the skull feels like its about to have stroke well ware shoal now what can you do that would produce those things what can you do theres very definite things that you could do that would produce those conditions one is to fail to clear the bank you are working on but go dancing off to other banks because the fields were so green early or late go dancing off to other banks see fail to clear the bank you are working on the next one is refuse utterly to go earlier before youve gone later in other words run the banks closer to present time dont get persuaded into the backtrack banks another thing is try as far as possible to run bank from its extreme top to the bottom now another pointthat is completely aside from dont bypass items and that sort of thingthis is an adjunct to the last and modifies the last onedont keep auditing the pc over and over and over and over finding nothing and not discharging the bank because that is very hard so you see between the last two ive given you there is the medium situation that you could take huge slabs out of this bank and still discharge the bank in other words your auditing must not continuously idle around on one unfound item with lose after lose after lose for the pc hour after hour of hunt and punch see knock it off knock it off find something that can be found in this bank now of course we get down to the ordinary auditing precautions dont find wrong item dont run wrong goalmuch more important than bypassing an item or something do workmanlike job of auditing and then of course we get this oneand this will sound odd to youfollow the pattern your pc is not different your pc is not different your pc simply wont rocket read well at some portions of the gpm i had one last night on that last one that would amuse you greatly i had pc that said it was not impartial or noit was not incomparable but unconquerable and that argument was so succinct it was backed up by the fact that the only thing that was firing on the list was not incomparable but the thing that was firing on the list was unconquerable there was only one thing wrong with it every time unconquerable fired three or four other items also fired on the same list i just went by the rules of auditing and i got enough listing done and enough listing done and enough listing done and by god it turned out to be incomparable twenty minutes worth of random listing and seven pages of actual listing later it turned out to be incomparable so its just charge which prevents the right item from firing your pc isnt different your pc is simply too charged up to fire and you keep at it long enough and the pc will fire now although this is more or less general talk on handling pcs and so forth at the risk of overrunning this little bit i am going to im going to show you method of handling this which takes care of most everything ive been saying except handling the bankbanks you know run them forward and so forth which ive talked to you about now just as the pc has many goals and many banka finite number fortunately very small numberso he has many ris many ris in one gpm now instead of worrying about all the gpms there are to run while youre auditing this pc you should worry in this regard how well you clear up the ris you got your hands on just as if you halfran half the banks so if you halfrun half the ris in bank your pc sooner or later is going to feel queasy the monitoring factor here is audit what youve got your hands on youve got your hands on it well audit it now when i say audit it i mean audit the pc in front of you dont run routine 3 on pc audit the pc with routine 3 and that goes for every auditing skill that we have for instance i never sec check pc never been known to i audit the pc with sec checking see i dont find goals on pc i audit the pc with goals finding now if you keep that frame of reference youll win all the way but if you simply run routine 3 on the pc youre going to run yourself right off cliff someplace this is run the pc in front of you im not talking about fixating your attention on it but what is the running of routine 3 doing to your pc and what are you doing about it it actually doesnt mean that any more steps are added it doesnt mean that anything new or peculiar particularly is done but youve got pc sitting in front of you and that is thetan plus bank plus body in physical universe ghastly if the body wasnt there you could probably do all sorts of things but it is there so how does this pc feel i shades of the 3rd or 4th london acc i said that you should be able to audit pc straight through without single somatic thats ne plus ultra perfection definition you know you audit so beautifully and so well and so smoothly that you pull him out of it all without him ever having sunk into it deeper than hes in of course that is just postulated theoretical ideal but you know its almost possible to do that with routine 3 sounds incredible if you do this if you use everything you are doing at the moment you are doing it to clear the pc of what youve got your hands on see if you use that every moment to clear the pc of what youve got your hands on you will then all of sudden have miraculous series of runs with the pc and youll get something like this the first ri takes two and an half hours the next thirty ris take half an hour apiece the next thirty ris take twentyfive minutes apiece the next thirty ris take fifteen minutes apiece the next bank takes you fortyfive minutes to get your first ri takes you half an hour to geteachto get the next half dozen takes you fifteen minutes each to get the next thirty takes you ten minutes each to get the next thirty takes you five minutes each to get the next thirty using the same process every time why because you are building on gradient scale the thetans confidence and youre of course sending the case into the stars because youre clearing everything you lay your hands on there is nothing behind you to worry about i am not now talking about an ideal im talking about an attainable fact this is attainable now there are mechanics involved with this attainability and there are ways to audit which attain this the first rule youve got to follow is if youve spent session or two trying to get somebodys top oppterm firing whatcha going to do make career out of this top oppterm so for some peculiar reason on this peculiar case caught catfish doesnt apply and you just cant get anything to fire well look youve got the whole goal to catch catfish you dont need that top oppterm youve got the ending of the goal youve got an item in there catching catfish youve got the whole bottom of the goal as far as thats concerned youve got catfish catcher over there as terminal you can cut in with that block and go on down by the way matter how hard you try to go up in bank you always go down this will fool the auditor and fool the pc more often theyll say theyre going up in the bank and theyll just get couple of items reversed but theyll only be goingrunning down in the bank which is quite interesting youll alwaysits so funny you sit there after while and you look with your jaw dropped and you realize were going down in this bank and weve been trying to list up in it see nope you always go down well youve got all these points where you can cut in well which one fires native and natural on the pc which one fires which one can you make fire well you know theyre there you could unburden the case and go forward this doesnt excuse you however from not getting the top oppterm the first time and following it through you know so what you couldnt do it well lets not takemake the next seventyfive hours of auditing the contest for finding something that cant be found assume theres some reason why it cant be found and find something that can be run because your first interest is to get charge off you get charge off of that bank and the pc can confront it you fail to get charge off of that bank and the pc cant confront it and so of course youre just left there walking in the mud and if theres any doubt remains in your mind as to what the top oppterm isyou cant get the top oppterm and nothing seems to fire you cant get any absolute form you cant get any perfect form you cant get these things huuuuuuhlbaaayaalyaaaughhh dont make career out of it man leave it to the politicians to make career out of being inept youre supposed to be effective well just stretch back and say well were having bit of trouble findingfinding this top oppterm cant seem to get anything to fire on this and theres some discussion as to what it is and what it isnt and all that sort of thing were going to cut in on the goal line and see if we can get that well of course you had the goal firing so you can certainly get the goal as an oppterm firing and tear on down using the pattern of the bank from there see tear that out but you get some slabs out of that bank thats your first job but when youve got your hands on it clean it clean it up make sure its right now pcs bank doesnt go absolute catfish catfish absolute perfect inness to catfishing eager catfish catfish eagering it doesnt go like that ifitll go catfish absolute or absolute catfish or absolutely catfish or catfish absolutely or an absolute catfish itll establish pattern and that pattern will contain certain things and after youve got that pattern man there isnt anything varies the next one isnt swapended see it isnt eager catfish in one place and in another place degraded catfish you understand it doesnt say eagerly catfish and then perfectedness catfish see you got constant when you establish that pattern which is your heaviest job once that pattern is established that pattern holds so you better make sure that the pattern is right and cleared when you get it see now it really doesnt go in the upper part of the bankit varies somewhat in the lower part of the bankbut it doesnt go not perfect catfish catfish perfect catfish eager eager catfish not and cant eager catfish see and not degraded aint nothing else present doesnt go like that see it just doesnt go like that itll go perfect catfish see and eager catfish whatever it is if its eagerly catfish itll be eagerly catfish once that pattern is established that pattern continues it doesnt bounce all over the place now youve got countless locks which fire when you first enter bank lets got bank to have catfish catch tigers tigers catfish anything will fire and rocket read you work on it long enough any part of that goal wording will fire anything any combination of it catfish catch tigerishness will fire see nono havingness of catfish catch tigerishness that will fire anything fires why because youre looking at the whole mass and it is so crosscharged well the pcs name will fire in it anything will fire in it anything any kind of combination will fire you can find any top oppterm known to man or beast you can take any part of the goal or any tense of any part of the goal and put it in as top oppterm and itll fire thats horrible liability isnt it terrible so that makes the top oppterm the hardest part to find if you cant find it for gods sakes take some charge off the bank so it can be found because after youve got the charge off then all of these weird combinations dont fire now its getting simmered down just as the bank itself is shelljust as an item an ri is shell with lot of rring items and rsing items around itas ive just given you in bulletinjust as youve got cross section of that so the whole bank operates that way and the most ridiculous things will fire the more bank the more things will fire the more things will be restimulated too in life the more bank hes got the more nervy he is its just matter of charge if you can bisect charge out of there if you can getthats why you mustnt stand around with your hands in your pockets you see trying to find something find something find something find something find something find something trying to find something and not find anything you better go someplace where he can find something now you better clear everything you get your paws on everything you can get your paws on clear it now whats that mean well that means if you get your hands on an ri you clear it most of the pcs around will not fire first off on the pattern pattern does not begin by rocket reading and therefore auditors will be invited to believe that its different patternthis pc has different pattern i dont pretend that pattern is perfect that patterns awful close in though man i now your problem with all this other thing is first and foremost very well may be simply how to get the pc to rocket read at all on these items thats the problem you may find yourself wrestling with so therefore you need technology that develops rocket read and let recommend to you something on this order this is im just about to put out routine 3n which includes simply things which you have which is directive listing and random listing these things are included in it your pattern isnt very esoteric but lets take something like this now we know this characters item is going to be absolute but that absolute can also be total or all it all depends on what it is the other words dont seem to varybut perhaps that one can vary i dont say that it can eitherbut lets just takelets just have absolute caught catfish absolutely caught catfish lets just take these items see and tell the pc to give us the items and we tell the pc to give us the items so we can put them on the listwe dont just put them on the list and thats to blow charge see so we tell the pc absolutely caught catfish catfish caught catfish absolutely absolute caught catfish whatever this thing is were going to get various combinations of this this will maybe amountthis first ones going to be longer because were establishing pattern and were going to get all kinds of possibles endings and combinationswe can and so therefore it may amount to quite few items be quite few items on this and after we got all these things down weve carefully noted that one or two of them fell when the pc said them we didnt expect any rocket reads just dont expect any rocket reads at this stage of this operation i mean when youre doing this be gratified if something rocket reads but dont expect any youre looking for falls and you find out that absolutely caught catfish falls isnt that nice in fact we put it on couple of times and it fell haha we know what our item is now we simply say to the pc all right weve probably got the item on this list now there are great many secondary items however that you probably are very greatly interested in so i just want you to do some random listing on this and tell the answers as fast as you can think of themto this auditing question who or what would caught catfish oppose and the pc says soandso and soandso and soandso you dont write down thing you just sit there with your meter in front of you and the pc going on and you giving him an occasional halfacknowledgment mm mm okay fine hes listing see but youre not writing it down so he can list at rather tremendous rate and if he stops listing you damn well get him started again by getting in suppressed and invalidate see thats always the way to get person listing is put in suppress and invalidate and dont put them in prepcheckwise see just put them in on the meter suppress and invalidate and hell start listing again probably before you can get them in and let him go on talking and you let him talk until we longer are seeing rocket reads and rock slams and drs on this meter how long does it take i dont know how long is piece of string how charged is pc and you will eventually get very smooth needleone of the cleanest needles you ever laid your eyes onbeautiful smooth flowing needle and you say all right thank you very much and you stop him listing at this point and now you list caught catfish question you say this to him caught catfish to see if it reacts and if it doesnt rough up the needle appreciably thats appreciably see you dont have the perfection of cleanness because remember theres still pin on this theres still the bottom of the bankand you got you got instant reaction on it and it seemed cl it didnt rough up the needle asked the question this doesnt rough up things very much it maybe gives tiny speeded rise or something like this dont bother with that you say all right now were going to read to you your item and we read couple of these things that fell we dont even ask him again see we read him couple of these things that fell to see if couple of them are rocket reading and when you call that absolutely caught catfish which you already saw fall youre going to see the most beautiful rocket read youre ever going to see and the pc says thats it and he cognites on it and everything is fine didnt rocket read before why not obscured by charge got that you just follow that pattern item after item terminal or oppterm and youve got it made man i just was running this one over the jumps and not using it for harassing the pc to get it on the list two and half hours it took to find an item this other one took half an hour apparently lengthy isnt it but that time will shorten and what have you done in essence you have discharged or cleared the ri you were working with ill give you another discussion of this as to the exact theory of all this and why this happens this way but remember theres charge where it faces one oppterm and charge where it faces the other oppterm and theres another charge that connects it to the bottom of the bank and this item is surrounded by risby potential ris that you could get wrongthat rocket read like crazy but theyre just rocket reading items theyre rock slamming items and theyre dirty reading items and youve got them on there by the ton and before we started doing this it was customary in the top of the bank to have the tone arm ride high if you do this one and clear every one of those ris just this way you will watch this confounded needle go on down here to clear readeven for girl and come back up and pump down and go back up and pump down you can actually run you dont have to run the tone arm action out of itbut you suddenly find yourself auditing the pc at clear read he puts new item on the list you go to new section and hell go up but then by the time youve discharged it hes at clear read when you gave him the item you dont get much blowdown because its blown down youll find something else youll find something else thats terribly intriguingisthis is why you must do itthe item you are listing from will always rr again and that is because the first time you gave it to the pc the charge suppressed it and only by listing it do you get the charge back on it in clean pure state so that it can blow in other words it implodes before it explodes quite fascinating in other words youre listing from caught catfish and heyou put absolutely caught catfish on your line plot you put this on your line plot and it falls and you could read your meter at this moment and you wouldnt find caught catfish firing but you list it for five minutes and then read caught catfish and it gives you rocket read ohhoho but youve got the item on the list already oh i think this is fascinating in other words there was that much blasting charge left on the thing but there is method to clean it ive often told you you might have to do something with the ris but i didnt know what it would be well what you do with them is list them list them random you dont write it down gives the pc the weirdest feeling when hes already trained into having his every word recorded you know to have the auditor just sitting there staring at the thing you know thank you all right okay all right well thats enough now dont even write it down again but supposing you couldnt get anything to rocket read at the end of this thine then youd have to work with the pc to get something on the list but it will now rocket read previously if you hadnt taken this step just the way id given it to you you could get half dozen perfectly satisfactory ris in the place of this one and therefore have half dozen chances to get wrong ones and then your errors mount and you find it harder and harder and you think this is wasting time his lists are going to get shorter and shorter ive already seen this in the first bank the lists were three pages in the second bank theyre two pages in the next bank theyre one page dont you see but list those rrs and rses off of that ri just by making him answer the question and youre going to see some of the cleanest needles and some of the happiest pcs youve ever seen and that tone arm will come right on down now if the tone arm doesnt come down you goofed you said well this pc is different it wasnt absolute or itd absolute can vary because thats just bllaa thats just being sabllaa it wasntit wasnt eager it was excited oh excited would fire oh i guarantee excited would fire so you put down excited now when you dont put it down at the top of the list youre going to get very long list the right item must be on the list first before you give any random listing and thats why you put it down at the top of the list youve already got the right item on the list so therefore the list will be relatively short and blow easily now if you didnt put the right item on at the top of the list the pc would list for couple of hours without putting the item on see you already triggered it you already triggered it and made it collapse in on itself and then youve listed the debris off see youve done an heroic job so this makes it up to you the auditor to know what item goes on the list haha before the pc puts it on you can consult the pc you can get his opinion but he will inevitably tell you particularly early on in processing and so forth it is not perfect it is exquisite and exquisite will rocket read unfortunately perfect wont but exquisite will and after youve got the random listing what do you find you find yourself looking exquisite doesnt even read hell even tell you now well it isnt exquisite its perfect of course in other words he comes around that way then people can say yes pcs are forced to list according to this pattern they forced to list according to this pattern and the pattern actually isnt what is in the bank at all see they can have all sorts of arguments but heres the proof you now cant get anything else to rocket read on that question you cant get any more rocket reading items on it but if you had taken exquisite if you had gone back to it you would have found out youd get another half dozen rocket reading items in that same area isnt that interesting in other words what lists it flat is the pattern now when we transfer this into french german swedish scandinavian chinese and other tongues were probably going to be in trouble and even when we try to run it on twelveyearold child that has never heard of such word as incomparable were going to be in trouble arent we well people have already been in trouble as auditors trying to run the mid ruds on an eighteenyearold girl that just couldnt seem to get it through her head what suppress meant so the auditor sat down and taught her the language so we need glossary which defines by dictionary and with an idiots definition of every single word that is used in the bank and im going to get one together or get somebody to get one together now we say theres the definitions and these suffixes what does ivity really mean well this is educating the pc but unfortunately he wont go clear unless you do so some pc saysyou have to give him angive him test literacy test you seeand you say what does incomparable mean and he says incomp ininwhat you mean unconchible i thought for while here just short time ago that theonly literate people were ever going to get clear they were probably more educated when they laid these things in than they are now but then i suddenly realized well they can learn those words they learn new words all the time they can learn those too its finite number of words all we got to do is write up glossary thats well defined with good idiots definition following the dictionary definition you know very clear dictionary definition and then an idiots definition that gives it all in pattycake eventually they would come up to being very fond of these words so there is your method of handling whereby you keep the body from getting knocked off while youre auditing the thetan and this has the single practical aspect of course of continuing to have pair of hands to wrap around your emeter electrodes i wish to however call this to your attention because my earlier researches on thetan meterwhich was small antenna read by the magic eye type of response on thetandidnt pan out worked on it in 1952 53 and the difficulty with this universe is that the fields of television stations radio stations and all that sort of thing and the fields of live body in the vicinity of that antenna can raise the devil with it but it isnt so much the tv fields as it is the live body and lord knows where the thetan would have to be you as an auditor would have to be in order to audit the thetan now he could be in the vicinity of the antenna but you would have to bewhat do you knowover twentyfive feet away youd have to audit twentyfive feet from your meter and then of course every wire that is run in toward the antenna sets up its own field so im just recommending to you to keep the pc alive and so that you can have pair of hands to put on the emeter electrodesand this isi cant recommend this to you too strongly because its embarrassing now we thought we would run into problem whereby how do you audit somebody ot well thats very easy because all hes got to do is keep in touch with the body and youll continue to get your rocket reads but how do you audit thetan that doesnt have body to put on the meter and we havent got that solved and im pointing that out to you and strongly recommending therefore that you clear the banksthat you contact and clear every item in the bank before going on to the next item and therefore youll continue to have live hands on the electrodes okay all right thank you very much
