budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 medicare spending has set records for low or declining rates of program growth congress first addressed the issue of slow er rates of growth in medicare spending with the passage of the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106 113 however while part of the slower rate s of growth may be attributed to under estimates of the savings derived from the bba it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor as the exact cause for this proj ected decline in spending provider groups argue that the bba reductions have threatened both their economic viability and their ability to provide services for medicare beneficiaries however government studies have indicated that this lower rate of growth has not re sulted in inadequate reimbursement rates as the congress debated further ame ndments to the bba the current cbo projections were those released in july 2000 cbo projected that medicare would spend about total of 1339 trillion over the following 5 years

since the passage of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba pl 10533 medicare spending has set records for low or declining rates of program growth in fiscal year 1998 the medicare growth rate sl owed to then record low of just 15 for the entire year an amount less than woul d be expected allowing for increases in enrollment and for inflation the following year set new record when for the first time in the programs history medicare spe nding dropped from one year to the next mandatory program spending declined by about 2 billion from 211 billion in 1998 to 2093 billion in 1999 almost 1 decline according to the department of the treasury medicare spending for 2000 increased by about 3 although part of the slower rates of gr owth may be attribut ed to underestimates of the savings derived from the bba it is di fficult to pinpoint any one factor as the exact cause for this projected decline in spending many factors other than the bba such as an improved economic forecast and heightened antifraud activities are significant components of the decline in th rates of growth in medicare spending see crs report rs20238 trends in medicare spendi ng after the balanced budget act for detailed discussion of the fact ors affecting medicare projections provider groups argue that the bba re ductions have threatened both their economic viability and their ability to provi services for dicare beneficiaries however government studies have indicated that this wer rate of growth has not resulted in inadequate reimbursement rates for example reports on the medicarechoice mc program by both th department of health and human services hhs and the gao indicate that payment levels are not too low the inspector general of the hhs reported in september 2000 that mc organizations receive more than an adequate amount of funds to deliver the medicare package of covered services gao also reported in august 2000 on their examination of 1998 payments the second year that plans were paid using the mc payment rates their examination showed that the mc pr ogram spent about 32 billion or over 13 more on health plan enrollees than if th enrollees had received services through traditional feeforservice medicare despite these findings mc organizations are withdrawing from the program disrupting c overage to many dicare beneficiaries studies of the adequacy of payment extend beyond the mc program the inspector general of hhs in series of reports on skilled nursing facilities snfshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30707crs2 reported that even under the new prosp ective payment system most hospital discharge planners were able to place patients that need care in nursing facility congress first addressed the issue of slower rates of growth in medicare spending with the passage of the balan ced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106113 at time of passage cbo estimated that the bbra would add approximately 16 billion in total back into the medicare program for 20012005 cbos july 2000 estimates of medicare spending released in july 2000 projected that medicare spending growth over the course of the 2001 to 2010 decade would average 73 annually over that period medicares share of the us national income was projected to incr ease from 23 of gross domestic product gdp in 2000 to 28 by 2010 most of medicares program growth was expected to result from two factors increased enrollment and automatic updates in reimbursements for services the table below compares cbos ju ly 2000 projections with two earlier estimates those made in july 1999 just pr ior to the passage of the bbra and the january 1997 estimates calculated prior to the passage of the bba as shown in the table according to cbos july 2000 projec tions medicare would spend about total of 1339 trillion over the following 5
