6309c05 shspec303 service facsimile assessment we have been walking around the edges of the field of psychotherapy for some time there is third dynamic service fac in this field in that medical doctors who have training for and have business in the field of mental healing are attempting to take dominance over this field they have understanding of the mind only an understanding of the brain all you would have to to is to get legislatures to pass laws that would only allow those trained in the field of the mind to practice in that field and you would have secured the field there are only 272 mental practitioners in england so we have mocked up our own opposition our own extra item so people qualified at level iii will soon have certificate as psychiatric consultant there is legal patent on the name level iii is expected to be able to clear it also incidentally takes in the ability to treat insanity neurosis and psychosis these are just different degree of what is wrong with the mind the person who cant even manage himself and the environment we call insane what is wrong with him is that he has got the final solution some solution that is so allpervading that he doesnt have to itsa anything after that he never has to look so he just disappears in mound of unasised mass in processing certain amount of introversion takes place for the purpose of bringing about extroversion the only time introversion and erasure do not bring about greater reach and greater arc is when overrestimulation is brought about that factor still exists in class iv but there it is whole track that is most likely to get pc into an overrestimulated condition not just itsa on this lifetime at level iii you could overrestimulate someone who was already batty the worse off case is the more careful you have to be of overrestimulation for instance someone who had been running on conceptual basis who did not have much reach and not much arc with the environment might get overrestimulated if you got them to contact the pain in the thing that they are running to clear somebody you will stay in this lifetime only at level iv do you leave this lifetime and that is when someone has an active ta that doesnt go high or low with any pc on this planet it is environmental restimulation that is the straw that breaks the pcs back you can go backtrack but it is rough it can make the pc unauditable an hgc operating with raw public or even with scientologists has to battle with environmental restimulation not with the bank neurotic and psychotic states are caused by environmental restimulation the two factors involved are 1 the amount of environmental restimulation 2 the inherent susceptibility of the individual therefore if all you did was to try to reduce environmental restimulation some people would go sane and others would go mad with boredom it is question of acceptable randomity dogooders end up reducing randomity and things can get pretty boring an acceptable level of randomity equals the amount of environmental restimulation divided by the amount of restimulation the individual can withstand this being equal to some constant pcs usually audit only what they consider safe the mind starts to shut off any restimulation that would overwhelm it cf the minds protection the pcs ability to resist restimulation is too low for him to face up to track so how are you going to get anything done there are three types of cases 1 normal confront of bank those which audit easily 2 confront of bank those who refuse to approach the bank 3 suicidal confront those whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs so that they go in over their heads all the time we want to convert the two latter sorts of cases into the former all cases tend towards the safe solution some cases also adopt vengeful solution like getting even with people by dying even dangerous solution seems like the safe solution to the pc all cases when they become more auditable do so along the channel of the safe solution safe solution is safe decision safe environment safe assumption etc all human rights disappear down the channel of the safe solution that is the hole in the bathtub it is actually very dangerous to have safe solution it inhibits observation and anything that inhibits observation destroys someone who is very neurotic or psychotic is so to the degree that they have adopted safe solution this datum underlies mental healing as sweepingly as the datum that survival is the common denominator it is another way of saying the same thing people adopt survival solutions when then become so safe that they become contrasurvival the safe solution makes the person right and others wrong enhancing the persons survival by putting him in position of dominance and letting him escape domination by others it lets him survive and causes others to succumb he thinks this reaches extremes of craziness eg the miser who starves in household of 100 bills his method of survival is to have lots of money it is very safe solution but in his obsession with this safe solution he has neglected to spend any of it to live so his attention becomes more and more concentrated and less and less sensible for someone to be wise he must be able to observe his environment he must be able to reach it is not good enough to have maxims tucked away to which you can refer in times of stress philosophy becomes not wisdom but study of safe solutions the safe solution is the service facsimile there are times when you will have to be very clever to find just what it is in the pc it is complicated alterised and not believable there could be thousands of them you want to get the one the test is did it resolve the case in the first ones you find the most you can hope for is to find something that moves the ta and brings you closer to resolving the pcs case when you have found the service fac on the case the needle will be looser and the ta will be in more reasonable state acting better when something you have found doesnt run on the rightwrong bracket you prepcheck this is an invariable rule you could fix the pc up by taking anything that has been found charged on old assessments and prepchecking it that which you couldnt prepcheck with ta you could run on rightwrong if it goes nowhere on that ok there is harm done all this will eventually reveal the service fac one way in which you could be too clever with this would be to get overambitious and throw the pc in over his head as follows you are pulling the stable datum out of the confusion therefore the pc may be thrown into the confusion which makes him feel weird if you run r3sc on the stable datum until it is flat it will make it all right for the pc one of the tests of the service fac is that the pc is likely to say or at least think that he is not sure that it is wise to get rid of it be very sure if you are working with someone who is already shaky that you unburden the case gradiently even though he is standing there saying his service fac environmental restimulation has to be reduced on such case before you add any processing restimulation the better the assessment and the less gradient there had been the greater the shock to the person remember the pc adopted the safe solution because he couldnt stand the environmental restimulation so you dont necessarily want to get the big stable data first it is better to start off with r1c or 2wc on solutions that he has had to his problems the more solutions he has had to problem the more it will stick how do you raise someones ability to withstand environmental restimulation you pull his service fac since that is what reduces his ability to see his environment the more safe solutions he has adopted the more environmental restimulation he isnt asising the less he is confronting etc oddly enough or not so oddly the thing that reduces his ability to handle his environment is the thing that he has adopted to handle his environment for him when you remove that thing he can now confront and inspect the environment and handle it when you get the environmental restimulation out of the way the pc can confront the backtrack we have gone into this line because we want faster run to ot i dont care anything much about clearing or whether he gets clear or not we are not trying to make happy persons we are trying to make an able person you can make clear by getting off enough service facs it makes better human being but the point is to cut down the time spent at level iv which is already sizable amount at level iii then we can handle environmental restimulation by knocking out the service facsimile which is what encourages environmental restimulation we have enough attention free so that we can go wholetrack and erase things faster and we are not held up by low tas and high tas so we dont have this situation w started to do gpm we got little bit mixed up we got into the bear goals then we got into the helatrobus didnt realize it but we were into the invisible picture goals all the time by knocking out the service fac session restimulation also drops because the session is part of the environment the assessment for r3sc is simple one it is l and n the lists dont have to be superlong in fact they should not be longer than eight to ten pages with twenty items per page unless it is just safe to keep on listing list should be only as long as it has to be to keep the pc from arc breaking because it is incomplete here is the r3sc procedure 1 you do parts of existence list and null it down to some one item that the pc doesnt object to say peanuts it doesnt matter if the item is right so long as the pc doesnt argue about it if say four items are left in and the list isnt complete we will just do step 2 to all four of the levels left in as long as the pc isnt protesting pcs dramatize doing only what is safe ss they move in towards the service fac so you may need to do this assessment several times 2 take the item found and list safe solutions to it safe assumptions about it or safe decisions about it whatever clears with the pc the item you get eg not eat them is probably either as close as you can get to the service fac at this time or the service fac itself 3 take the item and work it over until it is solution to more than just that one dynamic eg solution to more than just peanuts you could ask how could that apply to other dynamics etc we want broader version of the safe assumption to get closer to the real service fac 4 in any case take whatever you get from 3 and run r3sc brackets or prepcheck on it 5 repeat the entire procedure starting with new parts of existence list 6 run it to free needle if you run something and you still have some charge on it list for safe assumptions about that topic look for identifications pcs will mention assumptions that dont make sense such an identification is cousin to one or more service facs note them when you find them this whole operation does take some genius
