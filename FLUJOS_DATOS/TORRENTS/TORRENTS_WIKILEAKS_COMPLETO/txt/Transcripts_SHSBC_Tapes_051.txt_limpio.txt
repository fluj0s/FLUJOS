shsbc 51 auditing quality lecture given on 30 august 1961 thank you well this is the what audience 30th lets see if youre right by george you are 30th of august ad 11 the year of the clears all right theres probably lot of questions youd like to ask the first question you should like to ask is whether or not if running an auditing session is so important why then that omits all of the rudiments doesnt it well i said yesterday you see that if the if you had to choose between the two why youd run session and if the pc rudiments were very upsetting to the pc and so forth and he felt he was getting place with rudiments and so forth of course you have pc out of session but i said there is an adjudicative thing here there is point where you can have far too much rudiments you get the idea and far too little session and there is also and i said this yesterday and i want to point it up again theres also point where you can have far too little rudiments now if you expect 1a i just got subjective reality on this just little while ago if you expect 1a to handle all the present time problems and therefore not handle present time problem which the pc has given you to be handled every now and then youre going to make terrible mistake every now and then youre going to make terrible mistake because you can put it down that present present time problem you know short duration present time problem is not necessarily handled at all by any process in 1a you got that you got that heres an example i just had this matter of fact pc comes into session gives the auditor goal he wants to get rid of present time problem and life and livingness says well id like to get this particular person out of my hair you got the idea one two rudiments are run needle falls off the pin on present time problem auditor goes ahead and runs 1a net result session why well 1a is not addressed to the present time problem so one doesnt feel that the auditor is participating at all in the auditing of the case the permissive wandering around looking at unknowns or present time problems or something of this sort particularly 1a version in which problem is ever mentioned you know just look at unknowns look at unknowns look at unknowns and pc could very well go out of session very thoroughly you see hes really got it bugged he doesnt want anything to do with this present time problem so actually hes sitting there in state of noconfront you got the idea so of course you run permissive process he will not then confront the present time problem even though he wants to get away from it you see he just bounces off the problem and hes running youre running case who has present time problem in wild restimulation got the idea but of course the reason hes got present time problem is he doesnt want to confront some part of it so naturally youre permitting the pc then to do nonconfront on the present time problem even while you think you are busy running process which handles all problems so we wont bother it you see the very problem that he will not have anything to do with is present time problem which he told you he wanted to get rid of and that you found in the rudiments therefore 1a does not scoop up present time problem you got it present time problem of short duration something like this or actually present time problem of long duration has great deal of noconfront mixed up in it and you got this tremendous quantities of noconfront all right you run permissive process on that exact subject the auditor is then not controlling the pc and the only thing that comes through to the pc is that the session is not controlled you see how that would be quite interesting quite interesting but all of these things are subject to judgment the safe way to play any auditing session of course is to have all your rudiments in to get all of your rudiments in now i didnt say that you couldnt run 1atype process immediately against that exact present time problem but the auditor is in there making the pc confront it see so that isnt then 1a youre using 1atype process to handle present time problem with pc which is what fell on the meter and of course the pcll be getting someplace if you did this well now pc never feels hes wasting his time if the auditor is fulfilling one of his goals its when the present time problem the handling of it is absolutely goal to the pc and the pc sits down and hopes to god he doesnt have present time problem he isnt really aware of having one but he hopes to god he wont have one he wants to get on with his prehav run on the goals terminal and get the show on the road and all of sudden the auditor looks up and hes got that movingneedlelook in his eye and the pc says with faint heart and despair creeping over him oh there isnt present time problem here and the auditor says oh he says brightly yes there is well the pc says well i dont know what it could be and the auditor says well lets see what it is now the only thing thatll get you over that barrier is smart auditing pc says he knows dimly theyre going to repossess his car tomorrow or something of the sort and he doesnt want to think about it well ill clue you if you pass that up or if you pass up any falling rudiment or any reacting rudiment youve just set yourself up for session thats why theres judgment involved in this thing its one of these horrible facts of life every once in while why mama will get daughter and take her down and sit down in the kitchen pour her cup of coffee and let her in about men the horrible facts of life you see or tell her about father and this is this is an analogous sort of thing you know yes gwendolyn you were actually born in cabbage patch you werent born really at all you were found there and its just one of the brutal things you have to face about auditing is that as you come down the line youve got rudiments to cover if your rudiments are out assessment cannot occur and also youre going to set up problems and trouble in the auditing session pc has present time problem present time problem isnt handled the immediate next result is an arc break i mean it goes one two arc breaks always stem from present time problem the present time problem however should not be looked at by the auditor as always exterior to the auditing session if you preconceive what present time problem should be well thats just an oughttobe that youre running on the pc dont you see what is present time problem i remember in one acc i startled all of the students by finding that 50 percent of the class had present time problems known as an auditing session it was the auditing session which was the present time problem to the pc but nobody had ever inquired about an auditing session i think it was the 18th nobody had ever inquired about an auditing session do you have present time problem well yes and yes and so and they didnt know and the auditor would guess at this and that and the pc didnt know and the pc would be saying oh my god dont tell we really have to run present time problem here i want to get on with this help on the rock and so on and this was the way it was going you see but factually the session itself had some present time problem factors in it and none of the auditors ever sorted these things out i looked over few shoulders and realized that what was going on here is the idea of asking for present time problem sometimes restimulated present time problem which was dormant up to the point it was asked for and that can happen too you know the pcs sitting there hes minding his own business hes being pc everything is going along just dandy and splendiferously and he hasnt got care in the world and all he wants is an auditing session and then the auditor says these fatal words do you have present time problem and the pc says lets see now oh god yes yeah ohoh yeah but he would it hed tell you at the same time i wouldnt have unless youd have asked you see present time problem wasnt worrying him and he sort of postulates it into view as present time problem you get the idea actually he probably could have gone on to the end of the session and straight on out and he never would have thought of the fact that hes supposed to take cake home to his motherinlaw you know its always present time problem to give something to your motherinlaw well i was very shocked one day i was around and found out that this ancient joke about motherinlaws wasnt necessarily true i found husband who was very enamored with his motherinlaw and hated his wife he and his motherinlaw got along fine you know used to go around to the dances and everything anyhow wife was very disapproving of the whole thing anyway hes got to take cake home to his wife and he hadnt thought of it and he probably wouldnt have thought of it except its labeled under the heading of problem do you have problem and he sort of thinks to himself problem thats something that youre supposed to do something about am i supposed to do something yes i am supposed to do something i was supposed to take cake home to my wife well god ill have to sit here for the rest of the session and remember this now because id comfortably forgotten it of course and never intended to take any cake home to my wife you know some kind of weird oddball combination goes through and present time problem charges into view that wouldnt have been into view so the subject is sorts out amongst the facts of life the rudiments are dangerous ground saw picture the other day of ford interceptor motorpowered boat all the advertisement was about ford interceptor motor going up the grand canyon going up the colorado river at some fantastic rate of speed and the ad was all about this motor see its had in total mystery ever since you talk about notknow what the hell kind of boat is this that can go at about thirty or forty miles an hour up against the grand canyon banging its stern and so forth and its bows onto rocks at high rate of speed dont you see and actually make it 365 miles upriver and the other thing is who the hell did that you know had in mystery ever since i got record up here that says the grand canyon suite or something of the sort and i sat there and during the whole time you see i couldnt hear the music at all i was thinking about this ford interceptor going up the grand canyon stuck in total mystery but if id never seen the advertisement i wouldnt be worried about it you got the idea and id probably be able to enjoy the grand canyon suite and life would be marvelous when somebody shoves this advertisement under your nose you know and youre being audited and so help pete we never have realized before there was such an unknown such mess about it and we postulate at that moment that it is problem and then we go on and have to handle it as problem and this becomes very boring and we find tremendous amounts of auditing are being consumed on present time problems and this itself now listen carefully is the only present time problem getting auditing so it solves very nicely that the pc who is gets bugged every time you say to him well do you have present time problem he says oh my god oh yeah oh yeah i do hmm and so forth the only thing youre running into is scarcity of auditing pc is afraid he isnt going to get audited theres tremendous scarcity of auditing all right that amounts to present time problem so you have pc there trying to make two sessions out of every one session and as result you get very slow gain there are numerous games that men play you go out here on the golf course other places and youll find theyre playing all sorts of games the scots invented this game because it only requires one ball and youll find these fellows out there and they have such an anxiety to hit the ball right that they go into the woods the trees knock the caddie off on the 18th hole when theyre playing hole number 7 you see but they have this terrific anxiety ive heard pro after pro say relax now just relax and go through the motions every once in while the fellow wouldnt have anything on his mind and he would accidentally step up to the ball and go through all the proper motions and there goes 265yard drive you know right down the middle of the fairway you know right on to the other green one small putt and hes in hes got an eagle you know well his anxiety now sets in how did he do it so hes got new anxiety i suppose golf pros never never never would get rid of this anxiety problem because otherwise theyd never have any pupils dont you see because this particular pressure you know have got to do it have got to get it have to press to press somehow or another is just too much you see and it gets everybody upset and then they have to have golf lessons of course to overcome this but of course the golf lesson doesnt ever overcome it its quite remarkable when you look at it the anxiety to do right often winds up you see in total fiasco youre just so anxious to do right you see that you wind it up and its just total fiasco you know the ball is in the woods and the pc is flat on his back weeping silently to himself someplace you know and theres been session golf game or anything its just anxiety well its the postulate the trick is about golf and youll understand it about auditing the trick is is very simple trick the guy has already postulated he cant do it he must have if he feels nervous about it hes postulated that he cant do it you see so this fellow has an idea that he cant have session before he starts getting worried about trying to have session so its its just red flag thats hanging up there with storm warnings from the truck to the foot of the mast its very obvious if youll take look at it anybody who starts pressing on the rudiments has present time problem called how am i going to get audited so dont from here on just dont worry about that phenomenon you go down the rudiments i say well its one of the facts of life that you have to face that you have to go down the rudiments and you go down the rudiments dont make big deal out of it but youu get to the present time problem the pc starts sighing and moaning and so forth and he didnt know he had one and now hes got one dont you see what hes doing hes trying to have session and of course this triggers the fact that he cant have session so the best way not to have session is to have present time problem that is mixed up in the session and oh my god i dont want present time well what does all this add up to dont you see it adds up explicitly instantly to the fact that he has scarcity of auditing hes got such scarcity that its very very valuable therefore it has to be done terribly terribly right do you see and hes got to get the most session he can possibly get into that unit of time well hes pressing so hard as pc that he will actually sit there and do additional commands and try to make session out of it in some oddball way and you the auditor often sit there watching pc getting audited not realizing that the pc cannot do the auditing command but the pc is pressing so hard trying to make session out of it because of the scarcity of auditing that he doesnt give any real evidence of not being able to do the auditing command theres something wrong with the auditing command theres something undoable about the session and yet hes in there trying to make session out of it now maybe you could do the process but that is criterion on whether or not the pc can do the process dont you see so hell inevitably substitute process in there that he can do in some fashion or another hell put additional auditing answers in there or commands in there or something of the sort trying to make session out of it and all this comes under the heading of trying to make session out of it and if youve got pc around who is desperately trying to make session out of it you have pc who has present time problem called the scarcity of auditing now its perfectly all right right off your bat to call for that one only it sometimes may be phrased as scarcity of treatment you get one off the street raw meat walks in off the street and so forth and you say this person has never been audited before how could he possibly have scarcity of auditing well of course hes got the greatest scarcity of auditing there is hes never had any hes never even heard of it but the point is he does have scarcity of treatment there is terrible scarcity of effective treatment as matter of fact it has been zero on this planet as nearly as i can trace for about fifty thousand years its just been zero there was always repercussion on the treatment you go into the aesculapian temple and they slipped you the hellebore and after youve had your fit and your dream and few things like that why you were all cured you didnt have paraclosis or something but you certainly did have you went on having these fits you get the idea you know and keep having these dreams and these fits and thats worse than the paraclosis you know and all these things so you go to medico and the medico he cuts out your zorch and there you are youre zorchless and you say well that was good that was awful good to get rid of that zorch the horrible things it was doing and so forth only now youre operating without zorch and thisll catch up with you sooner or later because the body is designed to be run with zorch every once in while the medico elects some part of the body as dispensable and now its tonsils now its appendix now its this now its that now its something else one of these days theyll elect the head and the the general situation as far as this is concerned of course is is consequence to treatment so treatmeents which have consequence make of course effective treatment very scarce bad treatment makes effective treatment very scarce naturally the person is then frightened of having any treatment hes frightened of having any treatment because hes had so much ineffective treatment got the idea i mean thats in other words somebody has run canthave on him you know the medico up here with the chromium plated zitherproof operating theater where only two colleges of surgeons and eight universities full of students are cheering in the amphitheaters as he delicately amputates zorch you know nice quiet orderly operative procedures you see and everybody knocked out cold unable to perceive anything thats going on you know and its real ball you know and you wake up in the hospital room with awareness of having gotten to the hospital room and you say what happened and you fumble around and by god youve got zorch you know something of this sort and you lie there and you can hear the blood dripping on the floor nurse comes around on her midnight rounds shes been out having tea or something of the sort you go up at this local abattoir pardon hospital and you find you find accident cases and everything else just trundled into the front room you know and skipped and hours and hours and hours will go by nobody ever comes near them you think im kidding you but thats the way she rolls all right now the more instances of that person has committed the more instances of that you see that they have received why the less treatment there is of course because these things arent treatment so you can actually get somebody who gets terribly anxious for hospital treatment because hes never had any treatment in hospital you got the idea hes kept going to hospitals but they never treated anything and he just gets into total anxiety you know he wants treatment he cant have treatment and and there it goes and hell get into terrific wingding so it makes quite problem and it goes over into auditing and auditing would almost inevitably have its roots in circa twentieth century maltreatment instead of treatment you see punishment instead of treatment they do some remarkable things of one kind or another i myself have run into few headon had some sinusitis one time so they started pulling teeth that was great one had nothing to do with it either became obvious even to the medicos short time later you know i was in hospital one time and my stomach wall wouldnt heal been messed up and so they kept feeding custard and after about the 465th custard i just had some kind of an inkling i was coming around little bit actually what was wrong with was i was utterly exhausted id just been in combat theater after combat theater you see with rest nothing between and it sort of came to that this was not the sort of diet that i myself would select of my own free choice so i used to slide out with goodlooking nurse and beg your pardon she was wave and she knew where there was wonderful chinese noodle parlor and so after id eat my custard she would come in and we would go out the back gate and wed go down and id have several egg foo yungs and you know soothing things like sweet and sour pork you know and so forth i started to feel better started to get back on my feet again and it was those custards i kept telling the doctors you see those custards were absolutely marvelous particularly when served in chinese restaurants under some other name you werent supposed to eat anything else you see so then finally finally through the connivance of couple of hospital corpsmen and several pals in the marine why i got the wrong meal ticket issued to and there was special diet table where they fed people nothing but steak so i do know where all the steaks went that the civilians didnt get because they were all served at that table huge piles of steaks would come in you see and id demolish four or five of these steaks and feel much better the medicos never found out about this and i finally got restored to duty certified for continental limits of the united states only to stay where proper diet and ration and adequate rest are assured and of course the next piece of paper back of that says ordered to the fifth amphibious force you see and next hospital just same sort of nonsense going on in all directions i walked in the front door under protest and they said go to bed and i said why and i said i feel perfectly all right and beside i have date tonight in monterey and they said well monterey is much too far away and youre going to bed and the nurses around there these girls got turned down for the womens teams on the olympics you know theyre really husky and so i went to bed and by damn they put there for two weeks there was nothing wrong with i was just supposed to report to the hospital two weeks i spend in bed of course you know i wasnt two weeks in bed but that was what the orders said their windows open from the bottom and the top but after while you get the dim notion starts to penetrate you see that theres treatment available you just get this dim notion it somehow or other enters from like ray of light through the upper windows of the cathedral and it goes into your medulla oblongata and it goes splank and youd say there is treatment being offered in any direction for anything what do you know so you start checking around and find out this is true of course immediately its canthave on treatment of various kinds whatsoever sometimes quite the reverse has happened some kids born in family that theyre all sold on the idea that if you bite rattlesnakes or i dont know something you know im indiscriminate as to races if you just bite enough rattlesnakes why you develop strong teeth or something like that and this kid happens to have very soft teeth and they need to be pulled every now and then and nobody ever pulls his teeth there are probably people in this room who had parents who had bugs on the subject of medical treatment either you had to go and get treated particularly right in the middle of the basketball season or something of the sort or you must never go and get treated you see both of these two extremes result in of course treatment so it gets to be problem and its carried over into auditing just the long and the short of the thing its carried over desperately into auditing where youve had ineffective healing practices running on planet for while nobody thinks anything can happen so thats terrific scarcity dont look at it in any other way you see the treatment at all could be total scarcity dont you see but it still adds up to scarcity and now were back to scientology 88008 scarcity and abundance in all things and that applies to treatment and thats the present time problem to the pc whos having trouble in an auditing session this pc will get up to this kind of state where hell demand auditing and wont have it when he gets it all of that stems immediately and directly from the present time problem of the scarcity of treatment how do you handle such thing well handle it in any present time problem process it is present time problem of long duration because of course its this lifetime theres nothing to it you just handle it just as you would any present time problem only you get it phrased and the pc probably never thought of this as the present time problem back of all the present time problems he has every time you mention present time problem to him see he never thought of any part of this so youve got to introduce some innuendo along about this point its not evaluation its innuendo and you innuendo him into the cognition that my god auditing is scarce of course you can run such process as what auditing session have you been unable to confront or when has there been auditing i mean it can be this crude dont you see i mean you dont even have to be very adroit and youll get him over it now you can use this pattern of process the other day that i gave you which is what unknown in an auditing session would you want to escape from you can use any process that has to do with present time problems and wind up at the other end with the pc with more problem about having present time problems that would be the way to cure this particular phenomenon and manifestation also the pc who continuously has present time problems has obviously not told you anything about his present time problem it goes back to this those things that are known are not aberrative thats where it goes thats very blunt blanket wide wild statement even though i myself and you customarily forget that particular facet of scientology that is fact that which is not known is the only aberrative factor those factors which are known are not aberrative the individual sits there and he says oh well he says i know i know whats wrong with its my mother and she used to just be cross with day and night and made drink horlicks and i did nothing but drink horlicks from the time i was one to the time i was twelve and i know thats whats wrong with well you can just write it off right that moment you just write it off just overtly there is one track where we know nothing is wrong with the pc horlicks and mama you get the idea of course now after while in auditing you start revealing certain factors in the pc and your processes begin to reveal certain things to him those things which are halfknown can still have the unknown portion of the halfknown you see producing difficulty you see so the second the pc says i know all about it does not necessarily mean that he has recovered from it if he found out about it in auditing you see it does not necessarily mean that that is now known sphere just because he said so never believe pc one of the things you should operate on the pc says thats right we better look and thats operative in all fields except goals and terminals oddly enough the pc who has goal is hell on wheels in the direction of this goal his attention is just gets totally wrapped up in this particular goal and his progress toward that goal and so on there is his attention and thats why people clear on goals and terminals well you probably customarily treat goals question in the rudiments quite lightly you probably dont think too much about it you say what goals would you like to set for this session the fellow gives you four or five goals for the session and you say well ill pay attention to those things you say well just go on and i decided what i am going to run in this session and weve got to flatten off soandso in this session and suchandsuch in this session well if the case isnt running right you go back over your auditing reports and auditing reports are quite valuable and every auditor ought to keep them meticulously and actually an auditing report should be written at the time the auditing is given and it should not be written from notes taken at the time the auditing is given it ought to be the actual transcript now if youve got to have copy of an auditing report put piece of carbon paper underneath the actual auditing report that you are writing but dont turn in transcribed reports because youll tell yourself lies and you will omit data you see because its only notes which you are taking during the session you therefore dont make full report because youre going to transcribe it but when you transcribe it that data happens to be missing dont you see so its only notes and then it becomes only an auditing report and these things are very valuable particularly now in goals if we did not for instance have all of the goals lists of all of the auditors who attended the course in washington wed almost have had it you see and they were going to type up i just got despatch today they were going to type up the first couple of hundred goals of each one of these lists and send it to these students and i said oh you dont whistle them up and bring them in and find their assessment and get their goal because its of course in the first really probably in the first few goals the first 40 first 100 first 150 for sure now youre really reaching out but by keeping those records well we know something about it furthermore if clearing goes astray these days we can always put it right if the auditing reports of the pc are available to us we know what processes and levels werent flattened and where the case was so got submerged we know lots of things about the case then if we can go back if case stalls its very very good thing to go back over all of the auditing reports of the case now one of the ways you go back over all of the auditing reports of the case is to find out if there has been consistent statement of goal in each and every session or every few sessions see its similar goal its the present time problem of long duration that you somehow or another have not recognized was there do you see and he actually may not have recognized that it was there but he kept giving it as goal the goals given in the rudiments are important they are important for the location of present time problems of long duration and they are also very important for locating present time problems of short duration and the biggest boost they give you is solving the present time problem situation thats what that goals question gives you because the person nearly always announces his present time problem of long duration in his goals lists and itll just be session after session itll make you weep sometimes you look over an auditing report whole sheaf of reports and the person says i want to get over my zorch operation you know and you look at this and its just sheet after sheet after sheet you know report after report goals of the session get over his zorch operation and you look in vain to find anything thats happening about the zorch operation and you do worse than that you look in vain to see much improvement of the case so thats an interesting way to go about tracing case is using those goals you should pay some attention to those goals of course youre plowing madly ahead in the direction of clearing him and getting in auditing and so forth but remember auditing is what the pc to marked degree considers auditing it is what the pc considers auditing to the degree that he will stay insession and you can do anything you want to do with the pc as long as the pc considers its auditing what does the pc consider auditing is auditing is the handling of his fixed attentions on the track and that is what auditing is to pc so you neednt ever quail at getting in rudiment where the pcs attention is fixedly fixed because the pc will consider it auditing and if you cant quite find out why the rudiment is out and you insist on some half measure you say well well just audit this yoou know because we cant were sure we must have found it ah but did you you see the rudiment stays out the pc isnt interested in running it hes quite upset and so forth well we havent got the rudiment we havent got the root of it were were not really running it theres something wrong with our estimation of that rudiment now we may find the pc is arc breaking arc breaking arc breaking along certain particular line and we enter into some line of inquiry about it after while and we should enter into line of inquiries why is he arc breaking with us might he not be arc breaking with somebody else itll be present time problem of some kind or another thats causing him to arc break and the present time problem will always be scarcity of auditing its just as actually as simple as that but did somebody else make the auditing scarce before we came along see has something else happened here is there something else now maybe this pc was run consistently and continually maybe they had three hundred hours of auditing and during that whole three hundred hours of auditing their dislocated zorch was occupying the totality of their attention and the auditor was running them on consistently and continually their wife but their attention is not on their wife the attention is on the zorch you got the idea so auditing is what the pc considers frees up his attention and when when his pc is not being addressed where his attention is fixed he doesnt consider it auditing also he doesnt get clear i tell you every few lectures theres one thing you always do wrong and you dont find out what the pc is doing this is the oldest crime of the auditor they never ask enough questions theyre always little bit leery that the pc will arc break or get upset or have his attention dragged off in some fashion if they ask too many questions well of course if they ask bunch of irrevelant hogwash the pcll get upset and the auditor gets educated into believing the pc gets upset by being asked questions by having asked pcs in his early career this auditor has asked pcs lot of hogwash that had nothing to do with it and of course the pc got upset so they get the idea that if you ask the pc too many questions why the pc will get upset and that therefore you should just sit there and run the session well the pc can become quite oblivious of you he can become very upset with whether or not youre there are you there do you know anything about whats going on and the big notknow of the session can become very well what the auditor is doing the auditor know the auditor doesnt know so therefore the auditor has notknow on the session so if the auditor has notknow on the session the whole session becomes notknow you got the idea he gets the idea that he must be withholding something from the auditor because the auditors never asked any questions concerning what was going on now if youre going to ask questions ask pertinent questions but if youre asking pertinent questions dont care how many you ask get very searching i should give you more auditing demonstrations because ill tell you i will just sit and ask pc for minutes at time what hes doing how hes doing it what has been happening and if hes got any picture now and what he is looking at and if theres anything there that he hasnt noticed and all kinds of things of this character you know and id ask him and ask him any pc i audit will always tell you that im very interested in the session or i certainly am looking right down their throats they get sensation of presence in other words but of course these arent just thrownaway questions they are very very pertinent questions always because i really do want to know i i see pc is going this way i want to know whats this all about i dont just say well thats just boiloff and skip it you know whatd you run into you know oh well i just ran into the so on so on and so on and so on well because youre asking him what he was doing and not whats going on in the environment or what youre doing of course his attention is very thoroughly on his case so therefore hes insession because youre keeping his attention on his case by asking him about his case you keep his attention thoroughly on his case what did you do with the last auditing command well i did so and so and so and so and so and so and so and so with it and i say well did you do anything else oh well yes i havent found the auditing command was easy to answer so as matter of fact right in the middle of the thing i always mock up couple of matched terminals you see of the thing and i say well thats very interesting and very very interesting have you gotten anything out of that well as matter of fact i have well now what part of the auditing command havent you answered well soandso and soandso now what was the first time you failed to answer that point oh well it was way back at the beginning of the session all right now you just answer that one again heres the auditing command youd think under this much duress that the pc would be saying oh christ you know am i really being kicked around the track oh he doesnt feel that at all i ask him couple times later you know you still putting those matched terminals up there i dont tell him he mustnt you still putting those oh i as matter of fact i hadnt uh hadnt been doing it hadnt been doing it the last few commands well all right havent been doing it hmhm all right thats good then the auditing command is all right now oh yeah theres nothing wrong with it lets get on with the session you know that sort of thing well thats right thats what were doing now and give him the next auditing command and so forth where is that attention fixed it is something on the order of examining small searchlights that are playing around in the dark and you can actually find out where these searchlights are playing inside that pcs skull all you got to do is ask find out what the hell is going on now you can always mark it down that pc who goes anaten has had drop of havingness so it must be his first and primary havingness is the havingness of an auditor so if pc ever goes anaten hes lost the auditor i always just use that as rule of thumb pc blinks out on i blink in i dont ask him anything as crude as or i never have but i might i wouldnt put anything past in an auditing session but just say you know its an understood question whatever you ask whens the first time you lost the auditor oh well oh hell that was long time ago uh yeah five six minutes ago what happened well i just i just didnt all of sudden i felt very lonely standing out here on this plain oh youre standing on plain i didnt hear about that all right what about this plain well i was standing there and i answered the auditing question and all of sudden here i was standing on this plain all by myself and these cold winds are going by and so forth just like they are now as matter of fact you know and you say well howd the auditing question apply just right there well it applied s well thats thats gone thats gone now and you say well how about these cold winds now how did the auditing question apply about these cold winds what did it have to do with being all alone there and so forth well oh i see what you mean all right what do i mean well heres the guy i was with lying at my feet with knife in his back and you know i didnt notice that before i didnt know that i must have killed him lets see theres nobody else here and i must have killed him could it must have been of course i wouldnt do thing like that you understand and we just got one christawful overt off the thing what did he do you know well he went into some kind of an avoidance mechanism of some kind or another and it compounded the felony and hell pick up some rationale that hes lost the auditor and if you dont give him an auditor back along about that time hell continue to go anaten i could grade your auditing b c d f g simply to the number of minutes of anaten experienced by your pc in session i could just rack it up and just keep count of it you see and grade your auditing and then youd find out that the pc the auditor auditing the pc who had the greatest amount of anaten would have the least auditing presence the first loss of the pc is always the auditor now the pc gets himself into situations and you think that maybe monocentrically that its just things that you do you see that cause him to lose the auditor but i give you synthetic case in point the pc has answered the auditing question finds himself on this lonely plain bounces like mad goes someplace else carrying this terrific feeling of loneliness with him of some kind and of course he is now alone the auditor hasnt done anything but give him an auditing command but the pc feels alone so of course hes lost the auditor because hes alone now pc can get into that kind of situation and go on auto so quick itll make your head swim the number of minutes or hours of anaten of pc in any given intention intensive are direct indication of the presence of the auditor and the solution to the problem is find out find out pc starts going anaten the pc is alone thats all hes not with it hes not with you and something is wrong he is doing retreat and its more than retreat from the bank theres inevitably certain amount of anaten but it ought to get asised rather rapidly with the processes youre running now and it ought to get asised without fogout in present time anaten and boiloff on the part of the pc i dont want to put ideas in your heads as pc but i have to tell you the facts of life over this cup of tea in the kitchen and the facts of life are that auditors who are out of session from the estimation of the pc have pcs who go anaten and thats about all there is to it and the way you get over that barrier is simply just get snoopy and of course if youre finding out where the pcs attention is you naturally will free up lot of the pcs attention which after all is the purpose of auditing so you can do any gods quantity of nagging on the subject you can become the damnedest bore the direction to err however is the direction of too much never too little get awful yappy and questioning in the midst of repetitive command process see give him the auditing command how many needles can sit on the head of an angel you know whatever it is and he says well eightytwo and you say all right have you got picture there oh yes as matter of fact got picture well what is it of is it black and white is it 3d oh tisnt all right all right now what have you had any other pictures just before that yes i did i had couple as matter of fact i still got it see still got one of those one of those its stacked up alongside of this picture oh well is there any part of the auditing command you didnt answer that other time well as matter of fact i was too busy to answer the auditing command the other time well just you answer the auditing command now for the other time all right yeah all right the auditing command was soandso and soandso all right okay now did you answer that one for the other time yeah all right you answered the other one for the other time all right now answer it for now and the auditing command is soandso and soandso okay now how are these pictures stacked up well theyve changed good all right now whats your attention on now all right attention is on this picture all right heres the next auditing command you get this kind of yipyap sounds awful yappy doesnt it doesnt sound like the auditing sessions youve been giving lately either does it you can conceive the pcs attention as small searchlight of which you are handling the handle and you can just take the searchlight around in his skull and you can turn it on anything and up and down illuminate the pictures and so forth after while you can get pretty good at it you yourself of course are looking at something which up to the moment you ask is an unknown how come you can tolerate this much unknownness i cant when i go to motion picture show i dont like to sit facing the back almost never do almost never take cotton for my ears either i like to see the movie i get very interested in this movie now this is whats going on youre youre looking at the blood sweat and tears of the churchills of yesterday youre looking at the cometorealizes you got cometorealizes in this pc that would make bernarr macfadden deep viridian with envy true confession special there i was poor little innocent girl sitting on my the doorstep of my astartes temple sweet innocent overts of any kind and these goddamn soldiers came up and here they are burning the temple down and i didnt do thing we were kind of strangers in the land you see and i had nothing to do with this and what are you looking at you know well im just looking at these soldiers well what are these soldiers doing well theyre pulling down the altar good what else are they doing what else is there well theres nothing else there what else is there nothing theres nothing in the place what else is in the picture the dead body of their captain we stabbed i stabbed you say all right and when did this stabbing occur first time ive heard of this stabbing you know when did this occur well in the first reel of course it was after this night of orgy well what about this night of orgy well its like this the local governor paid us to put on hell of an orgy so the invading troops would get so loused up they wouldnt be able to fight the battle tomorrow and thats the only overt i had except of course killing the general oh it was general yes its general didnt i say all right good well who won the battle oh well hell i never stayed around to find that out they killed oh all right heres the next auditing command and so forth so forth so on whats happening now oh nothing much im up here about fifteen thousand feet above this temple its little tiny block and i say fine all right come on heres the next auditing command whats happening now nothing did you answer the auditing command all right heres the auditing command ill repeat it all right now whats happening oh well you shouldnt ask well why shouldnt i ask well its messy whats messy and so forth well am i ever going to get out of this temple i was fifteen thousand feet up and everything was all right and im right back in the middle of the temple again all right whats going on well its something i forgot to mention before wed poisoned all their wives all right good got picture there yeah oh yeah yeah all right heres the next auditing command got the idea this is conducted cooks tour of the bank and you can get away with an awful lot of auditing just sitting back and repeating the auditing command and never finding out what the pcs doing scientology is at level today where this actually works which is rather fantastic but there are ways man of speeding that up that make that kind of auditing look something like rickety onehorse shay compared to of course jet airliner and its big comparisons and believe when some pc has been audited like that he knows hes been audited he knows it hell tell you too well we got out of that whoohoo you see we got out of that ive even way back when in running engrams and so forth used the word we consistently and continually well where are we now pc probably winds up with bank where ron is but you got to find out whats going on if you dont find out whats going on the pcs attention does this it hits and bounces now this escape mechanism i was talking to you about is always present to some slight degree and hell leave stuck and hell leave stuck and hell leave stuck and hell leave stuck and these stucks finally all compound to kind of dizziness and where is he at well itll come out free in the end itll come out one way or the other just on repetitive auditing rather permissive auditing itll go on and it only adds five times the number of hours necessary to get the same result thats all thats why ive never been down with crusher on this stuff you see i mean thats why i never really raised hell about it one way or the other because theres point if youre going to get there anyway rather smoothly the only thing that restrains from forcing this type of auditing on auditors i mean just forcing it on them and saying this is the way to do it and you better not do it any other way is the fact they can be so damn knuckleheaded occasionally this guy runs into the temple see and hes just now looking with horror as they pull the altar down and find the dead general back of it dont you see and at that moment the auditor has this horrible feeling you know got an engram just like it maybe he was the general and will pull stupid one along about that time you know get stupid about it but the reason im mentioning this to you now so bluntly is because youve got the mechanism for that if you arent doing an escape mechanism of pulling the pcs attention out of the bank pulling the pcs attention out of the bank pulling the pcs attention out of the bank you actually yourself will never ask stupid question in trying to find out what the pcs doing because your question never has the hidden fact from you that youre trying to get the pc to escape of course its damn dangerous to be in temple which is falling down and where one has committed murder with fifteen dozen soldiers around brandishing copper swords very dangerous to be in such locale well the kind auditor says come outside oh youre fifteen thousand feet up above the temple whew boy is there any other zone of life later than that where things were calm you get the idea as long as an auditor experiences impulses matter how obscure to rescue the pc from danger at every side and pull the pc off the bank of course it isnt safe to have an auditor asking very many questions dont you see well thats the whole bug back of this so thats why i today tell you about this other ive told you about the other from time to time well im saying you better do it you better do it pc says well here i am ten thousand feet above this temple and everything is fine now and good we can go on with the session all right is there anything you skipped there just before you went up nothing nothing all right and ill ask another auditing command youve inferred that he go back and take look you see and you ask him the next auditing command what is the most unknown thing you can think of about astarte or something and the pc says you did it to here i am right back in this temple ive been trying to get out of this temple for fifty thousand years and you youre trying to get right back in this temple again and here i am you know its little little accusative feeling well you if feeling defensive and not knowing whether youre right or wrong are liable to take this slight accusative thing as making you actually think you have done something wrong well ill tell you whats wrong is let him out of the temple and let him stick in an exteriorized bounce and then run for the next fifteen sessions ten thousand feet in the air not confronting anything yes im running the auditing command everything is fine theres nothing but peace well the clue is that the bank is as it is because it has so much action and randomity in it and if you cant keep the pc in areas of randomity the pc wont clear up thats all and thats your fivetoone auditing factor which julia here whos been talking about for years thats the bulk of that auditing factor i i was never very allergic to action i havent got to have action i used to drive somebody i knew very well completely stark staring mad because i used to go up and they say what are you going to do you know their whole idea of life you see was to be doing you know be busy be working or something you know and id say well im going up and sit down for while what are you going to do im going to sit down for while yeah well what are you going to read nothing i dont happen to have book right now im interested in what are you going to do im going to sit down for while well what are you going to think about nothing and the person would go absolutely woogo god i could never do that i just think of that awful you know terrible and its unthinkable you know just to do nothing but at the same time its also unthinkable in auditing if you dont get the pc to confront the action which has got him stuck stuck stuck you do not audit the quiet points of the track just skip them although scarcity of action is what is wrong with pc we have to ask how did this scarcity of action occur scarcity of action occurred because of the unpalatability of action ask this horrible question why is this pc sitting there on the plain farming he goes out and he plants these beets see and then they come up very quietly because its very nice climate and the beets come up and then he has the beets thrown into wagon and they are dragged off to the beet store see and next season he plants the beets and every sunday he goes to the same church and he hears the same sermon and he listens to the same confounded hymns and he goes back and forth and he walks on the same paths and if you talk to him very very much you would find out that it was dangerous to do anything else thats the keynote the great payoff of being quiet of being still of never being in motion the enormous bonus this pays is always you wont get hurt thats the superbooster of conservatism and such things you know we wont go into any motion because if we do well get hurt what taught him this so you find this pc sitting there complaining about the fact that there is action there is nothing happens in life he is bored he is bored in life nothing is ever happening and you say well all right lets go join the marines eh well well what are you going to do well next sunday im going to go to church what are you going to do monday well im going to go out and hoe the beets what are you going to do tuesday oh tuesday thats my day to clean up the smokehouse and you say well you say lifes pretty boring huh oh yeah lifes awful boring it just runs the same routes the same routes same routes well fine lets join the air force oh well well why not join the air force well you might get hurt or things would run wrong you know action has been given bad name its discreditable action is now discreditable youll find the whole literature of the society at this particular time is devoted to the discreditability of action people go into action they get in trouble this is obvious read any novel if you dont believe this heroes longer dash over the top and emerge unscathed with medals pinned to their bare skin theyre sort of sick in the trench you see and they crawl over the top because theyre so tired you know and just the moment they stand up they are severely wounded you see and then theyre carted off to very brutal hospital you see where its all pain and then they get letter that emily has left them shes run off with the iceman now action has been given bad name why why if the pc is so starved for action if hes so bored with the dolessness you would think offhand then that there was just scarcity of action you see you might think it worked out this way that there was scarcity of action because he wasnt in action you know theres scarcity of action because hes in situation in life where he cant have any action this is quite obvious isnt it i mean thats the first thing that you might adjudicate on the subject of course he has scarcity of action because hes clerk and he sits in this office all day long you see and he doesnt even have any excitement on the lines he doesnt have anything to judge or say or do or anything else theres nothing really going on he has figures he knows nothing about which he enters in ledger that he knows nothing about which goes to destination he knows nothing about and you say well that man is suffering from scarcity of action because hes not in action now what is he doing doing that that is the proper question to ask action must have gotten bad name how did action get bad name well hed been working at it for couple of hundred thousand years therefore it must be pretty desirable if it has that much of bad name and it is very desirable so the faster you get pc over the idea of the discreditable nature of action the more the pc is going to move out of those quiet areas on the track too because hes keeping those to make sure that he doesnt go into action hell keep those very closely hell have this whole long life you see as beet farmer hes got this beautiful life as beet farmer and you ask him well now how many angels can stand on the head of pin and you think youre getting someplace you know you just think youre just roaring around like mad because youre getting little tone arm motion and everythings going along all right and you however along about this time should be asking what sort of picture does he have where is he what is he doing what is he doing there well he hasnt noticed what hes doing either but hes asked answered the question well eighteen what sort of picture do you have there with that well i got picture of this old country church and the organ is playing rather badly and out of tune and so on and you say all right how many angels can stand on the head of pin and he says well seventeen and you say what kind of picture you got there well ive got this long country lane and the quiet white clouds drifting by well if you kept check on it youd find out hed had these things for the last eight sessions and hes going to have them for the next eighteen sessions why not hes running all the safe spots on the track of course you say well what does this picture look like well this picture looks like its just just picture well how big is this picture well this picture is about uh oh its about two feet by two feet well does the picture have breadth in any way its just small little picture well does it have any dimension it doesnt have any dimension well is that the size your pictures always are oh yes yes well what color is it well theres color in it is there any picture above or below it haaaarup blow the whole thing huh liable to have very quietly kept all of these very quiet lives there and theyre actually running through blood and guts man the whole way only he doesnt put any attention on those at all if you start asking him to look around hell find out some things hell find out how pictures ought to look youd be amazed what the ideas people have as to what their pictures should look like though its not up to you to correct them but its sure up to you to find out youd just be fascinated what some people think picture is had pc had cognition the other day just on this basis i always thought every picture i had should be 3d in all directions 360 degrees and therefore i didnt think i had any pictures because my pictures werent like that if i were looking at book it was just picture of book well what else was their attention on how could they have anything but picture of book if all they were looking at was book what did they think they had some kind of machine that did 360 degree cinemascope that somehow or another put it in they they of course theyve got the pictures they got they have the pictures of what they saw naturally and only the pictures of what they saw but they have some weird ideas about pictures believe and every one of those weird ideas about pictures is backed up with the discreditability of action ill give you little sequence that you might be interested in on that basis i think ive mentioned this to you before but its rather startling it took by storm all right auditing question cognition the greeks had books printed books how did the greeks print the printed books well they printed the printed books this way and so forth auditing question well what do you know the egyptians printed books too all right howd they print books well soandso and soandso and soandso and the auditing question and so forth and the auditing question the auditing question what kind of picture have you got there well ive got picture its picture its auditing question what picture you got there same picture well auditing question what picture you got there same picture has anything changed in that picture not for the last five six auditing questions all right whats the exact mechanic present here books is there anything more quiet than books youre going down the middle of roaring action chain man except of course youre going down it on the basis of the stable datum the quietude the quietness is core in the middle of some hurricane youre going down books wheres the hurricane and this interesting idea was injected into the session why dont you look on the other side of the picture and at that moment boom what was on the other side of the picture some of the goddamnedest fights that anybody ever saw but it was an awfully quiet picture about egyptian books you get the idea well now pc will just stay there on that nice quiet chain bouncing from one quiet sunday to the next quiet sunday bouncing from old hundred straight into lead kindly light until you tell him to look and how do you tell him to look by asking him what the hell is going on auditing question whats going on auditing question auditing question auditing question whats going on now auditing question auditing question you got picture all right what is it of all right whats going on auditing question auditing question auditing question got picture got picture now has it changed any what whats it look like now whats happened here see well theres some more of these books oh i see theres this stack of books now yeah auditing question auditing question whats going on now well theres this small number of books theyre pretty books you know theyre awfully pretty books now the danger point is asking the pc question he cant answer such as what are the books about he doesnt know it you know its just books see asking him for particularity that he wouldnt possibly have the answer to is the kind of question that will get you into trouble if any question of this character would get you into trouble but even question of that character gets you into less trouble than total neglect of the whole situation so you could very easily say all right is there anything else around there just books well where are all these books well theyre just here in this bookstore okay auditing question auditing question what kind of picture now oh just this bookstore im very grateful to you you know i hadnt realized it was bookstore its very beautiful books theyre all down the shelves and everything auditing question auditing question what you got picture of now oh just this bookstore whats outside the bookstore boom he ran bookstore on the alaskan frontier three killed every morning before breakfast on the front steps got the idea you can do certain amount of direction of the pcs attention by asking him questions and as long as these questions do not yank their attention off the subject on which it is operating he will get into trouble whatsoever as long as you dont say oh look at something else im tired of you looking at books or as long as you dont say some other auditing command change the process and he says why well you arent getting along well enough you see with that particular process and this is all invalidative of what the pcs doing but just finding out what he is doing and what he is looking at and ask him to look around little bit more this type of interrogation and questioning and so forth can become more illuminative than anything you ever saw and then on top of it any time you see violent escape of some kind or another scent that he must have escaped from discreditable action of some kind or another and ask him if there was ever did he tell you everything there was to know in that sequence which he just left is there anything that you left unknown about that sequence you know is there anything in there that you didnt quite look over well im safely out of that now and i dont think we need to talk about that anymore because we got out of that all right and you say good what did you get out of exactly well there youve done it you see i mean here i am right back in here ive been trying for eighteen thousand years to get out of this temple and here youve got back in this temple again well whats going on in there anyway oh this is where we tortured the victims what victims oh these victims who tortured them those high priests i didnt have anything to do with it you know what am i doing with all these gowns on you know yeah well theres something i i just realized i i was the high priest oh well yes yeah i i see what you mean yeah this isnt so good here is it and so forth all right ill give you the next auditing question of course its the auditing question that got him into this mess and its the pc thats jumping out of mess and its the auditor that gets him to apply the auditing question to the mess you see but he does it rather delicately by just asking him whats going on what are you looking at what does it consist of is there anything else is there something you havent mentioned in that sequence about the fur trade industry now that we just you dont seem to be in now is that gone oh yes oh thats gone well just moment ago you had pictures of all these canoes what you got picture of now sky got picture of the sky what sky is it oh its the beautiful sky of normandy i dont have any more to do with this this fur trade industry you see i im out of that you see im all out of that all out of the fur trade industry now the wrong question and the question the auditor would ask who thought it would be good thing to get the pc out of all that dangerous area would be well what does the normandy sky look like you say well what happened to those canoes you know aside from the fact that you are interested and youre curious they there were these eighteen canoes going down the river one after the other and they were all full of painted savages and that was the last you ever heard of it well i dont let people run continued stories on im not expecting him to run into these canoes somewhere up the track in another fiftyseven hours of auditing i want to know about those canoes now what happened to them the last auditing command i gave you had canoes now you dont have canoes what is this all about well i was an indian hey what do you know i was in the canoes oh this was just before they went over the rapids haha yes glug and you say all right next auditing question next auditing question yeah we went over the rapids and that was it and were all drowned and now im back here in this beautiful normandy sky and you say all right good enough good enough all right now how many how many people did you see anybody elsse in the water there in the rapids at all uh next auditing question well as matter of fact there were about twenty and you say well thats good thats good thats fine next auditing question next auditing question next auditing question thats fine now whatve you got picture of well this beautiful normandy sky and you say thats good now what happened to the canoes did they just drift away after they went over the oh auditing question auditing question oh god almighty whats the matter now ugluhuglugluh i got terrible somatics in my throat well whats the matter whats happening whats happening well after we got all dumped in the water the fur trappers on the shore started firing volleys into us oh oh yeah and they killed everybody you see this was big lose for i was big chief you see i had been over in england and i picked up one of these indians so i decided to i i thats right thats the way that went yeah thats right and then all of sudden the english attacked and that was so on and i was indian thats right and yeah heres the picture heres the picture youve been looking for you know and all of sudden the whole sequence the unknowns vanish out of the thing and the thing is all clear and he can look at it and not look at it and he skips it and so forth and hes not running away from it anymore do you follow that but its very adroit auditing that does that because you can be totally knuckleheaded and ask all the wrong questions but it is better to ask some questions than none at all the way to err is being too yappy and the way to make mistakes is never to say anything because the pc will just bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce never confront and its just like the present time problem i started in to tell you about at the beginning of the lecture and that present time problem is simply there and the pc knows hes got it but 1a wont let him run it so in that particular case you overtly direct the pcs attention you see with the auditing command you say what is unknown about that problem about teacups hes worried about his teacups you see and you run that flat hes interested the whole way he knows hes getting auditing well now if you keep directing his attention back into where his attention is really fixed and those points from which hes trying to escape boy does he know hes getting auditing see by definition he knows hes getting auditing to the degree that his attention is being directed where it is already stuck his attention is already stuck there even though hes escaped out of there so he knows hes getting auditing if his attention is freed from the spot and not permitted to escape from the spot you see and by asking questions at all your pc has illusion of being audited at all and wouldnt even really believe that session is in progress so how do you get person insession well you direct their attention find out where their attention is so forth and they know theyre getting audited you find out where their attention is stuck you guess where the attention is stuck put it back there you say it must be still stuck there you dont get normandy skies you dont get normandy skies in the middle of rapids in the north american wilderness full of savages the normandy skies are awfully quiet so the guy must have moved into stable datum and must have escaped from action now what on earth was the action and of course you yourself are interested and if you yourself really want to know what the action is you will find out and of course that is what his attention is stuck on and the pc winds up with action not being discreditable he takes care of all this up to this time hes got it all justified your pc is normally leading quiet life and he is walking to church every sunday and he is listening to lead kindly light and the highest randomity that he runs into carefully is that some sundays they play old hundred you find that sort of sequence here in present time hes leading that kind of life you have to suspect at once that action has become discreditable and that he cant have it and that hes very carefully not having any action well of course the healing from that of course makes you direct his attention over into the zones of action and the zones of action then becoming inspected he becomes more familiar with it he recognizes that he could have action that action isnt quite that bad he becomes more familiar with it and there he is okay its very simple all you have to do is do it okay thank you
