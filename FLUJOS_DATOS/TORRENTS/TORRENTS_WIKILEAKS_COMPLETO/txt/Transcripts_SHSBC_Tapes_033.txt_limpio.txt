withholds lecture given on 14 july 1961 thank you okay what is this this is the audience 14th 14th of july ad 11 okay i can at least remember the year all right its very difficult subject that i have to touch on very very difficult subject is youre dragging your heels youve been outpassed youve been outpassed they just made three clears in south africa on the course there clearing goes by contagion its contagious you make clear now look what happens went down to south africa and on course made clear see all right big reality was established right at that point promptly and immediately peter williams goes back over to australia and makes two clears see boom this clear now teaching course down in south africa has cleared some fantastic percentage like i dont know what it is three out of four three out of seven or something like this that was on this unit interesting isnt it whos going to be the first clear here tomorrow tomorrow all right lets get on the ball youve got to create new reality and set good example and stop setting this aberrated example to people now lets set good example to people now youre doing all right what weve been doing ill tell you what the difference was what the difference is all these clears have been made very close to assessment only you understand its practically nothing but routine 3 that is clearing them got it but let point out something very drastic here very small percentage is making it on routine 3 yeah its making it but small percentage is making it now why rudiments are so far out on the vast majority of people that putting in the rudiments becomes fantastically arduous proposition not necessarily difficult but whole activity has to be devoted to this thing called rudiments hence you have the first part of session if youve ever cared to notice is getting the pc under control you at least have to get him to set down in chair before you can establish rudiments you understand routine 1 all right now out and above that comes routine 1a that takes care of the alteris characteristics of the pc and takes care of present time problems as bugaboo from there on because the only people she didnt clear were people who had screaming present time problems that nobodyd located see that its common denominator all right so our next part of the program of course is to get these present time problems swept right straight off the slate just set this up and set up this wide percentage you see and get all of these withholds that are slowing it down to walk off hence your routine 1 and your routine 1a these are preparatory were not looking for an occasional clear we are looking for very broad clearing you understand any time for years i could have made clear well i did and have done it so what see where has this gone well i could probably sit down and do nothing but audit twentyeight hours day and i could probably turn out few dozen clears in my lifetime and that would be dandy and then i go out and get mixed up in an altercation called life or something like that or the body decays or something like that and nobody else makes any clears and then youve got buddhism thats pretty good that would be nice thats just what this planet needs just exactly what it needs just needs bunch of brass idols thats just what it needs because thats all anybody has ever understood out of buddhism all right so that obviously has been tried and i wouldnt advocate that particular route it has already been tried and its actually strewn with the whitened bones of busted psyches that whole route looks like chart of death valley there are so many routes been tried so many routes that one of the most difficult things is not getting curious when you cross some of their old ruts and you know you say oh isnt it interesting look at the oregon pioneers and they went up that way well all right lets walk through that woods that was very interesting and look at that water hole all surrounded by bones and busted wagon wheels and lets go little bit further maybe somebody found something out there and theres range of mountains over there yeah well maybe somebody can cross that and the next thing you know why somebodys sitting and there is way out see they cant even find the trail back man so frankly the piloting of dianetics and scientology is not so much through wilderness or an untrodden desert waste you see that nobody has ever been in the trouble with plotting dianetics and scientology is it is nothing but solid trails something on the idea of tracking five hundred horses which have gone in all directions you know and youre trying to find youre trying to find new trail in the middle of all these horse marks and thats all they are too horse marks okay now as we go forward here we find that itd be very easy to trip up and to take some old cockeyed route that has never led anywhere and never will and this is pretty darn good that somebody else is clearing this is pretty darn good and were clearing closeup and then theyre clearing at distance and now theyre clearing at bit of remote distance in time this looks very promising see looks very good but the only flaw in all this is broad clearing you want to be able to take joe aloysius q doakes that was not his fathers name but well let it pass and by getting without getting fancy and without having to become screamingly brilliant in all directions as an auditor and without having to sit up half of the night figuring out the starplot of george q aloysius doakes why clear him all right now were on to that right now were on to that right now with routine 1 routine 1a and i have not said very much about routine 2 theres only one addition that has routine 2 this has been hanging fire for some time i better give you the changes which have taken place in the prehav scale change number one is drop motion drop the line motion just leave it blank leave the number blank now salt through the lot beginning up around one and so forth salt through the lot of it which way they go and where they belong isnt very important every basic emotion you have ever seen on tone scale as part of your routine and ordinary assessment you know serene and all the rest of it on that line in other words put all those emotions into the prehav scale there is several ways you could do it you could put them all in their proper place on the scale well leave that up to ill do that sooner or later or you could just take those emotions and just read them off every time after youve read the prehav scale see theres not i dont think theres thirty of them there are very few number now people that get stuck in chronic tone and you can get rid of that chronic tone you can get rid of it its good thing to do and youll find your pc will fall on that chronic tone you just run it routine 2 see or if it falls while youre running routine 3 why you run it on the terminal you know would god be angry you know how would you make god angry thank you how would god make you angry thank you how would god how would another make god angry thank you or how would god make another angry thank you how would another make god angry thank you how would god make god angry or how would god make himself angry that would be your bracket you see if you ran across this tone scale now it would follow and fall right along with the prehav scale you understand it follows the same characteristic it has special activity read diagnosis anything its just its more levels of the scale and you assess it by elimination and so forth and you just go over those things too every time those things have been with us since the earliest days of dianetics and there is sense in neglecting them now that we got it on the run all right now were looking for very broad clearing very very broad clearing and we want to take somebody thats lying unconscious up in the hospital non compos mentis and havent known anybody for eighteen years and run them through to clear get the idea i mean that that is the reductio ad absurdum on the thing i wouldnt say and i am not on the track of some things that would work this way you find thetan after hes just dropped body and you audit him through to clear see now we havent got any summated data that leads on that track thats not an examined road one of the requisites of clear right now is the odd limitation that the thetan must be in body so thats as far south as we happen to be going at the present moment see in the first place youd have to be something on the order of ot before you could pick up this character and audit him see so that requires different skill and different lineup and different location of the pc and different version of cchs and the lot you see give that give that beam thank you but there is about where we are now we are doing this and with your sec checks youre taking care of withholds and with your various problem factors youre taking care of problems and those are the primary hangups i am perfectly prepared as i have said before to suddenly find out that arc breaks might constitute some specialized activity they basically however fall under ow do you see and they are junior to withholds by considerable but you still might find some pc who did nothing but arc break and if he did nothing but arc break i imagine the oldest remedy we have on that is recall an arc break and thats quite slippy one man thats quite process any process ever calculated to turn on track and tie double carrick bends in the preclear that was it recall an arc break they all do because you see they run themselves backwards on it all the time you know they call it motivator motivator motivator motivator george did this to and bill did that to and mamma did that to and somebody else did that to did that to did that to did that to umm boomm boomm mm they go down scale in hurry but if you kept on pushing it they eventually come up and find out they did something too its workable process the process is perfectly workable i would say offhand if i were auditing somebody who was consistently and continually arc breaking and i just couldnt get them into session because they were arc breaking and all that kind of thing im afraid i would be more inclined to recall an arc break than i would be to go out on the cchs person is perfectly capable of running communication process you know of one kind or another so we say communication process recall an arc break he will do that he is arc breaking you are paralleling what the mind is doing and id say it was perfectly legitimate as an activity if you ran into this factor of somebody did nothing but arc break and then youve pretty well covered the rudiments because youve got find the have process you see and that gives them the room and youve got lots of rudiments processes which are the best ones to find the auditor the best way to find an auditor is of course the cchs and the processes which already exist on model session the old look at who am i is kind of weird lethal killer when columns b c d consistently and continually register as low on repetitive examination of profile that is profile every intensive and you find b c d that area in there low you can make an adjudication out of that the pc has not found the auditor now there are two causes for this the auditor is incapable of making an impingement on the pc see the auditor thinks hed better audit sort of in the back of his head you know and nobody ever quite finds out whether hes auditing or not that could happen you understand that could happen or the commoner cause of the pc just cannot register an effect cannot stand or tolerate an effect of any kind cannot stand or tolerate control of any kind and on pc whose profile continues consistently and forever low on b c d and you are trying to run problems or youre trying to run some other remedy on this pc formulas problems something just anything to get him off the bottom there youre wasting time youre just wasting time now lets say we audited somebody just fine on problems for twentyfive hours and when we examine their profile the following monday for their next twentyfive hours we find out he didnt get off the register on b c and d see theyre all low and they didnt move and nothing happened well dont come on down on the auditor with thud and so on thats an entirely different activity training auditors and setting them right and so on the auditor probably was not effective in some fashion or he didnt get the ptp or he didnt get the withhold or he didnt get something but theres very easy way to shortcircuit this you already must credit the fact that the auditor was undoubtedly trying to do something for those first twentyfive hours you see he was trying to do something and you could go in and check it over and youd find the ptp you would youd find ptp if you looked for it hard enough and so forth the easier thing to do however is just say 1a run 1a thats good broad remedy for an hgc d of p assoc sec hco sec sort of remedy they just see this character is hanging up and then without going and inquiring and running congressional investiga oh well id hardly say wed ever run congressional investigation were not trying for publicity thats all congressional investigation does you should hear those guys by the way lets see how can i get some publicity so i can be reelected well i think ill investigate scientology yes thats it thats good idea youll hear that someday but remember that if you ever do hear it to immediately convene an investigation of congress but the upshot of hung profile at levels b c d those levels are down there about minus seventy or more your standard remedy is routine 1a all right now if routine 1a does not budge this in twentyfive hours im getting talking about awful difficult cases here im giving you good way out see you tried routine 1a the first week and the case didnt move let let review this just scrub what i said routine 1a didnt move the pc see when we assume then that while doing the security check and everything else certainly there was every opportunity to find withholds there was every opportunity to get the case started and instead of just being critical and coming down on the auditor and batting our brains out and that sort of thing shift them over to routine 1 got it run routine 1 for twentyfive hours now quite amazingly it will now be possible for you to check over the case if it still didnt move much you see but that would be at the beginning of the third twentyfive hours now what do you do at the beginning of the third twentyfive hours this case didnt move for two consecutive intensives at columns b c d of the graph what do you do well certainly dont let it go any further than the beginning of the third twentyfive hours before you act but dont much bother to act until then that would be the rule you should follow when youre monitoring cases audited by other people you should saw in now with your emeter and get clever with the sensitivity up to 32 funny thing about it is at twentyfive hours of problems if they wouldnt show on the profile has still done something and twentyfive hours of the cchs although it didnt show on the profiles have still done something but all they have done is arm the firing mechanism this is why its really fruitless for you to have tried anything before this time or have scolded auditors or jumped up and down because all theyve done is arm the firing mechanism now youre going to ask this case youre going to talk to this case youre going to talk to this person personally on girltogirl basis or mantoman basis or mantogirl basis or versawise and youre going to say now put all your hairpins on the table because here we go and just check those rudiments until they just about fry the atmosphere see are you withholding anything from the auditor weve got the sensitivity all the way up we can hardly read it you see because the thing is the needle is so drifty sensitivity all the way up and we say all right are you withholding anything from your auditor see and you dont get reaction have you thought of withholding anything from your auditor have you ever discussed it with yourself whether or not you should tell your auditor this have you ever decided that it was good to have told your auditor this have you ever decided that it wouldnt do your case any benefit really because little thing like that which you havent mentioned and you dont know little thing like that certainly wouldnt hold up case have you ever thought that you get the idea its awfully awfully rightdowntorock drilling see and on questions of this character which are all crossleading and which are rather unsettling you know what the person has done sometime during that period of time they have undoubtedly come up and said well i probably ought to confess to the fact that i did rob my piggy bank when i was three you know and have said well that couldnt possibly have suppressed my case and so they have notised it and for moment it was on registry but immediately afterwards wasnt well youve got to kick it back on nonregistry off of nonregistry and back onto registry the way you do this is run notis type of questioning on all of your rudiments now what do i mean by notis type of questioning well i just gave you an example have you ever thought that it really wouldnt hold up your case any if you didnt tell your auditor something there it is what was that and of course youre sitting right on it what have you done youve done the notis see youve picked up these moments of notis because youre going on the assumption that this case has been thinking about something or this case has been stewing about something or this case is reacting about something during that whole fifty hours of auditing have you got it the case must have sooner or later come through something and factually itd be impossible if the case hasnt but remember that case that hangs fire has this wrong with it it has an automatic notis and when youve got an automatic notis it can wipe out the needle read thing comes up to reality the person pushes it back see notis for split instant when it came up to reality it registered and then the person said it doesnt exist see and the notis machinery took over and said nuunh and it went right back out of sight again and didnt register on the needle after that in other words theres just fringe level now this is case that could go out and murder half dozen babies and have an opportunity to shoot policeman and didnt this is case that could have all sorts of oddball things in its background and tell them to you in just steady stream on security check without your ever getting reaction got the idea you just never get reaction on the security check you say why on earth isnt this reacting on the needle well it isnt reacting on the needle because it isnt real to him he doesnt think its bad and he is actually running on about the second inversion of the notis see he knows about it but its all notised you wont get any registry you wont get any case advance either those cases are hangfire cases so you get very expert in taking them apart dont however get into state of outrage when you do this with the auditor who has done the auditing or even with yourself if youve done the auditing for that first fifty hours dont get in state of outrage and say well he missed it and i had to dig it up that is not correct statement i had to dig it up is correct statement but he missed it is incorrect because it normally wasnt there in the first place he was busy running give that hand when it came up he didnt even have the person on an emeter it registered for moment it got awfully real for moment and the person said oh my god i uhhzzzzzzz notis out she went you know now your line of questioning can actually dig it up out of the auditing youre not trying to dig it up out of his life youre trying to dig it up out of his auditing the lock at the most is even if theyre being run fragmentarily is only few weeks old dig it up out of their auditing and you talk about auditing all the time youre checking this person over who has had gain for two consecutive intensives see just dig it up out of his auditing youll find its there youll find its there youll find an amazing number of things that come up during the auditing they just had not mentioned to the auditor you get the type of questioning this would amount to you see the type of questioning would be very simple type of questioning which is about him and the auditor him and his auditing now at any time during your auditing have you felt that it was improper to audit in that particular auditing room all right now youve put it on via so therefore its safe see the question is on wide via if you say to him is it all right if i security check you in this room or if i run these rudiments or do scout of rudiments on you in this room thats not real unreality is the common denominator of this case that doesnt make the advance you see thats unreal but asking him about being audited in another room that you are not now in thats safe see that could be real and all of sudden comes up with this remarkable series of complaints well i just never mentioned it to the auditor but theres lavender picture on the wall and ive always detested lavender ever since i broke bottle of it over my grandmothers head do you see and ive always detested it and they dont remark the idea that the smell of lavender and the picture color lavender have nothing in common except some letters in the english alphabet you pick things up that way pick them up on via that isnt the only trick in doing research of this character on rudiments that isnt the only trick but it is very good trick you should ask any way you possibly can is there any time in your life you ever felt that you were completely beyond help ah what was that oh well that was when i was eighteen and uh goodness id forgotten all about this but this was when i was eighteen and suchandso happened and i didnt dare tell my parents and uh uhhuhhuhhuhhuh well have you told your auditor oh well you see that was long time ago and that was when i was eighteen see you get the tricky way of going about this in other words you release the notises have you ever felt that you were beyond help well obviously the guy had just done something and the person must have been withholding something even if it was just his body during such period dont you see so you can indulge in tremendous amount of very tricky questioning i could probably write down series of thirty or forty rules or types of questions theyd probably be very handy to have but i havent developed them ive not ever seen any need to develop them you usually look at the pc and you size him up and you find out about which way this thing is going and you count on the fact then that during period of cchs during 1a something has come to the surface and has possibly disappeared and it isnt registering now but it came to the surface during auditing and anything that happened during auditing you can make it reregister on an emeter so you get the registry of the registry see its too direct to get registry for this pc but you can get registry of registry get via you get how you might go about this type of questioning well you should study to get clever about this you should study how to get clever about it its just cleverness thats all you sit there and the person says now have you failed to tell your auditor anything and you dont even get disturbed needle it just sits there calm ive told my auditor everything well technically in childlike way this is true but the reverse question is quite interesting you see have you ever thought of telling your auditor anything and then didnt do so ohhh oh well and you get needle read you see this is an equivocation the person really has told his auditor everything that he thought he should tell his auditor is the qualifying statement which he doesnt add on to it and the notis machinery is of course why its sitting there and you could study to get very clever with this and it requires bit of cleverness the bit of cleverness will save you any quantity of auditing time you get clever right about this point but i wouldnt bother to get clever at the beginning in the first place nothings been plowed up its like trying to plant seeds or reap grain off of unplowed unsowed ground hes been going along like this all of his life and he knows its all right he knows its all right to live like this you know constant migraine headache and sick stomach and hating everybody he knows its okay thats normal isnt it thats what psychologist would tell you normal state of man just read what his opinion of man is and of course you get what he thinks the normal state of man is and its pretty wild so this is all right you see well of course people rob banks and rape billy goats and so forth so its all right see everything is all right and you get out meter well of course youre asking for disagreement the only thing meter ever registers on is disagreement i pulled one right straight on the groove not very long ago and i just chucked all silly questioning and i said well have there been any disagreements in the last few weeks with anything anywhere you know of course i got registry i got tired of talking into the blue you know and i just got registry bang all right now what were you disagreeing with there see oh well at holy you know i mean whole bunch of stuff comes off on this now have you got any have you had ever had any disagreements with about whats going on here and so forth clang you see and immediately before this do you have an arc break do you have present time problem have you got any withholds all blank blank blank blank blank but now sudden dissertation on the subject of disagreements do you have any disagreement with whats been happening to you in the last couple of weeks oh well comes to that thats another proposition you see you say well have you had any unkind thoughts about your auditor oh registry see do you have any disagreements with whats been happening to you in the last couple of weeks clang well now what was that and we get this on viaviavia we have gotten hit the jackpot they sit there all the time thinking unkind thoughts about their auditor see pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa only you see this is ordinary and its what everybody does i refer you to dianetics evolution of science the everybody knows because what youre running into is the everybody knows when youre trying to crosscheck rudiments see this is normal you know horses sleep in beds bang normal everything is normal everything is normal to this pc of course nothing is normal in actual fact the pc has migrosis and his zorch is out of place and all this is pretty goofy see and he really knows that it is not normal the pc knows but the valence that he is being considers it all normal you sometimes just for fun and just for exercise should just lay aside your knowingness hat of you know what is going on and start asking somebody just right off the bat what is life really like you know some raw meat someplace and just ask this character you know what is life really like what are people really like what are things really like and so forth and just get treated to ball its pretty wild now you go to jail and start asking this question and you get some of the wildest answers actually its better than comic book practically they just stagger you all over the jail aisles you just ask prisoner after prisoner each one of them knows what normalcy is each one of them they know it perfectly and theyre the wildest divergencies of anything you ever heard of and they have some of the wildest opinions on things you ever heard of they couldnt possibly be further off of the line you know you could take tractor or tank and drive all day and all night at right angles to any known highway and you still wouldnt get as far off the line as theyve managed and then they say well life just doesnt run right for you see well this universe in which they have gone up the pole of course hasnt anything to do with it so you start asking anybody about the rightness or wrongness of their deeds or actions or the rightness or wrongness of their opinions or the differences of their conduct when all of their conduct is aberrated and of course you get falls on an emeter see i mean thats all usual so there cant be any disagreement because theyre in total agreement with themselves while being in total disagreement with everything and you dont get fall on the emeters do you understand how this is we described this in various ways we say well its below the fellows level of reality well what do we mean by that statement exactly well we mean something very precise by that we mean that he has some specialized compartmented values of existence which have nothing to do with existence its below his level of reality well his level of reality is the clue what is his level of reality well its up some firemans pole someplace that hasnt anything to do with the sun moon or stars or another human being anyplace or anything you see it is total unreality but of course this is reality so of course it doesnt register when you ask him for difference you say have you had an unkind thought about anybody lately and it would even be too much insight for them to say not any more than usual but thats what they mean have you had an unkind thought about anybody lately well theyll give you all kinds of qualifications about this sort of thing but of course it doesnt register on the meter because its totally rationalized you know just going around flattering about everybody and how bad everybody is and how everybody ought to be shot and somebody hands you sandwich in restaurant and right away there is long stream about how their thumb shouldnt have been on top of the plate and the plate should have been set down in more geographical position in the middle of the table and all of this sort of thing or let the fellow says well this is life it never occurs to him that he could sit in chair and have somebody simply bring sandwich and put it on the table and that he sits there and eats the sandwich that just is not life you see reality is natter natter natter natter natter and theres always something wrong with the sandwich see its all awry but the very complexity of the disagreement with everything adds up to noregistry because of course the disagreement is in total agreement with the way things should be and when disagreement is in total agreement why of course you get registry so thats the kind of person youre trying to run rudiments on and check rudiments and do rudiment scout with after let us say something like week of 1a didnt move anything like profile week of cchs didnt move anything see aw hell man that is something that is something on the order of putting somebody in flour barrel and then bringing them out and there is not speck of flour on them believe its impossible it just couldnt happen something has happened but the automatic notis will be of such magnitude the automatic disagreer that is in such disagreement with everything that you are in perfect agreement with it this thing has been disturbed by that auditing fifty hours of this and that didnt get disturbed in any way well at least youll find the periods of disturbance all of sudden you will find these periods of disturbance and thats what youre trying to find and these things will kick these things will go blang and follow them down follow them down follow them down follow them down i dont have any present time problem i havent had any present time problems during auditing i havent been worried about anything registry on the meter either well is there anything you should have been thinking about other than auditing oh well yes of course registry on the meter whats that well its my divorce yes i should have been thinking about my divorce you got the idea you say what divorce oh well didnt you know thats always part of the response on such an interrogation it always has lot to do with well didnt you know or i told you all about it dont you remember that six or eight months ago you met on the corner of the street and you said to you said how are you and i said i think i will get divorced dont you remember my doing this you see it probably never happened either oh i told you all about that you know ive told my auditor about this whole thing in full youll get that kind of response and if you dont follow it through with exactly what did you tell your auditor about it youre going to be fooled again well what did you tell your auditor about this divorce well i said i was little worried at the beginning of one session did you tell your auditor about what you were worried oh well yeah i told the auditor all about it hes saying you see all about it this is qualified broad carelessly used interpretation yes i said to the auditor i was little bit worried did the auditor ask what you were worried about well yes as matter of fact the auditor said what are you worried about what did you say you were worried about i said life and you go back in the auditing reports and you will actually find it and youll find there was needle registry and when they said life it cleared and that was it the notis went bang see and there it all went youll find people straining to get clear something on the order of submariners try to get out of submarine that is immovably fixed on the bottom and will never come to the surface anymore for gods sakes find out what submarine you know whats her name rank and serial number you know on the bottom of what sea oh well ive told everybody about that everybody knows all about this submarine im trying to escape from yes im being evicted next month you say from where well from my sisters oh well what about this what about this eviction how come and so forth well its because of what the police did last month you say whoa boy where we goin here see its like taking billiard ball and throwing it on billiard table you know and it caroms off all sides and bounces and falls on the floor then you dont even find billiard ball there anymore so you expect its okay nevertheless they become vaguely aware of billiard ball during the auditing you see and you can track it back you get some goofy ones well why are they goofy well thats because life is totally identified with everything so nothing makes any sense anyhow so theres sense in disagreeing with him youre looking at some kind of superapathy of one character or another this is life you know is kind of its motto and youve got to do some smart checking back thats all and if youre smart enough you can really start unveiling the statues man the place will look like an art gallery before you get through you know well have you ever consulted anything during your last two weeks of auditing have you ever consulted anything to find out whether or not you were improving and you get fall thats the first anybody ever heard of the hidden standard see have you ever asked anybody if you were getting better during the last two weeks of auditing see that kind of dissertation oh well yes of course i asked my wife well what did she say she said she didnt think id ever get better and in that way you can drift in sideways on something the pc is actually not being willfully mean the pc is not trying to obscure anything the pc is not trying to withhold or anything else the pcs opinions of life are just sufficiently abstruse that they dont add up to disagreement you see because that is life theyve gone up some gully someplace and its way off the mainstream and there they are you know and they worried little bit they kind of know theyre up gully and theyll tell you well i dont feel emotional anymore about things you see i dont get kick out of life anymore just things dont seem good to and i just seem to be little anxious all the time and so on they make these general statements of some kind or another well all they are telling you is the mainstream of life went thataway and somewhere along the line i considered it was just too much so i went up this little gully and ive been lying here in the midst of the dead leaves ever since and if you dig out of here of course youll put back in the mainstream of life again and thats good because thats too horrible you see and thats impossible and if i just lie here and not feel anything and not see anything and not hear anything ill be all right so just go away quietly and let the robins cover one leaf at time that is the supergeneralized solution that people take they find the back bayous of the muddy river you know and they go in there and after that they dont even catch any catfish but they are worried about the fact that they know they shouldnt be there and they know they shouldnt be doing that and they know that thats good to do that now pcs who apparently have never had anything happen to them have led perfectly calm orderly lives and yet still dont improve in any fashion whatsoever ohoh their tale of the calm orderly life and that sort of thing you could sing little song about it may be so but i really dont know your story sounds so queer the truth of the matter is that youve got case on the back bayous you see the case is up this little gully lying there in the black mud and they hope they have past their quite usual reaction is to say they dont have any they hope they have past now how would you get persons past how would you get person back into the mainstream of things the cruelest thing you can do is just ask this burning question have you ever left any place and they say thoughtfully well yes when i was small boy i uh well as matter of fact in uh uh well i left school i left school now that isnt all of the meanness youre going to indulge in here youre going to ask one more worse question youre going to say why now youre asking for the points of departure from the main highway did you ever leave any place why he says yes oh yes well of course i left place people always leave places as matter of fact in 19 1948 1948 i left san francisco in 1948 anybody is liable to leave san francisco if you can find your way out fog you know and you say good you left san francisco why hmhmhm you shouldnt have asked that see because what have you done to him at that precise and exact moment you have said what didnt you confront that you should have confronted what did not necessarily should have confronted you feel you should have confronted what did you not confront that you feel you should have confronted oh well thats different story and youve all of sudden got an active meter now your meter gets active up to that time it was all okay but this wasnt okay now that particular the notis is what you run into as more general mechanism but if you want to connect somebody up with the mainstream of life the exact mechanism i just gave you will just pick them up by the collar and throw them into the mad and raging torrent its very easy to do dont think this requires very much cleverness it can be summed up this way did you ever have little child want you to look at something put your attention on something did you ever have anybody all right did you ever have anybody ever demand that you put your attention on something now have you ever had anybody tell you you were wrong for not having had your attention on something all right thats the basic trick see and youll run into that on problems one of your basic tricks of life making people confront is the overt and having to confront is the motivator all deaths and the whole mechanism of death derives from unwillingness to confront that is the mechanism of death so when people leave and yet feel they shouldnt have left it is because there was something there which was too threatening and it keyed in death and thats why they went up the bud the bayou and covered themselves with the dead leaves because its just straight q and on death departing from situations you feel you should have confronted is just the same as truck runs into body pc goes out of head if he was good enough at confronting probably the truck would have disappeared before it hit the body but certainly he probably would not have been hurt the fact that he knew he could be hurt caused him to bring about his hurtingness its interesting you will notice that people have repetitive accidents to the same part of the body now theres curious one until you know that their motivator line must be that because their overt line is that well similarly they were running noconfront on people they were giving people things that couldnt be confronted now if you ran bunch of noconfronts on people then you get to the idea that you cant confront and after you get the idea that you cant confront you can only leave and when you cannot even leave anymore you can still go nuts im speaking very factually that is the cycle of sanity all right so the person you ask him this question you say well have you ever left anyplace and hell say and rudiments all in everything is all fine disturbance here everything is going now youve got evidence that there must be something wrong because you have two powerful processes here run one after the other without any change of profile you know something is here that tells you something is here thats one of the most vivid tests that you can get is an unchanging profile an unreality on the auditor case remains either very very high or very very low change you got the idea just all floating along well there are many ways to clear this up and you cant clear it up with ordinary cleverness you can go back and actually trip the trigger on it have you ever left anyplace oh well one time i yeah yes yes yes of course when youre part of the military services you very often get answers like this well we were ordered out of tobruk thats not very fruitful ground they say well yes i left i left london left london in 1948 yes i left london in 1948 hmhm hmhm and if you were watching close you got disturbance right there oh you say you left london why uuhp clang big withhold its liable to fall right out of that hamper and maybe if it wasnt london maybe you had to ask him for five places they left and ask them why five times before the fifth one suddenly dropped it out in your lap and all of sudden you got big withhold off the case now theres another way to follow this down and you say well has that sort of thing ever been problem to you at any other time cow well yes of course right now theres his present time problem got the idea get the withhold work it to the present time problem bring it down the line you see now this works out this way have you ever thought of blowing session is part of your technique see why you know he has arc break with the auditor the pc has arc break he has nothing everything is all fine and so forth well have you ever thought of leaving session what had you just done good well what had you said about your auditor uhlp shouldnt have asked that one falls off the pin and you see what youve done is walk around using cleverly the actual buttons which you know in scientology you have actually walked around all the defenses if i keep it all notised and unreal everybody will go away quietly and leave my decaying body here in the leaves you can just walk through this because you know the buttons to walk through it on see now its funny thing that lot of the parts of the original prehav scale can be discussed in exactly the same way you almost do prehav assessment only its in the line of rudiments do you see how that would be for instance prevent just taking one off the bat prevent is to large degree an anatomy of problems so you say to him well during your sessions have you been trying to prevent anything uuhh youre liable to get one fall off the pin there well i really havent been trying to prevent anything i just dont want to get any worse you see and the auditor is very unskilled and all of sudden well have you told the auditor this well of course but uh itd hurt his feelings and you get whole basket of stuff comes out see you can take almost any part of the prehav scale and go at it this way see and compare it to various parts of the rudiments you dont need any system now the funny part of it is is surprise has certain amount of element in this so therefore if you take pat system you see which is everything everything everything and then you put in the eggs and then you whip them all up you see and then you put the frying pan on and you put exactly one sixteenth of an ounce of butter in there you know well the recipe becomes familiar and this too can become notis see then the person can notis that its got to be you its got to be you who does the questioning now theres another part of the element completely aside from system system defeats itself to this degree is the person realizes hes being interrogated by an intelligence and its necessary for the person to realize that and the person says ooooh well last fifteen hundred years been very comfortable in these here dead leaves and part of his fall may actually be reaction against you some misemotional reaction against you for having actually disturbed the corpse dead bodies any good clean honest thinking auditor would know better than to disturb halfdecayed bodies lying in piles of dead leaves but you can get to pc from all corners and quarters but to try to get to the pc before anything has happened to disturb the beautiful smooth notised complexion of the bank is quite trick therefore things like presession 37 run at the beginning of auditing turn up very little the same technique run after ten hours of auditing turn up quite bit now you take two tremendously powerful processes like the cchs or problems and look if theyre not going to move this case it has never happened yet all it will do however is just shove the case far enough that you can save the next five hundred hours of grind on give that hand by getting some withholds off and finding out what the present time problems is are and finding out why this case cant get easily into session you see how you could do that so right there you could save an awful lot of auditing with little bit of cleverness interrogation of this character is very very valuable on case very valuable crisscrossed questioning of one kind or other well you ask the straight question at first well have you had any during your auditing have you had any present time problems registry on the meter except one i told the auditor about that and the auditor handled it he had other present time problems now whats calling this pc fibber two profiles now man thats not possible see its just not possible to get change of profile and be free of present time problems thats not possible so you say well all right and go in on it on some other quarter some level of the prehav scale something anything you want to do but try to find this present time problem its probably there its not there because your meter says so its there because your graph says so its there because graph and unworkable auditing says its there now somebody tells you after theyve had quite bit of auditing that they havent gotten any results from the auditing this once more is as good as the graphs so you just wind up your emeter with the handy attached madeinbritain spring on it and let it fly and you start interrogation of one kind or another you dont just run rudiments you just shake this thing to pieces you just go at it from every quarter now one of the things that restrains you from doing this is you think the pc is going to get arc broke if theyre this knocked around ill tell you what arc breaks the pc about something like this the arc break that comes about is because of some dumb repetitive question that has cleverness in it and the pc gets arc broken because he feels he is not being confronted by an intelligence and thatll cause more arc breaks than you can easily count you see you can only cause arc breaks by auditing stupidly or just going on knuckleheadedly just completely off beam you say do you have present time problem and the pc says to you and you say well all right do you have present time problem and the pc says and then you say do you have present time problem and the pc picks up the chair and hits you over the head with it and i almost dont blame him because this line of questioning is going to lead place in the first place hes fairly well aware of the fact that youre not even getting reaction on the meter dont you see thats the wrong way to go about this sort of thing do you have present time problem he says and you say well what would be problem to you oh well thats different question lets see what would be problem to well like having my car parked outside like it is right now with the meter running i is uh na hehhehheh yes i have present time problem hell say aha youre pretty clever auditor you velly smart and he goes out and puts the nickel in the meter and goes into session like rabbit disappearing in burrow kabango you got the difference cleverness is very well associated with intelligence good reason of course its also associated for some reason or other with control to such degree that amongst working men who work all the time with their hands you wonder what causes strikes and all this kind of thing and upsets and so on by the way i just read in the paper last night the first proof i have actually seen that psychiatrists do take their orders from moscow one of the great brain and nerve specialists of england actually turns out to have been working under an assumed name as the head of an organization backed by the communists to knock out all management in england he was the brains behind it all and he was working under an assumed name and he was known as something else and so forth and here he was this is the first one ive ever seen exposed you know they all go running down to vienna every year to get their orders you know they all go down to get their orders you know and then they go spreading out and they say well the party line is freud is good this year you ought to hear them man and they get up there and theyre always giving advice thats superpolitical advice thats going to bust somebodys back sooner or later its quite interesting that was in the papers that was headlines last night if you didnt see it did you see it last night it was headlines they got him rrruuff anyway labor management situation is suspicion of cleverness and when people are very very unclever they are very easily overwhelmed by cleverness very easily so much so as i say somebody who is plodding around all the time just learning that somebody is very intelligent or something or something of the sort they have one of two reactions either they admire this or they dont quite like this or they immediately decide to strike that is the basis of labor management relations now you often wonder i used to wonder how in the name of common sense is as an engineer walking around men building sluiceways and digging with their hands all of them with weapons in their hands you might say who would fight amongst each other every morning why theyre dragging themselves to work with black eyes and split lips you know violent boys and why is it that they never turned on you it used to be little bit of problem to you know theyd fight amongst themselves but they just wouldnt fight in the direction of somebody who was more intelligent than they were that was what i finally boiled it down to its curious you know real curious and yet you put somebody more intelligent than they are at their level or below them and boy they eat him up like terrier will eat meat slurp gulumm yeah they will they just go out of their road to make life hell for him but the second that he has even quasiposition which is slightly in charge of something hes really in charge bang you know its quite fantastic youve seen this kind of thing or samples of it i tried to understand it over number of years exactly what this mechanism was all about the basic yap of labor is against an intelligent function called management and management is never bright enough however as bright as it is to turn around and use the same weapon on labor and the weapon on labor is of course just display of intelligence not conservatism you get display of conservatism and thats sort of defensive action you see of one character or another and you just ask him to get overwhelmed by the fctu communist dedicated antipeoples local union number 49 see kabango its not that im against unions far from it but they sure can be used and youll find that they have revolt factor toward this other and its not management its intelligence its not so much control the only way you can err in management is not control and you can also err by being insufficiently intelligent but you get this intelligence factor im only trying to say here that the intelligence factor is part of being looked up to its an altitude factor let put it more precisely that way if youre clever or if you show youre clever or you are smart about something or other you will have an immediate altitude with your pc and going on and asking the pc stupid question after stupid question preferably repetitively all of which have been negated is of course prima facie demonstration of stupidity you ask this question well have you ever raped anyone it says on the security check and the pc you get small fall and instead of saying what was that or something like that you say good have you ever raped anyone and the pc says and you say good have you ever raped anyone actually anything is better than that line of procedure just anything is better than that line of proceeding when youre trying to find out one datum from the pc because he hasnt answered the auditing question and yet by repeating the auditing question you appear to have agreed that he has in some peculiar way answered the auditing question dont you see because youre obviously asking another one even though you say ill repeat it or something but the fact is its coming out again you see and if you cease to demonstrate that you want that one question that you have asked answered and that youre going to find some answer to it regardless of what he does and going in on it from all sides you start doing that kind of thing and he instantly feels sort of surrounded and he says there must be something here and he tries to look and all of sudden hes got it and the whole thing rolls along with considerable speed if you do something like this but you sit there and say well have you ever raped anyone he says you say well have you ever raped anyone have you ever raped anyone well have you ever raped anyone ill tell you anything is better than that histrionics are better if you if you even turned the emeter this is extreme but if you even turned the emeter around facing him and said now look im going to say those words again and you look what happens here have you ever raped anyone bang you see that well thats what i want to know about now tell honest thats superior to repetitive question it sounds rough it sounds rugged but itll get results it shows that youre interested it shows an active intelligence is confronting him not machine see he wont obey machine and intelligence is very often variety or versatility or other factors mean intelligence to people so you say have you ever raped anyone and you get fall and you say who was that well it at least tells him there was an observer you say who was that who he says well ive never raped anyone it couldnt be any who well her then there couldnt be any her because ive never raped anyone i tell you him then well there cant be him because and so on ive never raped anyone im trying to tell you im trying to tell you well i hear what youre saying but so does the meter look all right animal maybe all right who could it be now put your mind to it little bit this thing isnt falling on the window shade now come on what is it rape rape rape rape rape oh he says youre talking about uh youre talking about my sister bet you oh i was just trying to tell you youre talking about my sister bessie she got raped and it was great upset to the family and thats undoubtedly what the look were talking about you have you you ever raped anyone that was what the question was and its still registering and i want to know what it is thats all lets get it up very plain lets get an understanding going here im not trying to pick fight with you or anything i just want piece of information thats very easy for you to tell its very simple and the second you tell i will have heard it and he says allrightitwasasixteenyearoldgirlandiwasthereatthesideofro ad uhpp uhp there you say thats better i knew you could do it i knew you could do it good now lets just check here to make sure this thing is clean and clear have you ever raped anyone ah thats calm now all right fine lets go to the next one well i tell you thats security checking see kabangobangobango youre getting right on down the line thats because the person feels hes being confronted by an active intelligence somebody is interested somebody will understand something is happening here something is going on the whole situation is under control theres something occurring and thats the way to do it and just never go at it on the basis of set yourself up as nice ritual nice machine like im telling you check the rudiments on this character that isnt advancing youre not satisfied this cases advanced check those rudiments but dont check them do you have present time problem thank you any arc breaks yeah yeah any withholds see you getting along all right with the auditor yeah well your rudiments are okay the rudiments arent out didnt fall on any of those questions if you add it all up to yourself this way itll make much more sense only dead body would fail to respond to the processes there must be something else wrong you got it and that something else is contained in the rudiments and as soon as you pick up high level of certainty on this then you go at this with lot more willingness and lot more verve see and that dead body doesnt talk well and doesnt respond well so that if youre not getting instant and immediate responses youve just got somebody who is lying up in that gully somewhere and its way out of the mainstream of life and youre going to have to get him back into it thats all in the first place hes never going to be happy up there in the second place hes going to go on complaining because hes living up there maybe if hed just lay there quietly and never said anything anymore for the next two hundred trillion years it would be all right but he doesnt he thinks hes lying there quietly you know and hes firing off guns and throwing leaves into the river and putting this dreadful stench up through the trees and so forth and you just got to show him somebody is alive around here thats all and you do that by being clever and youll be surprised youll be surprised how much faster security check goes the second that the pc gets the idea that you might be smart you know that you just might have something on the ball that you might be alive and you might be smart and all of sudden he said to himself oooh ohh somebody has moved some leaves somebody has moved some leaves and i never noticed it before but there it is there it is well you can watch it because youre liable to be put on test right at that moment next one thats hot and you can say well did you ever spend any money that wasnt yours he knows of one and he says nothing you say alllll right when was it when was it but i told you but i want to know when hehheh well yeah i havent even told you that i did yeah but i know i want to know when why do you want to know when well i just think it might be good thing if you told peculiar idea of mine when and how much from whom now its getting tougher see and he gets the illusion you see that this is going to get horrible if he doesnt burst forth with it all right so he says okay it was seven dollars and nineteen cents and i hunhhunh twentyone years old and so forth and it was from uncle sabuchi very good all right now have you ever stolen any money from anyone all right thats clear good and you dont get these hangups you just dont get these hangups that way they sort of become thing of the past and youre over your primary hump of the guy wondering and hemming and hawing then you can go the other way too you can get so helpful that he depends on you utterly to find them and he never bothers to remember any so that you can steer around that too all right well i didnt mean to keep you so long today but i thought you might be interested in this whole subject of crisscross checking rudiments and hangup cases and so forth thought you might be very interested in that okay all right have good weekend and dont loaf because you probably have only got oh youve only got fraction of what you should have gotten filled out on your checksheets thank you female voice thank you
