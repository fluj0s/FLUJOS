administration assertions that readiness remained high by 1997 they asserted that the postcold war defense drawdown and the expanding demands of manpower intensive peacekeeping and humanitarian

external pre ssure in january 2004 dod responded administration end strength initiative before the house armed services co mmittee on january 28 2004 chief of staff of the army general peter schoomaker testified that he had been authorized by the secretary of defense to increase end st rength of the army by 30000 personnel on temporary emergency basis9 he argued that permanent legislated increase would be unwise and unnecessary he asserted that permanent increase would create burden on planned defense budgets in the out years citing 12 billion annually for each increase of 10000 troops some ongoing programs were presented as over time providing more efficient and usable force structure within current army end strength general schoomaker began making organi zational changes shortly after he became chief of staff in august 2003 he ordered divisions to create mo re combat modules by forming four new brigades from their ex isting three brigades and divisional support forces once implemented this would provide 10 additional brigadeequivalent maneuver elements for the rotation base including planned stryker brigades could eventually raise the number of brigades available from 33 to 4810 he is pursuing unit manning policy rather than rotating individuals to deployed units he would also shift from the coldwar mix of combat capabilities to one geared to the less technologically advanced enemies joint ope rations and stabilitytype ope rations now faced examples included reducing air defense artillery and ordnance unit strength and increasing military police civil affairs and transportation capabilities the army and dod also sought other ways to glean ma npower efficiencies general schoomaker noted that 5000 soldier pos itions were converted to civilian in 2003 making more soldiers available for ployment and he anticipated finding 5000 positions in 2004 this raised issues about the numbers of civilians and contractors needed by the services another organizati onal initiative has been rebalancing the mix of active duty and reserve component forces to increase fairness and flexibility in deploying the total force and to allow initial deployments with fewer reserve forces other measures may have potential to re duce military manpower re quirements over time such as reposturing us forces overseas nd base closings and r ealignments mandated by

permanently increase the end strengths of th army and marine co rps the department of defense announced that it would seek appr oval to increase the permanent end strengths of the active army by 65000 and the active marine corps by 2700012 this increase in troop strength is intended to eventually ease the significant strains that have been placed on the army and marine corps that have b een at war in afghanistan since 2001 and in iraq since 2003 the army plans to create six additional brigade combat teams bcts and two additional patriot missile battalions and the marines plan to create an additional regimental combat team rct from the increased end strength13 these additional troops will also permit both services to fill shortage s in existing organizations and create other smaller

there have been number of recent proposals to create specialized units to meet the operational challenges of counterinsurgency stabilization and training advisory operations but the army insists that
