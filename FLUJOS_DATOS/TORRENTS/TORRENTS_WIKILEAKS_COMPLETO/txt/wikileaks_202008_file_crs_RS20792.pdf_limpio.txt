idb it also belongs to two similar organizations the north american development bank nadbank and the interna tional fund for agricultural development ifad for fy2009 the administration is proposing that the united states participate in new world bank program the international clean technology fund the mdbs and their programs the mdbs have similar programs though they all differ somewhat in their institutional structure and emphasis each has president and executive board that manages or supervises all their programs and operations except for the ebrd which makes only marketbased loans all the mdbs make both marketbased loans to middle income developing countries and concessional loans to the poorest countries their loans are made to governments or to organizations having gove rnment repayment guarantees in each mdb the same staff prepares both the marketbased and the concessional loanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20792crs2 1 the international development association ida is the world banks concessional loan affiliate the asian development fund asdf african development fund afdf and fund for special operations fso are the comparab programs at the asdb afdb and idb 2 mdb marketbased loans cost little more than the rate the banks pay to borrow funds commercially ida and afdf charge about 34 of 1 annually the idb charges 1 to 4 annually depending on the project and the borrower most borrowers from the concessional programs have per capita incomes of less often much less than 900 annually using the same standards and procedures for both1 the main differences between them are the repayment terms and the countries which qualify for them2 the mdbs also have specialized facilities which have their own operating staff and management but report to th banks president and executive board the world banks international finance corporation ifc and the idbs interamerican investment corporation iic make loans to or equity investments in private sector firms in developing countries on comme rcial terms without govern ment repayment guarantees the asdb makes similar loans from its mark etrate loan account the world banks multilateral investment guarantee agency miga underwrites private investments in developing countries on comme rcial terms to protect agai nst noneconomic risk at the idb the multilateral investment fund mif helps latin american countries institute policy reforms aimed at stimula ting domestic and international investment it also funds worker retraining and programs for small and microenterprises the mif originated as part of president bushs 1990 enterp rise for the americas initiative eai the nadbank was created by the north am erican free trade agreement nafta to fund environmental infrastructure project s in the usmexico border region the international fund for agricultural devel opment created in 1977 focuses on reducing poverty and hunger in poor countries throug h agricultural development the global environment facility gef funds projects d ealing with interna tional environmental problems the gefs assistance program is managed by the world bank funding mdb assistance programs the mdbs concessional aid programs ar funded with money donated by their wealthier member country governments loans from the mdbs marketrate loan facilities are funded with mone borrowed in world capital markets the ifc and iic fund their loans and equity i nvestments partly w ith money contributed by their members and partly with funds borrowed from co mmercial capital markets the mdbs borrowings are backed by the subscription s of their member countries they provide small part of their capital subscriptions 3 to 5 percent of the total for most mdbs in the form of paidin capital the rest they subscribe as callable capital callable capital is contingent liability payable only if an md b becomes bankrupt and lacks sufficient funds to repay its own creditors it cannot be called to provide the banks with additional loan funds countries voting shares are determined main ly by the size of their contributions the united states is the largest stockholder in most mdbs japan has provided more to the asdf and afdf while nigeria and egypt ve subscribed larger shares in the afdbhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20792crs3 periodically as the stock of uncommitted mdb funds begins to run low the major donors negotiate new funding plan that sp ecifies their new c ontribution shares table 1 shows the us contribution share nd voting share for all mdb programs in most banks countries get few votes becau they are members regardless of the size of their capital subscription thus for banks with large number of small members the voting share of large subscribers such as the united states may be little smaller than their share in providing the banks resources voting shares are the same for both market based and concessional loan s in the asdb and idb table 1 us contribution and voting shares in the mdbs contribution

power and contributions in recent decades they have c hosen not to receive more ida votes in return for their contributions thus while the unite d states canada japan the countries of the european union and the wealthy arab oil st ates have dona ted 99 of idas resources they have 65 of the vote this is more th an enough to protect their interests however as decisions are reached by majority vote the arrangement diffuses possible tensions by giving the developing countries sense that their voices are heard before 1976 the united states was the only si gnificant contributor to the idbs fund for special operations nonre gional countries have since joined the idb and the fso has become much smaller program and he us share has declined substantially the african development bank controls 50 of the vote in the afdf though it has contributed only about 1 of the concessional loan programs resources th is maintains semblance of african control the interests of the donors ar protected by the fact that threequarters majority is required to approve afdf loans us appropriations for mdbs table 2 shows the amounts the administrati on has requested and congress has appropriated budget authority annually since fy1998 for us contributions and subscriptions to the multilateral banks the numbers in parentheses are subscriptions to mdb callable capital since 1981 the united stat longer appropriates money to back its callable capital subscriptions to the md bs rather congress sets annual program ceilings in the foreign operations appropria tions act specifying the amount of
