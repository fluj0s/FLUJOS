alcohol products louis alan talley specialist in taxation government and finance division pamela j jackson analyst in public sector economics government and finance division summary this report provides brief history of federal alcohol excise tax rates and examines recent federal revenue collections from alcohol products rates were last increased by the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 rra90 pl 101508 under that act congress increased the excise tax rates on alcohol products because of large continuing federal budget deficits which resulted in the need for additional federal revenues tax rates were increased 100 per proof gallon on distilled spirits to 1350 per proof gallon the tax rate for beer was doubled to 1800 per barrel also the excise tax rates on wines were increased with the new rates ranging from 107 per wine gallon to 330 per wine gallon all these rates became effective january 1 1991 breaking down these rates the consumer would find that the current federal alcohol excise taxes amount to 214 per 750ml bottle of distilled spirits 33 cents for sixpack of beer and 21 cents per 750ml bottle of table wine this report will be updated to reflect new information or as legislative developments warrant brief history of tax rates the tax rate on distilled spirits remained unchanged from 1951 to 19851 in october 1985 the rate was raised from 1050 to 1250 per proof gallon under the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 rra90 pl 101508 the rate was increased by an 1 for more complete discussion of the history of federal alcohol taxes see crs report rl30238 federal excise taxes on alcoholic beverages summary of present law and brief history by thomas b ripy congressional research service the library of congress crs2 additional 100 per proof gallon to 13502 the tax rate on beer had not been raised since november 1 1951 then the rate was raised from 800 to 900 per barrel the rra90 doubled the existing rate which stands today at 1800 per barrel the rra90 retained the small producers exception of prior law which allows lower rate to apply to small brewers who produce fewer than 2000000 barrels of beer per year the rate for small brewers which has been in effect since february 1977 is 700 per barrel3 for the first 60000 barrels after 60000 barrels small brewers pay the 1800 per barrel rate thus small brewers pay approximately 2 cents per 12ounce serving for the first 60000 taxpaid barrels of beer the taxes on wines are levied at variety of rates as in the case of beer the tax rates that applied to wine remained unchanged for many years until the passage of rra90 prior law rates ranged between 17 cents per wine gallon4 for still wine to 340 per wine gallon for sparkling wines under the rra90 these rates range from 107 per wine gallon to 340 per wine gallon the details of these changes are shown in table 1 below unlike other alcohol tax rates included in the rra90 the tax rates on champagne and sparkling wines were not increased small domestic wineries credit equal to 90 cents per wine gallon is provided for the first 100000 gallons of wine production with phaseout of the credit for wineries whose production falls between 150000 and 250000 gallons5 the effective date of all these tax rate changes was january 1 1991 under provision of the taxpayer relief act of 1997 the excise tax rate on hard cider was lowered the credit available for small producers of hard cider was also lowered commensurately comparison of alcohol tax rates for comparison purposes the federal tax rates on all alcohol products listed here have been converted to level of federal excise tax per drink obviously such conversion requires assumptions regarding serving size the federal statutory tax rate on beer is 18 per barrel of 31 gallons6 for beer this equates to 058 per gallon or approximately 033 per sixpack of 12ounce cans or just over 5 cents per 12 ounce can more than 90 of all beer sold is in 12ounce serving sizes the federal statutory tax rate on distilled spirits is 1350 per proofgallon retailers most often sell distilled spirits in 750ml bottles and at 80proof federal excise tax of 214 attaches to an 80proof 750ml bottle of distilled spirits if mixed drink contains approximately 15 ounces of distilled spirits the federal excise tax per drink is approximately 013 at higher alcohol 2 proof is method of measuring the alcohol content standard proof gallon is 231 cubic inches at 60 degrees fahrenheit containing 50 by volume of ethyl alcohol 100 proof 3 barrel contains 31gallons 4 wine gallon is measure of liquid volume regardless of alcohol content it contains 231 cubic inches at 60 degrees fahrenheit 5 this credit does not apply to champagne and sparkling wine 6 as noted earlier in this report small brewers whose production is less than 2000000 barrels of beer per year pay reduced excise tax rate on the first 60000 barrels of taxpaid beer crs3 proofs higher tax rates would apply and thus higher tax revenues would be generated there are special tax rates or credits for small domestic distillers converting wine excise taxes is problematic because of the differences in rates between large and small wineries wine is most commonly sold in 750ml bottles this bottle size equates to 254 ounces under the rra90 federal excise taxes rose from 3 cents to 21 cents on 750ml bottle of table wine if glass of wine holds approximately 5 ounces the tax rate per glass produced by large winery equates to slightly more than 4 cents because of the 90 cents per winegallon tax credit provided to small domestic wineries by the rra90 the tax rate for small wineries equates to 3 cents per 750ml bottle or less than penny per glass of wine thus the federal excise tax that attaches per drink is approximately 4 cents per glass of wine from large wineries 5 cents per can of beer and 13 cents per mixed drink table 1 comparison of alcohol excise tax rates before and after the revenue

taxable alcohol products with gross receipts of less than half million dollars in the preceding taxable year must pay tax of 500 year for those whose gross receipts exceed that amount the tax is 1000 year per premise additionally alcoholic beverage wholesalers pay wholesale dealer occupational tax of 500 per year per place of business while alcoholic beverage retailers pay at rate of 250 per year per place of business more than 90 of the special federal occupational tax revenues are related to the alcohol industry revenues the revenue yield from total federal alcohol excise taxes in fiscal year 2002 was 8500190000 of this total distilled spirits and beer each accounted for under half 4039878000 for distilled spirits and 3651126000 for beer the most lightly taxed alcohol product wine yielded tax revenues of 707296000 special occupational taxes generated 101890000 in revenues7 the joint committee on taxation estimated that if congress increased alcohol excise tax rates to 1600 per proof gallon with the same tax per ounce of ethyl alcohol extended to all alcohol products distilled spirits beer and wine additional revenues of 237 billion would be collected for the fiveyear period 2004 to 2008 such an increase would raise the tax on 750ml bottle of distilled spirts from 214 to 254 the tax on six pack of beer from about 33 cents to 81 cents and the tax on bottle of still table wine 750ml from about 21 cents to 70 cents8 revenues collected from all alcohol excise taxes go into the general fund of the united states treasury as such these revenues are not specifically dedicated for any trust fund or for any special use the rationale for the last increase in tax rates was the budget deficit there have been legislative proposals made in the past to dedicate the excise taxes on alcohol products for various purposes for example it has been suggested that the revenues collected from alcohol excise taxes be used to help finance the medicaremedicaid trust funds here the rationale given has been that the abuse of alcohol products early in life may lead to health related problems that drain revenues from those federal trust funds suggestions have also been made that alcohol tax receipts be used for alcohol rehabilitation treatment and to compensate victims of drunk drivers 7 us department of the treasury internal revenue service statistics of income

or can be found on their website at ftpftpcbogov40xxdoc4066chapter3revenuespdf visited july 30 2004 crs5 policy arguments among the arguments frequently made for increasing the alcohol excise taxes is that they can raise substantial and stable amounts of revenues while the cost of tax administration in relation to the revenue generated is small the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the us department of treasury believes the compliance rate for payment of the federal alcohol excise taxes to be high in the past most of the legislative proposals to change the tax merely raise the tax rates since the number of business concerns that make these federal excise tax payments is fixed and known federal collection costs should remain stable thus it is generally believed that those legislative proposals that simply raise or lower the tax rate should not change the administrative ease with which the tax is currently collected some supporters of an increase in rates have suggested that one way of increasing revenues without large onetime tax increase would be to tie the alcohol tax rates to an inflation adjustment such as the consumer price index since these taxes are imposed on per unit basis their real cost declines during inflationary periods9 another possible alternative is converting the current excise tax to an advalorem tax that would tax the product at percentage of the manufacturers price thus tax revenues would rise as the price of alcohol products andor their consumption increases over time alcohol excise taxes10 have long been justified as user tax societys cost from alcohol includes those from alcoholinduced auto accidents and increased police services resulting from its indiscriminate use it is possible that these costs are not fully reflected in the price of alcohol it is sometimes argued that further increases in tax rates would help pay for these services and the attendant costs to society an argument made against alcohol excise taxes is that they are regressive this is because individuals with lower incomes would spend larger portion of their income than higher income person for the same consumption amount in opposition however some argue that not only should abilitytopay be factor of taxation but also the ability to spend and consume spending by person with limited resources for nonessential is considered sufficient reason by some for imposition of tax and reflects an ability to support the national government in the same proportion as the amount purchased and consumed supporters of alcohol taxes argue that while the tax can be said to be regressive it can also be said to be tax that wealthy taxpayers cannot avoid through loopholes or other income tax reduction or saving devices several other arguments have been advanced against increasing the excise taxes on alcohol products an increase in rates could be expected to decrease consumption decreased consumption will affect state tax revenues unless the states were to further raise their own excise tax rates which could lead to still lower rates of consumption opponents note that the state governments often rely more heavily on salebased taxes than does the federal government decrease in consumption can also be expected to 9 crs report rs20172 excise taxes on alcohol tobacco and gasoline history and inflation indexed rates by louis alan talley pamela j jackson and brian w cashell 10 the taxes imposed on alcohol and tobacco products are sometimes referred to as taxes crs6 cause loss of employment not only in the alcohol industry but also in related industries such as advertising trucking and packaging some recent research suggests that moderate consumption of some alcohol products might produce beneficial health effects an increase in taxes could reduce consumption by some light drinkers which could have been beneficial to their well being11 further increased tax rates can result in increased evasion and illegal production of product 11
