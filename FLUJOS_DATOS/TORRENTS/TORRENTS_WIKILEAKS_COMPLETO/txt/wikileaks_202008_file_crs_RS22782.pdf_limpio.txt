engaged in interstate commerce and related subsidiaries railr oad associations nd railroad labor organizations these benefits are earned by railroad workers and their families in lieu of social security rrb benefits railroad retirement benefits are divided into two tiers tier i benefits are generally computed using the so cial security benefit formula on the basis of earnings covered by either program in some cases rrb tier i benefits can be higher than comparable social security benefits for example rrb beneficiaries may receive unreduced tier i retirement benefits as early as age 60 if they have at least 30 years of railroad service social security beneficiaries may receive unreduced retirement benefits only when they reach their full retirement ages currently rising from age 65 to 67 rrb tier ii benefits are similar to private pension benefits and are based only on railroad work2 history of the trust starting in 2002 significant portion of railroad retirement assets have

independent of the railroad retirement board rrb and is not part of the fede ral government it has re sponsibilities for administering rrb benefits the trustees of the trust are required to act solely in the interest of the rrb and the participants in the railroad retirement system the fiduciary rules governing the trustees are similar to those required by the law that governs the private pension

been voted in the sole interest of railroad retirement participants and beneficiaries6 goals congress designed the trust to in crease rrb funding investing railroad retirement funds in private markets was expect ed to yield higher average annual returns than investing solely in government securities the higher returns were intended to pay for the enhanced benefits that were established in the act and to potentially reduce future tax rates for railroad em ployers and employees7 the trust is also designed to maintain four to six years worth of benefits in case of lowerthanexpected returns in order to maintain this balance the tier ii tax is set to automatically adjust to maintain the fund balance at four to si x years this tax adjustment would not require congressional action investment
