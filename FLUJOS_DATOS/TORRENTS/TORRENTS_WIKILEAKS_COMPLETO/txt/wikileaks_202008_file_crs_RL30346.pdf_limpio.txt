101508 added title v to the congressional budget act title v also called the federal credit reform act of 1990 the fcra changed how the unified budget reports the cost of federal credit activities ie federal direct loans and loan guarantees before fiscal year 1992 fy1992 for given fiscal year the budgetary cost of new direct loan or loan guarantee was the net cash flow for that fiscal year this cash flow measure did not accurately reflect the true cost of loan or loan guarantee which is its subsidy cost over the entire life of the loan or loan guarantee that is its accrual cost the purposes of this report are to explain the credit reform provisions examine their implementation and discuss proposed modifications beginning with fy1992 federal credit reform legislation required that the reported budgetary cost of credit program equal the estimated subsidy costs at the time the credit is provided the fcra defines the subsidy cost as the estimated l ongterm cost to the government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs this places the cost of federal credit programs on budgetary basis equivalent to other federal outlays this change means because the subsidy costs of discretionary credit programs are now provided through appropriations acts the discretionary credit programs must then compete with other discretionary programs on an equal basis funding for most mandatory credit programs generally entitlement programs is provided by permanent appropriations the director of the office of management and budget omb is responsible for coordinating the estimation of subsidy costs to the government since the passage of the fcra federal agencies working with omb have steadily improved their compliance with credit reform standards in october 1990 the federal accounting standards advisory board was established in august 1993 this board required that agencies accounting procedures be consistent with their budgetary procedures for their federal credit programs on august 5 1997 the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 was enacted amending the fcra to make some technical changes including codifying several guidelines set by omb four proposals to modify current practice have been discussed the principles of credit reform could be applied to governmentsponsored enterprises gses the principles of credit reform could be extended to federal insurance programs the administrative costs of credit programs could be included in the calculation of the costs of these programs and the budgetary cost of capital for credit programs could be changed to include market risk this report will be updated as issues develop andor in the event of new legislation

loan or new loan guarantee was its net cash flow for that fiscal year this did not accurately reflect the true cost of loan or loan guarantee federal credit for the government which is its subsidy cost over the entire life of the loan or loan guarantee using the old cashflow method it was often difficult for policymakers to accurately monitor and therefore make informed decisions about federal credit in addition administrators at agencies could understate costs by using budgetary techniques such as generating savings from the fees on increased volumes of new guarantees while ignoring the increase in expected losses and offsetting the cash cost of new direct loans with current year collections from old loans to remedy these problems congress added section on credit reform to the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 obra90 the presid ent signed obra90 into law pl 101508 on november 5 1990 the legislation added new title to the congressional budget act title v the federal credit reform act of 1990 fcra 1 beginning with fy1992 the fcra changed the methodology in the unified budget for measuring and reporting the cost of federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees from cash flow to accrual accounting the fcra required that the budgetary cost of federal credit would be measured for any one year as the net present value of the cost to the government of credit subsidies in the fiscal year that the credit is provided the government accountability office gao the congressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb all recommended this new measure of the cost of federal credit 2 specific provisions of the fcra represent compromises within congress and between the legislative and executive branches of the government the purposes of this report are to explain the provisions of the fcra examine the implementation of credit reform including credit re form provisions of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba97 and discuss proposed

grounds equity and efficiency equity concerns the distributions of income consumption and wealth the distribution of income has received the most emphasis among policy makers because economists cannot make interpersonal comparisons of utility the optimal distributions of income consumption and wealth are normative that is they involve value judgments in other words economists cannot conclude that one distribution is better than another many members of congress support redistributive 1 this report will be updated as issues develop and in the ev ent of legislative change for the most current

critics maintain that direct subsidies can usually better target assistance to the needy than can credit programs if an economy is productively efficient it cannot produce more of one good without reducing the production of one or more other goods for an economy to be efficient private financial intermediaries should allocate capital to its most productive uses private financial intermediaries generally operate efficiently but market imperfections do exist and these imperfections may cause an inadequate availability of credit in certain sectors of the economy the office of management and budget omb states that market imperfections that can justify federal intervention include insufficient information lim ited ability to secure resources insufficient competition and externalities 4

federal credit federal credit subsidies and the unified budget some of these terms are defined in the fcra g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561 the office of management and budget defines federal credit as federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees the fcra defines direct loan as disbursement of funds by the government to nonfederal borrower under contract that requires the repayment of such funds with or without interest section 5021 according to the fcra direct loan obligation is binding agreement by federal agency to make direct loan when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower section 5023 the fcra defines loan guarantee as pledge with respect to the payment of all or part of the principal or interest on any debt obligation of nonfederal borrower to nonfederal lender section 5023 loan guarantee commitment is binding agreement by federal agency to make loan guarantee when specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower the lender or any other party to the guarantee agreements section 5024 when either direct loan obligation or loan guarantee commitment is extended the federal government determines future credit flows because the government signs contract to provide credit in some cases the specified conditions may not be met and consequently credit will not be provided even though contract was signed furthermore there is time lag between the signing of these contracts and the actual disbursement of direct loan by the federal government or the actual disbursement of guaranteed loan by private lender in some cases particularly for credit for construction credit may be disbursed by either the federal government or private lender in increments over several fiscal years 5 4 us executive office of the president

private market omb describes subsidies from federal direct loans as consisting of one or more of the following interest rates below commercial levels longer maturities than fully private loans deferral of interest allowance of grace periods waiver or reduction of loan fees higher loan amount in relation to the value of the underlying enterprise than fully private loan and availability of funds to borrowers for purposes for which the private sector would not lendat virtually any interest rate under virtually any repayment terms6 the recipient of federal loan guarantee receives subsidy because the federal government covers part or all of the default riska subsidy conveyed by lower interest payments also the federal government either does not levy loan guarantee fee or charges smaller fee than private insurer would charge consequently lender can charge the borrower lower interest rate in addition with some guaranteed loans the federal go vernment may pay to the lender part of the interest due on guaranteed loan 7 thus federal loan guarantee with or without federal interest payment may provide lower equal or higher level of subsidy than federal direct loan

budget before 1967 the federal government most frequently used the administrative budget which was not comprehensive in coverage because it excluded the trust funds for example the social security trust fund the federal government also used two other broad budgets the consolidated cash budget and the national income accounts budget each of these three budgets had different coverage of federal programs and different accounting method consequently each had different surplus or deficit 8 each of these budgets had weaknesses and the simultaneous use of three different budget concepts caused confusion9 6 us executive office of the president office of management and budget special analysis f federal credit programs budget of the united states government fiscal year 1988 washington gpo 1987

and instructed to make thorough and objective review of budgetary concepts10 in october 1967 the commission produced comprehensive report with detailed recommendations on implementing unified budget in its report the commission stated that the two basic functions of the federal budget are resource allocation and macroeconomic stabilization11 for resource allocation the commission believed that the budget should provide the integrated framework for information and analyses from which the best possible choices can be made in allocating the publics money among competing claims 12 this function of resource allocation should include comparisons among government programs and between the public and private sectors13 for macroeconomic stabilization the commission maintained that the budget should contain detailed and accurate information in order to evaluate the effects of federal fiscal activities furthermore the budget should include data necessary to undertake discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy14 thus the commission recommended unifi ed budget that would be composed of all federal activities including the trust funds and federal credit activities the commission recommended that federal credit programs be measur ed by their cash flows although it realized that this procedure provided poor measure of the economic and budgetary effects of federal credit in the fy1969 budget the johnson administration adopted the unified budget concept but with some structural differences from the proposal of the commission the johnson administration essentially adopted commission reco mmendations of measuring credit by its cash flows implementation of federal credit reform would improve the use of the unified budget for resource allocation and macroeconomic stabilization as originally desired by the commission

federal credit reform act of 1990 the unified budget treated federal credit in two different ways the unified budget measured credit by its cash flows but also after 1980 included separate credit

federal direct loan was treated as budget outlay in the current fiscal year and repayments of principal and payments of interest were treated as offsetting collections negative outlays in the future fiscal years in which they occurred if loan recipient paid fee this fee was treated as an offsetting collection loan defaults reduced repayments of principal and interest and therefore offsetting collections administrative expenses were reported as outlays in given fiscal year the budgetary cost of loan program not the individu loans was its net cash flow this equaled new loans made plus any administrative expenses associated with these loans rarely recognized in the loan accounts less any loan fees repayments of principal and payments of interest 10 ibid p 105 11 ibid p 14 12 ibid p 16

provided was not included in the federal budget because cash flow occurred the administrative costs of guarantee program were outlays in the fiscal year in which they occurred some guarantee programs charge fees to the recipient and these fees were considered offsetting collections any federal outlays necessary to compensate lenders for any default losses covered by federal guarantee were not shown in the budget until they were actually paid g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561 in january 1980 the office of management and budget introduced federal credit budget to help monitor and control the growth of federal credit including new direct loan obligations and new loan guarantee commitments federal credit was measured at the time that the government signed binding contract to provide credit assistance initially the credit budget consisted of nonbinding targets before fy1992 limits in the credit budget were included in the budget resolution and in annual appropriation acts for discretionary credit programs but not mandatory credit programs 15 although the credit budget improved credit visibility the credit budget did not measure or control the size of subsidies g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561g3g140g157g561g152g143g561g343g351g351g342g561 reforming federal credit required that the budget in the year in which the credit was provided include the multiyear net cash flows generated by new direct or guaranteed loan thus federal credit would be recorded on an accrual basis but incorporated into cash flow budget advocates of credit reform maintained that the inclusion of credit subsidies in the unified budget would equalize the budgetary treatment and therefore congressional consideration of federal credit and noncredit programs federal credit programs could be compared on dollarfordollar basis with expenditures for noncredit programs and costbenefit analysis could be more easily used to evaluate specific federal credit programs credit reform was expected to improve the ability of the unified budget to allocate resources and stabilize the economy numerous comprehensive plans were proposed beginning in 1983 these proposals culminated in the federal credit reform act of 1990 16 g18g158g155g153g152g156g142g156g561 the four stated purposes of the fcra were to 1 measure more accurately the costs of federal credit programs 2 place the cost of credit programs on budgetary basis equivalent to other federal spending 3 encourage the delivery of benefits in the form most

is the subsidy value at the time the credit is provided the fcra defines the subsidy cost as the estimated longterm cost to the government of direct loan or loan guarantee calculated on net present value basis excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays section 5025a the discount rate used to calculate subsidy costs in terms of present value is the average interest rate on marketable treasury securities of similar maturity section 5025e17 hence the subsidy cost of program is determined by the amount of credit provided and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of that credit any government action that changes the estimated present value of an outstanding federal credit program is counted in the budget in the year in which the change occurs as change in the subsidy cost of that program section 5025d for example the federal government could partially forgive the repayment of principal for lowincome borrowers from particular credit program which would increase the subsidy cost of the program g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g21g158g139g156g146g141g146g142g156g561 the director of the office

permanent indefinite budget authority this additional cost is displayed in subaccount in the credit program account also beginning with fy1992 each credit program has nonbudget financing account each

the payment of default losses on guarantees and the collection of interest and fees19 because they are nonbudget the cash flows into and out of these accounts are not reflected in total outlay

budget act of 1997 pl 10533 was enacted41 this law bba97 amended the federal credit reform act of 1990 to make some technical changes including codifying several omb guidelines important changes were first agencies are required to use the same discount rate to calculate the subsidy when they obligate budget authority for direct loans and loan guarantees and when submitting the agencys budget justification for the presidents budget42 thus the dollar value of loans for specific credit program is known when congress considers subsidy appropriations for that program prior to this change agencies had used interest rates from the preceding calendar quarter to calculate the subsidy at the time direct loan was advanced or loan guarantee was obligated 43 second agencies are required to use the same forecast assumptions for example default and recovery rates to calculate subsidy rates when they obligate credit and when preparing the presidents budget44 third agencies are required to transfer endofyear unobligated balances in liquidating accounts revolving funds for direct loans and loan guarantees made prior to the effective date of the fcra to the general fund as soon as practicable after the close of the fiscal year45 fourth the same interest rate must be used on financing account debt which generates interest payments to the treasury financing account balances and the discount rate used to calculate subsidy costs46 fifth the definition of the term cost is modified so that the discount rate is based on the timing of cash flows instead of on the term of the loan under this new approach in the presidents budget series of different rates would be used to calculate the present value of cost flows over multiyear period for example for 10year direct loan or loan guarantee costs in the first year would be discounted using the interest rate on oneyear treasury bill costs in the second year would be discounted using the interest rate on twoyear treasury note etc under the prior approach the interest rate of 10year treasury note would have been used as the discount rate this prior method proved to be inferior because the flow of semiannual interest payments and the repayment of full principal on the last payment date did not match up well with yearly cost flows 47 41 for summary of the contents of the budget enforcement act of 1997 see crs report 97930

credit reform have been discussed in recent years first the principles of credit reform could be applied to governmentsponsored enterprises gses gses are privatelyowned financial intermediaries which were established and chartered by the federal government gses pay lower interest rates on their securities because investors generally believe that securities issued by gses have an implied federal guarantee making them appear less risky than other private sector securities proponents of extending credit reform principles to gses argue that the federal government has already bailed out one gse the farm credit system hence proponents argue that credit reform should cover the subsidy costs to taxpayers of gses opponents argue that the subsidy costs of gses are difficult to quantify furthermore the federal government has legal responsibility to bail out gses opponents also maintain that the current exclusion of administrative costs and risk premium would probably result in subsidy costs of approximately zero second the principles of credit reform could be extended to federal insurance which currently is primarily treated on cash flow basis 62 most federal insurance consists of deposit insurance or pension insurance63 the government accountability office maintains that credit reform could improve the budgetary information and incentives for federal insurance64 but for some federal insurance programs significant difficulties exist in accurately estimating future claims for losses often historical data are unavailable frequent program modifications occur and fundamental changes take place in the activities insured65 many federal insurance programs cover complex casespecific or catastrophic risks that the private sector has historically been unwilling or unable to cover66 the complexity of the issues involved and the need to build agency capacity to generate such estimates suggest that it is not feasible to integrate accrualbased costs directly into the budget at this time67 gao suggests that supplemental approach should precede the full inclusion of insurance programs under credit reform thus gao recomme nds that accrualbased cost measures be initially included along with cashbased estimates as supplemental information in the budget documents68 62 for comprehensive analysis of the current budgetary treatment of federal insurance program

because the current subsidy measure excludes administrative costs and risk premium some major insurance programs would record negative subsidies the comprehensive budget process reform act of 1999 hr

5 1999 did not include those sections extending credit reform to federal insurance programs third as was discussed in the 1990 debate administrative costs of credit programs could be included in the calculation of the costs of these programs proponents argue that the current exclusion of these costs understates the actual costs of credit programs proponents also stress that cost comparisons among credit programs are distorted for example the administrative costs per 1 million of credit are higher for direct student loans than guaranteed student loans opponents argue that agencies have difficulty separating the administrative costs of their credit programs from their general administrative costs fourth the budgetary cost to taxpayers of providing federal credit could be changed to include market risk 69 currently the fcra requires the discounting of expected cash flows at the interest rate on riskfree treasury securities the rate at which the government borrows money70 cbos report on federal credit subsidies examined two ways of including the market price for risk riskadjusted discount rates and optionspricing methods the riskadjusted discount rate adr method adds spreadthe difference between the interest rate on treasury security and the rate on risky securityto treasury rates and uses the resulting adjusted rate to discount expected cash flows associated with loan 71 the adr method results in higher discount rate for both costs and revenues and with few exceptions for negative subsidies raises the net cost of credit programs an option is marketable security which allows the owner to buy or sell another security at stipulated price on or before specified date 72the general ideal behind optionspricing methods is that assets with the same payoffs must have the same price otherwise investors would have the opportunity to earn riskfree profit by buying low and selling high73 an optionspricing method is likely to be more ac curate than the adr method but only when the necessary data and model are available74 optionspricing models are seldom used to value credit provided to individuals instead the use of the adr method is usually appropriate75 option pricing methods are usually better than adr met hods in valuing credit provided to commercial 69 this change would require new legislation because the fcra specifies that the subsidy cost of federal credit is the cost to the taxpayer rather than the market value to the recipient 70 congressional budget office estimating the value of subsidies for federal loans and loan
