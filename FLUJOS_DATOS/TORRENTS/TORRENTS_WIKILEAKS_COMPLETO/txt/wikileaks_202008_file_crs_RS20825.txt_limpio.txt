presidential libraries inaugurated with the presidential libraries act of 1955 these entities are privately constructed on behalf of former presidents and upon completion are deeded to the federal government deposited within these edifices are the official records and papers of the former president as well as documentary materials of his family and often his political associates these holdings are made available for public examination in accordance with prevailing law concerning custody official secrecy personal privacy and other similar restrictions this report provides brief overview of the federal presidential libraries system and tracks the progress of related legislation hr 1254 hr 1255 hr 5811 s 886 it will be updated as events recommend during the first 150 years of government under the constitution the management and preservation of federal records was generally neglected1 inattentiveness to the maintenance of official papers prevailed within both the infant bureaucracy and the white house while the secretary of state bore responsibility for retaining copies of the most important government documents during these initial years lesser papers without immediate administrative significance disappeared in clutter disintegrated became otherwise lost or were destroyed by design within this atmosphere departing presidents had little choice with regard to the disposition of their records there was national archive to receive them and for reasons of etiquette or politics or both there was reluctance to leave them behind thus the early chief executives carried away their documents of office entrusting them to their family estate executors and often to fate after several decades of the perils of private ownership many collections of presidential records came to be established within the libraries of state and private universities state historical societies and the library of 1 see h g jones the records of nation new york atheneum 1969 pp 323 crs2 congress however time levied price on some caches of such documents before they came to rest in friendly institutions as the federal establishment began to grow and to realize increasing responsibility for maintaining or regulating the economic and social affairs of the nation questions arose as to the propriety and wisdom of neglecting the management and preservation of federal records including the practice of regarding presidential papers to be personal property to be taken away by the incumbent when he left office by the 20th century historians had become alarmed that such papers were being accidently destroyed lost and sometimes only selectively released for scrutiny archivists lamented omissions in the national governmental record that the situation created not only might entire files be carried from the white house but presidential correspondence might be taken from departmental files as it applied to federal records the concept of presidential papers knew bounds the situation became particularly acute with the creation of the executive office of the president in 1939 franklin d roosevelt fdr established panoply of emergency and wartime agencies within this domain all of which served the president in immediate and direct capacities and all of which therefore could be considered producers of presidential papers the potential loss of the documentary materials of these entities presented both records management and an administrative continuity problem presidential libraries addressing this situation fdr sought to return presidential papers to the public realm through new type of institution the presidential library when he advanced this concept in 1938 two prototype libraries were in existence the rutherford b hayes memorial library had been completed in fremont ohio in 19142 former president herbert hoover had placed his presidential records in facility he had inaugurated in 1919 to house records deriving from his public service during world war i the hoover library of war revolution and peace located on the stanford university campus3 building upon these models roosevelt developed the concept of federallymaintained presidential library electing to locate his presidential library on the grounds of his family home in hyde park ny fdr approved the creation of corporation to receive contributions and donations to pay for the construction of an archival edifice to house and preserve such historical materials as he might provide to the corporation or the united states chartering legislation for the roosevelt presidential library was enacted in 19394 the archivist of the united states acting on behalf of the federal government accepted the completed library facility on july 4 19405 2 the hayes library is currently

crs3 the efforts of fdr to create federallymaintained presidential library were both ad hoc and specific nonetheless his successor harry s truman was less attentive to history and the preservation of his presidential papers for public examination after his election truman saw the 1950 creation of missouri corporation to establish presidential library on his behalf following the fdr model6 while the truman library corporation was endeavoring to raise funds for the construction of the archival edifice congress enacted the presidential libraries act of 1955 which established the basic policy for the creation of all federallymaintained presidential libraries7 these include the herbert hoover library west branch ia harry s truman library independence mo dwight d eisenhower library abilene

democratic national committee headquarters located in the watergate office building in washington dc and related matters the official papers and records of president richard m nixon were placed under federal custody by the presidential recordings and materials preservation act of 1974 prmpa to assure their availability to federal prosecutors9 the statute required that these materials remain in washington dc under the supervision of the archivist thus nixon could neither take his presidential records with him when he left office nor place them in presidential library outside the nations capital subsequently nixon library was constructed at the former presidents birthplace yorba linda ca the completed facility was dedicated in july 1990 but remained under private operation for 17 years housing nixons congressional and vice presidential records and small collection of copies of his presidential papers provision in the consolidated appropriations act 2004 amended the prmpa to allow the archivist at later time to transfer the nixon presidential materials to the nixon library in the event nara took over its administration in the event of such transfer the federal government would retain custody of the records and materials and responsibility for their public availability10 negotiations with the nixon library resulted in its transfer to nara on july 11 2007 concurrent

available 78000 pages of previously restricted nixon documents and more than 11 hours of taped conversations11 following the enactment of the prmpa congress developed two other statutes affecting presidential libraries the first of these the presidential records act of 1978 carefully defined presidential records and specified that all such materials created on or after january 20 1981 were subject to its provisions12 the new law effectively made official presidential records federal property that was to remain under the custody and control of the archivist when each incumbent president left the white house jimmy carter was the last occupant of the oval office who could freely take away his records at about this same time concern about the increasing cost of providing benefits to the nations former presidents was beginning to build in congress and was legislatively manifested initially in march 1980 in proposals to adjust the federal largesse bestowed upon former presidents and their families federallymaintained presidential libraries particularly their physical size and continued maintenance were among the perquisites seen to be contributing to the burden of the taxpayers13 the 99th congress passed legislation addressing this single area of expense involving former presidents the presidential libraries act of 1986 set certain reporting requirements architectural and design conditions and fiscal limitations regarding future presidential libraries including requiring an operating endowment14 for example prior to accepting any gift of land facility or equipment to create federallymaintained presidential library or making any physical or material change in an existing one the archivist must submit written report to congress providing certain details as specified in the statute about the transaction the endowment requirement for new presidential libraries 20 of assessed value was made applicable to any president who takes the oath of office as president for the first time on or after january 20 198515 the george h w bush library became the first such facility to be subject to this reform requirement subsequently the consolidated appropriations act for fy2003 increased the endowment requirement to 40 of assessed value and made it effective to any president who takes the oath of office as president for the first time on or after july 1 200216 federal

occurred with the johnson presidential library which was located on the campus of the university of texas at austin because the university could not legally deed its land to the federal government the archivist to take possession of the facility relied upon his presidential libraries act authority to make agreements upon terms and conditions he considers proper with state political subdivision university institution of higher learning institute or foundation to use as presidential archival depository land buildings and equipment of the state subdivision university or other organization to be made available by it without transfer of title to the united states and maintain operate and protect the depository as part of the national archives system17 this innovation was used again in the case of the ford library located on the ann arbor campus of the university of michigan separate ford museum is located in the former presidents hometown of grand rapids but it is not federally maintained presidential library the kennedy carter and reagan presidential libraries are situated in locales in close proximity to respective presidential hometowns the george h w bush library is located in the former presidents home state on the texas am university campus in late december 2006 it was reported that southern methodist university located in dallas was the lone candidate in exclusive talks for the george w bush library18 in recent years congress occasionally has appropriated funds on onetime basis for construction or other improvements at facilities honoring former presidents that are not part of the presidential library program administered by the national archives these include 1 million in 1996 for the calvin coolidge memorial foundation19 500000 in 1997 for the rutherford b hayes home20 3 million in 1999 for the abraham lincoln library21 and 365000 in 2000 for the ulysses s grant boyhood home22 establishing library to establish federallymaintained presidential library in compliance with prevailing law an incumbent president may informally enter into discussions with family members close friends and political associates regarding his wishes in this regard some combination of these individuals may create foundation or other organization of private character to receive contributions and donations to obtain site and construct an edifice for presidential library because the president is not an official of this organization and due to its private character the groups activities are not subject to public scrutiny nor 17 see 44 usc 2112a

the president leaves office his official records remain in the custody of the federal government under the supervision of the archivist it is expected that once the archivist accepts the archival edifice built in honor of the former president the official records of the former president will be deposited there library staff are archives employees and as such are compensated from funds appropriated for this purpose upon completion of the presidential library facility constructed in accordance with prescribed architectural and design conditions arrangements are made by the former presidents private foundation to deed it to the federal government along with an operating endowment statutory law provides for the calculation of the amount of the endowment required23 and legislative history indicates that the income to the endowments is intended to offset building operations costs and reduce to the extent of the income the amount of appropriations required for building operations24 ceremonies for dedicating and deeding the facility are scheduled the federal government takes possession and an opening day is set the former president may or may not maintain offices at his library and his foundation may or may not sponsor or support activities at the library legislation on march 1 2007 two bills pertaining to presidential libraries were introduced hr 1254

requirement hr 1255 would revoke eo 13233 which allows the incumbent president as well as former presidents and vice presidents whose records are affected to withhold from public disclosure the
