authorities to support these activities when state and local res ponse capabilities are overwhelmed the president acting through the secretary of homeland security can provide assistance to stricken communities individuals gove rnments and notforprofit groups to assist in response and recovery aid is provide d under the authority of the robert t stafford disaster relief nd emergency assistance act the stafford act upon presidential declaration th secretary of health and human services hhs also has both standing and emergency authorities in the public health service act by which he or she can provide assistance in response to public health and medical emergencies at this time however the secretary has limited means to finance activities that are ineligible for whatev er reason for stafford act assistance the flawed response to hurricane katrina and preparedness efforts for an influenza flu pandemic have each raised concerns about exis ting federal response mechanisms for incidents that result in overwhelming public health and medical needs these concerns include the delegation of responsibilities among different federal departments nd whether critical conflicts or ga ps exist in these relationships in particular there are some concerns bout federal leadership and delegations of responsibility as laid out in the recently published national response framework nrf there is federal assistance progra m designed purposely to cover the uninsured or uncompensated costs of indivi dual health care that may be needed as consequence of disaster nor is there consensus that this should be federal responsibility following hurricane ka trina congress provided shortterm assistance to host states through the medicai d program to cover the uninsured health care needs of eligible katrina evacuees some have proposed establishing mechanism to cover certain uninsured health care costs of responders and others who are having health problems related to expos ures at the world trade center site in new york city following the 2001 terrorist attack legislation introduced in the 110th congress hr 6569s 3312 would author ize the secretary of hhs to use special fund to

ited states state and local governments take the lead in response activities state and local legal authorities are the principal means to support these activities in re sponse to catastrophes the president can provide certain additional ssets and personnel to aid st ricken communities and can provide funding to individuals and to g overnment and notforpro fit entities to assist them in response and recovery1 this aid is provided under the authority of the robert t stafford disaster relief and em ergency assistance act the stafford act upon presidential declaration of an em ergency providing lower level of assistance or major disaster provi ding higher level of assistance2 recent incidents the september 11 nd anthrax attacks of 2001 and several gulf coast hurricanes in 2005 have s hown the limitations of existing funding mechanisms in supporting public health and medical incident responses first it is not clear that stafford act major disaster assistance is available for the response to infectious disease threats whether intentional bioterrorism or natural eg pandemic influenza or flu second the secretary of health and human services hhs has authority to draw upon special fund to support depa rtmental activities in response to unanticipated public health emergencies but there is at present money in the fund finally there is existing comprehensive mechanism to provide federal assistance for uninsured or uncompensated individual health care costs that may be incurred as result of na tural disaster or terrorist incident though there is not general agreement that such assistance should be federal responsibility this report examines 1 the statutory authorities and coordinating mechanisms of the president acting through the secretary of homeland security and the

disaster declaration issued pursuant to the stafford act author izes the president to provide variety of types of assistance to eligible entities3 major disaster declaration must meet three tests definition need and action the statute defines major disaster as follows any natural catastrophe including any hurricane tornado storm high water winddriven water tidal wave tsunami earthquake volcanic eruption landslide mudslide snowstorm or drought or regardless of cause any fire flood or explosion in any part of the united stat which in the determination of the president causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this chapter to supplement the efforts and availablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33579crs3 4 42 usc 51222 5 42 usc 5170 6 ibid

incident must result in da mages significant enough to exceed the resources and capabilities not only of the affected local governments but the state as well the requirement is set forth as follows all requests for declaration by the presid ent that major disaster exists shall be made by the governor of the affected state such request shall be based on finding that the disaster is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments and that federal assistance is necessary5 third the state must implement its authorities dedicate sufficient resources and commit to meet its share of the costs as follows as part of such request and as prere quisite to major disaster assistance under this chapter the governor shall take appropriate response action under state law and direct execution of the states emer gency plan the governor shall furnish information on the nature and amount of state and local resources which have been or will be committed to alleviating the results of the disaster and shall certify that for the current disaster stat and local government obligations and expenditures of which state commitments must be significant proportion will comply with all applicable costsharing requirements of this chapter based on the request of governor under this section the president may declare under this chapter that major disaster or emergency exists6 stafford act emergency declaration by comparison with major disaster declaration consid erably less assistance is authorized under an emergency declaration7 however the stafford act gives the president considerably broader discretion in issuing an emergency declara tion first the definition of emergency does not include the specific causal events lis ted in the definition of major disaster the president instead may determine whethe r circumstances are sufficiently dire for the affected state to call fo r an emergency declaration also of importance to flu pandemic or other public hea lth threat the protection of public health is to be considered by the president as seen in the following emergency means any occasion or inst ance for which in the determination of the president federal assistance is need ed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of cata strophe in any part of the united states8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33579crs4 9 42 usc 5191 examples of emergencies involving federal primary responsibility include the 1995 bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city and the 2001 attack on the pentagon both federally owned facilities 10 for background see federal emergency ma nagement agency fema notices at httpwwwfemagovnewsdisastersfemayear2000emlike those for major disaster statut ory provisions governing procedures by which an emergency declaration will be considered by the president also contain requirements pertaining to need and action however as with the definition of emergency the procedures provide for wider degree of discretion on the part of the president while governors requesting assistance must take required actions they do not have to identify that state and local resources have been committed governors must however identify the type and extent of federa l aid required the president also has discretion to act in the absence of gubernatorial request if the emergency creates condition that primarily or solely constitutes federal responsibility the stafford act procedur for an emergency declaration follows request and declaration all requests for declaration by the president that an emergency exists shall be made by the governor of the affected state such request shall be based on finding that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments and that federal assistance is necessary as part of such request and as prerequisite to emergency assistance under this chapter the governor shall take appropriate ac tion under state law and direct execution of the states emergency plan the governor shall furnish information describing the state and local efforts and resources which have been or will be used to alleviate the emergency and will define the type and extent of federal aid required based upon such governors request the president may declare that an emergency exists b certain emergencies involving federal primary responsibility the president may exercise any authority vested in him by section 5192 of this title or section 5193 of this title with respect to an emergency when he determines that an emergency exists for which the primary responsibility for response rests with the united states because the emergency involves subject area for which under the constitution or laws of the united states the united states exercises exclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority in determining whether or not such an emergency exists the president shall consult the governor of any affected state if practicable the presidents determination may be made without regard to subsection of this section9 the emergency declaration authority in the stafford act has previously been used by president to respond specifically to public health threat in the fall of 2000 president clinton issued emergency d eclarations for new york and new jersey to help the states contain the threatened spread of the west nile virus10 public health emergency authorities state and local governments rather than the federal government are th seats of responsibility and authority for public health activities both in general and in response to public health and medical emergencies as with catastrophes in gene ral the federal g overnment may provide various forms of assistan ce to state and local governments nonprofit ent itieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33579crs5 11 42 usc 247da 12 for more information regarding the national emergencies act see crs report 98505 national emergency powers by harold c relyea 13 42 usc 243cfamilies and others in respons to public health threats section 319 of the public health service act phs act grants the secretary of hhs broad authority to determine that public health emergency exists pursuant to such determination the secretary may waive certain administrative requirements provide additional forms of assistance and take certain other actions to ex pand federal aid to state and local governments notforprofit entities and others the secretarys statutory authority to determine public health emergency is as follows if the secretary determines after consu ltation with such public health officials as may be necessary that 1 disease or disorder presents public health emergency or 2 public health emer gency including significant outbreaks of infectious diseases or bioterrorist att acks otherwise exists the secretary may take such action as may be appropriate to respond to the public health emergency including making grants providing awards for expenses and entering into contracts and conducting and supporting investigations into the cause treatment or prevention of di sease or disorder as described in paragraphs 1 and 211 the secretary has variety of additional authorities to provide assistance some of these authorities require concurrent determination of public health emergency pursuant to the phs act authority above some require concurrent declaration pursuant to the stafford act andor the national emergencies act12 and some are independent of any other authority listing of various fe deral public health emergency authorities is provided in the appendix the emergency authorities of the secretary of hhs are not strictly comparable to authorities in the stafford act stafford act major disaster assistance is intended to assist states and individuals with needs that exceed the scope of assistance routinely provided by federal agencies and is often triggered by largescale infrastructure damage in contrast the re sponse to public health emergencies such as infectious disease outbreaks often involves extensions of routine program activities such as technical assistance for epidemiologic and laboratory investigation workforce assistance or the provi sion of special drugs or tests in response to public health threats the secretary of hhs can provide considerable degree of assistance to states upon their request through the secretarys standing ie nonemergency authorities there is ne ither defined threshold nor requirement to demonstrate need as with the stafford act for example simply upon the request of state health offici and without the involvement of the president the centers for disease control and prevention cdc can provide financial and technical assistance to stat for outbreak investigation and disease control activities these activities are ca rried out under the secretarys general authority to assist states pursu ant to section 311 of the phs act13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33579crs6 14

emergency and major disast er declarations may offer an instructive comparison the drf is discussed further in subsequent section of this report see also crs report rl34146 femas disaster declaration process primer by francis x mccarthypublic health emergency determinations are less common than disaster or emergency declarations under the staffo rd act the secretary of hhs has determined that public health emergenc exists on only four occasions since 2000 1 nationwide in response to the terro rist attacks on september 11 2001 2 in several states affected by hurricane katrina in august and september 2005 including states that were directly affected and number of states that hosted evacuees 3 in texas and louisiana affected by hurricane rita in september 2005 and 4 in iowa and indiana aff ected by severe flooding in june 200814 two factors may explain the rarity of public health emergency determinations first the secretary of hhs has standing nonemergenc authority to render many forms of aid to state and local government s and others without the need to meet defined threshold of need or impact als although making ch determination authorizes the secretary to draw from public health emergency fund phef the fund has not had balance in it for many years15 consequently none of the determinations issued since 2000 had the effect of mobilizing any additional funds beyond what would otherwise have been availa ble it is possible that if funds were available to the secretary in the phef it could influence the decision to make public health emergency dete rmination or the pressures put upon the secretary to do so16 given that the congress may cons ider whether the degree of discretion afforded to the hhs secretary in ma king such determination and the accompanying reporting requirements are appropriate although the secretary of hhs does not at this time have access to additional funding if he or she makes public health emergency determination the authority appears to have be useful nonetheless in addressing th widespread evacuations that resulted from hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 and the midwest floods in 2008 when public health emergency determination is made the secretary has authority to waive number of requirements that typi cally apply to health care providers as condition of their receipt of federal re imbursement through the medicare program for example among other things these waivers allow beneficiaries to receivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33579crs7 17 applicable waiver authorities are described in waiver of certain requirements in the appendix for more information about waivers applied in response to the midwest floods of 2008 see hhs hhs takes action to help medicare beneficiaries and providers in iowa and

received an emergency declaration on august 27 2006 prior to landfall this was superceded by major disaster declaration on august 29 2006 the day of landfall the secretary of hhs also determined that public health emergency existed in l ouisiana effective august 29 2006 to further complicate matters at least two types of assi stance to louisiana citizens medicaid and crisis counseling program grants were based on their evacuation status from stafford major disaster areas and were available to them in host areas including other states some of which were not themselves subjec t to major disaster declarations 20 6 usc 3126 departme nt of homeland security dhs national response plan december 2004 the nrp was mandated in the homeland security act pl 107296 and superceded the earlier federal response planservices despite having lost their documentation of eligibility and providers to provide services in alternate temporary facilities17 legislation introduced in the 110th congress hr 6569s 3312 would authorize the secretary when he or she has determined there to be public health emergency pursuant to section 319 of the phs act to use the phef to provide temporary emergency health care coverage fo r uninsured individuals affected by the emergency the proposals would require th secretary to consider in making such determination the extent to which the s ituation has or is lik ely to overwhelm health care providers in the affected area and th potential financial bur dens those providers may face as result18 intersection of stafford act and public health emergency authority disaster and emergency authorities pursuant to the stafford act are generally independent of public health emergency authorities only one provision in current law allowing for the waiver of number of hhs statutory regulatory and program requirements discussed bove requires simultaneous public health emergency determination and declaration pursuant to either the stafford act or the national emergencies act when multiple declarations are in effect as result of specific incident as they were following hurrican katrina it can pose greater challenge for officials in understanding the scope nd interaction of thei r response authorities19 federal coordinating mechanisms for disaster response national response framework pursuant to cong ressional mandate the department of homeland security dhs released the national response plan nrp in december 2004 to establish comprehensive framework for the coordination of federal resources under specified emergency conditions20 in

can be implemented at any level at any time nrf p 7 as re sult while the nrf serves as the blueprint for coordinated national response actions following stafford act declarations such declarations are

the stafford act coul d be applied to flu pandemic29 and fema has issued disaster assistance policy regard ing major disaster assistance that may be provided in response to this threat30 the matter of the applicability of stafford act declaration to flu pandemic is important for two reasons first the level of funding that may be available to support federal activ ities and provide assistance to state and local governments and individuals is substantially greater following major disaster declaration than it is for an emergency declaration31 second the federal leader ship structure for incident response may be different depe nding on whether the incident results in stafford act declaration or is nonstafford incident the stafford act requires the president upon making an emergency or major disast er declaration to appoint federal coordinating officer fco to ope rate in the affected region32 this individual has historically reported to the head of fema who in turn reports to the

things as monitoring and assurance of the safety of food and water prevention of injury control of infectious diseases and host of other activities and is carried out by variety of entities primarily government and notforp rofit agencies successful medical response is perhaps more complicated requiring the c oordination of several elements which are variously based in federal st ate or local

collapsed buildings othe r responders including urban search and rescue teams and the us coast guard are trained to work safely in such dangerous conditions but their mission is to resc ue the living not recover the dead47 the matter of mass fatality management is of considerable concern to pandemic planners and this gap could be problema tic during such an incident at times the distinction between esf6 and esf8 may be blurred emergency support function 6 esf6 mass care under the leadership of fema lays out the coordination of emergency shelter feeding and related activities for affected populations as was evident in the respons to hurricane katrina the esf functions overlapped when evacuees in red cross shelte rs required medical care or when large numbers of hospital patients evacuated to esf8 field hospitals required food and water the revised esf6 and esf8 annexes accompanying the nrf provide substantially more detail regarding the coor dination of these functions than did the corresponding nrp annexes also this problem was reportedly considered by fema hhs and the american red cross in their reviews of the hurricane response and in their subsequent preparedness planning in the nrf as with the nrp leadership for the federal coordination of mental and behavioral health services following disaster appears to be split between esf6 and esf8 crisis counseling is

abandon their pets and will remain at home despite an evacuation order if they cannot take pets with them hence the absence of coordinated mechanisms to assure the safety of pets in disasters may jeopardize human safety as well in the postkatrina act congress required dhs in deve loping standards for state and local emergency plans to account for the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals before during and after majo r disaster or emergency in particular with regard to evacuation planning and planning for the needs of individuals with disabilities in addition the act authorized the president to make stafford act assistance available to states and localities to carry out pet rescue and sheltering activities in the immediate response to major disaster50 congress passed similar provisions in pl 109308 the pets evacuati on and transportation standards act of 2006 though neither act addressed the matter of federal leadership for the needs of pets in disasters the nrf however clearly ssigns this responsibility under esf6 mass care and esf11 agricultu re and natural resources fema when coordinating federal efforts to provide human sheltering services per

elated health care costs overview when stafford major disaster assistance is available as it was following hurricane katrina it can be invaluable in supporting public health response activities under esf8 typica lly these activities are inherently governmental and are generally reimbursable from the drf but even when stafford major disaster declaration applies it does little to meet the uninsured or uncompensated costs of health care for disaster victims or to reimburse institutions and providers who may have provided care without compensation there is federal assistance program designed purposely to cover the uninsured or uncompensated costs of individual health car that may be needed as consequence of disaster in typical year there are dozens of stafford act major disaster declarations most resulting from weatherrelated events potentially affecting millions of people given that some us uninsured h ealth care needs go unmet under normal circumstances there is not consensus that the costs of health care for these disaster victims should be federa l responsibility however po licy debates following two recent disasters and concerns about pa ndemic flu suggest that some members of congress and others are interested in expl oring possible mechanisms to provide such assistance at least in certain situations following hurricane katrina congress provided 21 billion through the medicaid program to assist states in provi ding for the health care needs of katrina evacuees for five months following the storm katrinas victims continue to experience mental health problems in di sproportionate numbers however these problems and possibly others resulting from the storm and its aftermath may linger beyond the duration of assistance programs that may be

constitute national catastrophe requiring robust esf8 public health and medical response funding need s may not be readily addressed through existing assistance mechanisms pursuant to the stafford act to the extent that they apply and could outstrip existing governme nt and private resources while the need for public health and medical services c ould be considerable extensive damage to public or private infrastructure is not antic ipated costs associated with workforce surge capacity eg overtime pay and consumption of certain supplies eg for public health laboratory tests could increase substantially presuming surge of patients in the health care system nonur gent procedures which are often more lucrative could be postponed for weeks or months at time this has raised questions regarding whether there would be shifts in overall reve nue to providers for services rendered during pa ndemic and how such shifts could affect providers and insurers finally the cost of providing health care services during pandemic when about 47 million americans currently lack hea lth insurance is of concern to many some are concerned that dis ease control efforts could suffe r if some subgroups of the population were unwilling because of their in surance status or for other reasons to seek care or otherwise interact with disease control authorities during pandemic in march 2007 fema issued disaster assistance policy for pandemic flu outlining among other types of assistance the types of health care services that would be reimbursable through the disast er relief fund presuming that stafford major disaster declaration were made95 assistance would be provided to eligible entities including state and local governme nt agencies to support number of esf 8 activities including establishing temporary medical facilities public communication and mass fatality management with respect to the costs of medical care provided to individuals the policy stat that the following services may be eligible for reimbursement for period of time to be determined by the secretary of homeland security or his designee mergency medical care nondeferrable medical treatment of disaster victims in shelter or temporary medical facility and related medical facility services and supplie s including emergency medical transport xrays laboratory and pathology servi ces and machine diagnostic tests96 neither emergency medical care nor nondeferrable medical treatment are defined given the potential for there to be many casualties of flu pandemic who require extended critical medical care the extent to which the disaster relief fund could be tapped to support the costs of such care is not entirely clear as previously noted following hurricane katrina congress provided 21 billion to states to cover the states usual share of medicaid and schip costs for storm victims for defined time period and the cost of uncompensated care for the uninsured this federal assistance mech anism required legisl ative action and tookhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33579crs27 nearly six months to enact in the absence of preexisting mechanism to provide such federal assistance whether this c ould serve as model for federal assistance during flu pandemic is unclear an impor tant element of the discussion regarding the katrina assistance was the desire to help both states that had been directly affected and states that had assumed fiscal liability by accepting evacuees while the element of victim displacement would not likely be seen during pandemic congress may nonetheless deba the merits of expandi ng federal assistance for health care costs during flu pandemic and the model developed following hurricane katrina may serve as us eful starting point for discussion health care financing proposals for future emergencies legislation introduced in the 110th congress hr 6569s 3312 w ould require the secretary to establish program to provide temporar emergency health care coverage for uninsured or underinsured indi viduals affected by public health emergencies the secretary would be authorized to provide such coverage when he or she has determined there to be public health emergency pursuant to section 319 of the public health service act after considering the extent to which the situation may overwhelm health care providers in the affected area and the potential financial burdens those providers may face as re sult the program would apply certain administrative approaches used in other fe deral health care prog rams eg medicare payment rates but would be financed so lely through appropriations to the public health emergency fund the proposals w ould authorize the appropriation of 7 million for each fiscal year beginning w ith fy2009 for program planning and for an outreach and education campaign for pr oviders and the public about the potential availability of this assistance in public health emergency the proposals would require that if the secretary activates the program of emergency health care coverage he or she shall also establish program for medical monitoring and reporting on the health care needs of the affected population over time conclusion both the secretaries of homeland secur ity and hhs have statutory authority to provide additional assistance to state and cal governments and others in response to catastrophes following hurricane katrin congress defined in statute the roles of the two secretaries with respect to the public health and medical response to catastrophes numerous aspects of these relationships are yet to be sorted out through specific planning exercises and other approaches in carrying out the federal response to public health and medical emerge ncies and disasters the secretary of hhs has broad authority nd considerable discretion in providing assistance but lacks sound funding s ource to s upport the re sponse to these unanticipated events in contrast the president acting pursuant to the stafford act has in the disaster relief fund drf ready source of funds to support an immediate res ponse to emergencies and disasters stafford act assistance is however not especially welltailored for the response to public health and medical threats indeed some of these threats eg bioterrorism may not even trigger stafford act major disaster assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33579crs28 97
