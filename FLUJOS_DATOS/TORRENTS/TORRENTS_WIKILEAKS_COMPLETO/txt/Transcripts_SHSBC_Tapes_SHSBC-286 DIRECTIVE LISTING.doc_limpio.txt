directive listing lecture given on 18 april 1963 how are you today thank you well this is the what male voice the 18th the 18th of april ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and im going to talk to you now about directive listing and r3m2 the situation is evolving very neatly on 3m situation is well in hand and if you want to be interested in something or if you want to have more worries than you have at the present time just audit some 3m this is guaranteedthis is guaranteed method of absorption and worry you can have more heart failure auditing as the auditor doing 3m than the pc ever dreams of now pcs are very anxious to go down the bank very anxious to run the gpm and they get very arc broke and they hate to be stopped and all of this sort of thing and the auditor on his part why heshes in one of these mental states which is well its pretty grim its pretty grim im getting my licks in now on running it i know what of i speak now i myself didnt get much reality on auditing routine 3m by being audited on it and one of the reasons for that is is i have probably one of the most indestructible rrs that ever emerged you can be thankful for that i miss few items or couple of gpms even and nothing much happens the only time my rr ever went off was when id found been put through bank and found twenty items without having the goal for that bank it appearing that the bank was part of another bank and my rr went off and we found the goal for it for those twenty items and of course it went right back on again and theres been further trouble so i dont have reality subjectively on the delicacy of most pcs rrs and yet i have now auditing experience that shows very definitely that pcs rrs are very delicate and you misswell its this delicate you miss couple of items you know bypass couple of items and you find all of sudden the pcs rr is dwindling getting smaller and will suddenly disappear and you cant find any items on this pc and thats apparently fairly ordinary the experience is more than just my auditing experience its been happening in z unit rather consistently i began to see what the auditor is up against there in this situation because there are only two thingsnow get thisthere are only two things that can cause an rr to get smaller that is successive item after successive item an rr can get smaller shorter and that is symptom of danger and only two things cause it and the first of these is not having the goal for the gpm you are running well now with the new directive listing which we are using this liability becomes much less because the items you are getting in directive listing are taken directly from the context of the goal and this only leaves the possibility that the goal might be slightly misworded instead of to be successful we have goal to succeed dont you see i mean we could be that close in but if this were the case the goal would have rsed lot on being checked out beware of these goals that rs lot they rr and then they rsthat doesnt apply to goal halfway through bank because real goal halfway through bank will rs but when youre checking and finding goals youll find goal that rses and theyve got lot ofrs turns on with an occasional rocket read you can be absolutely certain that that goal is slightly misworded in other words instead of to be kingpin you see its to kingpin give you an idea instead of to run restaurant itd be to be restaurant you get the application of it in other words theres something slightly wrong instead of to be cookto be the cook you see and that much error that much error in the wording of the goal will cause goal on checkout to do lot of rs and once starts in by an rr or two and then does an awful lot of rs and then goes blooey and you cant get it to do anything else well that kind of goal by the way is very valuablevery valuable in routine 2 you find goal that does this all youve got to do is tell the pc to give some variations in the wording of this goal and if the pc starts out its to be cook see youve got this goal to be cook and the pc starts out well to like food to prepare food easily well all right let him go on but what you want is just variation in the wording of the goal not goal of similar context you see we dont want the similar concept we want varied wording because its somethingwe know that to and cook are probably right but is it to cook or to be cook or to be the cook which one is it now this gets us into directive listing on goals which is where we properly pick the thing up now when we have the goal that way we mustnt suggest goals to the pc because this upsets the pc like mad but if weve got goal which is going bing bing and rsing and it rrs every once in while and then it goes rs then we cant get any rrs out of it we know what weve got our hands on and about the only thing thats going to cure this in the final analysis is directive listing we tell the pc all right give some goals of similar context he says well to like food to eat to never have anything to do with animals to run farm to be the director of price control in the government to elect the president to well looklook this pcs confront on the subject of goals and so forth is about the same as it is in the bank which means terrible see its because his confront is measurable directly proportional to the amount of charge you get off the case by running bank you see and its not directly proportional to the amount of confront that pc does in bank now you can make pc just confront lots of goals and do lots with goals you can make pc do all these things but the truth of the matter is his confront comes up because you are in actual fact in the bank situation youre in dropped chargeit isnt the number of goals its the number of goals you discharge in other words by findin finding goals you must keep your tone arm action going if your tone arm action ceases in the finding of goals and you do list after list after that without finding one then the pcs attention has hung up on favorite goal and you must get rid of that favorite goal it is either the goal or if youve never been able to get it to do anything and so forth you must change the pcs position in the bank and you do that by saying what goal would you postulate afterto catch catfish had failed there is the wording which is usedwhat goal would you postulate to catchafter to catch catfish had failed thats youd do this list you see and then null it the same as any other way and all of sudden youll find your tone arm motion has been restored tone arm action ceases when youve gotten the pcs goal and gone across it or the pc has stuck on favorite goal which is not due at this time to be run its his goal its somewhere in the track but it cant be run so you must move his attention well theone of the ways to do this is directive listing directive listing is directive to the degree that you just say tell the goal after this other goal has failed that directs his attention dont you see well we can go little bit further than this and weve got this goal to be cook and it rred and then it rsed and then it went out and nobodys heard anything about it since well one of the ways of handling that is to make the pc give us another wording for that goal and we can do this quite directively and the pcs given us this long concatenation which finally winds up to elect the president and it isnt anything to do with being the cook youve got to bring his attention back give some goals with the word 4 cook in them cook cook and the pc says oh well oh why didnt you say so you know and to be cook to be the cook to cook to have nothing to do with cooks to never cook aha that one rred and you say thank you very much and you tiger drill that one and thats the goal thats quite interesting but one of these near misses requires direction of the pcs attention to the right wording to make it run well now to get back to what i was talking about the only thing that while youre running the gpm with routine 3 that can cause an rr to shut offtheres only two things is to get wrong item or bypass an item or list one wrong way to this is all under the heading of actually wrong item because bypassed item means you got the wrong item because you didnt get it in sequence and the wrong way to well you called terminal an oppterm so that again is wrong itemand so on so it actually comes under the heading of youve handled even right item so as to make it wrong item or you bypassed the right item youve done something just in that immediate framework nothing further than that and youll find the pcs rr is getting narrower on the subsequent items if you find them at all in other words bypassing an item or getting wrong item or listing one wrong way to you can then give the same phenomenon as would appear if you were running wrong goal now we are running the goal to be cookthis would be wrong goal to be cook and we get the top terminal top oppterm and so on which would probably be cooks or something like this and we get cook or 44 cooked or something like this and its to be cook it doesnt look wrong does it and then well get down to the next one we get the we have little trouble getting the top terminal all right thats fine and then we get the second oppterm from the top and oh we get that all right and then we get the second terminal from the top and we suddenly begin to realize that this pcs rr is getting awfully small well of course we havent got the right goal if we go on getting rrs why the rr will shut off we go on getting ris the rr will shut off the shutoff rr then is adequately telegraphed to the auditor the auditor knows all about it you see it isnt true that different ris have different lengths rrs thats not true theyre basically all the same length and if you got an inch and quarter rr on the top oppterm you should get an inch and quarter or even little better on the top terminal and it should be an inch and quarter on the second top oppterm and an inch and quarter on the second top terminal in other words we should go on there and if anything the rr should improve little bit and certainly it should improve on the goal well now if the reverse happens if we get shortening rr we know that one of two things are wrong weve either gotten wrong item or we have got wrong goal now with directive listing it isnt likely that we are going to get very wrong goal that is rather ruled out one of the ways we would become aware of this is the pc keeps putting down steam locomotives and were trying to run this to catch catfish and whats going on here and we keep directing him into catching catfish dont you see and we want caught catfish or whatever the top oppterm is and it just doesnt fire and the top terminal is caught catfish or something of the sort and that doesnt fire well but we start getting other things firing and so forth and we just cant seem to make it now because auditors do have lot of trouble making this your first assumption is not that you have wrong goal but this is definitely possibility you cant get the items which would ordinarily belong to that goal into that gpm and they dont fire obviously there must be something wrong with this goal of course if you really want to arc break pc start challenging right goal thats sometimes even challenging wrong one this is one of the liabilities of the business and the other one and much more likely is that youve gotten the wrong top oppterm or the wrong orand the wrong or the wrong top terminal and the wrong or even the right top oppterm and the right top terminal and the right second top oppterm and then you caught the next one and by accident listed it wrong way to or something andwow i did that and immediately on the third top oppterm why i didnt have any items i didnt have any rr or anything and i got couple of little things on the list that rred but the rr from being about an inch long was suddenly only about quarter of an inch long and then on the nextnext item it didnt exist at all just nothing rred we had nothing but long falls well now there are those amongst us i am very sorry to say who would say at this point well its the pcs item and it doesnt really have to read anyway so well just go on and find it yeah youd better blush thisthis is nonsense because the auditor has simply blinded himself to the fact that something is wrong and should be corrected so you know if you get shortening or vanished rr theres one thing that is true theres somethingis wrong and the something wrong is with the items or the goal and the second one you take and look at of course is the goal you try to correct the items first now if youve run this thing six eight items down into the bank and its all running fine and theyre right according to the lineup and so forth well of course it isnt wrong goal it couldnt be wrong goal or it wouldnt have gotten that far you wouldnt have found those items rring thats iti mean lets say its to be catfish and catfishishness and so forth stuff like this is turning up in there being catfish you know rr or being catfish rred like mad the beingness of catfish see that kind of thing you know this sort of thing all rred well you cant have wrong goal there dont you see so it must have been that you omitted an item or you got wrong item or you faked an rr or you did something and goofed and the first thing to suspect is that your top oppterm and top terminal since theyre the most variablenow from being the most fixed theyve become the most variablebut your top oppterm or top terminal are wrong and the thing to do in that particular case is go back and experiment with them and see if something else fires in their place and if that isnt the case see if you havent skipped pair you might have skipped pair dont you see there might have been terminal and an oppterm maybe the third oppterm and the third terminal maybe you just skipped that pair and somehow or other patched up so that they crossed in and you got two bypassed items look for something like that and of course the most obvious thing to look foris you evidentlyyou will do this sooner or later because i just did it last night just carelessly list one backwards just like that even though its staring you right in the face all of sudden the pcs wrapped around the telegraph pole all arc broke and nothing going anyplace rr diminishing dwindling everything going to pieces in other words now that were listing by pattern with directive listing youre pretty safe in running routine 3m its very safe now running it without discovered pattern was not safe because the pcs confront is not up to it and youd just miss things all over the doggone place if you did that so there is only two things that can be wrong and the most likely is that youve got wrong item subheadyouve bypassed an item subhead youve opposed one wrong way to or subheadyouve gotyou just picked up the wrong item thats your most likely and then the other one is of course that youve got wrong goal but if of course the proper 3gm wordings according to the pattern you have has been firing on the pc the possibility of that goal being wrong is very faintvery faint and you shouldnt rack the pc up with it but you mustnt rule that out as possibility well thats about the only thing can go wrong now if you want to know whether or not every ri should rr and isnt it all right just to kind of apathetically go across the ahhhhh the meter moved little bit and yeah well its supposed to be there and so ill just give it to the pc i know what youre up against i had tendencive had tendency to do this you know its obviously the right item turning on somatics but it wont rr well that leads straight to disaster because youre not going to get anyplace from that point there on the thing youve got to do is stop right where you are correct the thing that prevents the rr from occurring and that will be something that went just before just ahead of what you are doing nope if you run straight pattern and if you run that pattern right on down that rr will improve itll get better itll get sparkier and spunkier the goal will read better and everything will go along beautifully soon as you miss one of those things as soon as you miss your rr will get smaller and tend to disappear you dont get rocket reading items on your list and so forth well thats the liabilities of 3m but if youll see that as prevention of doing something wrong you can get in happier frame of mind dont curse at it apparently on the bulk of the pcs you will be auditing you know right away when something is wrong because you lose your rr well you take old ironsides he didnt ever lose his rr so this has never come up see he had twenty items and most of them wrongtwenty items into the bank without the goal and my rr shut off well thats kind of the way it is but rrs apparently arent that strong theyre fairly delicate now let give you anotheranother item here on this same subject pc in running 3m if youre running from the top down if you havent picked up the goal to cause or something like that off the backtrack and youre trying to run this on this poor pc if youve got his present time goal its got pain in it it hurts those items hurt hes very delighted to have them and get rid of the somatics because hes had them for long time but it hurts and every time you say that item to him you turn on somatics lets say its catching catfish you see and you found this and when he put it on the list it fired and when you called it back once it fired and so forth youre going to run into this kind of situation sometimes youre going to call it again catching catfish you know you didnt see the rr it only went full dial and smoke came out the corner of the meter and you call it again and you want to make sureyou want to make sure you want to be certain you want to be certain whereas you dont have any certainty you want to be certain about this you see so you call it againso you call it again so you knowyou know perhaps the second time you call it its not going to be there as an rr third time it certainly isnt going to be there as an rr and the fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh and eighth ninth tenth eleventh twelfth thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth time you call it brother its not only not going to be there the pcs going to hate your guts because every time you say it youre blowing his head off thats an interesting thing you ever think about it that the pc has something to do with the session ive tried to teach some of the people in w unit this that the pc has something to do with the auditing session im having some success having some success were going to rig up something that when the pc dies large bell rings or something like this so the auditor will be aware of something having happened im sorry to be sarcastic but i myself audit the pc in front of little demonstration which we saw last night i didnt see the pc in front of the auditor being audited i saw the auditor going through the forms of auditing and that i always frown on the forms of auditing should be used but of course the pc is there to be audited you dont abandon the forms of auditing you just get good enough so that you can audit the pc in spite of the form of auditing and because of the form of auditing and youre going to be all right and by the way youll find its much better to use that form of auditing of course there was one student who got much better results he was permitted to audit up in east grinstead he didnt like being there at that time we were separating doing some course separation and they had to stay around awhile after they were terminated and this pc tookwas taken up to east grinstead and audited and they got along much better because the auditor was permitting the pc to eat stick candy all during the session well the pc did much better thats true its true the pc did much better that pc bad auditing came anywhere near the pc the pc wasnt insession didnt get any auditing and an auditor who would do that to pc or let pc do that would probably audit the pc very badly anyhow man to keep the pc interested and sitting there you have to feed him stick candy i dont think thats the right way to go about it anywayanyway im in vicious mood today the situation with regard to the discipline of auditing is the pc in front of you feels the pc in front of you has nerves now of course youre clearing him and eventually he wont have any nerves or be connected with any and hell be just doing fine but at the moment youre auditing him could i call to your attention the fact that the pc has sensibility as to what is going on and you take an item that is anyhow strong enough or big enough to aberrate 90 percent of his life and youre going to say to himyoure going to say to him catching catfish catching catfish catching catfish im trying to see if that rocket reads catching catfish i didnt see if it rocket reads or notcatching catfish iitsi you see ii have to confront you when i say it you know and i dont get chance to look at the meter so ill ill look at the meter again catching cat i didnt see the meter again uh so forth and you say well that doesnt rr well the question is did it rr well yes when you called it the first time it rred and after that the pca lot of pcs will do this it isnt just few of them they put on the brakes they do total suppress and they say get those goddamn catfish off of see and the auditor says i want to see if it reads catching catfish catching catfish catching cat it isnt reading yetcatching catfish cat oh my god hes got these knives going through the pcs chest you see and the pc is trying to hold this stuff up so what happens you dont get any read now after that nonsense you could put in your mid ruds by all means put in the big mid ruds and preferably even an eighteenbutton prepcheck that would be good and timeconsuming and you get this thing all put in you see and you finally get it all straightened up and you say once more catching catfish you get rocket read see so then you say catching catfish catching catfish cat and the pc says he may not even be sitting there saying anything you know but internally thats the way hes going you know because its an oppterm hes been fighting them all of his life so you say well that doesnt rocket read well probably have wrong goal probably have the wrong gpms probably have the wrong reactive mind probably have the wrong thetan possibly even have the wrongprobably even have the wrong auditor maybe were in the wrong room see you could trace it back like this and what does it come from comes from the fact that you should understand in running 3m that items have kksssrm in them they got skkkrrr and the more you say them and the more you chant them at pc and the less certain you are and the more nonsense you go through the less likely you are to keep rocket read on you could say it this way im studying the delicacy of rrs and the delicacy of rrs are this the pc listed it you give the pc ill give you the next rocket reading nexttothelast rocket reading item on the list the nexttothelast so the pc doesnt make mistake and you say fishhooks that doesnt rocket read that doesnt read you would say and now i will read you the lastthe last rocket reading item on the list catching catfish that rocket reads that is your item now would catfish or catching catfish or not catching catfish whatever it was oppose catching catfish and the pc says oh yes yes and you get your blowdownzzzzzrrrrmmmm sometimes you get your blowdown earlier and then you say all right thank you how does that relate to the goal and the pc says oh its an absolute negative of the goal catch well it makes the goal but somehow or another im agin it whatever it is and you say thank you very much write it down on your auditors report write down your next question who or what now here is the question you say who or what would oppose catching catfish and actually thats all the actions you take in 3m see you dont take other actions you get ityour trouble occurs when youve gotten yourself all set you say ill read you the last rocket reading item on the list or usually now we have directive listing the only rocket reading item on the list and you say all right the pcs put it down pc all very bright and you say catching catfish and it doesnt rocket read ooooooooh and according to pattern thats what belongs there ohohohohoh well try to get some more items that measure onto it more closely but watch it man if thats the item that really belonged there you gonna stray somewhere and it didnt show up till just now so try to get the right item down do everything you can to get the right item down and if you still cant get the right item down recognize that you have got wrong item ahead of you usually or youve done something silly with something just back of this dont try to take it out with the item catching catfish in other words dont go at it on the basis i was just showing you catching catfish i will read you now the only rocket reading item on the list catching catfish catching catfish catching catfish cat catching catfish on this item has anything been suppressed on this item is there anything youve been carecareless of on this item is there any foolproof on this item should we use neverleak on this item zabwablawrarahrharah yapyapyap i mean im telling you theres point in it man theres point in it thats the right item its the only rocket reading item on the list you completed your listing you call it youre going to get an rr if you dont get an rr youre wrong doesnt do you any good to try to drill it or pray to allah or throw coins out there in the wishing well it wont do you bit of good its wrong item and something before that is wrong itlleither you didnt get the item on the list or an item just ahead of this is wrong and the first thing you consult of course always is the list you are working on right at the moment and you try everything you can to make that work out and if that doesnt work out and you cant get rocket reading item off that when called back to the pc then its an earlier item that is flubbed up youve missed something or youve done something there thats what you put your time in on is looking for whats wrong right here with the 3m not trying to get this thing to read and you call it once dont you call it six seven eight twelve fifteen eightytwo times now this brings us down if were going to be that sharp this brings us down to directive listing now what happens when the pc says on the goal to catch catfish the pc says thats the ers formyes on the plot there thats the ers form so therefore thats ercatchers haha yeah thatsthats the item ercatchers uh so on you gonna let him flounder around burn up all your auditing time that way youre not you say yes its the er form thatthats right now just for fun take look at this and you make out what it is in other words youve got to know the item better than the pc because the pc is down in the middle of the bank he cant confront it because hes under all the duress of charge with relationship to this item but youre not and you can figure out what that item is now ill give you couple of lessons on this on directive listing two things ive learned is gobbledygook isnt right i mean he tries to give you some gobbledygook of some kind or another just to comply with the form and they arent words that make any sense whatsoever they dont make sense it doesnt matter if theyre not english but they dont make sense dont expect them to read they might even read but youre shortly going to run out of rr let give youits the er form well the only thing you can seem to get there is catcheter you dont know what it is pc doesnt know what it is nobody knows what it is and for some mysterious reason it rocket reads so you say well thats it and you finally find out that its just plain catfish catcher see and youll find out that itsthe item actually makes sense the item makes sense and youre going to see sooner or later people with directive listing trying to make gobbledygook work i had an i had an example of this i had an example of this i had couple of words on line plot when i was auditing and they didnt make much sense and i let them go by they didnt make any sense to and by george we had wrong item and as soon as we got the thing straightened out and they did make sense and so forth they rocket read and we went ahead beautifully the point im stressing here is even though you have those forms dont try to gobbledygook it because gobbledygook wont work but sometimes it looks little gobbledygooky lets get the idea of to be catholic lets say that somebody had goal like that got it down in the vatican or somewhere they got implanted and to be catholic you know and you get down to the ness form of the goal and you say well thats obviously the beingness of catholic but by george that doesnt work and you finally find out that its catholicness makes sense doesnt it catholicness it isnt an english word but its perfectly decent concept its the ness ness of being catholic see and catholicness youll find out will fire right at that point very nice so trying to bend it around or the pc trying to bend it around cathnessuhcatholness uhuhuhuhnesscath uh isnt going to work it just isnt going to work yet youll see pcs try this well youve got to be good enough as an auditor to look at that thing and say well his goal is to be catholic uh what would it be ness form of the goal the beingness doesnt seem to operate here its catholicness so you finally after he gets cathness and nesscath and nescafé you finally say wellyou finally say or say even earlier than that you say lets try catholicness catholicness he says catholicness haha didnt think of that of course he never thought of it thats why youre the auditor and hes the pc because hes right in the middle of the living lightning and its living lightning man and you cant think you wait till you run bank on somebody someday to be stupid you really want to have picnic ohhohoho its hard enough to think in some kind of bank to be bright but in one of these banks to be stupidits gorgeous and what are you going to run into what are you going to run into youre going to run into gobbledygook hes going to try to follow the form but he cant make it integrate and youve got to sit there as the auditor and direct his attention to what he ought to put down there otherwise whats going to happen youre going to start running out of rrs youre going to start bypassing items the next thing you know something is wrong way to and the next thing you know you may be over in some other bank theres telling whats going to happen now look the liabilities of wrong item are so greatthe liabilities of bypassed item are so greatthe liabilities of straying into another bank are so great in terms of just the mechanics of auditing trying to hold the pc insession in terms of the number of somatics and the amount of pressure that turns on on the pc thein terms of arc break and so forth these things are actually so magnitudinous that you must do everything possible to prevent them and thats what directive listing is for now youve got the bank youve got theyouve got bank pattern now the bank pattern youve got at this particular stage is not perhaps the perfect bank pattern its awful close to itits awful close to it particularly in its upper and lower reaches the upper fourteen or even the upper eighteen or twenty and certainly the lower dozenomitting the two lowest oppterms which vary on every goal thats very very set thats very very patterned now how patterned the middle ground is i cant actually guarantee nor can i guarantee that something hasnt been bypassed through that goal because i dont particularly suffer from this sort of thing but i tell you why why that bank is issued its issued just for directive listing now its actually my fifteenth gpm i think its the fifteenth its some such number and i was running out earlier gpms and straightening them out very neatly and i became aware of the fact that we had to know some data and amongst the data that we had to know is did you get knocked off if only half of the bank was run or that sort of thing thats all in guinea pig frame of mind and also i realized that we had to have the basic fundamentals of bank well the way to get the basic fundamentals of the bank was just to sit down and grind them out under every possible combination and i would say this sounds very heroic and i could say well i gave my all for you and so forth i could go into it that way as matter of fact it was an auditor flub the auditor started looking this over that far back on the track and i complained i said im in the middle of the living lightning here man and were going to establish the character of the bank back this far on the track haaaaaaahhh because we certainly should know the character of the bank and the auditor went ahead and established started running this bank so that bank is so bad and so beefy that of course you had to get the right pattern or you would have got killed in the pcs chair by the amount of charge so i didnt have much choice but anyway i was going back on the track to see if we couldnt establish what the exact pattern was and if youll notice there was lot more to the gpm than there appeared earlier and with the number of cases now ive seen run in the top hampersnobody finds them just nobody finds them and early on in the first few banks i ran i didnt find them so its an unconfrontable situation because theres too much charge and confront is in direct ratio to theto the amount of charge taken off and the pc can confrontthe more charge is taken off so anyway i went all the way back on the track and there i was and i got all the data and stretched it out and one of the reasons im very chary about putting it around is thats the most wicked thingthe bankthat there is which is of course to create rrrrrr of course every one of its items that has positive create form in it is busy creating and they can create more mass and more answers and more this and more that so its obvious that if you took it out of that bank and that bank evaporated why then of course you have correct rendition of what the pattern is now much to my amazement it holds true later on the track and it holds true on other pcs not because theyre told so the point here in actual fact is if the pc isnt run guided very closely to this pattern his rr goes off so therefore the pattern has value now there will be other patterns ill pick them up ill straighten this one up and absolutely shape it up and there will be patterns for various types of goals dont you see but you can extrapolate it from the just to ver form of goal you can you can figure out what it is because its all the same and its perfect pattern now directive listing then has to do first with the accuracy of the pattern directive listing was not very successful when you didnt have successful pattern and when the auditor doesnt know what hes trying to do you dont of course have very successful directive listing now an auditor who gives pc bunch of gobbledygook nescafé and other things like that thats for the birds but an auditor has to give some suggestions because the pc is just not likely to pick it up actually the pc will go on listing and listing and listing and listing and listing and will practically list himself into the ground where as matter of fact all he has to put on the list is one correct item and bang the charge is gone thats it sometimes they have to list few more to get the edge of it off but the point im making here is that directive listing is kind and nondirective listing totally permissive psychological approach to life you know what do people do oh they just do yahisnt going to get you anyplace because youunderstand where youve got the pc man you just poured him over niagara falls in barrel and just as he left you put in the next fourth of julys entire stock of fireworks and match you put the lid on and over the niagara falls he goes and youre not going to help him out huh whoa brother of course if youve got it in for him why go ahead by all means say go on and list now the main thing thats going to give you trouble at least for while unless we get absolute patterns straightened out on it things going to give you trouble is the top oppterm and the top terminal now these are characterized as the final achievement of the goal it is the nounal final achievement of the goal that is what the top oppterm is and the top terminal is simply negative negative whatever that was its negation of it now atthis leaves an awful lot to beto be looked at and because its first on the bank and its first right up the top and its the first thing youre going to find if you find it wrong as you drag on through your rrs going to shut off before youve gone five six items all of sudden youve got rr well you dont look always at those to be wrong but you look up toward them and if you cannot find anything has been wrong way to and nothing has been bypassed and it all seems to be straight and you havent had any trouble look for what you had trouble on look for the longest list you had to do you know thats an awful good tip the earlier longest list and so forth good tip on that you finally have to come back up to the top oppterm and top terminal and take look at them again and see if you can get something else functioning because theyre the most likely to have thrown it out now what are they well actually theyre what they are in the pcs aberrated consideration having postulated the goal he postulated the goal so what is the final form of it now hes going to try to sell you all kinds of final forms that dont have anything to do with the goal well heill give you an example youve got the goal to be tiger and hes going to give you brilliant beautiful animal nuts it never will be see itll be tigers or the tigers or something like that nor will it be tigerness thats lower actionthats lower item see and its not going to be tigerishness or anything like that its not going to be one of those lower items its going to be something like tigers you see when we know some more about this itll be even we found lot of them right i dont think its such thing as been tigers or becoming tigers or something like that but you get into ainto some randomity now thats dead easy on tigers to be tiger oh for heavens sakes thats nothing find that any day of the week how about goal like this how about goal like this to be the object of whirlpool now whats the top of this thing well you say obviously its the object of whirlpool but thats probably the last thing thatll ever occur to the pc itll be whirlpool is probably the first thing the pc will try to give you all sorts of things of that character but these goal wordings are tricky now you take to be the cook now you get to be the cook the cook iswhats the top of the oppterms its probably the cook or something of that sort well fine its what rocket reads of course now you oppose that and what do you get well youve got number of combinations and theyre liable to vary from pc to pc but its not never the cook but it might be not the cook the cook youve got these various negative choices you see and remember that you can have combination of this sort the notcook you can throw those negatives into the body of the thing and possibility is that you sometimes get negative that turns out to double negative turning out to be positive that mustnt be ruled out as possibility it might make sense but those two will most easily rocket read almost anything will rocket read up there oh even the wrong one will rocket read oh isnt that horrible ooooh naturally in bank to catch catfish catfish caught catfish catfish catfish caught catfish catfish catcher all of these things are liable to produce an rr so your rr is not too reliable your best test is having gotten them they rred they opposed properly your rr then didnt dwindle in finding subsequent items so those things should be considered to be in state of being tested even when youre up to about the twelfth ri in the bank this bank is running all right this banks running fine along about number six nothing untoward had happened i would start to relax about the top oppterm and the top terminal but id keep them in mind that long now as far as wrong goals are concerned there isnt much probability of finding wrong goal or listing wrong goal because the worst you would get would be the two top items that would be wrong and itd suddenly become apparent to you that something was awfully wrong here somehow or another but you should have been forewarned the goal probably rsedthe thing has never been seen to read properly theres something else goofy about this thing andand get this as the positive testby the time you get down to the sixth or eighth item the goal ought to be reading like buzz saw it ought to be reading beautifully the goal does not read well in the first four items well of course thats kind of late but listen if you found these items and they did rocket read then you have goal that is quite similar to them even if it is the wrong goal and it should be very easy just on the process of saying give some variations for this goal to get the right goal well i hope i havent worried you too much this is worrisome subject and i hope i havent disturbed your sleep or this evenings session in actual fact if you look over the very few things that can be wrong you will then stop being nervous about all the other nonsense that you may worry about because only those things can be wrong that i have enumerated and talked to you about in this lecture actually the most fun in auditing i think ive ever had is auditing 3m and the most interest and the most violent pc has ever been will be manifested in 3m the pcs very interested you cant stop pc from going down bank or getting audited to clear with anything once hes started once hes started you wont be able to stop him you can find somebodys goal and then he isnt too keen to have the first item found but one fine day if you want to see some bird who has found his goalhis goal has been found and he doesnt seem to want to be audited from that point on just get him in casual conversation on meter and see if you cant find his top oppterm and he wont stop then thatll be that thatll be that if goal is very close to present time it turns on lots of somatics and they keep him very interested keeping ahead of his own somatics all right well that is the score with regard to directive listing and thats lot of the whys and wherefores back of directive listing it is not method of evaluating for the pc you dont evaluate for him you just tell him what the next item is he should put down thank you very much good night
