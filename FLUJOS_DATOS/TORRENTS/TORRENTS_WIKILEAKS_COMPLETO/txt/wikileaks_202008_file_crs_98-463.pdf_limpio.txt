recent developments concerning legislative proposals to implement the world inte llectual property organization wipo copyright treaty and the wipo perfo rmances and phonograms treaty there are two pending wipo treaties in the intellectual property field the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo pe rformances and phonograms treaty the copyright treaty covers copyright protecti on for computer programs databases as intellectual works and digital communications over the worldwide internet and other computer networks the perfo rmances and phonograms treaty covers protection for performers and producers of sound recordings since the copyright treaty is the focus of the legislative proposals this re port concen trates upon implementation issues affecting the copyright treaty in general however the legislative provisions enacted to implement the copyright treaty will also be applied to implementation of the perfo rmances and phonograms treaty the original clinton administration implementation bills s 1121 and hr 2281 would have amended the copyright ac t to create new protection in two fields only protection against circumvention of anticopying technology and protection to assure the integrity of copyright management information systems another bill s 1146 addressed additional issues including online service provider liability fair use ephemeral copying and distance learning fourth bill hr 3048 was similar to s 1146 but omitted the online service provi der provisions and added provisions on first sale and shrinkwrap licensing s 2037 the successor bill to s 1121 pa ssed the senate on may 14 1998 hr 2281 as amended passed the house of representatives on august 4 1998 both bills now bear the short title the dig ital millennium copyright act of 1998 the bills

technologies provide unparalleled opportunities for worldwide communications and economic growth in the judgment of most experts it is also generally agreed that in order to tap fully the potentials of these new t echnologies many difficult technical and legal policy issues must be confronted and resolved one of these legal policy issues concerns the scope of protection for copy righted works against unauthorized copying or other unlawful use in digita l electronic environments the general copyright policy issues relating to internet uses of copyrighted material are being examined both by nati onal legislatures nd by the appropriate international intellectual property organizations bills were introduced in the 104th c ongress s 1284 and hr 2441 to make changes in the copyright law related to internet uses of copyrighted works1 hearings were held on these issues but the bills were not enacted at the international level two new intellectual property treaties were created by diplomatic conference of states in geneva switzerland on december 20 1996 these are the wipo copyright and performances and phonograms treaties2 the wipo copyright treaty covers copyright protection for computer programs and databases to the extent the latter are intellectual works and clarifies or creates rights relating to use of copyrighted works over the internet and in other digital electronic environments the wipo pe rformances and phonograms treaty covers protection for performers and producers of sound recordings called phonogramshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs2 3 hr 3048 and s 1146 contain the same proposals relating to fair use library reproduction distance learning ephemeral r ecordings operational copying by computers and protection against removal or alteration of cmi the provisions on circumvention of anticopying technologies are also virtually identic except that the definition of effective technological measure differs slightly hr 3048 moreover contains amendments relating to the first sale doctrine and shrinkwrap licenses not found in s 1146 on the other hand s 1146 contains provisions on online service provider osp copyright liability not addressed by hr 3048 4 the senate foreign relations committee has primary jurisdiction over the consideration of the treaties the senate and house judi ciary committees have primary jurisdiction over amendments

the senate for its advice and consent and originally recommended implementing legislation that adopts minimalist approach to treaty implementation s 1121 and hr 2281 as originally introduced embody the administrations implementation proposals as introduced these bills were premised on the assumption that existing united states law is largely consistent w ith the treaty obligations the proposed amendments concerned only two substantiv issues and technical matters the two substantive amendments would provide new legal protection i against devices that are primarily designed to circumvent an ticopying technologies and ii against performance of certain acts relating to removal or alteration of copyright management information cmi subsequent to the introduction of the administrations imp lementation bills two other wipo implementa tion bills were introduced which address copyright policy issues not considered by the admin istration bills these broader bills s 1146 and hr 3048 propose amendments to the copyright act concerning internet or national information infrastructure nii issues such as fair use library reproduction ephemera l copying distance learning and operational copying by computers in addition to provisions on circumvention of anti copying technologies and protection against rem oval or alteration of cmi3 separate bills hr 2180 and hr 3209 addressed only the online

treaties implementation act was subject to sequential referral to the house commerce committee the subcommittee on telecommunications trade and consumer protection held hearing on the bill on june 5 1998 the full commerce committee made several amendments to hr 2281 and reported the bill as the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 on july 22 19987 the house commerce committee version of hr

section 1201 would prohi bit the manufacture importation offering to the public or other trafficking in any technology product service device component or part thereof that is primar ily designed or produced to circumvent an anticopying system proposed civil penalties include in junctions impoundment of infringing material or equipment actua l damages and any additional pr ofits of the violator not counted as part of actual damages or statutory damages raging from 2002500 per act of circumvention product or performance of service or at the plaintiffs option total award between 250025000 for repeated violations within three years the court may triple the damages the court also has the discretion to reduce or remit damages if the violator proves and the c ourt finds he she or it was not aware and had reason to believe that the law was violated under the same circumstances in the case of nonprofit libraries and educa tional institutions the court must reduce or remit damages for innocent violations as passed by the senate and house of representatives both bills have been amended to clarify and narrow the scope of the anticircumve ntion requirements in comparison to the provisions of the original bills circumventions for purposes of interoperability of computers including reve rse engineering are permissible unless the activity exceeds permissible fair use bounds and is otherwise infringing new clauses expressly declare that 1 nothing in the anticircumvention provisions enlarges or diminishes the doctrines of vicarious or contributoryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs6 8 464 us 417 1984 in this landmark deci sion the supreme court by 54 vote held that the manufacturer of the betamax vcr sy stem had copyright liability for hometaping for private use of television programming that is transmitted for free offair reception by the public in part the decision rested on the prin ciple that the manufactur er would not be held contributorily liable even if the homeowner infringed the copyright since the vcr technology has significant noninfringing uses 9 the home recording rights coalition hrrc which is trade association representing manufacturers dist ributors and retailers of electronic products and some consumers issued press release on may 1 1998 about s 2037 that the amendment to the anticircumvention provisions significantly clar ifies that this legislation would not chill the design of new generations of recordings and computer products gary shapiro chairman of the hrrc stated we are very pleased that in the digital millennium copyright act the senate judiciary committee has now made clear that such legislation does not require that the design of consumer electroni cs telecommunications or computing

right9 both bills exempt law enforcement and intelligence activities generally from the anticircumvention provisions nonprofit libraries and ducational institutions are exempted for purposes of making purchasing decisions criminal liability is waived for nonprofit libraries and edu cational institutions and civ il liability must be reduced or remitted for these institutions and their employees if the defendant proves the violations of the law were innocent hr 2281 alone has been further ame nded to 1 delay for two years the implementation of the anticircumvention provisions and require an initial regulatory review by the secretary of commerce followed by periodic threeyear reviews of the impact of any technologyprotection measures on the application of fair use 2 exempt certain encryption research activities 3 clarify that the bill neither enlarges nor diminishes constitutional protection fo r freedom of speech and press and 4 mandates two agency reports the first on the impact of the bill on electronic commerce and the second on the impact of anticircumvention technology on research and development including the effect on reverse engineering 3 protection of copyright management information cmi systems the wipo treaties impleme ntation bills would add new section 1201 to the copyright act prohibiting the knowing pr ovision of false copyright management information

other nonprofit organizations can make 30 copies of broadcast program under certain conditions 17 usc 112bcopyright infringement the intentional re moval or alteration of cmi would also be prohibited the purpose of these provisions is to facilitate widespread use of cmi by rightsholders in order to make licensing of works or obtaining permission to use works more readily available to the pub lic consistent with the treaties the provisions cannot be legislated as formality ie as condition of the exercise or enjoyment of the copyright or pr ohibit the free movement of goods both civil and criminal remedies are proposed these remedies and their exceptions are the same as those descri bed above for violations of the anti circumvention provisions the civil remedi would be codified as 17 usc 1203 the criminal remedies would be codified as 17 usc 1204 the new rights to protect the integrity of cmi systems apply both to analog and digital formats in this respect the b ills exceed the minimum treaty obligations since the wipo treaties require protection only for elect ronic rights management information as passed by the senate and house of representatives both bills 1 exempt lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence activities from the cmi requirements 2 exempt nonprofit libraries archives and educational institutions from criminal liability 3 in the case of the same tities require reduction or remission of civil liability for innocent violations and 4 limit the liability of broadcasters and other transmitting organizations depending in the case of analog transmissions upon whether or not cmi comp liance is technically feasible and not unduly burdensome financially and in th case of digital transmission upon the existence of industry st andards in general 4 distance learning nonprofit libraries and ducational entities also seek specific exemptions to facilitate use of the internet for systematic educational purposes socalled distance learning s 1146 senator ashcrofts alternative bill to implement the wipo tr eaties contains such pr ovisions s 2037 and hr 2281 do not contain special exemptions for distance learning the register of copyrights however is directed to study the issue and submit report to the congress including recommendations for legislation within six months of enactment of the bill 5 ephemeral recordings under existing copyright law commercial and noncommercial broadcasters10 enjoy an exemption from the reproduction right to make at least one copy of broadcast pr ogram for delayed transmission or archival purposes this is known as the ephemeral recording exemption s 2037 would amend 17 usc 112 to extend the existing ephemeral recording exemption to nonsubscription broa dcasts of sound recordings in digital formats as discussed in the next secti on of this report which concerns the majorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs8 11 nonprofit libraries and educational entitie s have sought other amendments of the copyright act which were included in s 1146 andor hr 3048these proposals cover fair use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments different ephemeral recordings provision exemptions for ope rational reproduction of copyrighted works by computers extension of the first sale doc trine of 17 usc 109 to digital electronic environments and preemption of state laws that might allow enforcement of socalled shrinkwrap licenses unilateral licenses imposed on purchasers of computer software when they open the package containing the soft ware in general these proposals have not been included in s 2037 or hr 2281 except that hr 2281 contains brief technical amendments relating to fair use and the first sale doctrinedifferences between the two bills h r 2281 embodies different ephemeral recording amendment not included in s 2037 which is part of an amendment to the digital audio transmission license of 17 usc 114 another amendment of 17 usc 112 wh ich relates to th new protection against circumvention of anticopying tec hnology appears in both bills when broadcaster is prevented by the copyrigh t owners technical anticopying measures from making the permitted ephemeral recording both bills require that the copyright owner must make available to the broadcaster the necessary means to make the ephemeral recording provi ded it is technologically feasible and economically reasonable to do so if the copyright ow ner fails to provide the necessary means in timely manner in accordance with r easonable business requirements the broadcaster is not liable for violation of the copyright owners anticopying measures 6 library reproduction both bills broaden the exemption for library reproductions of copyrighted works the library exemption of 17 usc 108 would be expanded by permitting library repr oduction of three copies or phonorecords rather than the one copy of existing law by deleting the references of existing law to reproduction only in facsimile form and by adding as new justification for library reproduction the factor that the work is stored in an obsolete format provided that copy reproduced in digita l format must be used on the premises of the library or archives in lawful possession of the obsolete format11 7 osp copyright liability title ii the administrations original implementation bills did not address the issue of who is liable for infringement of copyrighted works on the internet and other computer networks as result of actions by customers of online service and access providers although the wipo treaties arguably could be implemented without cl arifying osp liability that outcome was opposed by many groups including coalitions representing the osps telecommunications entities th electronics industry nd library and educational institutions also without legislative gu idance osp liability would be decided by the courts on an ad hoc basis which arguably would require many years of litigation to delineate s 2037 and hr 2281 as passed by the nate and house of representatives respectively basically absolve osps from copyright liability if they merely transfer information on computer networks without ving any control of the content of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs9 12 this report uses osp as shorthand for persons and entities who transmit route provide connections or otherwise facilitate computer network service and access for customers without initiating or altering the c ontent of the transmission although osps are the main beneficiaries of the copyright liability provisions in the title ii of the bills entities other than osps can claim the exemption if they meet the statutory conditions 13 the negotiations that culminated in an agreement on osp copyright liability on march 31 1998 were conducted for several years under the auspices of the senate judiciary committee and the subcommittee on courts and in tellectual property of the house judiciary committee the private sector negotiators included representatives of copyright owners and authors telecommunications electronics and computer equipment manufacturers and online service providers this agreement on digital copyright liability has been published at 55 bna patents trademar k copyright jour 564 april 9 1998 14 among other requirements the notice must be in writing describe the infringing material give information about its location on the netw ork identify the copyrighted work contain sworn statement that the notice of infringem ent is accurate and be signed physically or electronically by an authorized persontransmission12 the bills create safe harbours from either direct vicarious or contributory copyright infringement in accordance with private sector agreement on osp copyright liability13 upon receiving notice of infringem ent that complies with statutory requirements14 an osp is expected expeditious ly to remove disable or block access to the extent blocking is t echnologically feasible and economically reasonable upon receipt of counternoti ce by provider of the blocked site the osp shall retain the block fo r 1014 days but longer unl ess the copyright files suit for copyright infringement the exemptions from liability apply both to network service transmissions and to private and realtime communications services digital network communications an osp is not liable for monetary relief and injunctive relief is carefully circumscribe d when an osp acts as mere conduit in transmitting the copyrighted work some of the specific restrictions to qualify for this exemption are the transmission was initiated by someone other than the osp the transmission is provided through automatic technical processes without selection of content by the osp the osp does not select the recipients of the copyrighted material except as an automatic response to provide service the osp does not maintain copy of the copyrighted material that is accessible to recipients for longer period than is reasonably necessary for the communications and the material is transmitted without changehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs10 15 mai systems corp v advanced co mputer systems of michigan inc 992 f 2d 511 9th cir 1993system caching the osp is not liable for monetary relief and injunctive relief is carefully circumscribed when the copyrighted material is temporarily stored on the system or network as part of an auto matic process without change for use in refreshing reloading or other updating in accordance with accepted industry standards for data communications information storage an osp is not liable for monetary relief and injunctive relief is carefully circumscribed when an osp stores infringing material on its network at the direction of system user if the osp does not have actual knowledge of the infringement is not aware of facts or circumstances that make the infringement apparent or upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness the osp acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material information location tools the standards applicable to storage of information apply generally to osp liability for referring or linking users to an online location that may contain infringing material that is the osp is not liable without actual knowledge or awareness of facts that make the infringement apparent or if the osp acts expeditiously to remove or disable access upon obtaining knowledge or awareness of an infringement the bills propose penalties for knowing material misrepresentations about infringing activity absolve osps of nonc opyright liability if the osp in good faith acts to disable or remove allegedly infringing material establish the principle that traditional copyright defenses such as fair use are unaffected by an osps blockage of or failure to block access to alleged infringing material provide that copyright owners who seek the identification of the direct infringer from the osp must obtain court order first in the narrow cases where injunctive relief is available place limits on the scope of the relief orders and make osps terminate subscribers who are repeat infringers but do not require sps to monitor the network to seek out infringers 8 computer maintenancerepair exemption title iii both b ills incorporate the freestanding bill hr 72 which overturns ninth circuit

2281 with respect to provisions common to both bills have generally been noted in the above analysis of the common provisions of the implementation bills hr 2281 also contains several provisions and two titles that have counterpart in s 2037 thes proposals are discussed in this section of the reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs11 16 pub l 10439 act of november 1 1995 wh ich generally took

with the exception of collective bargaining ag reements limited to the public performance rights sec 416 of hr 2281 requires that th transfer of motion picture rights shall be deemed to incorporate the collective bargaining agreements negotiated after enactment of the bill if the transfer ee knew or had reason to know about the agreements or if there is an existing court order against the transferor which the latter is not able to satisfy within 90 days after the order is issued if the transferor of motion picture rights fails to notify th transferee of the contractual obligations and the transferee becomes bound by cour t order to make payments under the collective bargaining agreement the transferor is liable to damages claim by the transferee 3 under secretary of commerce for intellectual property policy sec 401 of hr 2281 would create new position in the department of commerce for an under secretary of commerce for intellectual property policy this under secretary would

sound recordings befo re enactment of th digital audio act the owner of sound recording copyright did not have any right of public performance this 1995 act applies only to public performance of sound recording by means of digital audio transmission the act has application to the existing analog system of broadcasting the existing digital audio transmissi on right of 17 usc 114 applies to subscription transmissions and interactive transmissions ie payperlisten or audioondemand services the act ge nerally does not apply to noninteractive nonsubscription transmissions noninteractive subscription services may be eligible for compulsory license payperliste n and audioondemand services do not have the benefit of compulsory license in doing business generally these interactive services must negotiate with the sound reco rding copyright owner to obtain the right to transmit the sound recording but th 1995 act places some strict conditions on this exclusive righthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs12 17 499 us 340 1991apparently the parties affected by the section 114 compulsory license for digital audio subscription services have disagreed about interpretation of the law sec 415 of hr 2281 contains substantial ame ndment of the section 114 digital audio compulsory license which is intended to address the interpre tive problems under this relatively new law sec 415 also would amend the ephemeral recording exception of 17 usc 112 however instead of broadening th exemption to apply to nonsubscription broadcasts of sound recording in digita l format as provided in s 2037 the house bill creates another compulsory license to make an ephemeral recording which parallels the digital audio transmission license of 17 usc 114 as amended that is those transmitting organizations that obtain 17 usc 114f compulsory license are generally eligible for the new ephemeral recording compulsory license under the license the transmitting organization could make one copy solely for use in its own transmissions and must destroy the copy within six months of first transmission unless the copy is preserved ex clusively for archival purposes 5 collections of information antipiracy act title v of hr 2281 the wipo copyright treaties nd the implementing bills s 2037 and hr 2281 would clarify and perhaps expand prot ection for databases that are intellectual creations and can qualify for protection as works of authorship under the copyright act under decision of th supreme court in feist publications v rural telephone17 however databases that lack at least modest amount of creative expression are not constituti onally eligible for copyri ght protection database producers have become concerned about l ack of protection for databases that are the result of industrious effort the so called sweatofthe brow standard this concern is compounded for them by the fact that the european union has issued directive mandating new form of protection for collecti ons of information under an extraction right that is available only on the basis of reciprocity that is american producers will be able to enjoy this new form of protection in europe only if the united states reciprocates with similar protection for europeanorigin collections of information title v of hr 2281 responds to th request of database producers for protection of databa ses that cannot qualify under copy right law standards pursuant to the feist case essentially collections of information that result from substantial investments of time money or resources would enjoy misappropriationstyle of protection for 15 years against copying this proposal passed the house of representatives as separa bill hr 2652 over the obj ections of many groups in the library educational and scientific communities in the united states basic right this new misappropriation right would be enacted as chapter 13 of title 17 usc under the authority of the commerce clause rather than the patent copyright clause of the constitution httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs13 the prohibition against copying applies gene rally to all or substantial part of collection of information that results from the investment of substantial amount of money or other resources provided the copying causes actual or potential harm to the market for the database exclusions from protection proposed 17 usc 1304 excludes from protection 1 collections of informati on developed by federal state or local governments including the efforts of govern ment employees within the scope of their employment and 2 computer programs us ed to operate or maintain the collection of information the government collection exclusion doe s not apply however to information required to be collected by the secu rities exchange act of 1934 and by the commodity exchange act the computer program exclusion does not apply to collection of information that is incorporated in computer progra m that is otherwise subject to protection under chapter 13 one other exclusion from pr otection is expressed in the definition of product or service that embodies the collection of information the definition purports to exclude from protection information gathere d organized or maintained in order to route transmit or store digital on line communications or provide access to connections for digital online communications this exclusion is intended to address concerns about interference w ith the operations of the internet if the chapter 13 right were applied to the data used to control the operations of the internet limitations on the right exceptions or limitations to the new chapter 13 right would be established at 17 usc 1302 in the form of six permitted activities the following are permitted activities in relation to use of protected collection extraction of individual items and other insubstantial part s from collection copying of information obtained from independent fforts use of collection for the sole purpose of verifying information gathered independently provided the use does not harm the actual or potential market for the collection use of collection for nonprofit educational scientific or resear ch purposes provided the use does not directly harm the actual market for the collection use of the collection for purposes of news reporting unless the extracted information is timesensitive and has been gathered by another news reporting entity and the extraction shows pattern of use in direct competition with the rightsholder and the owner of lawfully made copy of the collection is entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of the copy relationship to other laws proposed 17 usc 1305 declares that the new chapter 13 right has effect on copyri ght patent and trad emark laws design protection antitrust and cont ract laws trade secrets privacy rights or access to public documents equivalent state law ri ghts are preempted there is impact on the communications act for the purpose of publishing directories in any format detailed provisions specify that there is impact on the securities exchange act and the commodity exchange act or on the jurisdiction or authority of the securities and exchange commission or the commodity futures tradinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs14 commission the permitted acts of 17 usc 1303 do not apply to use of securities or commodities information except as that use is permitted by the securities exchange and commodity exchange acts and the regulations issued thereunder civil remedies the civil remedies for viola tion of the new chapter 13 right include injunction impoundment actual dama ges plus defendants profits from the violation not counted in dama ges treble damages costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party if nonprof it educational institution preva ils as defendant and the court finds the plaintiff brought the case in bad faith attorneys fees shall be awarded to the defendant the remedies of an injunction and impoundment are not available against the united states government the court shall reduce or remit money damages against nonprofit educational scientific or research institution if the defendant proves it believed and had reason to believe its conduc t was permissible criminal penalties willful violations of the chapter 13 right for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or financial gain or willful violations that cause 10000 or more in damages in one ear can be punished by criminal penalties employees or agents of nonprofit educationa l scientific or re search institutions libraries or archives are exempt however from any criminal penalties for violations of the chapter 13 right when acting within the scope of their employement the penalties include fine in the maximum amount of 250000 andor 5 years in prison for first offenses for second or subsequent offenses the maximum fine and prison time are doubled effective date the collections of information antipiracy act would take effect upon enactment statute of limitations clause provides that action may be brought against an extraction from collection that occurs more than 15 years after the date of the investment that created the portion of the collection that has been extracted this clause effectively limits the protection to 15 year period 6 vessel hull design protectio n act title vi of hr 2281 the house passed bill incorporates another new form of intellectual property protection not included in s 2037 title vi of h r 2281 embodies the vessel hull design protection act this title creates new 10year form of design protection for boat hulls essentially this proposal is inte nded to fill in perceived by some gap between the existing design pa tent and copyright laws the new design protection would be added to title 17 usc in new chapter 14 which would be headed protection of original designs proposed 17 usc 1401 would create new legal protection for th original design of useful article which design makes the article attractive or distinctive in appearance design is original if it is the result of the design ers own creative endeavor and represents distinguishable variation compared to other designs that is more than trivial and is not copied from another person the overall shape of boat larger than rowboat and smaller than 201 feet in length could be protected against copying both for its artistic and utilitarian featureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs15 18 damages of 1 copy would seem to have significance primarily for designs of useful articles other than vessel hulls this damages provision is another example of the way title vi may lay the foundation for protection of th design of useful articles in general 19 489 us 141 1989notwithstanding this broad language about designs of useful articles in general useful article is defined to mean ve ssel hull therefore as proposed the new design protection is limited to designs of boat hulls but with few word changes the new chapter 14 design right could be expanded to designs of useful articles in general excluded from protection are those desi gns that are 1 not original 2 staple or commonplace 3 different from staple designs only in insignificant details or elements that are common variants or 4 embodied in useful article made public by the designerowner more than one year before an application for registration the exclusions of proposed 17 usc 1402 actually list fifth criterion which is dictated solely by utilitarian function however anot her clause in the bill makes clear that this exclusion does not apply to boat hull designs that is boat hull designs can be protected against copying of their utilitarian features in order to obtain boat hull design protection an application for design registration must be made to the administrator the register of copyrights within two years after the design is made public the boat design right would be enforced through civil remedies only these remedies include an injunction act ual damages plus 50000 or 1 copy 18 the infringers profits destruction of infringin g articles and attorneys fees to the prevailing party the boat design right would take effect one year after enactment the new right would not apply to any design made public before the effective date like the database proposal of title v the boat design proposal passed the house of representatives as parate bill hr 2696 th proposal also essentially responds to decision of the supreme court in bonito boats v thunder craft boats19 which held that state law protection of boat designs was an unconstitutional interference with the federal patent and copyright laws the boat design title would enact desi gn protection proposal that has been presented to congress severa l times and been rejected when the proposal extended to designs of useful articles in general one of the objections to the current legislation may be that it represents first unwelcome to some step toward enactment of general design legislation another similarity to database legislation is the fact that design protection is the subject of european uni on harmonization project for american designs to obtain design protection in europe the united states would have to enact new design legislation equivalent to the design protecti on available in europe boat design protection has not been cons idered separately by earlier congresses when general design protecti on was considered in earlier years however objectionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs16 from the insurance industry consumers retailers and others concerned about possible anticompetitive effects of design protection were sufficient to prevent enactment of general design legislation conclusion the wipo copyright treaty and th wipo performances and phonograms treaty are two new international treaties in the field of intellectual property rights which were developed at diplomatic conference in geneva switzerland in december 1996 the president has submitted th treaties to the senate for its advice and consent to ratification by the united st ates implementing legislation to conform united states law to the obligations in the treaties has passe d the senate s 2037 and house of representatives hr 2281 the wipo copyright treaty confirms c opyright subject matter protection for computer programs and thos databases which are intellectual creations clarifies or extends rights of public distribution co mmercial rental and public communication ie transmission to use of copyrighted works in digital electronic environments subject to limitations that may be enacted by national law and requires adequate and effective remedies to protect against circumvention of anticopying technologies and knowing alteration or remova l of electronic rights management information the wipo performances and phonograms treaty tracks most of the provisions in the copyright treaty and applies them in the context of phonograms that is sound recordings in addition the performancesphonograms treaty requires protection for certain rights of pe rformers including moral rights copyright owners authors publishers and other producersdisseminators of copyrighted works originally urged imple mentation of the wipo treaties through enactment of the minimal changes in unite d states law proposed in s 1121 and hr 2281 as introduced these content providers initially argued that united states law is already consistent with the treaties with respect to exclusive rights and limitations on rights they argued that implementin g legislation need provide protection only against circumvention of anticopying t echnologies and viola tions of copyright management information cmi ri ghts content providers favored early ratification and enactment of the original bills to send an appropriate message to other countries in order to encourage th em to adhere to the treaties and upgrade their protection for use of copyrighted wo rks in electronic digital environments groups representing the telecommunica tions and electronics industries libraries and other educati onal interests generally suppor ted the ratification of the wipo treaties in principle but only on th basis of implementing legislation that would address their concer ns about osp liability fair use distance learning ephemeral copying and other internet c opyright issues these groups argued that united states law is not settled concerning the scope of rights and limitations on rights in digital electronic environments they argued that these issues must be addressed in legislation rather than ft to ad hoc judici decisionmakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98463crs17 alternative implementati on bills were introduced s 1146 and hr 3048 that responded to many of the concerns of these groups through the legislative process of hearings debate consideration and amendment the original implementation bills have been substantially modified s 2037 has replaced s 1121 as amended s 2037 and hr 2281 embody the digital millennium copyright act of 1998 the bills have many common provisions but also differ in significant respects the bills embody consensus agreement by private sector interests concerning online service provider copyright liability other amendments clarify or narrow the scope of the anticircumven tion and cmi provisions and cl arify or expand several of the limitations on the rights of copyright owners in digital contexts including library preservation ephemeral c opying and fair use some issues such as distance learning and additional exemptions for nonprofit edu cational institutions and libraries when they provide online service are left to further study and reports to congress by designated federal agencies hr 2281 includes additional amendm ents concerning the issues of circumvention of technological measures fair use the first sale doctrine encryption research ephemeral record ings and the digital audio transmission compulsory license moreover hr 2281 adds two new forms of intellectua l property protection that were not formerly considered part of the wipo treaties implementations issues title v of hr 2281 would enact the coll ections of information antipiracy act which creates 15 years of appropriationstyle protection for databases that are not eligible for copyright protection title vi would enact the vessel hull design protection act which would create 10 year s of new design protection for both the artistic and utilitarian features of boat hulls it appears that compromises have been reached on formerly contentious issues such as osp liability the anticircumvention provisions and several issues of concern to libraries and educational institutions except for the inclusion in hr 2281 of the collections of information antipiracy act and the vessel hull design protection act it seems likely that both c opyright users and copyright owners are in general agreement on enactment of wipo treaties implementing legislation
