issues and initiatives mary tiemann specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division summary the north american free trade agreement nafta includes several environmentrelated provisions that while limited were unprecedented for their inclusion in trade agreement however further environmental and labor assurances were needed to secure passage of nafta and ultimately the negotiating parties agreed to side accord that promotes cooperation on environmental matters and includes provisions to address partys failure to enforce environmental laws additionally the united states and mexico entered into the border environmental cooperation agreement beca which authorized the establishment of the border environment cooperation commission becc and the north american development bank nadb to help border communities finance environmental infrastructure projects in the 108th congress naftas environmental provisions and related institutions have continued to receive attention key issue has concerned the effectiveness of the nadb and the becc and especially the banks ability to finance projects enacted on april 5 2004 pl 108215 hr 254 authorizes several operational reforms to the nadb other issues involve the environmental impact of nafta and the effect that nafta and its environmental side agreement have had on the negotiation of other us trade agreements including the uscentral america free trade agreement cafta and uschile fta this report briefly reviews naftas environmental provisions associated agreements and related issues and congressional actions it will be updated nafta environmental issues and provisions environmental issues emerged early in nafta negotiations and linkages between trade and environmental issues were reflected in the outcome of these negotiations more so than in any previous trade talks while not new issue the question of whether countrys stricter environmental measures could be found to pose nontariff trade barriers received an unprecedented level of attention during the nafta debate additionally the question was raised whether countrys weaker environmental protection measures or their ineffective enforcement would create competitive advantage and provide an added incentive for businesses to relocate production to the least regulated country related congressional research service the library of congress crs2 concern was that expected naftadriven industrialization and population growth in the usmexico border region would worsen the severe pollution problems already present although trade officials argued that environment was not customary trade matter and that nafta talks were not the best forum for resolving these issues the level of concern over environmental issues in congress prompted nafta negotiators to respond to them ultimately the nafta parties included language to conditionally protect partys stricter environmental health and safety standards for products and produce provided that among other things such measures are scientifically based nafta also includes hortatory language to discourage parties from lowering standards to encourage investment other nafta provisions encourage upward harmonization of standards and encourage parties to integrate environmental protection and sustainable development into economic decisionmaking naftas standards provisions do not affect countrys ability to determine its levels of environmental protection for manufacturing and other process standards such as water pollution controls and resource harvesting practices nafta set precedent in addressing its relationship to multilateral environmental agreements meas it identifies three traderelated meas that may take precedence over nafta if implementation conflicts arise provided that the mea is implemented in the least naftainconsistent manner the listed agreements include the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal and the convention on international trade in endangered species usmexico and uscanada bilateral wastetrade agreements also are included and the parties may agree to add others despite the inclusion of the above provisions some in congress remained concerned that naftas effect on environmental laws could be unpredictable for example an issue during the debate on renewing trade promotion authority concerned the effect that nafta may have on state and federal environmental laws because some investors have challenged environmental measures as constituting form of expropriation for purposes of the nafta investment chapter these provisions allow companies to challenge and potentially be compensated for governmental measures that are viewed as harming their investments at least 20 cases have been filed including 6 against the united states one of which involves californias ban on methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline environmental concerns persisted after completion of the nafta text to facilitate nafta passage two related agreements were negotiated which are discussed below north american agreement on environmental cooperation matter not addressed in the nafta text was whether lax enforcement of environ mental laws in mexico would provide an added incentive for us industries to relocate and thus increase us job losses and increase borderarea pollution many in congress called for side agreements that included an enforcement mechanism to address failures to enforce environmental and labor laws opponents of side agreement argued that naftarelated economic growth would increase mexicos resources available for environmental protection and that nafta would increase environmental cooperation in north america nonetheless congressional support for nafta remained uncertain crs3 in 1993 the three nafta governments adopted the north american agreement on environmental cooperation naaec which includes dispute settlement provisions to address partys failure to enforce environmental laws the side accords objectives cover range of goals including avoiding the creation of trade distortions or new trade barriers enhancing compliance with and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations and fostering environmental protection and pollution prevention the side agreement created the north american commission for environmental cooperation nacec which includes council joint advisory committee and an independent secretariat the council consists of cabinetlevel representatives of the parties and has key responsibilities regarding the side agreements dispute settlement provisions the joint advisory committee advises the council and is comprised of nongovernmental groups the secretariats duties include preparing reports and serving as point of inquiry for public concerns about naftas possible environmental effects the nacecs major goal is to broaden environmental cooperation among the parties it provides forum for the parties to consider ways to address environmental issues and provides an avenue for dispute settlement panels to obtain environmental expertise perhaps most notable is the side agreements dispute settlement process that as last resort may impose monetary assessments and sanctions to address partys failure to enforce its environmental laws to invoke the dispute settlement process complaint must concern partys persistent systematic failure to enforce its laws and the alleged failure must be traderelated or involve competing goods or services only the nafta parties can initiate naaec dispute settlement proceeding and none have done so however the secretariat may consider submission from any person or nongovernmental organization asserting that party is failing to enforce its environmental law and may request that party to respond the secretariat may prepare factual record and submit it to the council for its consideration since 1995 47 citizen submissions have been filed and 9 factual records have been finalized and made publicly available usmexico border environment cooperation agreement throughout the nafta debate many proponents and opponents noted the need to identify funding sources for financing environmental improvements in the border area much of the pollution there had been attributed to the effects of unregulated industrial development and related population growth associated with mexicos maquiladora program and both governments anticipated that nafta could further concentrate economic activity in the border region and that existing environmental conditions would worsen without binational effort to address infrastructure needs the administration estimated that 8 billion would be required to address needs for sewage treatment drinking water and municipal solid waste infrastructure projects along the border over the next decade and that naftarelated industrialization would create additional needs1 for many in congress support for nafta was partially contingent on the identification of mechanism for financing border environmental projects in october 1993 the united states and mexico agreed to new institutional structure to promote border environmental cleanup the border environmental 1 us congress house committee on banking finance and urban affairs united states mexican border environment agreement hearings 103d cong 2d sess oct 27 1993 crs4 cooperation agreement authorized the establishment of the north american develop ment bank nadb and the border environment cooperation commission becc to assist border communities in financing environmental infrastructure projects the agreement noted the need for environmental infrastructure especially in the areas of water pollution wastewater treatment and municipal solid waste the becc is directed to help border states and communities coordinate design and mobilize financing for environmental infrastructure projects and to certify projects for financing the nadb evaluates the financial feasibility of becccertified projects and provides financing as appropriate public involvement is fostered through representation on the becc board of directors and advisory council and through public comment process on proposed projects the nadb was designed to generate between 2 billion and 3 billion in loans or guarantees for financing environmental projects on either side of the border ten percent of the nadbs resources may be used for naftarelated community adjustment and investment projects to leverage financing the united states and mexico each contributed 225 million over four years for total of 450 million in paidin capital the nadb is authorized to make only marketrate loans however and this has been major obstacle to the banks ability to finance projects in lowincome border communities despite the creation of the nadb to provide financing for border environmental infrastructure projects grants from the environmental protection agency epa have accounted for the vast majority of funding provided through the bank in 1997 the nadb entered into an agreement with epa under which epa contributes much of its annual border infrastructure appropriation to the border environment infrastructure fund beif over the past decade congress regularly has provided epa with 75 million or 50 million each year for border water and wastewater projects the nadb established the beif to use epa grant resources for drinking water and wastewater projects to make the projects affordable for border communities the nadb develops financing packages using its loan and guaranty programs epa grants and other sources epa grant funds may be used for beccapproved projects on either side of the border as of june 30 2004 the nadb had approved 22 loans worth total of 971 million and had fully disbursed 9 loans overall the nadb had authorized 6624 million in grants andor loans to partially finance 80 infrastructure projects estimated to cost total of 226 billion in addition to the 22 loans this assistance included 490 million in epa grants that had been committed for 52 water and wastewater projects2 because of the low activity level of the nadb and because most infrastructure funding for nadb projects has been provided through epa grants rather than nadb financing considerable interest emerged in recent years for reforming the nadb both federal governments the border states and other interested parties discussed possible reforms for these institutions including changes in institutional structure types of financial assistance provided and types of projects eligible for assistance 2 for more information on nadb and becc functions and accomplishments see beccnadb joint status report june 30 2004 at httpwwwcoceforg crs5 in 2000 the nadb established low interest rate lending facility using part of its paidin capital to provide lowerthanmarket rate loans to communities in 2001 president bush and president fox directed binational working group to develop recommendations to strengthen the performance of the nadb and the becc in 2002 both presidents accepted the working groups recommendations and directed their respective administrations to work with their legislatures to effectuate them the recommendations include maintaining the focus on environmental infrastructure projects giving the nadb more flexibility to make grants and belowmarketrate loans to finance projects and expanding the geographic scope of beccnadb operations to include the area in mexico within 300 kilometers of the border in august 2002 the nadb board of directors approved creation of water conservation investment fund to finance water conservation projects as discussed below hr 254 pl 108215 enacted in april 2004 authorizes several operational reforms to the nadb corresponding legislation was approved by the mexican legislature in 2003 assessing naftas environmental impacts the nafta implementation act directed the president to report to congress in 1997 on the effects of nafta and implementation of the side agreements the resulting study concluded that it was premature to assess any environmental effects of nafta and difficult to determine whether further environmental degradation at the usmexico border was due to nafta or other economic development and events more recent studies have attributed increased border pollution and other environmental impacts to nafta although the studies generally identify number of other contributing factors march 2001 naaec study north american trade and transportation corridors environmental impacts and mitigation concluded that air pollution from increased freight traffic in nafta transportation corridors is significant and could double or quadruple by 20203 relatedly the number of assembly factories in mexico near the border grew from 2114 in 1993 to 3182 in 2003 while employment at these plants more than doubled to 107 million4 report by epa in 2000 protecting the environment of the usmexico border area noted that the concentration of industry and people at the border was exacerbating pollution and health problems and that many border cities expected to experience serious water constraints by 2005 naaec committee recently completed tenyear review of the environmental side agreement and concluded that the naaec has facilitated trinational environmental cooperation and capacity building overall and specifically has fostered environmental progress in mexico congressional activity and issues in the 107th congress the environmentrelated provisions of nafta and its side accord received attention during consideration of trade promotion authority legislation 3 the nacec has an ongoing program assessing the positive and negative environmental impacts of nafta on specific sectors as well as projects assessing various environment matters these studies and reports can be found at httpwwwcecorgtrioindexcfmvarlanenglish 4 in 2001 the number of maquiladora plants reached 3684 with 1202 employees the decline of 502 plants by late 2003 has been attributed to decline in the us economy and movement of plants to china and elsewhere for lower labor costs see for example randall sherman has outsourcing to china gone too far mexiconow v 2 7 novdec 2003 p 4245 crs6 and the usjordan free trade agreement fta both adapted environmental provisions from the naaec and nafta5 some in congress expressed particular concern regarding the effect that naftalike investment provisions may have on domestic environmental protection efforts because various investors have challenged environmental measures as constituting form of expropriation under the nafta investment chapter6 also in the 107th congress the house passed hr 5400 to authorize changes in nadb and becc operations with goal of increasing these institutions effectiveness in the 108th congress efforts to reform the becc and nadb continued and in april 2004 the president signed into law pl 108215 hr 254 hrept 10817 this law authorizes the president to agree to change in the nadbs charter to permit the bank to make belowmarketrate loans and limited amount of grants in order to increase the number of projects these institutions support it directs the us members of the nadb board of directors generally to oppose project proposals if grants account for more than 50 of the project financing or if project is not financed in part by loans the law also authorizes extending the operational area of the beccnadb on the mexican side of the border from 100 kilometers to 300 kilometers it requires an annual report to congress and includes sense of the congress relating to us support for water conservation projects in other legislation the conference report to hr 6 the energy bill section 146 would amend nafta implementing legislation to direct us nadb board members to encourage the bank to finance infrastructure projects related to clean energy and energy conservation interest in the 108th congress also has continued regarding the implications of nafta and the naaec for new trade agreements the uschile and ussingapore ftas both include an obligation for parties to enforce their environmental laws and make this obligation subject to dispute settlement procedures moreover both agreements include environmental cooperation and capacitybuilding provisions the uschile fta further calls for parties to negotiate uschile environmental cooperation agreement the uscentral america fta cafta which the president has signed but which requires implementing legislation includes similar provisions and also adapts the naaec provisions that allow citizens to file submissions concerning partys failure to effectively enforce its environmental laws while welcoming the heightened consideration of environmental matters since the nafta debate some members of congress and environmental groups remain concerned that the provisions in the current tpa law and in recently negotiated trade agreements may not be sufficient to safeguard legitimate environmental measures from challenges particularly those involving investorstate disputes consequently while the debate over whether environmental matters should be part of trade negotiations generally has been settled the debate over how to address such issues is likely to continue the effect of the environmentrelated provisions in recent us bilateral trade agreements and thus the shape of the debate may become clearer with the ongoing implementation of nafta and subsequent agreements that have incorporated nafta and naaeclike provisions 5 for more information see crs report rs21326
