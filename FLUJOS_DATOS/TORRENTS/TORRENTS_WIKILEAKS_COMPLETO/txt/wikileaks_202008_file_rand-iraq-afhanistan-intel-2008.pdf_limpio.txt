their coverage encompass ing the full spectrum of conlict and 3 the nations of afghani stan and iraq serving as the primary though not exclusive sources of material he irst i n the earlier trio people make the city joint urban operations observations and insights from afg hanistan and iraq 1 was broad based general study of the topics and theaters in question he cond tale of hree cities 2 sought instead to investigate three urban operations in detai l and draw material of interest to potential users by inding commonalities and comparing operatio ns conducted in iraq by the us army in mosul us marine corps fallujah and briti sh army basrah and amara continuing counterinsurgency challenges3 was the third such ofering it took difer ent approach one similar to that used in this efort continuing counterinsurgency challenges focused on selected key issues identiied during interviews and litera ture searches as being particularly diicult he research underlying this report took n two

by the many interviewed in support of its underlying research in add ition to material from appli cable written sources and previous work in the urban operatio ns and coin realms it does not seek to be comprehensive evaluation of the current state of afairs regarding intel met rics or coin issues but rather seeks to identify key insights per tinent to the three areas and make recommendations

currently confronting the tasks associated wit h such undertakings and any in future years having to do so we think it better to cover both the sometimesknown and origi nal material additionally beneit of interviewing so many i nsightful individuals is the access the sessions ofer to innovative thinking molded by one person s intellect in light of his or her experiences we therefore seek to ofer the reader these insights s that they might be adapted to meet the demands of challenges elsewhere in place and time when appropriate he following overarching question guided our work what cha

groups too often th friendly force is also perceived as threat negatively inluencing civilian willingness to coope rate with coalition intel collec tion and other initiatives recognizing that treating civilians and detainees with respe ct can have great beneits is an inherent extension of this recommendation both cases wil l pose ongoing challenges given deliberate insurgent eforts to inspire

insurgent and criminal activity would remain even if the threat disappea red overnightcorruption sectarian prejudice and its related violence incompetent admi nistration crippled physical

coalition personnel present the various enemies an alleged just iication for violence and threat but the international forces strength means that th ey are best removed by eroding the soil from

associ ated with the deinition development and use of metrics in the s ame environment both were selected for attention because they were repeatedly evident in ou r previous years work in writ ings on ongoing us deployments and in many of the more than 3 00 interviews in support of this ongoing series of studies between october 2003 and septem ber 2006 we did not limit our investigations during the 12 months following that three year period to intel and metric issues alone chapter four addresses additional issues the aforementioned coin topics not falling into either of the two previous categories yet deemed suiciently important to merit their presentation for reader consideration he ifth and ina l chapter summarizes the poten tial impact of recommendations made in earlier pages and consid ers them in light of tasks that our men and women in uniform will likely face during future deployments he resulting analysis makes claim to being comprehensive evaluation of the current state of afairs regarding intel metrics or coin issues rath er it seeks to identify selected key insights regarding the three areas and make derivative recom mendations of prospective value to those in the

popular will or the peo ples support is the center of gravity cog during coin operatio n5 even the few question ing this assertion almost without exception agree that the pop ulation inevitably has dramatic efect on ultimate success as general kiszely so eloquently sta ted one of the reasons this is the case is that civilians are often vital sources of information it is therefore striking that so little attention has been given to this crucial component in the planni ng and execution of friendly force operations too often operations include unfortunate pisodeseg unit demonstrat ing too little ire discipline when traversing an urban area so ldiers failing to grant residents demonstration of basic courtesies during home searchesth at overlook the essentiality of giving priority to 1 preserving the peoples good will and 2 co nvincing them that the coali tion will persevere in its struggle with insurgents doctrine tells us that destruction or neutralization of the enemy center of gravity is the most direct path to victory and that commanders not only consider the enemy cogs but also identify and protect their own cogs6 granted it is impossible to deny foe occa sional success in attacking cog so broad in character as populat ion its will or even the critical leadership thereof yet those interviewed in suppor t of this research noted with little frustration that coalition forces themselves too frequently n eglect to treat local community members properly whether cog or merely vital component of frien dlyforce success such neglect not only fails to protect this important operational f actor it works to increase the ben eits that an adversary draws from it hough certainly an overs impliication there is value in considering popular support zerosum game any amount gaine d by one side deprives foes of an equal quantity of good will and intel conversely an activity tha t turns community mem bers away from the counterinsurgent cause beneits adversaries equal to those st he importance of the noncombatant population potentially lends increased signiicance to nonmilitary organizations with capacity to improve civil ians lot ongoing operations in

tempered only by their desire to efectively trans late guidance from civilian leaders into achievable military objectives in traditiona l major combat operation mco envi ronments the order to conduct combat operations is likely to be accompanied by set of clearly deined objectives that drive planning commanders start with these objectives and use process of backward planning that ideally includes

whether metrics are being developed that truly support the desired objectives or whether these metrics sometimes selected by default because of their ease of measurement may be inadvertently shapin g commanders objectives in unproductive ways as an illustration if commander can asily measure the number of weapon caches found he or she may decide that the number found is proxy for the objec tive of

assess since it often requir subjective assessment by either the provider or consumer of these services it often can not be done directly using strictly quantiiable assessments as an example the outcome that we d esire is not an increased or unlimited number of patrols as measure of safety and security in an area but rather outward demonstrations by the local population that indicate an incr

every echelon must have objectives and sup porting metrics that support those above it units may well suboptimize in the grander scheme wi thout such consistency ie their performance might be lawless from the perspective of t heir echelon but less efective or even harmful from others here is second type of consistency essential for metrics to be efe ctive consistency also means that metrics must share deinitions have common meani ng in the minds of those using them and be exploitable by higher headquarters metrics are t he method by which organiza tions develop common standard to assess their

iraq and afghanistan quantitative metrics allow for relatively uncomplicated com parisons however the infer ences from these comparisons can be misleading if the metrics ssess inputs alone moes or mops because decisionmakers often give more credence to quantitative metrics than to qualitative ones improperly selecting metrics can be more dama ging than similarly misidenti fying qualitative metrics qualitative metrics are not easily compared in their raw for m qualitative data often lack common trait that allows for meaningful scalar comparison simple and generally informa tive

the measures needed at their and higher echelons without overburdening those on the ground who collect the data ideally even the most complex compound metrics can rely on dat that are simple to collect as very simple example of this we can look at situation that on of the authors faced in 2005 sadr city considerable resources and efort had been expended to refurbish 15 sewerpump stations in sadr city to get the raw sewage of the streets it was v ery easy to collect quantita tive data on the hours the pump stations were operational the number of operational spare generators and amount of fuel available to run them if the dedic ated power went down and the number of resulting sewage backups within the pump stations vicinity23 however none of these quantitative measures alone provided any understan ding of the efects of these initia tives on local citizens or associated outcomes we could assu that individuals were better of with less sewage on the streets however there was deinit ive understanding of how the improved service afected their willingness to favor coaliti on forces and reject insurgent inlu ences in the service of improving security thereby serving the ultimate goal of establishing legitimate iraqi government acceptable to the people it was cl ear that qualitative assessment of local atmospherics combined with quantitative asses sment of the progress in ridding the streets of sewage was the metric desired data supporting this compound metric were rela tively easily collected forces needed to gauge the relative amo unt of sewage on the streets while determining the extent of public support for coalition and in digenous security forces thereby allowing them to determine correlation or lack thereof betwe coalition actions and local population

the exception rather than the rule leaders at every level must constantly reassess objectives and metrics of subor dinate units to ensure that all are aligned within the hierarchical organization it is the re sponsibility of senior command ers to ensure that subordinate commanders choice of actions to optimize outcomes at his or her level is not detrimental for the higher organization absent assessment and feedback from senior headquarters one can only expect subordinate commande rs to seek maximum progress toward their local objectives linking metrics to objectives does not mean that all

pile of garbage there and now there s little pile37 his anxi ety seems justiied at irst glance he data he and his unit were c ollecting seemed little more than measures of inputs simple counts of the number of indivi duals playing dominoes hours of electricity available and amount of trash however clo ser look relects that what appear to be input measures of little import areat least in some cases metrics relective of efects increasing numbers of individuals playing dominoes could rep resent an increased perception of security increased hours of power might represent an improvem ent in conditions necessary for economic development and decrease in the amount of trash n the street could suggest increased security quality of life and improved potential for economic development any of these measures might be one of several components of compound metri cs employed by higher echelons yet captain brooks is right to inquire whether the chose n measures in fact represent efects his unease demonstrates the importance of explaining the purpose of the data being collected to those performing the task in other instances quantitative measures are clearly more dubious as moes an

ly go in the wrong direc tion all metrics must have system to frequently adjust and determine whether they are useful and are measuring the right thing40 he undertone here is that units can become so consumed with col lecting the data needed to assess their progress that they are expending more energy on t hat collection than conducting operations that actually achieve the desired efects addition ally units can become so comfort able with assessment procedures that they lose sight of whether t he metrics continue to accu rately measure progress others with experience in afghanistan and iraq

were they dressed he quality of local government could be seen from th state of the streets and infrastructure43 one method of measuring efects rather than inputs that our int erviewees commonly cited is to use some form of polling to capture the perceptions of the local population he concern with polling however is that because of the oftendan gerous environment the poll ing organizations may not be able to ensure the rigor necessary to validate the randomness of respondent samples general vleugels observation regarding fghans propensity to provide the answers they think coalition soldiers want to hear valid ates the need to use local pollsters and even then to be cautious regarding use of results commande rs in the ield seem to be aware of these potential biases and use polls as references to gauge ch anges rather than absolute values colonel disalvo was one who concurred in this regard polls are good as reference but the degree of bias is usually profound44 wise to treat polling results as only one of several decision aids leaders should nevertheless not overlook ways to improve the quality of those results charles barlow the former head of the canadian forc afghanistan intelligence response team opined polling generally showed reasonably high level of popu lar support but we overlooked the fact that we are not working in democracywhatever we ma wish to call itand that the opinions of only few people actually matter polling should be done that identiies what tribal leaders and religious leaders believe such polling should ask them what they want in return for their support and conversely wha t would cause them to with draw that support surprisingly they will tell us when we bother to ask45 he common viewpoint of those raised in democracy is that polling l eads to an under standing of popular opinion and hence can help leaders best matc h available resources to the wants and needs of the people however though general vleugels recognized the desirability to accurately poll views of the population at large he also realize d that in country where the population is subservient to the desires of its leaders solic iting the needs of the individuals at the apex of social hierarchies is helpful despite not being opti mal another key to enhancing the value of polling results therefore is to ensure that the socialnode inluencers are solicited for their input in order to understand the impacts of potential po licy and resource changes on the attitudes of the inluencers and hence the remainder of the population 43 synnott 2008 p

two things happen at the same time one does not necessarily cause the other he classic example illustrating this princ iple is that you may eat carrots at dawn and two hours later see more clearly but

does not follow that it was caused by hts humanterrain syste m he odd thing is that in pilot program such as hts natural xperiment is easy to develop he question to ask is did that number of kinetic

however as i learned more bout my area i came to realize that the reduction of bodies on the streets was due t so much to my units military actions but to the simple fact that most of the minority

capable of sustaining support for an exten ded major counterinsurgency he question is disturbing one given that most 20thcentur insurgencies had durations that exceeded decade on more positive note

however longerterm perspective reveals t his such assets are crucial to the indigenous society recovering rapidly and successfully which makes sparing such resources or inding alternatives that are less damaging than total destruction more attractive it is essential to consider the second and higherorder effe cts of actions taken during urban operations those effects can be counterintuitive second and higherorder efects often have more immediate and wider impact in urban areas than i n other environments plan ners and commanders need to consider consequences of their cisions and actions

people would say well it didnt stop them bombing england thats true but i know it did on occasion make it much more diicult for them to get topq uality operatives to go to england because guys were saying hang on i have wife nd family here ive got three young children if i get caught and spend 25 years in jai l im not going to see my kids growing up whereas even here in northern ireland they kne
