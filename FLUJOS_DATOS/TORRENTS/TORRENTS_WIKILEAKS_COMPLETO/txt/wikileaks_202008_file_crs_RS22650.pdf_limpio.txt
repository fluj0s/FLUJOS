budget of the united states government fy2008 public budget database at httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudgetfy2008dbhtml 5 the budget uses cash accounting which reflec ts for example actual premium received during the fiscal year the annual report uses accrual accounting which reflects premium earned ie premium that was due during the fiscal year 6 generally the ratio of assets to liabilities ie the funding ratio for all plans taken over by the pbgc determines the trust fund reimbursement amount as follows the reimbursement amount equals the total benefit payments due in the year times the funding ratio the balance of the benefit payments are made directly from the revolving fund 7 the pbgc adopted new investment policy in 2004 aimed at improving the dollar duration match of invested assets to future benefit lia bilities to that end the pbgc lengthened the duration of its portfolio by exchanging signif icant portion of its treasury bond portfolio the voluminous sales and purchases resulted in sign ificant gains that were included in fy2006s 39 billion interest income on federal securities in fy2004 and fy2005 actual interest income on federal securities totaled 121 billion and

budget but are not directly related to the pbgc in addition to the pbgcrelated changes outlined in this report the ppa is expected to increase spending by 04 billion over 20072016 and decrease revenue by 705 billion over 20072016 description of these broader changes is beyond the scope of this report for more information on the ppa see crs report rl33703 summary of the pension protection act of

provided annually to the omb by the pbgc although some of the budget numbers pre miums benefits administrative expense can be traced to values in the pbgcs nnual report other valu reimbursements from the trust fund interest income on federal securities are more difficult to ascertain5 the level of reimburse ments from the trust fund to the revol ving fund is based on the ratio of assets to

10year period fro m 2007 to 2016 the ppa will decrease spending by 55 billion and increase revenue by 24 billi on some of the changes in the ppa take effect or are phased in beginning in 2008 so their impact on the budget is not immediatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22650crs4 9 the revolving fund balance serves as buffe r between the pbgcs budg etary cash flows and direct federal spending alt hough pbgc outlays are counted in the federal budget they flow through the revolving fund which had bala nce of 152 billion as of september 30 2006 in addition the revolving fund is partially reimbursed for benefit payments by the trust fund which had balance of 440 billion as of september 30 2006 even though net outlays are projected for fy2007 and fy2008 the balances in these funds enable the pbgc to

the ppa on the pbgcs budgetary cash flows is confined to the spending side of the federa l budget while the pbgc is said to generate revenue its revenue is accounted for within the revol ving fund

to the pbgc the premium is 1250 per pa rticipant per year payable for three years this provision was enacted under the ficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 and contained december 31 2 010 sunset date which the ppa removes12 cbo estimates that collections from termination premiums will increase pbgcs premium revenue by 23 milli on in 2011 and by 411 million over 2007201613 special funding relief for commercial airlines prior to the enactment of the ppa airlines were required to follow the same rules as other plan sponsors with the exception that they were provided temporar relief from deficit reduction contribution requirements in 2004 and 200514 the ppa allows airlines to choose special funding rules for airlines that will significantly reduce or possibly eliminate their required contributions over the next 17 years airlin that choose the special funding rules must freeze benefit accruals in their plans and w ill incur higher termin ation premiums 2500 instead of 1250 if they subse quently terminate plans within five years of choosing the special funding rules although cbo assume s that airlines that choose the special funding rules will incur the higher term ination premium charges they do expect underfunding for these airlines to increas which would result in increased vrp payments to the pbgc cbo estimates that these provisions will increase vrps by 115 million over 20072011 and by 399 million over 20072016 net benefit payments the ppa contains several changes that affect plan funding liability calculations and how much pl an sponsors will contribute to their plans the cbo expects that these changes will increase plan underfunding among plans that terminate in the next 10 years which equates to higher outlays by the pbgc cbo estimates that benefit pa yments will increase by 53 million over 20072011 and by 274 million over 2007201615 other provisions the ppa contains other provisions that are expected to increase spending these provisions include authorization for the pbgc to pay interest to plans for premium overpayments speci funding rules for certain government contractors and cap on vrps for small plans those with 25 or fewer employees

20072011 and by 48 million over 2007201616 the impact of the ppa on federal revenue unlike the ppas impact on the pbgcs budgetary cash flows and consequen tly on federal spending its impact on federal revenue is indirect the ppa affects corporate profits by raising or lowering the contributions that plan sponsors must make to their defined benefit pension plans in turn the impact on corporate profits is reflected in revenues collected by the government in the form of corporate taxes the ppa imposes more stringent funding requirements on many plans but the impact on the budget is not immediate due to phasedin or dela yed effective dates therefore the expectation is that the ppa will decrease revenue in the near term and increase revenue in the longterm the joint committee on taxation jct estimates that the ppa will increase revenue by 48 b illion over 20072011 and re duce revenue by 24 billion over 2007201617 the impact of the presidents federal budget proposal on the budget projections the presidents budget for fy2008 projects net outlays ie outlays exceed receipts for the pbgc of 316 million and 11 billion for fy2007 and fy2008 respectively in fy2006 the pbgc net genera ted revenue of 26 billion since 1975 the pbgcs operations have generate d net outlays in only two years if the current budget projections prove true that to tal will increase to four years in 2008 the presidents budget proposes provisions that would increase premium revenue for the pbgc beginning in 2009 curre ntly underfunded plans pay 9 per 1000 of underfunding to the pbgc in variable rate pr emiums vrps the current vrp rate was set by the deficit reduction act of 2005 congressional action would be required to change it the fy 2008 federal budget indicates that the administration w ill propose to authorize pbgcs board of directors to set the variable premium rate and extend the variable rate premium to plans nonve sted as well as its vested liabilities18 this change is projected to decrease spending by 55 billion over 20082012 and by 106 billion over 2008201719
