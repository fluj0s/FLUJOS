so hes being honest in one respect i still think hes reading far too much into ncep1 the bottom panel of their fig1 shows both cru and ghcn era40 having difference over the period from the late 1960s if the obs assimilated before 1967 even in the us were improved the apparent drop before might disappear cheers phil date fri 19 nov 2004 183558 0700 mst from roger pielke pielkeatmoscolostateedu to

have circulated the attached to our ccsp committee with the permission of eugenia and ming and want to also share with you the conclusion from my own work with the ncep reanalysis is that it is appropriate for trend assessments if integrated metrics are used thickness for example and for regions where the regional trend signal is quite large we have published on both of this issues one valueadded of reanalyses is that since the winds are monitored independently of the temperatures they provide information on the horizontal layer averaged temperatures in the mid and highlatitudes which helps adjust to some extent biases in the temperatures also as we have shown with regional data eg florida and others have shown elsewhere eg andy pitman for australia there is clear land use change signal on surface temperature this provides independent evidence that the kalnay and cai results should be expected roger roger pielke sr professor and state climatologist 1371 campus delivery

this debate of course should really take place in the literature there has been however in my view an unfortunate change over time where reviewers who disagree with already published work recommend rejection of subsequent work rather than letting the community view and assess the different perspectives on science issue our report has to make sure it is inclusive in order to avoid this pitfall an unbiased discussion of the kc results and ways to resolve the disagreement through hypothesis testing should be included in the appropriate chapters roger roger pielke sr professor and state

lim yklimmetfsuedu eugenia kalnay ekalnayatmosumdedu subject re kc dear roger attached is the preliminary summary report on our recent work on the estimate of landusechange climate impact using the reanalysis very fortunately we had secured oneyear funding from nsf starting last august despite short time period we have already produced sufficient results to confirm the robustness of our original work using different datasets that have the stateofart quality here i just want to add one more comment about simmons et paper basically they claimed that the difference between the era40 and cru is very small and therefore our method is not applicable if the reanalysis is as good as the era40 there are two things that are incorrect in their claims first of all if the reanalysis were made to be exactly the same as the observations by definition there would be difference between reanalysis and the surface observations since the era40 was obtained by directly assimilating the cru surface observations whereas the nnr didnt use any surface temp observation it is natural to expect that the difference between the surface observation and era40 is small second simmons et manually reduces the difference between the era40 and cru by setting the mean difference between the era40 and cru from 1987 to 2001 be zero as result the difference looks very small in recent years however the difference from 1961 to 1985 has to be larger otherwise they would make an error in their plot in other words by doing so the gap between the era40 and cru appears decreasing in time rather increasing in time as shown in kc and in the new figure 1 in the attached file which is the same as simmons et paper except we reset the 196070 to be zero in order to see how the positive gap increases in time if we closely examine their figures we will see by applying their treatment the gap between cru and reanalysis is negative one eg cru is below era40 from 1960 to 1980 and such negative gap decrease in time is equivalent to that the positive gap increases in time as found in kc from the nnr data eg the cru becomes more above the era40 so simmons et als results actually confirm our findings rather discredit our finding we actually reproduced simmons et calculations and confirm that their results are correct see the second attached figure which is identical to fig1 in our preliminary report except the negative gap is used and 1year running mean was applied as in simmons et but their interpretations are incorrect i appreciate if you could also forward the email to the ccsp authors let know if you want to to reply to tom and ccsp coauthors directly regards ming the report the replica of one of the key figures in simmons et on nov 18 2004 at 453 pm roger pielke wrote tom since we have not seen the paper we cannot make any judgements on the robustness of that paper in showing that the kalnay and cai work is flawed i expect to have summary by eugenia and ming tomorrow however which will address the published concerns on their work and will forward to the committee please forward us copy of the simmons et paper i also would like response to my mwr florida paper where we specifically show the dominant role of documented land use change in peninsular florida in the 20th century on julyaugust surface air temperature change or andy pitmans work who shows major effect on temperature trends in southwestern australia due to land use change this work and others like it support the conclusions of kalnay and cai on major role of land surface processes on surface temperature trends how do you reconcile those independent conclusions with the paper you list above roger roger pielke sr professor and state climatologist 1371 campus delivery department atmospheric
