international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division trade negotiations during the 110th congress summary the bush administration has made bilateral and regional freetrade agreements ftas an important element of us trade policy strategy known as competitive liberalization this strategy it argues will push forward trade liberalization simultaneously on bilateral regional and multilateral fronts it is meant to spur trade negotiations by liberalizing trade with countries willing to join ftas and to pressure other countries to negotiate multilaterally critics contend however that the accent on regional and bilateral negotiations undermines the multilateral forum and increases the risk of trade diversion away from competitive countries not in the trade bloc on may

have negotiated multilateral trade agreements to achieve lower trade barriers and rules to cover international trade during the 108th congress us officials negotiated and congress approved four bilateral freetrade agreements with australia chile morocco and singapore1 in the 1 the united states also is party to four previous negotiated agreements the usisrael free trade agreement effective 1985 the canadaus free trade agreement effective 1989 the north american free trade agreement effective 1994 and the usjordan continued crs2 109th congress agreements were concluded and congress approved the central americandominican republic fta and bilateral agreements with bahrain and oman the bush administration is making bilateral and regional freetrade agreements more important elements of its trade policy the multilateral arena is longer the only means or perhaps even the principal means by which the united states is pursuing liberalized trade2 trade agreements are negotiated by the executive branch although congress has the ultimate constitutional authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce trade promotion authority tpa requires that the president consult with and advise congress throughout the negotiating process after the executive branch signs an agreement congress may consider implementing legislation if any statutory changes are required under the agreement there is deadline for submission of the legislation but once bill is submitted tpa requires final vote within 90 legislative days us negotiating strategy us negotiating strategy is based on concept known as competitive liberalization as explained by the administration this strategy is designed to push forward trade liberalization on multiple fronts bilateral regional and multilateral it is meant to further trade negotiations by liberalizing trade with countries willing to join free trade agreements and to put pressure on other countries to negotiate in the wto according to former united states trade representative ustr robert b zoellick we want to strengthen the hand of the coalition pressing for freer trade it would be fatal to give the initiative to naysayers abroad and protectionists at home as we have seen in the league of nations the the imf and the world bank international organizations need leaders to prod them into action3 critics assert that the emphasis on regional and bilateral negotiations undermines the world trade organization wto and increases the risk of trade diversion trade diversion occurs when the existence of lower tariffs under trade agreement cause trade to be diverted away from more efficient producer outside the trading bloc to producer inside the bloc what also results from the plethora of negotiated ftas according to one economist is spaghetti bowl of rules arbitrary definitions of which products come from where and multiplicity of tariffs 1 continued free trade agreement effective 2001 2 for further information see

crs3 depending on source4 more recently new ustr susan schwab described the negotiation of bilateral and regional ftas as way to establish the breadth and scope of potential multilateral agreements in years to come by setting precedents and by demonstrating the real benefits of free and fair trade5 the manner in which the administration chooses potential fta partners has been the subject of scrutiny by some members of congress traditionally regional and bilateral trade agreements have been negotiated for mixture of economic political and development reasons the uscanada freetrade agreement fta was primarily economic in nature recognizing the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world between two countries at similar stage of development the partnership with mexico to create nafta brought in country at different stage of development and gave attention to trade as lever to encourage economic advancement it also had geopolitical rationale of encouraging stability in the us neighbor to the south the fta with israel was seen by supporters as an affirmation of us support for the jewish state while the fta with jordan could be seen as reward for jordans cooperation in the middle east peace process in may 2003 thenustr zoellick enumerated several factors used to evaluate countries seeking to negotiate trade agreements with the united states but he said there were formal rules or procedures to make the determination6 gao study released in january 2004 reported that an interagency process had been established to assess fta partners using six factors these factors include countrys readiness in terms of trade capabilities the maturity of its political and legal system and the will to implement reforms the economic benefit to the united states the countrys support of us trade liberalization goals partners compatibility with us foreign and economic policy interests congressional or private sector support and us government resource constraints7 the ability of the united states to attract future fta negotiating partners may now depend on the reauthorization of trade promotion authority which lapsed on july 1 2007 4 jagdish bhagwati and arvind panagariya bilateral trade treaties are sham financial times july 14 2003 5 opening statement of deputy us trade representative susan c schwab us trade representativedesignate senate finance committee may 16 2006 6 these considerations included cooperation with the united states in its foreign and security policies country support for us positions in the freetrade area of the americas ftaa and the wto the ability of trade agreement to spur internal economic or political reform in the target country or region the ability to counteract ftas among other countries or trading blocs that disadvantage american firms the presence of congressional interest or opposition to an fta support among us business and agricultural interests the ability of country to anchor broader trade agreements to spur regional integration the willingness of partner to negotiate comprehensive agreement covering all economic sectors and the capacity constraints of the office of the ustr following the bilateral route

agenda calls for better allocation of staff and resources january 2004 pp 910 12 crs4 some members of congress have questioned the manner in which potential fta partners are chosen senator baucus now chairman of the senate finance committee criticized the administration for overlooking high volume trading partners in asia and was quoted saying that this administrations trade policy is dictated largely by its foreign policy not by economics8 in addition some business groups have expressed desire to concentrate more on the multilateral negotiations of the wto which potentially could yield greater commercial gains9 the administration cites the negotiation of free trade agreements in multilateral regional and bilateral settings as an integral part of its strategy to enhance prosperity and freedom for the rest of the world in its september 2002 national security strategy the administration seemed to equate the concept of free trade with basic freedom or moral principle the freedom for person or nation to make living according to this document freemarket economic and trade policies more than development assistance provides nations with the ability to lift themselves out of poverty and to ensure stability10 although the administration is pursuing trade agreements on multiple fronts some critics question whether the united states should be negotiating trade agreements at all they contend that american jobs are lost because of cheaper imports and that relocation of us production to other countries has been facilitated by trade agreements some argue that trade agreements do not adequately address the problem of countries with lower labor and environmental standards that are able to produce at lower cost some critics believe that the us economy will be harmed by the administrations pursuit of freetrade agreements with party control switching in the 110th congress democratic leaders have sought to make changes in us trade negotiating strategy on march 27 2007 house ways and means committee chairman rangel and trade subcommittee chairman levin unveiled set of democratic trade principles including some that likely will require if implemented the modification of the currently notified ftas with colombia panama peru and south korea after several weeks of negotiations congressional leaders and the bush administration announced conceptual

the conceptual template11 provides for enforcement of international labor standards in an fta partners domestic laws and regulations adherence of fta partners to certain multilateral environmental agreements an assurance that trade agreements accord greater substantive rights to foreign investors in the united states than us investors in the united states clarification that each agreements essential security provision is not subject to challenge insurance that government procurement policies promote basic workers rights and the incorporation of certain flexibilities concerning test data and the approval of pharmaceutical products in developing countries the result of the competitive liberalization strategy is that the united states has been involved in an unprecedented number of trade negotiations during this administration the united states has concluded agreements with peru colombia panama and south korea legislation to implement these agreement likely will be considered by the 110th congress under the timetable set forth by trade promotion authority see table 1 during the 109th congress the united states ratified ftas with bahrain oman and combined fta with the
