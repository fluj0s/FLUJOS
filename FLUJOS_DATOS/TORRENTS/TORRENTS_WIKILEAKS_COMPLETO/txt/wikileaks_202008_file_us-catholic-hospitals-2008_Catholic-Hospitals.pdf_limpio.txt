us catholic hospitals betray mission sterilization and abortion offered in texas in study of hospital discharge data for the state of texas researche rs found that catholic hospitals reported at least 96 84 cases of sterilizations and 39 legally indu ced abortions from 2000 2003 while sterilizations and abortions are legal in the us they are considered immoral by the catholic church since they harm the body and violate human dignity the identified hospitals and their respective healthcare systems are operated by religious orders of the catholic church who according to the churchs canon law are dedicated to the service of god and the whole ch urch and subject to the authority of the church 1 in their activities t hey must faithfully observe the mission of their founders can 578 and cooperate with the local bishop in the united states they are expected by the local bishops to operate according to the ethical and religious directives for catholic healthcare 2001 the study shows that all six us catholic hospital systems operating in texas not only d efy these directives they betray the purpose and spirit of their founders more important ly they betray the trust of catholic s and the secular public especially the poor who depend upon them for humane and ethical care because these six systems are nationwide what has been happening in texas could be occurring throughout the country also to be considered are the practices of other catholic health systems throughout the country the researchers collected and analyzed the texas data to inform the p ublic of the practices of catholic healthcare systems and to foster public accountability for the religious sisters who run these systems in the name of christ and the church the data from the study is made available on this website to all who wish to fu rther investigate the situation it includes records from catholic hospitals in texas that present either explicit violations of catholic directives or might represent violations the concern of the study has been to examine solid documentary evidence of violations and to avoid confidential information morally ambiguous proc edures or personal cases the data is abstracted from the hospital inpatient discharge data reported to the texas health care infor mation collection center for health statistics the texas legislature requires the center to collect healthcare charges utilization data including diagnosis and procedures and outcome data for all patients for the purposes of promoting cost effective quality health care all texas hospitals except for very small or rural ones must submit quarterly data on all inpatient discharges hospitals assign unique patient and physician identifiers so that records may be submitted without violating patient and physician confidentiality the data is compiled quarterly into public use data files that may be purchased for research or analytical purposes the cost at 4600 per year is out of reach of most individuals and is the reason this study only covers 2000 to 2003 an excel file tchxls texas catholic hospitals containing abstracted patient records may be downloaded and examined by those who wish to do further investigation the researchers organized the data and simplified its presentation to make it more accessible to those individuals not familiar with hospital discharge data they added m acros to enable the data to be viewed in various ways the opening tab of the file explains how to use the macros there are also links to the hospital systems religious orders who own the hospitals and dioceses in which the hospitals or religious orders are located the researchers are available to assist interested parties in texas and other states to collect and analyze similar data an independent review of tchxls with one page data summary and an assessment of its implications for the practice of catholic healthcare in the united states and for the necessary adaptation of the ethical and religious directives for catholic healthcare have also been poste d the review has been widely distributed to church leaders and the media the review d ata summary review narrative and distribution memo may be

directory and the websites of the identified health care systems and respective religious orders responsible for th eir operation only one acute care catholic hospital located in brenham is not
