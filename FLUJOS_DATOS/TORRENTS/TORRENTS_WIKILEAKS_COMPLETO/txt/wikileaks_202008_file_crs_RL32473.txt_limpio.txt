american national government government and finance division omnibus appropriations acts overview of recent practices summary omnibus appropriations acts have become significant feature of the legislative process in recent years as congress and the president have used them more frequently to bring action on the regular appropriations cycle to close following discussion of pertinent background information this report reviews the recent enactment of such measures and briefly addresses several issues raised by their use for nearly two centuries regular appropriations acts were considered by the house and senate as individual measures and enacted into law as freestanding laws in 1950 the house and senate undertook onetime experiment in improving legislative efficiency by considering all of the regular appropriations acts for fy1951 in single bill the omnibus appropriations act of 1950 the following year the house and senate returned to the practice of considering the regular appropriations acts individually during the period covering fy1986fy2008 total of 294 regular appropriations acts were considered all but one of these acts were enacted into law either individually or as part of an omnibus measure of the 293 measures enacted into law 184 63 were enacted as freestanding measures and 109 37 were enacted in omnibus legislation on average eight 80 regular appropriations acts were enacted into law as freestanding measures and nearly five 47 were enacted into law in omnibus legislation each year during this period 14 different omnibus measures were enacted into law for 13 different fiscal years two separate omnibus appropriations acts were enacted for fy2001 each of the measures funded between two and 13 regular appropriations acts on average funding about eight 78 of them nine of the omnibus measures were bills or joint resolutions carrying the designation consolidated appropriations or omnibus consolidated appropriations in the title four were continuing appropriations acts and one was the vahud appropriations act for fy2001 which also included the energy and water development appropriations act for fy2001 in addition to the customary concern of sacrificing the opportunity for debate and amendment for greater legislative efficiency that arises whenever complex legislation is considered under time constraints the use of omnibus appropriations acts has generated controversy for other reasons these include whether adequate consideration was given to regular appropriations acts prior to their incorporation into omnibus

overview of recent practices omnibus appropriations acts have become significant feature of the legislative process in recent years as congress and the president have resorted more frequently to their use to bring action on the regular appropriations cycle to close following discussion of pertinent background information this report reviews the recent use of such measures and briefly addresses several issues that their use raises background each year congress and the president enact discretionary spending1 in the form of regular appropriations acts as well as continuing and supplemental appropriations acts2 the number of regular appropriations acts had been fixed at 13 for several decades3 but realignment of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees at the beginning of the 109th congress reduced the number of regular appropriations acts considered each year to 114 the number of regular appropriations acts was increased to 12 at the beginning of the 110th congress due to further subcommittee realignment if action is not completed on all of the regular appropriations acts toward the end of congressional session congress sometimes will combine the unfinished appropriations acts into an omnibus measure an omnibus act may set forth the full text of each of the regular appropriations acts included therein or it may enact them individually by crossreference the house and senate consider annual appropriations acts and other budgetary legislation within constraints established in yearly budget resolution required by 1 discretionary spending which accounts for roughly onethird of total federal spending is spending that is under the control of the house and senate appropriations committees for the most part discretionary spending funds the routine operations of the federal government it is distinguished from direct spending which is controlled by the legislative committees in substantive law and funds such mandatory programs as social security and medicare discretionary spending and direct spending together make up total federal spending 2 for background on the appropriations process see crs report 97684 the congressional appropriations process an introduction by sandy streeter 3 for information on changes in the number of regular appropriations acts over the years see crs report rl31572 appropriations subcommittee structure history of changes from 19202007 by james v saturno 4 the senate appropriations committee reported twelfth regular appropriations act for the district of columbia but in final legislative action it was incorporated into another bill crs2 the congressional budget act of 1974 as amended budget resolution policies are enforced by points of order that may be raised during house and senate consideration of spending revenue and debtlimit legislation5 on occasion budget policies may be modified by agreements reached between congressional leaders and the president such modifications may be accommodated during legislative action through the use of waivers of points of order emergency spending designations and other budgetary or procedural devices during the period covering fy1991fy2002 legislative action on annual appropriations acts also was subject to limits on discretionary spending established by the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 as amended under this statutory mechanism separate discretionary spending limits were applied to two different measurements of spending budget authority and outlays the discretionary spending limits were enforced by the sequestration process which involved automatic largely acrosstheboard reductions in discretionary spending in order to eliminate any breach of the limits6 for nearly two centuries regular appropriations acts were considered by the house and senate as individual measures and enacted into law by the president as freestanding laws in 1950 the house and senate undertook onetime experiment in improving legislative efficiency by considering all of the regular appropriations acts for fy1951 in single bill the omnibus appropriations act of 1950 81st congress pl 759 september 6 19507 the following year the house and senate returned to the practice of considering the regular appropriations acts individually beginning in the late 1970s continuing appropriations acts sometimes have taken the form of omnibus legislation generally incorporating the full text of multiple regular appropriations acts for fullyear funding instead of providing short term funding by formula8 in recent years the house and senate on several occasions have combined multiple regular appropriations acts into consolidated appropriations measures sometimes enacting individual bills by crossreference omnibus appropriations acts fy1986fy2008 during the 23year period covering fy1986fy2008 14 different omnibus measures were enacted into law for 13 different fiscal years two separate omnibus appropriations acts were enacted for fy2001 each

public law 1105 the revised continuing appropriations resolution for fy2007 did not include the text of the regular appropriations acts that it covered however in addition to its formulaic funding provisions it included many adjustments in appropriated levels and other provisions amounting to over 50 pages crs4 in length as slip law so it is regarded as an omnibus appropriations act for purposes of this report public law 106553 was enacted as an omnibus measure enacting the commercejusticestatejudiciary appropriations act for fy2001 and the district of columbia appropriations act for fy2001 by crossreference however the provision dealing with district of columbia appropriations was repealed therefore pl 106553 is not counted in this report as an omnibus measure during this period total of 294 regular appropriations acts were considered all but one of these acts were enacted into law either individually or as part of an omnibus measure9 of the 293 measures enacted into law 184 63 were enacted as freestanding measures and 109 37 were enacted in omnibus legislation on average eight 80 regular appropriations acts were enacted into law as freestanding measures and nearly five 47 were enacted into law in omnibus legislation each year sixtyone 208 of the 293 regular appropriations acts were enacted into law on or before october 1 the start of the fiscal year six of these measures were included in an omnibus measure for fy1997 and the rest were enacted as freestanding measures on average during this period about less than three 27 regular appropriations acts were enacted annually before the start of the fiscal year seven of the nine omnibus appropriations acts bearing the designation consolidated or omnibus consolidated in their title originated in the house as regular appropriations act and were expanded in coverage and their titles redesignated at the stage of resolving housesenate differences these included the appropriations acts for defense hr 3610 in fy1997 transportation hr 4238 in fy1999 district of columbia hr 3194 in fy2000 laborhhseducation hr 4577 in fy2001 agriculture hr 2673 in fy2004 foreign operations hr 4818 in fy2005 and stateforeign operations hr 2764 in fy2008 in the case of the first six acts listed above the transformation from regular appropriations act into consolidated appropriations act occurred as part of the conference proceedings between the house and senate in the case of the final act listed for fy2008 conference procedures were not used and the transformation 9 the foreign operations appropriations act for fy1992 was not enacted into law funding for activities covered by this act was provided in series of continuing resolutions culminating with the enactment of pl 102266 on april 1 1992 crs5 occurred in connection with an exchange of amendments between the two chambers10 the acts for fy2000 and fy2001 enacted regular appropriations measures by crossreference instead of including their full text except for fy2000 appropriations for the district of columbia11 in fy2003 the omnibus measure originated in the house as simple continuing resolution hjres 2 but was expanded in coverage and redesignated during senate floor action the remaining measure for fy1996 hr 3019 originated as an omnibus measure and retained this status throughout its consideration selected issues in the use of omnibus appropriations acts several issues pertaining to the use of omnibus appropriations have been the focus of debate in recent years including the extent to which the regular appropriations acts have received consideration prior to being incorporated into omnibus legislation the use of acrosstheboard spending cuts and the inclusion of legislative provisions prior consideration of regular appropriations acts one of the chief concerns regarding the use of omnibus appropriations acts is that it reduces the opportunities members have to debate and amend the regular appropriations acts that are incorporated therein this concern may be lessened if the regular appropriations acts eventually incorporated into omnibus legislation are first considered individually during the fy1986fy2008 period the senate was more likely than the house not to have given prior consideration to regular appropriations acts the house did not initially consider or considered but did not pass 18 of the 109 regular appropriations acts subsequently included in omnibus legislation these most often included regular appropriations acts for foreign operations and laborhhs education four times each and agriculture and defense two times each during the same period the senate did not initially consider or considered but did not pass 52 of the 109 regular appropriations acts subsequently included in omnibus legislation eight of the 52 measures were considered on the floor while 10 for discussion of legislative action on the fy2008 measure see crs report rl34298 consolidated appropriations act for

appropriations acts most often included in omnibus legislation without either initial consideration or passage in the senate were interior seven times and commercejustice and laborhhseducation six times each acrosstheboard spending cuts in order to adhere to restraints imposed by congressional budget resolutions the discretionary spending limits and ad hoc budget agreements between congressional leaders and the president or to meet other purposes congress and the president from time to time incorporate acrosstheboard cuts in discretionary budget authority into annual appropriations acts12 during the six fiscal years covering fy2000fy2005 five governmentwide acrosstheboard spending cuts were included in omnibus appropriations acts in addition an across theboard cut was included in the defense appropriations act for fy2006 year in which all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted separately13 the governmentwide acrosstheboard spending cuts included in omnibus appropriations acts ranged in size from 022 to 080 of covered appropriations and an estimated 11 billion to 35 billion in savings the 038 cut for fy2000 in pl 106113 saved an estimated 24 billion in budget authority the 022 cut for fy2001 in pl 106554 saved an estimated 11 billion in budget authority the 065 cut for fy2003 in pl 1087 saved an estimated 26 billion in budget authority the 059 cut for fy2004 in pl 108199 saved an estimated 28 billion in budget authority and the 080 cut for fy2005 in pl 108447 saved an estimated 35 billion in budget authority the 059 acrosstheboard cut in nondefense programs for fy2004 in pl 108199 was accompanied by requirement that defense appropriations which were exempt from the 059 cut be reduced by fixed amount 18 billion this requirement was repealed by section 9003c of the defense appropriations act for fy2005 which president bush signed into law on august 5 2004 as pl 108287 118 stat 951 et seq 12 this topic is discussed in more detail in crs report rl32153 acrosstheboard spending cuts in omnibus appropriations acts by robert keith 13 the act which became pl 109148 on december 30 2005 included in division b section 3801a governmentwide spending cut of 1 118 stat 27912792 emergency requirements and spending for the veterans administration were exempted from the cut which was expected to reduce total budget authority by about 85 billion for additional information see omb bulletin 0602 guidance on implementing the governmentwide acrosstheboard reduction in the department of defense appropriations act fy 2006 hr 2863 january 5 2006 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovombbulletinsfy2006b0602pdf crs7 omnibus appropriations acts sometimes include other acrosstheboard spending cuts that apply to individual appropriations acts as set forth in separate divisions of the omnibus legislation pl 108199 for example included two other requirements for much smaller uniform spending cuts in nondefense programs 1 0465 cut in funding in the commercejusticestate appropriations division estimated to yield 1887 million in savings and 2 cut of 50 million in administrative expenses for the departments of labor health and human services and education further pl 108447 included three other provisions requiring acrosstheboard spending cuts focused on particular divisions of the act 1 054 cut in the commercejusticestate appropriations division estimated to save 229 million 2 0594 cut in the interior appropriations division estimated to save 120 million and 3 cut of 18 million in the laborhhseducation appropriations division applicable to administrative and related expenses for departmental management except for the food and drug administration and the indian health service the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 also employed acrossthe board spending cuts but they were not government wide instead they applied to six of the divisions of the act ranging in size from 025 legislative branch to 1747 laborhhseducation the office of management and budget estimated total savings from the cuts excluding cuts affecting the legislative branch at 3357 billion in discretionary budget authority the significance of the spending cuts differed with regard to budget enforcement the fy2000 cut was an integral component of the plan that successfully avoided sequester at the end of the session the fy2001 cut contributed to overall discretionary spending being below the statutory limits but the acrosstheboard cut proved to be unnecessary in avoiding sequester with regard to the fy2003 cut the house and senate did not reach agreement on budget resolution and the statutory discretionary limits had expired the fiscal year before nonetheless the acrosstheboard cut was necessary in adhering to an informal limit reached between congressional leaders and president bush and avoiding veto of the omnibus appropriations act similarly the fy2004 fy2005 and fy2008 cuts were necessary to keep the costs of the measures under overall limits acceptable to the president although the acrosstheboard spending cuts were viewed as essential elements in meeting budget enforcement goals some members criticized them as involving formulaic approach that undermined the process of making deliberate informed choices regarding appropriate funding levels inclusion of legislative provisions although house and senate rules and practices over the decades have promoted the separate consideration of legislation and appropriations the separation has not been ironclad in many instances during the routine operation of the annual appropriations process minor provisions are included in appropriations acts that technically may be regarded under the rules as legislative in nature but do not significantly undermine the dichotomy between legislation and appropriations at other times however the legislative provisions included in annual appropriations acts especially omnibus crs8 appropriations acts have been much more substantial and have represented deliberate suspension of the usual procedural boundaries14 in addition to the regular appropriations for fy2003 for example the consolidated appropriations resolution for fy2003 pl 1087 included the agricultural assistance act of 2003 amendments to the priceanderson act and the homeland security act and provisions dealing with the uschina economic and security review commission among other legislative matters the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 pl 110161 included such items as the emergency steel loan guarantee act of 1999 amendments the harmful algal bloom and hypoxia research and control act of 1998 amendments the ed 10 act and the kids in disasters wellbeing safety and health act of 2007 while the inclusion of significant legislative matters may represent an efficient way to conclude legislative business as congressional session comes to an end it also may raise concerns about the adequate opportunity for members to debate and amend them 14 recent practices in this regard are addressed in crs report rl30619 examples of legislative provisions in omnibus appropriations acts by robert
