state fidel castro who turned 78 on august 13 2004 has ruled si nce the 1959 cuban revolution which ousted the corrupt government of fulgencio batista from power castro soon laid the foundations for an authoritarian regime by consolidating power and forcing moderates out of the government in april 1961 castro admitted that the cuban revolution was socialist and in decem ber 1961 he proclaimed himself to be marxistleninist from 1959 until 1976 castro ruled by decree constitution was enacted in 1976 setting forth the communist party as the leading force in the state and in society with power centered in politburo headed by fidel castro the constitution also outlined national provincial and local governmental structures executive power is vested in council of ministers headed by fidel castro as president legislative authority is vested in national assembly of peoples power currently with 609 members that meets twice annually for brief periods while assembly members were directly

considerable disagreement over when or how this may occur some point to castros age and predict that the regime will collapse when castro is not at the helm other observers maintain that fidel castro may remain in power for years and that cuba has plan for the succession of his brothe r raul they point to cubas strong security apparatus and the extraordinary syst em of controls that prevents dissidents from gaining popular support moreover obser vers maintain that cubas elite has interest in castros overt hrow and that castro still joys some support in parthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31740crs6 because of the social benefits of the c uban revolution but also because cubans see alternative to castro even if castro is overthrown or resigns the important

despicable act of political repression in the americas in decade and called on the international community in c ondemning this repression and in dema nding the release of these cuban prisoners of conscience6 rationale for the 2003 crackdown analysts see variety of potential reasons for cubas severe crackdown on democracy activists the cuban government asserts that the crackdown was justified b ecause the defendants were supported by the us government and that us diplomats in cuba most notably the head of the us interests section in havana james cason often met with the dissidents some analysts believe that the crackdown was clear message by the cuban government that it will not tolerate the us governments active and open support for the opposition movement other analysts emphasize that the crackdown was an effort by castro to strengthen the regimes political control in light of faltering economy and dim ec onomic prospects ahead ccording to this view an increasingly assertive opposition movement c ould become national security threat to the castro regime in the tough economic times ahead along these lines some analysts see the crackdown as way for the regime to clear away any potential opposition in order to ensure that the even tual succession of raul castro to power will be smooth some observers maintain that the cuban governments willingness to jeopardize the possibility of easing us trade and travel restrictions as an indication that it currently views the dissident movement as serious security threat others however believe that the cuban government judged that there would not be any movement to ease the embargo under the bush administra tion and felt that it had little to lose in cracking down on the opposition movement finally view often heard when castro takes harsh action that jeopardizes an improvement in relati ons with the united states is that castro actually is opposed to any further opening to the united states because it could threaten his regimes control according to this view the crackdown against the opposition puts the skids on any potential easing of us policy varela project human rights initiative within cuba that has received attention since 2002 is the vare project named for the 19th century priest felix varela who advocated independence from spain and the abolition of slavery in which thousands of signatures

help br ing democracy and respect for human rights to the island there have been several sc hools of thought about how to achieve that objective some advocate policy of keeping maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while continuing current us efforts to support the cuban people others argue for an approach sometimes referred to as constructive engagement that would lift some us sanctions that they believe are hurting the cuban people and move toward engaging cuba in dialogue still others call for swift normalization of uscuban relations by lifting the us embargo in general those advocating loosenin g of the sanctionsbased policy toward cuba make several policy arguments they assert that if the united states moderated its policy toward cuba through increased travel trade and diplomatic dialogue that the seeds of reform would be planted in cuba which would stimulate and strengthen forces for peaceful change on th island they stress the importance to the united states of avoiding violent change in cuba with the prospect of mass exodus to the united states and the potential of involving the united states in civil war scenario they argue that since castros demise does not appear imminent the united states should espouse more realistic approach in trying to induce change in cuba supporters of changing policy also point to broad international support for lifting the us embargo to the missed oppor tunities to us businesses because of the embargo and to the increased suffering of the cuban people because of the embargo proponents of change also ar gue that the united states should be consistent in its policies with the worlds few remaining communist governments and also maintain that moderating policy will help advance human rights on the other side opponents of changing us policy maintain that the current twotrack policy of isolating cuba but reaching out to the cuban people through measures of support is the best means fo r realizing political change in cuba they point out that the cuban liberty and demo cratic solidarity act of 1996 sets forth road map for the steps cuba needs to take in order for the united states to normalize relations including lifting the embargo they argue that softening us policy at this time without concrete cuban reforms would boost the castro regime politically and economically enabling the survival of the communist regime opponents of softening us policy argue that the unite d states should stay the course in its commitment to democracy and human rights in cuba that sustained sanctions can work and that the sanctions against cuba have only come to full impact with the loss of large subsidies from the former sovi et bloc opponents of loosening us sanctions further argue that cubas faile d economic policies not the us embargo are the causes of the economys rapid decline httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31740crs20 helmsburton legislation major provisions and implementation the

foreign companies advocates of this approach argue that it would affirm that the united states will not give effect to claim or right to us property if that claimed is based on foreign compensation26

million has been spent by the united states for tv marti while the cuban government only needs to spend few thousand dollars to jam the broa dcasts effectively they argue that tv marti is waste of taxpayers money becau it does not contribute to the promotion of freedom and democracy in cuba unlike radio marti which some cubans listen to as source of information opponents so argue that the conversion of tv marti from vhf to uhf transmission has not succeeded in overcoming cubas jamming efforts in contrast supporters of continued tv marti funding point to congressionally mandated advisory panel in 1994 which stated that the cuban people have an ardent desire and genuine need to receive the programming produced by tv marti64 supporters argue that eliminating tv marti would send message to the cuban people that the united states is not committed to the cause of freedom in cuba they believe that eliminating tv marti would be giving in to the dictatorial castro government which s uppresses the free flow of in formation in cuba these proponents contend that it is impossible for the cuban government to completely jam tv marti and maintain that significant numbers of cubans ve attempted to tune in to the programming still others point to the potential use of tv marti in the event of crisis or upheaval in cubas future and argue that in such scenario it would be important to
