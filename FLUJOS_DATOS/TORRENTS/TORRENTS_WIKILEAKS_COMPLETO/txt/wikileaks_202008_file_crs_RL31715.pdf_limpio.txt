march 19 2003 with strike against location where iraqi president saddam hussein and top lieutenants were believed to be meeting on march 17 president bush d given saddam an ultimatum to leave the country or face military conflict althoug h some resistance was encountered after us troops entered iraq all major iraq i population centers had been brought under us control by april 14 in november 2002 the united nations security council had adopted resolution 1441 giving iraq fi nal opportunity to comply with its the disarmament obligations or face serious consequences during january and february 2003 us military buildup in the pe rsian gulf intensif ied and president bush other top us officials and british prime minister tony blair repeatedly indicated that iraq had little time left to offer full cooperation with weapons inspectors however leaders of france germany russia and china urged that the inspections process be allowed more time the administration and its supporters assert that iraq was in defiance of 17 security council resolutions requiring that it fully declare and eliminate its weapons of mass destruction wmd further delay in taking action against iraq they argued would have endangered nati onal security and undermined us credibility skeptics including many foreign critics maintained that the administration was exaggerating the iraq threat and argued that the u n inspections process should have been extended in october 2002 congress author ized the president to use the armed forces of the united states to defend us national security against the threat posed by iraq and to enforce all relevant resolutions regarding iraq pl 107243 analysts and officials ar concerned about the risk of instability and ethnic fragmentation in iraq after the war us plans for postwar governance of iraq are just starting to be implemented and the role of the united nations in administering iraq if any is still under bate whether the overthrow of iraq president saddam hussein will lead to democratization in iraq and the wider middle east or promote instability and an intensification of antius attitudes is also an issue in debate the iraq war has created concerns over the humanitarian situation particularly in baghdad and other cities affected by the war but largescale refugee flows have not occurred constitutional issues concerning possible war with iraq were largely resolved by the enactment of pl 107243 the oct ober authorization international legal issues remain however with respect to launching preemptive war against iraq and the prospective occupation estimates of the cost of war in iraq vary widely if war or its aftermath leads to spike in the price of oil economic growth could slow but oil prices have fluctuated widely durin g the conflict to date conceivably global oil production could increase si gnificantly after the war this crs report provides in formation and analysis with respect to the 2003 war with iraq reviews number

military buildup in the persian gulf intensified as analysts speculated that mid to late march seemed likely time for an attack to be launched officials maintained that it would be possible to attack later even in the extreme heat of summer but military experts observed that conditions for fighting war would be far better in the cooler months before may statements by president bush secretary of state colin powell and other top officials during january february and march expressed high degree of dissatisfaction over iraqs compliance with security council disarmament demands the president said on january 14 that time is running out for iraq to disarm adding that he was sick and tired of its games and deceptions3 on january 26 2003 secretary of state powell told the world economic forum

failed to take the fi nal opportunity afforded to it by resolution 1441 to disarm the proposed resolution wa s regarded as authorizing the immediate use of force to disarm iraq on march 10 president chirac said that his government would veto the resolution and russian offi cials said that their government would likely follow the same course chiracs stance and the administrations lack of success in garnering other support for the second resolution seemed to convince us officials that further diplomatic efforts at the united nations would prove fruitless president bush flew to the azores for hastilyarranged meeting with the prime ministers of britain and spain on sunday march 16 2003 the meeting resulted in pledge by the three leaders to establish unified free nd prosperous iraq under

and the united states might have fewer military and diplomatic options in january 2003 the administration revive d assertions it d made periodically since the september 11 2001 attacks that th baghdad

khurmal was captured by coalition forces during operation iraqi freedom other experts are said to believe that there might have been some coope ration when osama bin laden was based in sudan in the

february 12 exhorting them to resist any us attack while also criticizing saddam husseins baath party regime as socialist and infidel in attempting to win inte rnational support for its po licy the

programs numbe r of us allies nd security council members including france germany russia and china agreed that iraq did not fully comply with resolution 1441 but opposed military action maintaining instead that inspections were working to di sarm iraq and should have been continued diplomatic negotiations to avert war ended after the united states and britain could not muster sufficient support for proposed security council resolution that would have authorized force if iraq did not meet final deadline for iraq to fully comply with wmd disarmament mandates the bush administrations september 2002 decision to seek umbrella for the confrontation with iraq led officials to mute their prior declarations that the goal of us policy was to change iraq s regime the purpose of downplaying this goal may have been to blunt criticism from us allies and other countries that argued that regime change is not require d by any resolution the united states drew little separation between regime change and disarmament the administration believed that friendly or pliable govern ment in baghdad was required to ensure complete elimination of iraqs wmd as the option drew to close the

military force against iraq concerned both the constitution and the war powers resoluti on article i section 8 of the constitution confers on congress the power to declare war and historically congress has employed this authority to enact both declarations of war and authorizations for the use of force article ii of the constitution in turn vests the executive power of the government in the president and designates him the commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states because of thes separate powers nd because of claims about the inherent authority that accrues to the president by virtue of the existence of the united states as sovereign nati on controversy has ofte n arisen about the extent to which the president may use military force without congressional authorization while all co mmentators agree that the pr esident has the constitutional authority to defend the united states from sudden attack without congressional authorization dispute still aris concerning whether and the extent to which the use of offensive force in given situation as in iraq must be authorized by congress in order to be constitutional the war powers resolution wpr pl 93148 in turn imposes specific procedural mandates on the presidents use of military force the wpr requires inter alia that the president in the absence of declaration of war file report with congress within 48 hours of introducin g us armed forces into hostilities or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances section 5b of the wpr then requires that the president terminate the use of the armed forces within 60 days 90 days in certain circumstances unless congress in the interim has declared war or adopted specific authorization for the continued use of force the wpr also requires the president to consult with congress regarding uses of force with respect to iraq these legal requirements were met as noted earlier in this report pl 107243 signed into law on october 16 2002 authorized the president to use the armed forces of the united states as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq nd 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions rega rding iraq as predicates for the use of force the statute required the president to communicate to congress his determination that the use of diplomatic and other peaceful means would not adequately protect the united states or lead to enforcement of ll relevant united nati ons security council resolutions and that the use of force would be consistent with the battle against terrorism on march 18 2003 president bush sent letter to congress making these determinations pl 107243 also specifically stated that it was intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the mean ing of section 5b of the war powers resolution thus it waived the time limitations that would otherwise have been applicable under the wpr the statute also required the president to make periodic reports to congress on matte rs relevant to this join t resolution pl 107243 expressed congressional support for the efforts of the president to obtain prompt and decisive action by the security council to enforce iraqs compliance with all relevant security council resolutions but it did not condition the use of force onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31715crs40 prior security council authorization th authorization did not contain any time limitation subsequent to enactment of the authorization but prior to the initiation of military action twelve member s of the house of representatives along with number of us soldiers and the families of soldiers filed suit against president bush seeking to enjoin military action against iraq on the grounds it would exceed the authority granted by the october resolution or alternatively that the october resolution unconstitutionally delegated congress power to declare war to the president on february 24 2003 the tria l court dismissed the suit on the grounds it raised nonjusticiable political question and on march 13 2003 the us court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed albeit on different gr ounds the appellate court stated that although the mobilization of us forces clearly imposed hardships on the plaintiffs soldiers and family members the situation was too fluid to determine whether there was an irreconcilable conflict between the political branches on the matter of using force and thus the separa tion of powers issues raised by the suit were not ripe for judi cial review on the delegation issue the appellate court ruled that the constitution allows congress to confer substantial discretionary authority on the president particularly with respect to foreign affairs and that in this instance there was clear evidence of congre ssional abandonment of the authority to declare war to the president the ppropriate recourse for those who oppose war with iraq the first circuit concluded lies with the political branches see doe v bush 240 fsupp2d 95 d mass feb 24 2003

preemptive use of force given that the united states had not itself been attacked by iraq one question that arose with respect to the use of force against iraq concerned its legitimacy under international law if considered apart from security council resolutions international law traditionally has recognized the right of states to use force in selfdefense and that right continues to be recognized in article 51 of the charter selfdefense has also traditionally included the right to use force preemptively but to be recognized as legitimate under inte rnational law preemption has d to meet at least two tests 1 the perceived threat of attack has had to be imminent and 2 the means used have had to be propor tionate to the threat in the past the imminence of threat has usually been readily apparent due to the movement of enemy armed forces but some contend that the advent of terrorism coupled with the potential availa bility of weapons of mass destruction has altered that equation the bush administra tion in particular argued in nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31715crs41 103 white house the national security strategy of the united states of america sept 2002 at 15 104

of imminent threat to the capabilities and objec tives of todays rogue states and terrorists by expanding the parameters of preemptive selfdefense to include war against potential threats ie preventive war103 subsequently with respect to the legality under international w of its use of force against iraq the administration relied primarily on prior re solutions of the united nations security council104 but it also claimed that its use of force was ju stified on the basis of our inherent right of self defense recognized in article 51 of the charter105 there is considerable doubt that iraq posed threat of attack on the us sufficiently immi nent to fall within the traditional justification for preemption arguably therefore the use of force against ir aq can be seen as an exercise not of the traditional right of selfdefense but of the administrations expanded doctrine of preemption that incorporates preventive war to the extent that is the case critics argue that the military action against iraq has loosened the legal constraints the international community has attempted to impose on the use of force since world war ii and presages similar justifications for the use of force against other states deemed to be potential but not imminent threats india in particular it is noted has been drawing parallels between iraq and pakistani actions regarding kashmir and it is argued other states may do so as well thus the use of force against iraq has provided singular opportunity to examine whether the internati onal legal standards governing preemption have been violated nd if so whether the traditional standards ought to be reformulated crs products crs report rs21314 international law and the preemp tive use of force against iraq crs report rs21311 us use

as matter of sovereign right but the charter was intended to change this legal situation th charter states one of its purposes to be to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war to that end it mandates that its member states refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other

council has directed its member states to impose economic sanctions in number of situations and to use military force in such situations as korea iraqs invasion of kuwait and the balkans in addition the charter in article 51 as noted above continues to recogn ize the inherent right of states to use force in selfdefense on march 17 2003 the united states great britain and spain abandoned efforts in the security council to obtain new explicit authorization for the use of force against iraq nonetheless the u s and great britain both contended that earlier resolutions of the security council dopted in the wake of iraqs invasion of kuwait in 1990 provided sufficient and conti nuing authority for the use of force they noted that after number of resoluti ons in 1990 calling on iraq to withdraw had gone unheeded the council in reso lution 678 adopted on november 29 1990 authorized member states to use ll necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 1990 and all subsequent relevant reso lutions and to restore international peace and security in the area they further noted that following gulf war i the council on april 3 1991 adopted resolution 687 which set forth numerous obligations that iraq had to meet as conditions of securing cease fire including total disarmament and unconditiona l agreement not to develop or acquire chemical biological or nucl ear weapons or facilities or components related to them and that iraq accepted those obligations resolution 687 they also observed speci fically reaffirmed previous resolutions on iraq including resolution 678 noting that the council had on numerous occasions most recently in resolution 1441 in the fall of 2002 found iraq to be in material breach of its disarmament obligations and contending that it was in material breach of that resolution as well the us and great britain argued that the use of force continued to be au thorized to remedy those breaches and to restore the conditions of the cease fire thus the attorney general of great britain in legal opinion released on march 17 2003 and the white house in report to congress released on march 19 2003 asserted that material breach of resolution 687 revives the authority to use force under resolution 678 nonetheless that was not the view of number of members of the security council including some of the permanent mbers or of many international legal specialists they contended that the stion of whether past security council resolutions continue to authorize the use of force is for the security council to decide and not individual member stat in particular they noted that iraqs agreement to the conditions of the cease fire embodied in resolution 687 was with the security council and not with the member states th at had forced its withdrawal from kuwait they further stressed that resolution 1441 while deeming iraq to be in material breach of its obligations under earlie r resolutions imposed an enhanced inspections regime in order to give ir aq final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations and stated that iraq would face serious consequences if it continued to fail to meet its obligations they also emphasized that resolution 1441 did not itself authorize member states to use force but mandated that the council convene immediately in the even t iraq interfered with the inspections regime or otherwise failed to meet its disarmament obligations thus they concluded resolution 1441 contemplated that the use of force against iraq would be legitimate only upon the adopti on of another resolution httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31715crs43 106 see hrept 10876 or congressional record april 12 2003 pages h3358h3385 for bill and report language and p h3385p h3404 for debate in

support 150 million that dod could use to pay irregular or indigenous foreig n military forces and 50 million for foreign military regular forces of unspecified countri who cooperate with the us in the global war on terrorism although th secretary of defe nse would need the concurrence of the secretary of state for the aid to regular or irregular foreign military forces congressional oversight would be limited because reporting of expenditures would be after the fact111 the conference version requires 15day advance notifications for the 14 billion in logistical and military support eliminates the administrations request for 150 million for irregular forces and reduces the 50 million for regular foreign military for ces and limits that funding to counter terrorism training in addition to funds for dod the administration requested 24 billion for an iraqi relief and reconstruc tion fund with the administration retaining flexibility both as to how to spend the funds and whic h agency would manage those funds the prospect that much of these funds would be managed by dod rather than by usaid and the state department as is the norm for foreign assistance programs created controversy within the administrati on among american international non governmental organizations ngos and internationally cr itics argue that military control of civilian operations would be inappropriate the conference version places the new relief and reconstr uction fund under the control of the president and permits funds to be transferred to dod reversing earlier action by the house

administrations estimate appear s to include funding for relatively small occupation force for six months members of congress voiced concerns bout the effect of war costs on the deficit it now appears unlikely that total war costs in fy2003 will reach 100 billion in the first year which would have increased the fy2003 deficit by onethird from about 300 billion to 400 billion setting new record in real terms ie when adjusted for inflation though still sm aller percent of the gdp than in 1983120 the effect of war costs on the deficit was part of the ongoing debate on the fy2004 budget resolution war and related costs could rise if dods assumption about the size of the occupation force needed proves to be optimistic and continuation of those costs could increase fu ture deficit levels the full costs of war with iraq could include not only the cost of the war itself but also the cost of aid to allies to secure basing facilities and to compensate for economic losses eg pakista n israel egypt
