radioactive materials release energy in huge explosion rdds simply scatter radioactive material their main physical effect is contaminating an area terrorist group could create an rdd much more easily than nuclear weapon radiation most atoms are stable they remain in their current form indefinitely unstable or radioactive atoms disintegrate or decay into other elements mainly by emitting an alpha particle two neutrons and two protons or beta particle an electron or positron emission of photons typically gamma rays or highenergy xrays often accompanies decay the emitted particles and photons

halflife the time for half the atoms in mass of that isotope to decay the faster an isotope decays the faster it releases and exhausts its radiation the radioactivity of mass of material is measured in curies ci 1 ci 37 x1010 disintegrations per second cobalt60 the number is the number of neutrons plus protons in the atoms nucleus with halflife of 53 years is highly radioactive uranium235 with halflife of over 700 million years is not2 each isotope has unique decay fingerprint eg gamma radiation energy that can be used to identify it biological effects radiation strikes people constantly but most of it like radio waves and light is not ionizing it does not have enough energy to damage cells significantly the biological effects of ionizing radiation depend on the amount of energy deposited in the body called the absorbed dose higher doses produce direct clinical effects including tissue damage radiation sickness and at very high levels rapid death with chronic lowlevel exposure clinical effects are observed but the exposed individual may have an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer absorbed dose depends on several factors some are straightforward such as source strength distance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21528 shielding time of exposure and energy per particle or photon others are more complex type of radiation layer of dead skin or few inches of air stops alpha particles more material is needed to stop beta particles and much more is needed to block gamma rays which are more penetrating form of material alpha and beta emitters do little harm outside the body because they are easily stopped inside the body they can do much damage one can with few ill effects pick up lump of plutonium239 an alpha emitter because the dead skin layer stops alphas but speck of the same material deep in the lungs bombards tissue with alphas and can cause lung cancer an rdd thus poses greater health threat if its material is finely powdered and thus more readily dispersed and inhaled rather than granular chemical behavior of the element in the body certain organs concentrate particular elements strontium concentrates in bone radioactive strontium90 can cause bone cancer breast cancer and leukemia the thyroid gland concentrates iodine radioactive iodine131 can cause thyroid cancer3 sources of radioactive material radioactive sources have many beneficial uses millions are used worldwide sources with tiny fraction of curie such as household smoke detectors do not pose terrorist threat but source with even few curies may be of use for an rdd while hundreds of radioactive isotopes exist only few isotopes all produced in nuclear reactors are of concern for rdds isotopes of special concern typical sources and curies per source include cesium137 halflife 302 years used in external beam radiation devices to treat cancers 13500 ci and equipment to monitor wells for oil 002727 ci and cobalt60 halflife 53 years used in industrial radiography 3250 ci and cancer therapy 00014027 ci such sources often have little security because they are small have modest amounts of shielding so they 2 us department of energy office of environmental management characteristics of important radionuclides httpwwwemdoegovidb97tabb1html 3 potassium iodide protects against radioactive iodine by saturating the thyroid with stable iodine127 it does not protect against other elements terrorists are unlikely to use iodine131 because they could obtain it only from nuclear reactor its halflife is so short that much of it would decay before they could use it and its intense radioactivity makes it hazardous to handle crs3 can be used in the field and do not have enough radiation to be selfprotected they are sometimes abandoned in contrast terrorists would find isotopes with very short half lives hours or less of little use because the radiation could decay to low levels before the material could be used while those with long halflives millions of years emit radiation very slowly and would do little damage unless inhaled there is legitimate global commerce in radioactive materials of concern but also potential for fraudulent purchases and theft during shipment or use and problems of disposing of sources longer wanted4 radiological dispersal devices alternative designs the term dirty bomb may have led the media to focus on device in which powdered radioisotope surrounds chemical explosive many terrorist groups would have the skill and materials to make the explosive part of the device it would be somewhat harder for them to obtain the radioactive material and convert it to powdered form terrorists could also scatter radioactive material without an explosive effectiveness an rdds effectiveness depends on many factors 1 some isotopes do more harm than others and some elements including their radioisotopes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21528 such as cesium bond strongly to concrete and asphalt 2 smaller particles disperse more easily and are more readily inhaled but may be harder to make 3 using more material increases physical effects 4 more explosive would disperse the material more widely 5 weather would play large role higher wind speed would disperse the material more widely and wind direction would determine where it would fall thermal currents more prevalent on summers day than winters night would also disperse material rain or snow would wash material out of the air but concentrate it in rivers lakes and seacoasts greater dispersion would increase the number of people affected while reducing the effect on each less dispersion would inflict more effects but on fewer people several estimates have appeared on radiation levels from dispersal of radioactive material for example the federation of american scientists calculated that the cesium 137 in medical gauge small amount detonated in an rdd at the national gallery of art in washington would cover about 40 city blocks with radiation that would exceed environmental protection agency epa contamination limits one in 10000 chance of getting cancer this area might depending on wind direction include the capitol supreme court and library of congress if decontamination were not possible these areas would have to be abandoned for decades by one estimate5 others feel that such scenarios exaggerate the effectiveness of rdds by assuming that material disperses well and by downplaying the ability to decontaminate affected areas epa guidelines magnify rdd effectiveness steven koonin provost of california institute of technology stated that 3 curies of an appropriate isotope fraction of gram dispersed over square mile would make the area uninhabitable according to the maximum dose currently recommended for the general population however the health effects of such contamination would be minimal for every 100000 people exposed to that level of radiation four lifetime cancers would be induced which would take

argue that these effects are extrapolations from higher doses with conclusive evidence to support their existence7 terrorists could try to achieve several goals with rdds in the following sequence most depend on public fear of any radiation rather than actual levels of radiation 1 deaths and injuries any prompt casualties would most likely come only from the explosion of dirty bomb many experts believe these would be few in numbers8 2 panic small amounts of radioactive material might cause as much panic as larger amounts 3 recruitment the worldwide media coverage of an rdd attack would be powerful advertisement for terrorist group claiming responsibility 4 asset denial public concern over the presence of radioactive material might lead people to abandon subway system building or university for months to years 5 economic disruption if port or the central area of city were contaminated with radioactive material commerce there might be suspended 6 longterm casualties inhalation of radioactive material or exposure to gamma sources could lead to such casualties probably in small numbers prevention and response httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21528 securing radioactive sources prior to september 11 2001 safe handling of sources was the chief concern they were used worldwide in medical equipment oil well gauges etc with little security some were abandoned becoming orphan sources after the attacks attention shifted to securing them various measures seek to control us radioactive materials the nuclear regulatory commission nrc regulates the use and transportation of most radioactive sources for nuclear reactors for medical industrial and academic uses and related facilities9 many states share in regulation an nrc department of energy doe working group to increase the security and regulatory oversight of highrisk radioactive sources has proposed verifying the legitimacy of applicants for licenses preventing insiders from diverting sources and controlling imports and exports of sources10 several programs provide for the disposal of unwanted radioactive sources which can be difficult epas orphan sources initiative will establish national system to retrieve

threat reduction task force is consolidating that and other programs to secure highrisk radioactive material worldwide13 some international efforts seek to secure sources this goal is important according to one expert over 100 countries in 1999 were known or thought to lack effective control over radiation sources and radioactive materials14 in march 2003 the international atomic energy agency iaea held an international conference on security of radioactive sources15 in june 2002 the g8 committed itself to six principles to prevent terrorists or those that harbour them from acquiring or developing radiological and other wmd16 nnsa has identified 35 large radiological waste sites and over 1000 orphan or surplus radioactive sources in the former soviet union and has initiated cooperative program with the iaea and these republics to locate and secure these sites and sources17 the iaea has begun discussions with source manufacturers and suppliers to address alternate sources possible fraudulent purchases and source disposal options httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21528 avoiding the use of radioactive sources for some uses radioactive material is the only way to achieve the desired result for others alternatives exist such as xray machines or particle accelerators these machines use electric power to generate radiation have radioactive material and are not radioactive when the power is off detection rdds are the least difficult wmd to detect chemical or biological agents in airtight containers have signatures by which they could be detected rdd suitable material is more detectable than the highly enriched uranium or plutonium239 used in nuclear weapons because it is much more radioactive hiding radioactive material would require much shielding that could raise suspicions if seen on an xray inspection machine and infrared detectors can detect the heat generated by large radioactive sources despite shielding many sensors can detect radioactive material such as geiger counters gammaray detectors and at short range pagersize radiation detectors used by customs and border protection cbp agents portal monitors detect radiation in nearby sources 11 us

sea land and air ports18 nnsa is deploying them in russia and elsewhere through its second line of defense program and in other ports through its megaports program19 detecting rdds though is not simple material might be smuggled across unguarded stretches of coasts or borders or obtained within the united states so system to detect rdds inside this nation might be needed to complement border detection efforts the difficulty of finding rdd material emphasizes the value of eliminating or securing it advance steps to minimize effects of an rdd attack as noted earlier most such effects flow from fear of radiation largescale public education program available for use in the event of attack could help quell panic20 other steps might include deploying radiation detectors in large cities and developing and applying coatings to prevent radioactive material from bonding to streets and buildings though it is not clear that the benefit of coatings would merit the cost response to an attack the initial response would likely involve detecting an attack evacuating areas that might receive radiation or keeping people indoors until respirable material had dispersed treating people who might be exposed and sheltering httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21528 evacuees the federal radiological emergency response plan21 would come into play does nuclear emergency support teams among others could assist22 harry vantine of lawrence livermore national laboratory suggests having the prompt ability to predict dose to the population from an rdd attack and exercising decontamination procedures23 public education program could be implemented promptly longerterm responses would include monitoring radiation levels defining and decontaminating affected areas and decontaminating or demolishing affected buildings promulgating standards that permitted exposure to somewhat higher levels of radiation while having few adverse health effects as noted above would greatly reduce the area to be abandoned and the decontamination required public acceptance of such standards would be uncertain 18 us department of homeland security customs and border protection radiation and portal monitors
