down kelo v city of new london holding that under the fifth amendm ent takings clause the sovereign power of eminent domain c ondemnation can be used to transfer private property to new private owners for the pur pose of economic development kelo sparked public outcry and flurry of legislativ proposals in congress and the states to restrict the use of eminent domain the principal kelo bill in congress is hr 4128 the sensenbrenner b ill which passed the house on november 3 2005 its key provision prohibits states and their political subdivisions hereinafter states from using eminent domain to transfer private property to other priv ate parties for econo mic development or allowing their delegatees to do so the prohibition applies to any fiscal year after the bills enactment in which the state r eceived federal economic development funds state that violates the prohibition is ineligible to r eceive federal economic development funds for two fiscal years following judicial determination of violation penalty enforceable by private right of action hr 4128 raises several legal i ssues the prohibition on economic development condemnations extends not only to land taken for the explicit purpose of economic development but so to land subsequently so used the latter coverage raises the possibility that although parcel was initially condemned for non prohibited purpose its use years later for prohibited one would trigger the twoyear cutoff of federal funds nor does there seem to be any pr oportionality requirement between the prohibited condemn ations and the length and scope of the federal funds suspension if congresss spending power in cludes proportiona lity requirement for conditions on federal funds as the c ourt suggests the absence of proportionality in some of the bills applications may raise constitutional issue persons forced to move by prohibite d condemnation may r into standing problem should they attempt to use the bills right of action to impose funds suspension standing requires that the remedy sought in an article iii court will redress the complainedof injury susp ension of federal funding to the offending jurisdiction does not redress the fact that the person was made to move unless it can be argued that the funding cutoff makes it more likely that the jurisdiction will elect to return the wrongfully condemned property the bond amendment inserted into an fy2006 appropriations bill by senator bond is now enacted law like hr 4128 it attaches condemnationrestricting condition to federal funds though limited to funds appr

and bond amendment introduction on june 23 2005 the supreme court handed down kelo v city of new london 1 addressing whether under the fi fth amendment takings clause the sovereign power of eminent dom ain condemnation can be used to transfer private property to new private owners for the purpose of economic development2 the court held 54 that the city of new londons use of privatetoprivate condemnations to further its economic revitaliz ation project satisfied the takings clauses demand that eminent domain be employed for public use3 despite the private nature of the transferees the citys goodfaith purpose said the majority was to carry out carefully considered areawide redevelopment plan believed by the city and state to be needed to reverse d ecades of economic decline on these facts the majority deemed the public use requirement satisfied especially given the strong deference owed by courts to legisla tive determinations of local needs many observers argue that kelo does not depart from established eminent domain law that its view of public us as covering new londons revitalization plan is indistinguishable from prior court precedent sustaining eminent domain for mixed private and public gain contrariwise vocal minority starting with the four dissenters argues that the decision repres ents major expansion of public use while still others counter that it actually narrows public use for present purposes this debate is unimportant what matters here is that kelo cast bright spotlight on controversial and increasin gly frequent practice the use of privatetoprivate condemnation by state and local government s solely to increase tax base or tax revenues and create jobs the new attention given by kelo to the possibility that peoples homes can be taken involuntar ily for such purposes upon payment of compensation provoked popular outcry and media coverage such as few recent supreme court decisions ve generated following kelo the majority of state legislatures saw the introduc tion of or talk of the in troduction of bills limiting thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs2 4 kelo made clear that it was construing only th us constitution so it

by robert meltzuse of eminent domain4 congress entered the fray through the introduction of roughly dozen bills most of them seeking to discourage state and local use of eminent domain for economic developmen t through the device of attaching restrictive conditions on federal grant money5 the use of funding conditions rather than direct federal command that localities not condemn for economic

funds and h r 4088 restricting federal funds hr 4128 what the bill says section 2 the heart of the bill the key provisions in hr 4128 are sections 2a and 2b section 2a sets out the state and local activities that the bill prohibits state or political subdivision of state shall exercise its power of eminent domain or allow the exercise of such power by any person or entity to which such power has been delegated over property to be used for economic development or over property that is subsequently used for economic development if that state received fe deral economic development funds during any fiscal year in which it does so section 2b states consequence under th bill when state or local government violates section 2a violation of subsection by stat or political subdivision shall render such state or political subdivision ineligible for any federal economic development funds for period of 2 fiscal years follo wing final judgment on the merits by court of competent jurisdiction that such subsection has been violated under section 2c the section 2b inelig ibility period is terminated if the offending state or locality elects to return all real property the taking of which was judicially determined to offend section 2a7 section 3 of the bill is the federal condemnation counterpa rt to section 2 barring federal agencies from using minent domain for economic development section 3 however is much less important than section 2 at least as defined in the bill federal condemnation for economic development is rare section 8 definitions section 8 determin which government condemnations are prohibited by sections 2a and 3 bove through its definition of economic development given the huge variety of purposes for which eminent domain is used around the country craftin g such definition is difficult task attempted by many of the kelo bills in congress in section 8s version economic development means taking pr ivate property without the consent of the owner and conveying or leasing such property from one private person or entity to anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs4 8 hr 4128 does not actually say that is the purpose of the mandated attorney general list but it would seem the most plausible readin g of the bill and the house committee report construes it so hre pt 109262 at 12 2005private person or entity for commercial enterprise carried on for profit or to increase tax revenue tax base employment or general economic health seven exemption categories are stated the first allows the conveyance of private property to public ownership or an entity that makes the prope rty available to the general public as of right eg common carriers or for use as road or other right of way open to the public other categorical exemptions incl ude removing harmful uses of land that constitute an immediate threat to public health or safe ty acquiring abandoned property clearing defective chains of title use by public utility and redeveloping brownfields the bill uses the words economic developm ent in second context in addition to section 2a the phras federal economic developm ent funds in section 2b defines which federal monies are to be suspended should court find that prohibited condemnations have occurred notwithstanding the word overlap the bill defines the section 2b phrase in completely different language than it uses for the section 2a phrase federal economic developmen t funds according to section 82 are those federal monies distribut ed to or through states or their political subdivisions under federal laws designed to improve or increase the size of their economies the attorney general is charged unde r section 5a2 with compiling list of such federal laws to delineat the particular federal funds that must be suspended in the event of section 2a transgressions8 section 4 private right of action section 4 gives the bill an enforcement mechanism in the form of private right to sue property owner who suffers injury as result of violation of any provision of this act may bring an action to enforce any provision of this act in the appropriate fe deral or state court unlike the typical suit where the plaintiff has the burden of showing the elements of the cause of action hr 4128 sh ifts the burden of pr oof to the defendant government to show by clear and convinc ing evidence that the taking is not for economic development any such suit must be brought within prescribed time window namely after the condemnation and the pr opertys subsequent use for economic development but before seven years following such economic development use but see legal comments on section 4 infra on the possibility that section 4 also allows suits before and during an improper condemnation as well prevailing plaintiffs are to be awarded attorneys fees comparable provision is included for prevailing government defendants other bill provisions other bill provisions are as follows section 13 is counterpart to section 2a and 2b for the specific cas where property of religious and nonprofit organizations is condemned in the case of section 13 condemnation triggers funds cutoff if the condemna tion occurs by reas on of the nonprof it or taxexempt status of such organization this may be rough analog to the prohibited economic development purpos in section 2 house judiciary committee proceedings make clear that th inclusion of section 13 was motivatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs5 9 see eg hrept 109262 at 8 2005 10 whether the possibility of future federal funds cutoff would have present consequences for municipalitys creditworthiness or bond rating is beyond the scope of this report see hrept 109262 at 2627 dissenting vi ews of reps nadler and scottby belief on the part of committee memb ers that because religious and nonprofit organizations pay or fewer taxes th ey are tempting condemnation targets for municipal officials looking to increase tax revenue9 section 11 commands that the bill be construed in favor of broad protection of private property rights in the sa spirit but less subs tantively section 10 declares that it is the policy of the united states to encourage the private ownership of property and section 7 expresses the sens of congress that the use of eminent domain for economic development is threat to agricultural and other property in rural america finally section 9b instructs that the bill if enacted applies prospectively only it takes effect in the fiscal year that begins after the date of enactment and does not apply to projects for which condemnation has been initiated be fore enactment legal comments on section 2 delegatees section 2as prohibition on conde mnations for or followed by economic development explicitly reaches not only condemnations by states or their political subdivisions but also those by entities to which eminent domain power has been delegated by states and political s ubdivisions the inclusion of delegatees public or private presumably reflects the fact that economicdevelopment condemnations are often carried out not by the state or local government itself but by governmentcreated nonpr ofit entities created to impleme nt the project as in the kelo case absence of time limit the section2a phrase subsequently used for economic development appears to have outer time limit this omission raises the possibility that while parcel was initially condemned in good faith for non economicdevelopment purpose as defined in the bill its use many years or even decades later for economic development due to unforeseen change in the law policy priorities or funding ava ilability would trigger loss of federal funds per section 2b10 bear in mind here as elsewhere in the bill the broadconstruction mandate of section 11 favoring private property ri ghts to avoid funds cutoff the condemnor government would ve to return the property problematic option after the condemnee has moved see disc ussion of section 2c below absence of nexus and pr oportionality requirements the plain meaning of section 2b is that the suspended fede ral economic development funds need not be connected in any way to the economic velopment project at which the offending condemnation took place indeed the project need not be slated to receive federal economic development funds at all nor would it appear to ma tter how many or how significant the offending condemna tions the condemnation and economic development of single sma ll tract of land triggers the twoyear funds cutoff everyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs6 11 us

condition imposed by hr 4128 section 2a 15 south dakota 483 us at 207208 208 n3 16 rep sensenbrenner chairman of the house committee on the judiciary and chief sponsor of hr 4128 emphasized the clear connection between the federal funds that would be denied and the abuse congress is intending to pr event the policy is that states or localities continuedbit as effectively as jurisdictionwide pattern of using c ondemnation for economic development spending power and nece ssary and proper clause at first blush hr 4128 appears to be an exercise of congresss spending power11 under which it is well established that congress may attach conditions to the grant of federal money so as to induce the recipients to coopera voluntarily with federal policy12 and doubtless many of the kelo bills in congress are straightforward exercises of this power federal money available to the state or loca lity is made subject to some condition that there be condemnation for economic velopment if such condemnation is planned or actually occurs the same money cannot be transferred hr 4128 takes fundamenta lly different tack the funds granted during the year in which the offending condemnations take place are not th emselves at risk rather the funds co with condition that if violative condemnation occurs during the same fiscal year as the money is received other federal monies are blocked namely econo mic development funds for the tw fiscal years after court discerns the prohibited condemnation this shift from loss of the conditioned money to loss of separate funds means that th constitutional basis of hr 4128 arguably is not the spending clause alone but ra ther the spending clause together with congresss authority under the necessary and proper clause13 that clause has been construed to empower congress to see to it that taxpayer dolla rs appropriated under the spending power are in fact spent for the general welfare 14 as either an exercise of the spending power alone or the spending power and necessary and proper clause in combina tion discussion of the constitutional limits on congresss use of funding conditions is relevant one such limit is that the condition must be related to the federal interest for which the funds are expended15 this prerequisite has been little explicated by the court and spending condition has yet to be found deficient because of it because hr 4128 punishes condemnation for economic development by cuttin g off only funds promoting economic development it would seem to pass this amorphous test16 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs7 16 continued that abuse their eminent domain power by usin g economic development as the rationale for the takings should not be trusted with fede ral economic development funds that could contribute to similarly abusive land grab s hrept 109262 pa rt 2 at 32 2005 17 south dakota 483 us at 211 quoting steward machine co v davis 301 us 548 590 1937 18 if found to offend the spending clause in certain applications by reason of compulsion standard the twoyear funds cuto ff would still be available in others section 9a contains severability clause if any prov ision of this act or any application thereof is found unconstitutional that finding shall not ffect any provision or application of the act not so adjudicated 19 south dakota 483 us at 211whether second possible constrai nt on spending power conditions is satisfied by hr 4128 is closer questi on the supreme court has suggested that in some circumstances the financial inducement created by congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at wh ich pressure turns into compulsion17 though once again the court has never found congressional condition to violate this criterion it is conceivable that the threat of twoyear cutoff of millions of dollars under many federal programs triggered by condemnation of single small property later used for economic development could be viewed as such unacceptable compulsion18 certainly hr 4128 presents shar p contrast to some of the other kelo bills in congress which terminate only those funds destined for the particular project at which the offending condemnati on took place the bill contrasts sharply as well with the facts in the leading supreme court decision on spending power conditions upholding congresss creation of relatively mild encouragement to the states loss of arelatively small percen tage of certain federal highway funds to enact higher minimum drinking age19 again however any such compulsion test is only suggested in the courts decisions and is of poorly understood content returning the condemned property section 2c allowing the offending condemnor to return the property and thereby end the funds cutoff does not explicitly state that the condemnee has to return the money received for the property such reimbursement requi rement is arguably implied however possibly including interest since the bill otherwise would llow unjust enrichment of the condemnee at the governments expense assuming reimbursement requirement another issue arises some condemnees might not want their property back having long since moved somewhere else spent the compensation on new home and settled in under literal reading of section 2c which requires that the state or politi cal subdivision return all real property to restore federal funding such re fusal by the condemnee forecloses the condemnors use of section 2c query wh ether court would read returns all real property more liberally to include bona fide return offers by the condemnor government that are rejected by the former property ownerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs8 20 hrept 109262 part 2 at 4349 2005 21 348 us 26 1954 22 467 us 229 1984 23 in the words of one commentator

defines economic development the prohibite d condemnation purpose under the bill but exempts an entity such as common carrier that makes the property available to the general public as of right such as railroad or public facility in committee markup the question whether this exemption includes s ports stadiums and shopping centers was debated at length20 representative nadler argued that it does in response representative goodlatte cont ended that shopping centers and private stadiums are not within the exemption because they are not open to the public as of right but that public stadiums might very well be removing harmful uses section 81 offers another exemption from economic development for removing rmful uses of land provided such uses constitute an immediate threat to public hea lth and safety the immediate threat qualifier is of interest because as the following paragraph argues it seems to extend hr 4128 well beyond the sort of econo mic development project involved in kelo one of the leading supreme court precedents leading up to kelo is berman v parker 21 holding that privatetoprivate condemnation for blightremoval redevelopment is public use another leading kelo precedent is hawaii v midkiff 22 where the court found public use in hawaii statute allowing privateto private condemnation to alleviate the econo mic harms of highly concentrated land ownership in kelo justice oconnors f ourjustice dissent explicitly left these precedents intact while privatetopriva condemnati on for economic development as in kelo was constitutionally objectionable she wrote the elimination of property uses that inflict affirmative harm on society as the urban blight in berman and concentrated land ownership in hawaii was legitimate public use as noted above however section 81b does not exem pt use of condemnation to remove any harmful property use but only those invol ving an immediate threat thus it seems hr 4128 would punish certain privateto private condemnations that justice oconnor and her fellow dissent ers would find unobjectionable the immediate threat qualifier may serve to discourage the use of eminent domain for redevelopment in cases of marg inal even moderate blight accusations in the literature are common that the term blight is construed overly expansively by localities to further econo mic development and is often applied to neighborhoods not exhibiting the classic blightrelated ills of dilapidated structures crime drugs etc23 in these milder instances of blight an immediate threat may not be

but displaced lessees could still like displaced owners receive compensation under the takings clause of the constitution plus moving expenses and replacement housing costs under the uniform relocation act24 or its stateenacted counterparts third parties section 4 makes its right of ac tion available to any owner of private property who suffers injury as re sult of violation of any provision of this act this language might lead one to th ink that the right of action can be asserted not only by the condemnee but by third pa rties such as propertyowner neighbor whose property value tumbles suffers in jury when the prohibited condemnation for economic development results in bigbox retailer next door coverage of third parties is undercut however by subsequent language in section 4 stating that such actions are to follow the conclusion of any condemnation proceedings condemning the private property of such owner 25 remedies available does section 4 allow court to enjoin an improper condemnation before or during the c ondemnation proceeding in addition to suspending federal funds af terwards the sounder argu ment based on it seems is that it does not section 4b which forecloses suits until the property is used forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs10 26 section 4b is titled limitation on bringing action not limitation on bringing certain actions in addition section 6 requires the attorney general to make annual reports to congress identifying states and po litical subdivisions that have lost federal economic development funds for violating the bill but makes mention of condemnations terminated pursuant to the bill 27 the word opportunity is used in the title of section 2c pportunity to cure violation not in its text 28 friends of the earth v laidlaw

read as applying to all actions under section 426 if the action cannot be filed until the conclusion of the condemnation proceeding and subsequent economic use plainly it cannot be used to prevent th condemnation from happening nor as practical matter to undo it after the fact the dualremedy reading cannot be comp letely discounted however section 4b says that an action may be brough t if the property is used for economic development after the condemnati on not that such action may only be brought at that time arguably this suggests that section 4b speaks to different type of private right of action than section 4a one following the condemnation seeking funds cutoff leaving 4a as the aut hority for injunctive actions before during or soon after the condemnati on aimed at thwarting or undoi ng it and again section 11 calls for the bill to be construed in favor of broad property rights protection there appears to be authorization in the bill for damages money paid to the plaintiff remedy further it mig ht be contended that section 2cs opportunity for states and localities to cu re the violation by returning the real property27 is only that choice to be made by the state or locality in its sole discretion that is return of the real property assuming the displaced property owner wishes to buy it back probabl cannot be compelled by court if the foregoing arguments are correct then the only remedy available in section 4 action for nonfederal condemnations is for the court to order the two year cutoff and return of any federal funds mistakenly grante d during this period standing to sue as to the remedy of blocki ng federal funds to the offending jurisdiction and mandating re imbursement of improperly disbursed funds section 4 raises constitutional question does the pl aintiff seeking such remedy satisfy the standing to sue requirements derived from article iii of the cons titution as the supreme court explains the article iii case or controversy prerequisite for invoking the federal judicial power means th at to establish standing plaintiff must show 1 it has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent 2 the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and 3 it is likel as opposed to merely speculative that the injury will be redressed by favorable

being forced to move was caused by the challenged condemnation by the defendant but whethe r redressability is satisfied is more doubtful obviously funds cuto ff does not of itself redress the injury that the plaintiff has suffered but query whether redressability would be satisfied if the funds cutoff greatly increas the likelihood that the condemnor government will elect to return the property

congressional abrogation unde r the fourteenth amendment section 5 and prospective injunctions against state officials30 the issue is whether the amendment is an impediment to its against states under section 4 as threshold matter the eleventh amendment does not apply to political subdivisions of states31 thus the amendment is not implicated in most economic development condemnations done as they are by politi cal subdivisions or their delegatees in this connection we read b ill section 2a to mean that when political subdivision or its delegatee vi olates section 2a the in eligibility for federal funds imposed by section 2b is visited excl usively upon the political subdivision not the state as for suits against states section 4 pronounces that state shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment from any action under section 4 in federal or state court of competent juri sdiction the question is whether this language is adequate to effect state waiver of eleventh amendment immunity by virtue of the states acceptance of federa l economic development funds following the bills enactment the answer appears to be yes the supreme court in dicta and majority of the federal circuits in holdings have interpreted nearly identical language in another federal statute to be suffici ent to waive state sovereign immunity upon state acceptance of federal funds32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs12 32 continued amendment from suit in federal court for violation of section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 words similar to those used in hr 4128 section 4 though this hr 4128like language did not aid the private clai mants suit against the united states said lane it was an unambiguous waiver of the states eleventh amendment immunity since the dicta in lane at least eight federal circuits have held that the rehabilitation act amendments phrase waives the sovereign imm unity of states electing to participate in federally funded programs see

by the bill thus military bases now being conveyed into private hands per the defense base closure and realig nment act of 1990 are not coveredlegal comments on section 3 the section 3 prohibition on federal c ondemnations for economic development raises issues distinct from those in the statepolitical subdivision sections of the bill for one thing the section 3 prohibition argu ably covers only conde mnations with the direct purpose of economic development recall that section 2s prohibition on states and political subdivisions applies not only to the use of eminent domain over property to be used for economic velopment but also over property subsequently used for economic development33 given that section 3 provision of the same bill omits the latter phrase the presumption arises that congress had narrower vision for section 3 if so this relieves th united states of concern that should it in the future use eminent domain to assemble tracts of land for federal facility such as military base the property upon termin ation of federal us may be conveyed to private owners without running afoul of the bill34 second issue is what reme dies are available when federal agency violates section 3 the funds cutoff in secti on 2 applies only to states and political subdivisions if one takes the view see l egal comments on section 4 section that section 4 claim can only be brought after the condemnation has occurred an injunction against the imprope r federal condemnation is ru led out perhaps the lack of an explicit remedy in the bill for federal violations would be

benefits private entities is rough paraphrase of the oftenstated rule that condemnations producing priv ate benefits constitute public use only if the private benefit is merely in cidental or secondary to primary public purpose37 some condemnation decisions however declare or suggest broader view of public use namely that even projects primarily benefitting private entities can be deemed fo r public use as long as there is some public benefit38 supreme court decisions too ggest such broad view of public use stating that condemnation not be solely for private use and be rationally related to conceivable public purpose39 within the ambit of the amendment thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs14 39 continued 1992 emphasis added see also kelo 125 s ct at 2663 2666 stating that the

appeared in his statement accompanying introduction of his amendment to read kelo as supporting the anypublicbenefitisenough view 151 cong rec s11513 daily ed kelo would essentially allow the use of

paragraph makes clear that the fo rmer and narrower of these public use standards applies the third paragraph of the amendment declaring various projects to be public uses under the amendment conforms closely to existing takings clause jurisprudence as to what constitutes public us particularly is this so because the paragraph uses the descriptors benefit or serve the general pub lic designated for use by the general public and serve the general public echoing the supreme courts modern reading of constitutiona l public use as meaning for public purpose40 many of the listed items are f acilities to which the public has physical access satisfying even the narrow ninet eenth century sense of public use under which condemnation into private owners hip required that the public still have physical access to the property two other items listed in the third paragraph removal of immediate threats to public health and safety and removal of brownfields plainly would constitute public use the phrase immediate threat to public hea lth and safety in the third paragraph replaced blight including areas identified by units of local government for recovery from natural disasters in the introduced version of the amendment very likely the switch was made to align the bond ame ndment with the same immediate threat to public health and safety phrase in hr 4128s list of exceptions from its definition of economic development it may also as in hr 4128 reflect congressional concerns as to overuse of blightremoval justifications for local redevelopment involvi ng condemnations41 the list of nonpublic uses in the second paragraph and public uses in the third would each appear to be nonexhaus tive so what criterion as to publicuse status applies to nonlisted condem nation purposes one candidate is that in takings clause case law applying this criterion however the switch from blight to immediate threat to public h ealth and safety may have achieved little as to blight since blight removal has been broadly ndorsed as constitutional public use by the supreme court apparently irrespective of whether it constitutes an immediate threat to public health and safety42 on the other hand the criterion for nonlisted condemnation purposes might be statutory under this criterion the fact of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33208crs15 43 151 cong rec s11515 oct 19 2005 daily ed 44 inverse condemnation is the name given to the procedural reverse of trad itional condemnation action the property owner sues the government rather than the other way around the property owner argues that f acto exercise of eminent domain has taken his or her property as through severe regula tion even if formal condemnation action has been filed by the government because inverse condemnation is at bottom an unacknowledged exercise of eminent domain the possibility arises that the amendments mandate for study on eminent domain includes inverse condemnation language change from blight to immedi ate threat could ground an argument that removal of lesser degrees of blig ht are not public uses pursuant to the amendment whatever the parallels between the amendments itemized public uses and non public use and those of takings clause case law the amendment clearly works change in the law by adding the funding prohibition under preexisting law the judicial invalidation of st ate or local condemnation as not for public use did not require cutoff of federal funding for the associated project this change effected by the bond amendment is enhanced in impor tance if the first pa ragraph is construed broadly to trigger funds cutoff when eminent domain is used for other than public use anywhere in the jurisdiction rather than solely as part of the project in question the final paragraph of the bond amendment calls for gao study on the nationwide use of eminent domain by its literal terms this mandate is of expansive scope it includes federal state and local condemnations and is not limited to or even specially focused on the kelo issue of condemnation for economic development nator bonds statement on introducing the amendment however does suggest such constrained focus for the report dwelling as it does exclusively on kelo and similar circumstances43 similarly the senators statement implies that report coverage of inverse condemnation literally included in the term eminent domain was not intended44
