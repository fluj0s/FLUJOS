divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32789insurance regulation issues background and current legislation summary the individual states have been acknow ledged as the primary regulators of insurance as far back as 1868 since th 1945 mccarranferguson act this system has operated with the specific blessing of congress but has also been subject to periodic scrutiny and suggestions that the time may have come for congress to take back the regulatory authority that it grante d to the states in the late 1980s and early 1990s congressional scrutiny wa s largely driven by the increasing complexities of the insurance business and concern over whether the states were up to the task of ensuring consumer protections particularly insurer solvency congressional interest in insurance regulation in the 107th109th congresses focused on the inefficiencies in the state regulatory system major catalyst for congressional interest has been the aftermath of the grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba which modernized the regulatory structure for banks and securities firms but left the insurance sector largely untouched many larg er insurers and their trade associations had previously defended state regulation but consider themselves at competitive disadvantage in the current regulatory structure they are now largely arguing for an optional federal charter akin to that available to banks the increased internationalization of insurance has also brought more pressure on the current us regulatory system particularly as the regulatory paradigms being embraced overseas differ greatly from those in the united states the states particularly working throug h the national associ ation of insurance commissioners naic have not been idle in the face of this increased scrutiny they reacted quickly to the glba requirements that related to insurance agent licensing and have embarked on wider ranging project to modernize insurance regulation this includes both regulatory as pects such as streamlining the process for rate and form filing and more basic legal aspects such as the creation of an interstate compact to provide uniformity across states for some life insurance products since every state legislature must pass the legal changes suggested by the naic the process typically does not move rapidly some in congress and the executive branch have not been content with the changes being undertaken by the states nd several proposals ve been put forth over the past few years for increased fede ral involvement in insurance regulation in the 110th congress s 40 and hr 3200 would

issues background and current legislation introduction insurance companies comprise major segment of the us financial services industry unlike banks and securities fi rms however insurance companies have been regulated solely by the states for the past 150 years this stems from an 1868 decision of the us supreme court1 that insurance was not interstate commerce and thus was not subject to regulation by the federal governme nt under the commerce clause of the us constitution courts fo llowed that precedent for the next 75 years in 1944 the us supreme court effectivel reversed its 1868 ruling and held that insurance was interstate commerce and was subject to federal oversight2 by that time the state insurance regulatory structure was well established and joint effort led by state regulators and insurance industry leaders to overturn the decision legislatively led to the passage of the mccarranferguson act of 19453 that act relinquished to the states federal authority to regulate insurance subject to effective insurance regulation by the states and granted federal antitrust exemption to the insurance industry for the business of in surance which has been determined not synonymous with the business of insurers4 after 1945 the jurisdictional stewards hip entrusted to the states under mccarranferguson was reviewed by cong ress on various occasions some narrow exceptions to the 50state structure of insurance regulation have been enacted such as that for some types of liability insurance in the liability risk retention act5 in general however each time broad proposal s were made to tr ansfer insurance regulatory authority back to the federal government they were met by successful opposition from the states as well as from united insurance industry such proposals for federal oversight usually spurre d series of regulatory reform efforts at the state level and by the national association of insurance commissioners naic such efforts were directed at correcting perceived deficiencies in state regulation in order to forestall federal regulatory takeover they were generally accompanied by pledges from state regulators to work for more uniformity and efficiency in the state regulatory processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32789crs2 major effort to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government began in the mid1980s follo wing insolvencies of several large insurance companies representative j ohn dingell who chaired the house energy and commerce committee that had jurisdiction over insurance at the time questioned whether state regulation was up to the task of overseeing such large and diversified industry he c onducted several hearings on the state regulatory structure and also proposed legislation that would ve created federal insurance regulatory agency modeled on the securities and exchange commission sec state insurance regulators and the insurance industry oppos ed his proposal and worked together on series of reforms at the state level and at the naic including new state accreditation program setting base line standards for state solvency regulation under those standards in order to obtain and retain its accreditation each state must have adequate statutory and administrative authority to regulate an insurers corporate and financial affairs and the nece ssary resources to carry out that authority in spite of such reforms however another breach in the state regulatory system occurred in the 1990s when martin frankel who had previ ously been barred from securities dealing by the sec slipped through the oversight of several states insurance regulators before being stopped he had looted num ber of small life insurance companies of some 200 million such breach was ma jor embarrassment to state regulation but it did not bring longter m change to federal policy in the middle and latter part of the 1990s congress attention on insurance regulatory matters waned in recent congresses however attention has again focused on the regulatory structure of in surance the house financial services committee in particular held more than dozen hearings at both the subcommittee and full committee levels on insurance matters from the 107th through the 109th congresses representative michael oxley who chaired the committee for this timeindicated strong interest in pursuing legislation to change the regulatory structure number of broad proposals for some form of federal chartering or other federal intervention in insurance regulation were put forward in both houses of congress but none were marked up or reported by the various committees of jurisdiction in the first session of the 110 th congress senators john sununu and tim johnson and representatives melissa bean and edward royce introduced the national insurance act of 2007 s 40 and h r 3200 into their respective chambers while differing slightly both bills would create an optional federal charter ofc for propertycasualty and life insurance th is legislation was echoed by the us department of the treasury when it released blueprint for modernized financial regulatory structure on march 31 2008 as an intermediate step the treasury blueprint also called for an optional fede ral charter although it did not specifically endorse the existing ofc bills number of narrower bills affecting diffe rent facets of insurance regulation and regulatory requirements have also been introduced these bills include the nonadmitted and reinsuran ce reform act of 2007 hr 1065 and s 929 the insurance industry competition act of 2007 s 618 and hr 1081 the holocaust insurance accountability act of 2007 h r 1746 the homeowners insurance noncoverage disclosure act s 1061 the life insurance fairness for

see below for additi onal details on legislation factors promoting change three interrelated factors provide impetus for broad change in the insurance regulatory system these are 1 previous legislation that revamped regulation for the banking and securities industries 2 change in the insura nce marketplace and 3 the impact of regulatory changes abroad taken together these changes are having significant impact on the competitive position of companies both within the insurance industry and between insurers and other financial service companies largely because of this impact significant portions of the insurance industry which had previously supported the state regula tory system are now calling for federal intervention the grammleachbliley act6 in 1999 congress passed the gramml eachbliley act glba instituting massive overhaul of the fede ral laws governing us fi nancial institutions support for the measure came largely as result of changes in market forces frequently referred to as convergence convergence in the financial services context refers to the breakdown of distincti ons separating different type s of financial products and services as well as the providers of once separate products drivers of such convergence are generally considered to be market forces such as globalization new technology ecommerce deregulation mark et liberalization increased competition tighter profit margins and the growing number of sophisticated consumers the goals behind these driving forces in turn ppear to be the increasing efforts of all financial services providers to find grow th gain market share create new revenue streams and enter new markets for exam ple us banks have looked to adjunct nonbanking products such as insurance and pension products to increase their profitability pointing to european bancassurers that generate 20 to 30 of their profits from the sale of insu rance and investment products integrated into core retail banking businesses glba repealed federal laws that seemed inconsistent with the way that financial services products were actually being delivere d and removed many barriers that kept banks or securities firms from competing with insurance companies the result was the creation of new competitive paradigm in which insurance companies now find themselves in direct competiti on with brokerages mutual funds and commercial banks glba did not however change the basic regulatory structure for insurance or other fi nancial products instead it reaffirmed the mccarran ferguson act recognizing state insurance regulators as the functional regulatorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32789crs4 7 see for example the april 16 2008 testimony by tom minkler on behalf of the independent insurance agents and brokers made before the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises at httpwwwhousegovappslisthearingfinancialsvcs_demminkler041608pdf 8 in 2003 bank one acquired zurich life and then in 2004 bank one merged into jpmorgan chase and the insurance divisions were renamedof insurance products and those who sell them some insurance companies believe that in this environment state regula tion places them at competitive marketplace disadvantage they maintain that their noninsurer competitors in certain lines of products have far more effi cient federally based system s of regulation while they remain subject to the percei ved inefficiencies of state insurance regulation such as the regulation of rates and fo rms as well as other delays in getting their products to market for example life insurers with products aimed at retirement and asset accumulation must now compete with similar bank products banks can roll out such new products nationwide in ma tter of weeks while some insurers maintain that it can take as long as two years to obtain all the necessary state approvals for similar national insuran ce product launch glba also addressed the issue of modernizing state laws dealing with the licensing of insurance agents and brokers and made provision for federally backed licensing association the national associ ation of registered agents and brokers narab which would have come into existence three years after the date of enactment if at least 29 states failed to enact the necessary legislation for state uniformity or reciprocity following glba the requisite number of states enacted this legislation and thus the narab provi sions never came into effect the issue of insurance producer licensing reciprocity or uniformity continued however as some have continued to see problems in th actions taken by the individual states every state has not passed legislation imple menting reciprocity and even in those states that did it has not always been implemented as smoothly as desired particularly by the agents and brokers themselves7 the market after the grammleachbliley act congress passed the grammleachblile act to enhance competition among financial services providers though many observers expected banks and insurers to converge as institutions af ter it passed this has not occurred as expected in fact the major merger between large bank c itibank and large insurer travelers which actually spurred the passage of glba has effectively been undone the corporation that resulted from the merger c itigroup has divested itself of almost all of its insurance subsidiaries the property casualty divisions were sold first to the st pauls companies and the large majority of the life insurance operations were sold to metlife the only remaining sizeable bankinsurer merger is chase insurance which is part of jpmorgan chase8 although large bankinsurer mergers have not occurred as expected significant convergence has continued instead of rging across sectoral lines banks began distributing but not manufacturing insurance and insurers began creating products that closely resemble d financing consolidati on has also continued withinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32789crs5 9 see crs report rs21827 insurance regulation after the grammleachbliley act by carolyn cobb 10 us exports of

banking insurance and other fina ncial services are not an industry that produces tangible good to be shipped acr oss borders the trade in such services makes up large amount of international trade the united states has generally enjoyed surplus in trade in financial services other than insurance but in insurance services the united states has consistently run deficit with the rest of the world10 consolidations in the insurance industry ar creating larger inte rnational entities with growing market shares particularly in the reinsurance market some have speculated that the growing internationalization of the financial services industry means governments may find it difficult to reform their regulation in isolation from other jurisdictions and internati onal developments the need for single voice at the federal level to represent us insurance interests on the international stage is frequently heard argument for increased fe deral involvement in insurance regulation the european union eu our biggest trading partner in insurance services is continuing with its financial services action plan fsap comprehensive program to transform the eu into single market for financial services the eu is putting forward an updated solvency regime for insurers known as solvency 2 that is intended to parallel the basel ii capital standards for banks it is an ambitious proposal that will completely ove rhaul the way we ensure the financial soundness of our insurers we are setting worldleading standard that requires insurers to focus on managing all the risks they face and enables them to operate much more efficiently11 the eu has also adopted reinsurance directive that creates single license or passport for eu reinsurers which would enable reinsurers licensed

at httptradeeceuropaeudoclibdocs2008april tradoc_138559pdfpdfit could help improve access for european re insurers to foreign markets such as the united states13 access to the us market for insurance is significant issue of particular concern have been the state regulatory requirements that reinsurance issued by alien14 reinsurers must be backed by 100 collate ral deposited in the ited states alien reinsurers have asked state regulators to re duce this requirement to as low as 50 for insurers who meet particular criteria poi nting out among other arguments that us reinsurers do not have any co llateral requirements in many foreign countries and that the current regulations do not recognize when an alien reinsurer cedes some of the risk back to us reinsurer in the past the naic has declined to recommend collateral reduction c iting fears of unpaid claims from alien reinsurers and an inability to collect judgments in courts overseas at recent naic national meetings however the naic reinsurance task for ce has advanced proposal to ease the collateral requirements somewhat tying them to the financial strength of alien reinsurers final naic decision has not been reached on the issue and it has provoked significant controversy within the naic in addition to the reinsurance collateral debate the overall complexity of the regulatory system in the united states has been seen by some as barrier to overseas companies operating in the united states15 this complexity may also end up hindering us companies in the eu as it is not clear that state supervision of us insurers will be sufficient to allow the same single passport access to all eu countries that eu insurers will enjoy state regulatory modernization following the passage of glba state insurance regulators working through the naic embarked on an ambitious regulatory modernization program in response to both the mounting criticisms of state insurance regulation and the recognition of the growing convergence of financial services and financial services products in early 2000 naic members signed statement of intent the future of insurance regulation in which they pledged to modernize insurance regulation to meet the realities of the new financia l services marketplace and to work cooperatively with all our partners governor s state legislators federal officials consumers companies agents and other

revamping the financial regulatory structure in the united states23 wideranging document the blueprint foresees completely revamped regulatory structure for all financial services as an intermediate step it makes two specific recommendations on insurance regulation first it calls for th creation of federal insurance regulator to oversee an optional federal charter for in surers as well as federal licensing for agents and brokers second recognizing that the debate over an optional federal charter is ongoing in congress it recommends the creation of an office of insurance oversight in the department of the treasury as an interim step this office would be charged with two primary functions 1 dealing with international regulatory issues including the power to preempt inc onsistent state laws and 2 collecting information on the insurance industry and dvising the secretary of the treasury on insurance matters recent legislative activity 110th congress the national insurance act of 2007

3200 in the house on july 26 2007 these bills would create the option of federal char ter for the insurance industry including insurers insurance agencies and indepe ndent insurance producers they would create federal regulatory apparatus inside the department of the treasury and would preempt most state insurance laws thus nationally licensed insurers agencies and producers would be able to operate in the entire united states without fulfilling the requirements of each individua l 50 states insurance laws s 40 and hr 3200 also would reduce substantially the rate and form regulation

the time of this report committee action was scheduled on either bill these bills would address relatively narrow set of insurance regulatory issues where currently some see overlapping regulation by multiple states in the area of nonadmitted or surplus lines insurance the bills would harmonize and in some cases reduce regulation and taxation of this insurance by investing the home state of the insured with the sole authority to regulate and collect the taxes on surplus lines transaction those taxes that would be collected may be distributed according to future interstate compact but absent such compact their distribution would be up to the home state these bills also would preempt any state laws on surplus lines eligibility that conflict with the naic model law and would implement streamlined federal standards allowing commercial pur chaser to access surplus lines insurance for reinsurance transactions they woul d invest the home state of the insurer purchasing the reinsurance with the authority over the transaction while investing the home state of the reinsurer with the sole authority to regulate the solvency of the reinsurer26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32789crs10 27 see

structure and intent these bills modeled to some degree after the statefederal regulation in th banking industry would ve provided for an optional federal charter for the insurance industry they were similar to the bill of the same title introduced in the 110th congress and di scussed abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32789crs14 30 see httpwwwabacomabiaabia_reg_m od_pagehtm for one copy of the billalso in the 109th congress the financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government s ponsored enterprises held june 16 2005 hearing on the state modernization and regulatory transparency smart act draft bill that had originally circulated among interested parties in the latter part of 2004 one draft of the smart act compasses 17 titles nd more than 300 pages30 this draft would set up number of uniform standards in different areas including market conduct product nd producer licensing life insurance propertycasualty insurance and reinsurance while establishing that there should be uniform standards and threatening fe deral preemption if the standards are not followed the draft often leaves the exact standards to be followed to the state regulators and naic one aspect of th proposal however that is not up to the states is federal preemption of state laws requiring prior approva l of insurance rates at june 21 2006 subcommittee hearing thenchairman richard baker indicated that the smart acts comprehensive appr oach might be superseded by number of smaller bills addressing particular problems in state regulation as an example he held

direct the secretary of commerce through an independent commission within the department of commerce to protect consumers by regulating the interstate sale of insu rance and for other purposes s 1373 would have created federal commission within the department of commerce to regulate the interstate business of propertycasualty and life insurance and w ould have required federal regulation of all interstate insurers it t hus would have preempted most current state regulation of insurance except that of single state insurance companies the federal commission would have had full regulatory powers including licensure rate and form approval regulation of solvency nd regulation of market conduct s 1373 also would have repealed the antitrust exemptions in the mccarranferguson act and created federal guaranty fund s 1373 was referred to the commerce committee hearings or markups on the bill were hel d senator hollings retired following the 108th congress during the 107th congress two formal proposals were advanced providing for an optional federal charter for insurers senator charles schumer presented legislation in december 2001 which was not assigned number whilehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32789crs15 31 pl 107297 116 stat 2322 32 pl 108159 117 stat 1953representative john lafalce introduced bill in february 2002 which was designated hr 3766 as with the current national insurance act of 2006 they both were roughly modeled after the current dual statefederal regulatory system that exists for the banking industry such system llows institutions to be chartered at either state or federal level and would have enabled insurance companies to choose between state and federal re gulation there were hear ings or markups on either proposal during the 107th congress senator schumer has not introduced such bill since while representative lafalce retired following the 107th congress in addition to the legislation taking general aim at the current insurance regulatory system other proposals have had more limited impact on the system for example the terrorism risk insurance act of 200231 tria specifically endorsed state regulation of insurance wh ile it included provisions preempting state definitions of terrorism nd previous state approvals of terrorism exclusions in considering the fair and accurate cr edit transactions fact act of 200332 some would have included provisions to regula insurer usage of credit information however the final bill included only study of this usage this study was to be completed in late 2005 but wa s only delivered to congress in july 2007 tria had been set to expire at the end of 2005 and this pending expiration provoked significant legislative and lobbying activity on bill to extend tria such bill s 467 was passed in early december 2005 and signed into pl 109144 on december 22 2005 s 467 extended tria two years nd changed little in trias relatively minimal intrusion into the state insurance regulatory system the 110th congress passed another tria extension bill h r 2671 in december 2007 and it was signed into pl 110160 on december 26 2007 this bill extended tria seven years and again did not substantially change trias minimal intrusion into the state regulatory system
