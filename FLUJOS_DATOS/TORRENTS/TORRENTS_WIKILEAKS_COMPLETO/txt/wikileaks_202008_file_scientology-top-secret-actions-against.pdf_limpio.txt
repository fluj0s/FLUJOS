issued its first report on the church of scientology since that tine the nenbers of our sister churches in australia new zealand south africa england canada france germany austria switzerland denmark llol1and belgiurn spain and greece were subjected to an intelligence operation which had as its purpose the annihilation of an americanfounded religious movement we have been accused of almost everything from gunrunning drug trafficking white slave trafficking sex perversion hypnotisn brainwashing currency smuggling to connunist countries to even killing they are tired old lies we have long since been able to prove are false in 1973 we discovered by accident in germany evidence of the international circulation of false reports and imrnediately began utilization of the freedon of information act by 1978 more than 200000 docunents had been collected cross indexed filed and analyzed hundreds of foi requests were made and lawsuits filed against agencies withholding docunents thousands of nan hours were consumed in this nassive project ltle had to study intelligence tactics to understand what had happened what we found was systcnatic canrpaign of rrwell poisoningr which followed the expansion of scientology abroad in nore than 14 countries from australia in the early l960ts to france in 1978 in every instance where our church was attacked we have docunents which prove that malicious false reports rumors unproven allegations of crimes and other dirt were disseminated abroad by anerican agerii ao foreign goverrulents prior to any2 action taken against the church for long 21 years we have not only endured this deliberate and coldblooded inquisition we have continued to expand and prosper we have been threat to national security we have history of criminal activity and there has been evidence to support the outrageous lies spread by the cia fbi irs and others involved docunents we have reveal consistent tactic australia the cia funded and led an investigation on scientology which resulted in ban on us in three australian states confession by cia bag man phiffip wearne anil evidence looked into by the australian federal attorney general reversed the ban and granted scientology full religious status cia and fbi black propaganda campaign began nearly ten years before goverrunent minister placed ban on foreign scientologists entering britain without any hearing or inquiry later inquiry by sir john foster found crines and reconmended lifting the ban england south africa false reports sent from australia and england on state departnent channels as well as from other us agencies we fought an official inquiry to standstill by proving the lies false and noaction ltras taken greece ten other countries3 cia was active in spreading reports to greek govcrnncnt wlrich rcsultcld ilt tlto cxlrulslon of tt sclontology truining slrlll urxl forcctl lt out itttl major storm with engine trouble the greek govern nent later apologized and retracted the expulsion order continued dissemination of false information by cia fbi irs fda and others is steadily poisoning the well to create suspicion distrust and eventually bring about investigations after 16 years of black propaganda activities at home which we are currently analyzing in detai and ten years of known intelligence operations against us abroad in 1966 we forned guardianrs 0ffice whose major purpose was to forward our social reforn programs and of course protect our beliefs we have survived the ordeal and continued to prosper in the teeth of this continuing professional intelligence operation the current actions by justice departnent are but another step in long battle the prospect of few individuals serving or not serving sentences is noissue since future history is the only judge of the impact of scientology as the emergent socioreligious movenent of the century the governnent has spent more than 100 million dollars of taxpayersl noney trying to eliminate us while billions of dollars worth of heroin was being successfully shipped into the united states from france over twentyyeax period by an allied intelligence organization we broke story on this just prior to the july l977 fbi raid just why is this country infested with4 drugs lhc fbi ills and cia attacks on thosc listcd on nixonrsrrncmy listl has forced those organizations to either collapse or to defend themselves they can longer peacefully exist the failure of the justice department to clean its own house and the houses of the fbi irs cia fda et has resulted in parts of society beingalienated from the government investi gations of few congresstnen who have done wrong but will only be on post for four years is laudable but the failure of justice department to indict crininal fbi agents who will continue on for the duration of their careers is tragic the fbi cast the first stone at us even as we were becoming religion nearly three decades ago now at last wecan prove their intentions and their methods and we can prove that our difficutties were part of campaign of bloodless genocide there is doubt that we will win the current battle and achieve overwhalming support it
