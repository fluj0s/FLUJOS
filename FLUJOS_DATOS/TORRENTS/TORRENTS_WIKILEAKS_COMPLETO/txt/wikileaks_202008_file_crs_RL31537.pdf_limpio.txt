the united states after eight years summary the north american free trade agreement nafta among the united states canada and mexico went into effect on january 1 1994 it is the first trade agreement the united states has entered into with geographicallyclose developing country and has raised concerns about its economic effect particularly on us communities and workers since the mid1980s when mexico began reducing trade restrictions the us and mexican economies have become more highly integrated this is evidenced by the rapid growth in us merchandise trad with mexico which is now 12 of all us trade up from 8 in 1993 and 6 in 1988 and especially by the growth of intraindustry and intrafirm trade this growing integration s by reducing costs made the us economy and particularly the mexican economy more productive and globally competitive greater integr ation of the us and mexican economies probably would have occurred without the nafta but the nafta by improving business confidence in mexico may have accelerated the process the us foreign direct investment positi on in mexico grew more rapidly before 1994 than after probably in anticipation of nafta although growing significantly us foreign direct investment in mexico is still relatively small accounting for 28 of all us foreign direct investment abroad in 2000 us flows of direct investment to mexico of 35 billion in 2000 are also very small compared with us domestic investment in us plant and equipment of 1362 billion it is estimated that nafta caused j ob dislocation for about 415000 workers between january 1 1994 and december 31 2001 about 34 of whom were in the textile and apparel i ndustry and 5 in the automotive industry the number of us workers dislocated by nafta over eight years is less than 1 of the 1343 million us workers employed in 2001 nevertheless study published in augu st 2001 by the us general accounting office of six communities who were rdhit by job dislocation from nafta illustrates the need for imp roving the skills and job opportunities of dislocated workers generally dislocated workers d less education than the us workforce as whole and many had limited english language skills these case studies suggest that in the past trade adjustment assistance programs did not meet the needs of the workers in these communities the trade act of 2002 includes provisions that may improve the effectiveness of trade adjustment assistance overall the nafta has had relativ ely small effect on the us economy future free trade agreements between the united states and other countries which are not major us trading partners and are geographically further away will likely have an even smaller effect on the us economy this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537contents

states central amer ican nations may launch trade talks by end of 2002 international trade reporter june 20 2002 p 1099nafta economic effects on the united states after eight years introduction the north american free trade agreement nafta among the united states canada and mexico went into effect on january 1 1994 after wellpublicized debate by the public and the congress the primary fear of naftas opponents was that the united states would lose jobs as corporations shifte d production to mexico where wage rates are substantially less and labor standards are not always enforced ross perot coined the term the giant suck ing sound of us jobs going to mexico phrase that resonated with the american public at the same time the clinton administration focused on the large number of jobs that might be created by nafta which it was claimed would expa nd us exports to mexico there are two basic reasons for analyzing the economic effects of nafta at this time first many people are still apprehensive and concerned about nafta two recent polls tell the story one question in 1999 poll was do you think the nafta has been good or bad for the united states1 the responses were 44 good 30 bad 7 neither and 19 don t know in poll taken in 2001 one question was do you think america shoul d continue the nafta agreement pull out of nafta or should the nafta be continued with changes2 the responses were 28 continue nafta 14 pull out of nafta 37 change nafta and 21 undecided second since proposals to expand and deep nafta are being discussed the lessons learned from nafta may be helpfu

agreement among the united states and costa rica salvador guatemala honduras and caragua in january 2002 reportedly the united states and the five central amer ican countries may begin ne gotiations

for action cd howe institute commentary 162 april 2002 p 1mexican economic growth4 others have suggested measures such as common external tariff coordination of regulatory systems and freer movement of citizens among the three nafta partners one canadian analyst suggested that deeper integration is necessary to prevent border cl osings for security reasons such as that in the immediate aftermath of septem ber 11 2001 which imposed an economic hardship on canada5 the purpose of this report is to examine the available data to determine naftas economic effect on the united stat the two questions addressed are how has nafta affected the us economy what is the magnitude of the effect the data studied include trade both mercha ndise and services flows foreign direct investment and the number of us wo rkers certified as having lost or been threatened with the loss of their jobs as result of nafta proxy for job dislocation selected case studies of us communities adversely affected by plant relocations to mexico are summarized this report focuses more on the us trade and investment relationship with mexico than with canada the nafta is the first major trade agreement the united states has had with geographicallyclo developing country where per capita income is much lower than in the unite d states in 2000 mexicos per capita gdp was about 6000 compared to 35000 in the united states issues of concern in us trade with mexico such as lower mexican wages are not relevant to us trade with canada where the two economies are quite similar the main findings of this report are since the late 1980s when mexico bega n reducing trade restrictions the us and mexican economies have become much more highly integrated this is evidenced by the rapid growth in us trade with mexico and especially by the growth of intraindustry and intrafirm trade this growing integration has by reducing costs made the us economy and particularly the mexican economy more productive and globally comp etitive greater integration of the us and mexican economies in fact was happening before the nafta but the nafta by improving business confidence in mexico may have accelerated the process between january 1 1994 and december 31 2001 about 415000 us workers have suffered job dislocation as resu lt of usmexican economic integration although this number is very small relative to the size of the us workforce it may have imposed significant economic hardship on those workers and their families who have lost jobshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs3 6hinojosaojeda et the us employment impacts of north american integration after nafta partial equilibrium approach school of public policy and social research continuedeconomic benefits and costs of free trade generally when trade restrictions such as tariffs and quotas are reduced in free trade agreement the economies of all participating countries benefit over time freer trade allows each country to specialize in producing those goods in which it has comparative advantage each economy may also benefit from lower production costs per unit as it produces for larger market or by trades stimulation of technological developments consumers can choose from wider variety of products and greater competition leads to higher quality goods at lower prices the costs of liberalizing trade generally fall to the workers and industries whose products are longer competitive they are forced to adjust sometimes very painfully as domestic plants close or relocate to other countries the benefits of free trade generally exceed the costs the benefits however are widely distributed over the entire population and as result each persons gain is quite small in contrast the costs are borne by relatively few people but may be huge for those workers and their families who have lost jobs both the benefits of the nafta incr eased trade and investment and enhanced global competitiveness and the costs job dislocations are very small relative to the size of the us economy background an implicit goal of the nafta was to increase economic integration among the three partner countries by increasing trilateral trade and investment which in turn was expected to raise each countrys productivity and global competitiveness in analyzing the naftas effect however it is important to recognize that economic integration between the united states and its nafta partners had been underway for some time before the nafta was negotiated crossborder integration of production resulted from market forces in which businesses to be competitive had to devise cost saving strategies such as shifting part of their production abroad and by government policies and bilateral agreements that reduced trade restrictions the economies of the united states and cana da in particular have been highly integrated for long time the automo tive agreement of 1965 between canada and the united states eliminated tariffs on shipments of autos and auto parts between the two countries which allowed costs avings from crossborder production of automobiles the uscanada free trade agreement fta which went into effect on january 1 1989 phased out b ilateral tariffs over 10y ear period consequently when the nafta superceded the fta in 1994 most uscanadian tariffs were already eliminated or very low in the mid1980s mexico dramatically re versed its trade po licies by unilaterally liberalizing many tariff and nont ariff barriers the extent of the liberalization was actually greater than the reductions in trade barriers in the nafta6 at that timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs4 6continued ucla january 2000 p 38 7the nafta includes chapters on investment services intellectual property protection government procurement agriculture energy

locked in the trade reforms of the previous decade in mexico7 by making it less likely that the mexican government can reverse its previous trade and investment liberalizations many argue that business confidence in mexico improved there are several reasons why naftas effect on the us economy would be expected to be small first from an economic perspective the relationship among the three countries is very asymmetric as shown in figure 1 mexicos gdp in 2001 of 618 billion was only 6 that of the united states of 10208 billion even canadas 2001 gdp of 682 billion was only 7 of us gdp

and have continued to decline under the canadaus free trade agreement which was superceded by the nafta some tariffs were eliminated on january 1 1989 and the rest phased out over 5 or 10 ears by january 1 1999 virtually all uscanadian tariffs had been eliminated when the nafta went into force in 1994 half of us exports to mexico became dutyfree while the remaining half were to be phased out over 5 10 or 15 years by january 1 2001 the average xican tariff on us products had declined from 10 to 127 while the average us tariff on mexican products had declined from 4 to

3figure 3 us merchandise trade with canada and mexicoanalysis of merchandise trade trends figure 3 shows the trends in us exports to and imports from mexico and canada since 1988 generally us trad with mexico has been increasing faster than us trade with canada since 1988 but the rate of increase accelerated from 1994 the year nafta went into effect to 2001 more specifically from 1988 to 1993 us trade increased by 86 with mexico 38 with canada and 37 with the world even in the pre nafta period then us trade with mexico was increasing faster than with canada or with the world from 1993 to 2001 us trade increased 185 with mexico 79 with canada and 79 with the world again the increase in trade with mexico far exceeded that with canada and with the world as result us trade with mexico acc ounted for 12 of all us trade in 2001 up from 8 in 1993 and 6 in 1988 by cont rast us trade w ith canada remained at about 20 of all us trade since 1988 it should be emphasized that the rapid growth in us merchandise trade with mexico occurred since nafta not necessar ily because of nafta other factors especially the high economic growth pe riod of the 1990s followed by the global economic downturn in 1991 the pesodollar exchange rate and the growing amount of trade in intermediate goods discussed more fully later contributed to changing trade flows although difficult to quan tify several recent studies have used econometric methods in an attempt to isol ate the effects of nafta on usmexican trade most studies found that nafta had small but positive effect on trade growth9 generally in such studies changes in gdp had much greater effect on us exports to and imports from mexico than did nafta the 1995 peso crisis in mexico had large effect on trade in that year the peso depreciated 47 against the us dollar in 1995 the year after nafta went into effect making us imports from mexico much cheaper and us exports to mexicohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs7 10mutti john

in 1996 and almost 7 in 1997 strong economic activity in all three countries contributed to the substantial growth of trade in the late 1990s trade creation trade diversion and the dynamic effects of trade the growing share of mexico in us trade raises the question of whether nafta has led to trade creation or trade di version trade creation occurs when the removal of trade restrictions in regional trade agreement increases the flow of trade between the trading partners because it beco mes more efficient to trade some products than produce them domestically economists believe that trade creation improves economic welfare of both the trading partne rs and the world trade diversion on the other hand occurs when country imports from the trade agreement partner because the tariff removal has made the product cheaper even though firm in nontrade agreement country can produce the product mo re efficiently in other words by reducing tariffs among few trading partners and not others trade could be diverted from the nonparticipating count ry which may be the more efficient producer to the trade agreement partner economists ar gue that trade diversion worsens economic welfare it is not possible to measure the magnitude of trade creation or trade diversion with any degree of precision several studi however indicate that trade creation exceeds trade diversion among the nafta partners10 the majority of us industries whose exports to mexico have grown most rapidly are those in which the united states has comparative advantage such as capital goods similarly us import growth has been fastest in mexican labor intensive industries where mexico has comparative advantage preliminary data from one study suggests that trade diversion is occurring with respect to us imports from mexico versus the rest of the world11 significant amount of trade diversion is most likely ccurring in the textile s and apparel sector partly because the rules of origin established in the nafta for this sector tend to favor trade within the nafta countries12 fears of trade diversion may have couraged some nonnafta countries to negotiate trade agreements with mexico for example the european unionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs8 13mutti op cit p 2 14organization for economic cooperation and deve lopment intraindustry and intrafirm trade and the internationalisation of production oecd economic outlook 71 june 2002 p 161 negotiated free trade agreement with mexico after its share of mexican imports fell from 15 in 1990 to 12 in 1993 and 9 in 1999 13 in addition to the shortterm static eff ects of trade creation and trade diversion the nafta may also generate positive longterm dynamic effects it is likely that the longterm dynamic benefits are greater in magnitude than the tradecreating or trade diverting effects of nafta achieving longterm dynamic eff ects was probably the most important economic cons ideration when the united states canada and mexico agreed to negotiate the nafta there are three main longterm dynamic effects first as producers face increased competition they are likely to beco more efficient in fact mexicos goal of making its economy more efficien t was one of the incentives for negotiating nafta second being able to sell to larger market enables firms in nafta countries to take advantag of economies of scale in which the per unit cost of production falls as output increases economies of scale might arise from one countrys being able to concentrate on pa rticular size or model of product and were important considerations in canadas negotiating its free trade agreement with the united states in 1988 finally the nafta and anticipation of the nafta attracted foreign investment from nonnaf ta countries whose firms wanted to produce within the nafta area to take advantage of the areas lower trade barriers foreign direct investment from nonnafta c ountries to mexico increased during the years immediately preceding nafta integration of the us and mexican economies even before nafta was negotiated us companies were in the process of internationalizing pr oduction to become more compe titive globally in many cases this meant locating part of their production processes in mexico to take advantage of lower wages which were only partly offset by lower productivity as discussed earlier such shifts were facilitated by mexicos unilateral reduction in trade barriers and the nafta which made it less likely that mexico could revert to higher tariffs and nontariff barriers one way of estimating the extent to which production has become more integrated is to examine changes in intra industry trade between the united states and mexico as crossborder pr oduction increased it would be expected that exports and imports of similar products i ntraindustry trade would so increase according to an oecd study intraindustry manufact uring trade in 19962000 accounted for 73 of manufacturing trade in mexico up from 62 in 1988199114 the oecd study credits the nafta which strengthened mexicos trading links with the united states as contributor to mexicos growing intraindustry tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs9 15ibid p 165 16us department of commerce operations of us multinational companies survey of current business march 2002 p 37 17for more detailed analysis see

machinery and chemi cals us department of commerce data show that from 1989 to 1999 u s majorityowned affiliates exports to mexico including exports to affiliate s and nonaffiliates n early doubled to 9 of all us exports by majorityowned affiliates to the world16 in contrast canadas share at 21 of all us exports rema ined about the same mexicos increased share according to the department of co mmerce reflected the growing presence of foreign affiliates of us parent firms in mexico as well as the higher mexican tariffs prior to nafta since high proportion of usmexican trad is intraindustry or intrafirm trade total us exports to mexico can be expected to grow at about the same rate as us imports from mexico looking again at figu re 3 it can be seen that us exports to and imports from mexico are fairly well correlated as are us exports to and imports from canada where the economies have been integrated for quite while one of the implications then of increased integra tion of production is that when the us economy slows not only will us imports fro m mexico and canada decline but us exports of components to mexico and cana da will also decrease this may account for some of the decline in both us expor ts to and imports fro m mexico and canada in 2001 shown in figure 3 the decline in growth of us gdp to 11 and the negative growth of 06 for mexican gdp in 2001 also contributed to the decline in us exports and imports the five us industry sectors with the greatest volume of trade with mexico and canada are automotive che micals and allied products com puter equipment textiles and apparel and microelectronics17 not surprisingly these sectors are also heavily involved in intraindustry trade fo r mexico alone between 1993 and 2001 us trade exports plus imports in all five sectors grew faster than us trade with the world18 bilateral automotive trade by far the largest of the five sectors in absolute terms grew 254 compared with 72 for the world in computer equipment the growth was especially large usmexico trade grew 553 while us trade with the world grew 80 in contrast us trade with canada grew slower than us trade with the world in all of the sectors except textiles and apparelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs10 figure 4 us merchandise trade balances with canada and mexicous merchandise trade balan ces with canada and mexico as figure 4 indicates the united states had merchandise trade deficit with both mexico and canada in almost every year since 1988 the trade deficit grew substantially in 1995 probably in response to the mexican peso crisis since 1999 the trade deficit has been especially large and surprisingly the deficit with canada has been larger than that with mexico in 2001 the us trade deficit was 53 billion with canada and 30 billion with mexico the 14 appreciation of the us dollar against the canadian dollar since 1996 likely contributed to the worsening us trade deficit with ca as the dollar appreciates us imports increase because the price in dollar declines and us exports increase as the price in foreign currencies increases for perspective it is interesting to compare the us trade deficit with canada and mexico with the total us trade defi cit in 2001 the us trade deficit with canada and mexico was 83 billion about 20 of the us trade deficit of 411 billion with the world moreover the us trade deficit with the world is growing faster than the us trade deficit with ca and mexico since 1996 the us trade deficit with canada and mexico has increased 112 wh ile the us trade deficit with the world has increased 142 this ggests that factors other than nafta especially strong us economy have b een the driving forces behind the growing us trade deficit with canada and

merchandise exports to mexico of 101 billion20 us private servicesimports from mexico were 11 billion while us merchandise imports from mexico were 136 billion private services trade fluctuated quite bit over the 19882000 period there was noticeable drop in us services exports to mexico in 1995 probably reflecting the peso crises of that year for example the depreciation of the peso and the decline in mexican gdp in 1995 likely reduced the number of mexicans traveling to the border to purchase us goods generally us services trade exports plus imports with mexico increased more in the prenafta period from 1988 to 1993 than since 1993 us services trade with mexico increased 79 from 1988 to 1993 and 40 from 19932000 the pattern for us services trade with cana da and the world was just the opposite the growth rate was greater for 1993 to 2000 than for 1988 to 1993 unlike merchandise trade the united states had surplus in services trade with mexico and canada in almost all years

data in u s department of commerce survey of current business various issuesfigure 6 us direct investment abroadnot surprisingly given their geographi c proximity and the significant amount of crossborder tourism and business travel the largest category of services trade with the nafta partners is travel passenger fa res and other transportation in 2000 this category represented close to 50 of us services exports to mexico and canada for us services imports the amounts ar much higher 66 for canada and 81 for mexico the next highest category was ther services us exports of other services exceeded us imports of other rvices by considerable amount to both mexico and canada in 2000 us services are also provided in mexico through affiliates of us multinational firms although the amounts are relatively small such sales have been growing rapidly for example in 1999 the latest data available sales to us affiliates in mexico were 48 billion up from 13 billion in 1993 growth of 269 this growth rate was much greater than for us services sales through affiliates in canada 84 and in the world 137 foreign direct investment the us foreign direct investment f di position the cumulative

somewhat lower but still high rate after nafta went into effect from 1993 to 2000 the latest da ta available the us fdi position in mexico grew 133 in contrast from 1993 to 2000 us direct investment in canada and the world grew 81 and 121 respectively greater than during the period preceding nafta despite fairly rapid grow th rates especially in the prenafta period the amount of us direct investment in mexico is currently small relative to total us direct investment abroad in 2000 the us direct investment position in mexico was 354 billion only 28 of us fdi in all countries of 12447

2000 was only 102 of the total us fdi down from 187 in 1988 about 58 of all us fdi in mexico was in the manufacturing sector in 2000 food products transportation equipment and chemicals account for almost 70 of us manufacturing investment in mexico examining us direct investment flows to mexico shows that they are very small relative to us domestic investment the amount of new us fdi in mexico was 46 billion in 1998 51 billion in 1999 and 35 billion in 2000 by comparison us domestic investment in us pl ant and equipment was 13622 billion in 200023 employment the argument that nafta destroys us jobs resonates strongly with the public it is indeed true that nafta has resulted in the elimination of some us jobs especially in the textile nd apparel and food pr oducts sectors at the same time nafta has created new jobs as exports to mexico in the capital goods and new economy industries increased on balance it is likely that naftas net effect on us employment is close to zero however nafta has pr obably affected the composition of jobs in the us economy as the demand for unskilled workers declined while the demand fo r skilled workers increased unfortunately there are available data bases to measure or estimate the number and types of jobs created by nafta as will be discussed below it is possible to roughly estimate the number of workers dislocated as result of nafta this section examines the job dislocation caused by nafta from two perspectives first the available data show that the estimated number of jobs lost is relatively small compared to total us employment second veral case studies of the effect of naftainduced job loss on several communities are described it is clear that while job dislocation may be small relative to aggregate employment the hardships faced by those workers and commun ities that lose jobs is serious concern this section concludes with brief discussion of naftas effect on job security in the united states job dislocation relative to total us employment the implementing legislation for the nafta pl 103182 included transitional adjustment assistance taa program which provides employment services training income support and job search and relocation allowances to eligible workers to receive benefits workers must be certified by the us secretary of the labor as having lost their jobs or threatened with job loss by increased

number of dislocated workers on the other hand since some firms and workers may not know of the taa program or that their displacement results from nafta the data may understate the number of dislocated workers consequently these data shoul d not be considered definitive measure of job dislocation but rather an indicati on of the magnitude of naftarelated job losses although clearly imperfect they ar the best available data on job dislocation in the eight years ending decembe r 31 2001 414761 workers were covered by certification of which 34 were in the tex tiles and appare l industry nd 5 in the automotive industry24 by comparison total us employment in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 1343 million workers25 thus the 414761 workers certified over eight years is relatively small bout three tenths of of total us employment of 1343 million the number of dislocated nafta work ers is also very small relative to the total number of unemployed workers in the united states the 414761 workers covered by certification ove r eight years is about 6 of the 67 million unemployed in 2001 this suggests that the effects of nafta are swamped by macroeconomic trends in the us economy in recent study it is estimate d that nafta has eliminated 766030 job opportunities in the united st ates between 1994 and 2000 b ecause of the growing trade deficit with mexico and canada26 most economists disagree with the methodology used in making this estimate27 nevertheless assuming the estimate is realistic the number of job oppor tunities lost is still relativ ely small about six tenths of percent of total us employment job dislocation in sel ected us communities according to the naftataa program from january 1 1994 to december 31 2001 3331 us plants were closed as result of import competition from nafta or production shifts to xico of these 1549 plants involving 210621 workers were certified as eligible because of production shifts to mexico this section summarizes the

and eligibility criteria in title i of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 116 stat 933 which was signed into law by president bush on august 6 2002 the problems facing dislocated workers and the problems inherent in existing attempts to aid such workers recent case study by the us genera l accounting office gao included six us communities that were especially hardhit by traderelated layoffs since the mid 1990s28 the six communities were watsonville california coushatta louisiana owosso michigan washington and chocowinity north carolina paso texas and martinsville and henry county virginia the purpose of the study was to examine the impact of traderelated layoffs on the communities and their experience with trade adjustment assistance most of the layoffs were in the apparel electronics furniture and food processing industries yoffs attributed to nafta were not separately identified but it can be assumed since data from the naftataa program were used that many of the layoffs were due to import competition or plant relocation to mexico of the six communities paso texa s had 17069 workers certified as eligible by naftataa since 1994 of 6000 workers laid off in mar tinsville and henry county virginia since 1993 3500 were certified by naftataa washington and chocowinity north carolina lost 1500 jobs in the 199799 period all the other communities lost fewer than 1000 jobs since 1994 workers affected by the layoffs in these six communities had less education than the us workforce as whole eighty percent of the trade adjustment assistance participants in the six communities had hi gh school education or less compared to 42 in the us workforce many of the workers had limited english language skills the majority of workers were in their 40s and women accounted for twothirds of the unemployed generally the workforces were not suited to the new economy jobs and therefore local government officials coul d not easily attract such industries to the area the layoffs caused dramatic rise in the unemployment rate in the six communities local government tax revenues declined affecting the services that could be provided retail sales dropped as workers had less money to spend business suppliers or contractors to the plants that closed were also adversely affected many of the workers found new jobs in the area but often at lower wage an important lesson from the gao study is that current trade adjustment assistance is not meeting the needs of the workers in these communities the requirement that separate taa the trade adjustment assistance program that is not directly related to nafta and naftataa accounts be maintained is administratively inefficient and confusing29 since dislocated workers receive income support for l8 months and training benef its for 24 months they often drop out of training after 18 months httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs16 30a town out of work globalization takes toll on industries seattle times may 11 2002 p a3 31more job loss

the companys louisiana director of manuf acturing was quoted as saying it was strictly business decision these people are hardworking and they helped build holloway the ohiobased manufacturer but unfortunately due to nafta we cant compete effect on job security while the number of plant relocations to mexico appears to be relatively small some argue that many employers use the threat of moving production to mexico at the bargaining table in organizing union drives and in wage negotia tions with individual workers in this respect then nafta may be increasing the economic insecurity among us workers kate bronfenbrenne r director of labor education research at cornell universitys school of industrial and labor relations researched this issue she found that in national labor relations board nlrb certification elections more than 50 of employers made threats to close all or part of the plant during the organizing drive32 by comparison in the late 1980s only 29 of employers made plant closing threats during nlrb campaigns also it is possible that threats to close plants prevented union organizing drives from getting underway conclusions us merchandise trade with mexico pecially intraindustry and intrafirm trade increased more ra pidly since 1994 than in the prenafta period and now accounts for 12 of us merchandise trad this suggests that the process of economic integration of th two economies which began prior to 1994 strengthened after 1994 the nafta by improving business expectations probably played significant role in the growth of trade and investment since 1988 given mexicos trade liberalization in the 1980s however economic integration probably would have occurred without nafta although more slowlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31537crs17 us trade and investment with mexico will probably continue to grow but in the near future its effect on the large us econom will remain relativel small at some point the process of us economic integr ation with mexico will likely slow down as it did with canada us merchandise trade with ca has remained at 20 of total us trade for some time the experience of the nafta suggests that future free trade agreements between the united states and other countries will have small effect on the us economy if integra tion with close geographical partners like mexico and canada has small effect on the united states it is likely that trade agreements with more distant countries w ill have an even smaller effect on the us economy growing economic integration between the united states and mexico has increased productivity and efficiency for the us economy these benefits are small however especially when distributed over the entire population the costs of economic integration are disp roportionately borne by the workers who lose jobs and the communities in which they live the low level of education and skills of the dislocated workers makes it difficult for them to be retrained in short period of time from policy perspective central issue is that in the past trade adjustment assistance programs have not been very effective in helping workers gain new skills or find new employment congress has attempted to remedy this deficiency in title 1 of the trade act of 2002 which includes ch anges to the trade adjustment assistance program
