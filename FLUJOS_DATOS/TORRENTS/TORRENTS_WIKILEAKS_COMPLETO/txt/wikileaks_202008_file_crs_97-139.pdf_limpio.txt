enforcement tool congress and state legislatures have authorized its use for over two hundred years every year it redirects property worth hundreds of millions of dollars from criminal to lawful uses forfeiture law has always been somewhat unique legislative bodies commentators and the courts however had begun to examine its eccentricities in greater detail because under some circumstances it could be not only harsh but unfair the civil asset forfeiture reform act pl 106185 114 stat 202 2000 is product of that reexamination modern forfeiture follows one of two procedural routes although crime triggers all forfeitures they are classified as civil forfeitures or crim inal forfeitures according to the nature of the procedure which ends in confiscation civil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding the property is the defendant in the case unless the statute provides otherwise the innocence of the owner is irrelevantit is enough that the property was involved in violation to which forfeiture attaches as matter of expedience and judicial economy congress often allows administrative forfeiture in uncontested civil confiscation cases criminal forfeiture is an in personam proceeding and confiscation is only possible upon the conviction of the owner of the property the supreme court has held that authorities may seize moveable property without prior notice or an opportunity for hearing but that real property owners are entitled as matter of due process to preseizure notice and the chance for hearing as matter of due process innocence may be irrelevant in the case of an individual who entrusts his or her property to someone who uses the property for criminal purposes although some civil forfeitures may be considered punitive for purposes of the eighth amendments excessive fines clause civil forfeitures do not implicate the fifth amendments double jeopardy clause unless they are so utterly punitive as to belie remedial classification the statutes governing the disposal of forfeited property may authorize destruction of property or transfer for governmental purposes or deposit of the property or the proceeds from its sale in special fund intergovernmental transfers and the use of special funds are hallmarks of federal forfeiture every year federal agencies transfer hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property to state and local

been somewhat unique its increased use has highlighted its eccentricities and attendant policy concerns present forfeiture law has its roots in early english law it is reminiscent of three early english procedures deodands forfeiture of estate or common law forfeiture and statutory or commercial forfeiture2 at early common law the object that caused the death of human being the ox that gored the knife that stabbed or the cart that crushed was confiscated as deodand3 coroners inquests and grand juries bound with the duty to determine the cause of death were obligated to identify the offending object and determine its value as well4 the crown distributed the proceeds realized from the confiscation of the animal or deadly object for religious and charitable purposes in the name of the deceased5 although deodands were not unknown in the american colonies6 they appear to have fallen into disuse or been abolished by the time of the american revolution or shortly thereafter7 in spite of their limited use in this country deodands and the practice of treating the offending animal or object as the defendant have frequently been cited to illustrate the characteristics of modern civil forfeiture8 1 forfeiture is the loss of any right ordinarily property right as consequence of breach of some legal obligation black s law dictionary 667 8th ed 2004 discussion in this report is

solely on human offender at common law anyone convicted and attained for treason or felony forfeited all his lands and personal property9 attainder the judicial declaration of civil death occurred as consequence of the pronouncement of final sentence for treason or felony10 in colonial america common law forfeitures were rare11 after the revolution the constitution restricted the use of common law forfeiture in cases of treason and congress restricted its use by statute in the case of other crimes 12 the third antecedent of modern forfeiture statut ory or commercial forfeiture figured prominently in cases in admiralty and on the revenue side of the exchequer in precolonial england13 it was used fairly extensively against smuggling and other revenue evasion schemes in the american colonies and has been used ever since14 in most instances the statutes have called for in rem confiscation proceedings in which as with deodands the offending object is the defendant occasionally they have established in personam procedures where confiscation occurs as the result of the conviction of the owner of the property15 although contemporary american forfeiture law owes much to the law of deodands and the law of forfeiture of estate it is clearly descendant of english statutory or commercial forfeiture16 9 1 h ale history of the pleas of the crown 35467 1778 1 c hitty practical

patterns concerning the crimes that trigger forfeiture the property subject to confiscation and the procedures associated with forfeiture the federal forfeiture statutes are matters of legislative choice and can vary greatly17 virtually every kind of property real or personal tangible or intangible may be subject to confiscation under the appropriate circumstances18 the laws that call for the confiscation of contraband per property whose very possession has been outlawed were at one time the most prevalent and can still be found19 property particularly vehicles used to facilitate the commission of crime and without which violation would be less likely has also long been the target of confiscatory statutes20 in some instances congress has upon the profits of crime authorized the confiscation of the direct and indirect proceeds of illegal activities21 and under some circumstances it has authorized the forfeiture of substitute assets when the tainted property subject to confiscation under particular statute has become unavailable22 continued in the enforcement of english and local forfeiture statutes which provided for the forfeiture of commodities and vessels used in violation of the customs and revenue laws and almost immediately after adoption of the constitution ships and cargoes involved in customs offenses were made subject to forfeiture under federal law as were vessels used to deliver slaves to foreign countries and somewhat later those used to deliver slaves to this country the enactment of forfeiture statutes has not abated contemporary federal and state forfeiture statutes reach virtually any type of property that might be used in the conduct of criminal enterprise 416 us at 68283 citations and footnotes omitted calerotoledo however was written

threatened the governments revenue interest eg smuggling tax evasion hunting or fishing without license or those crimes which because of their perceived threat to public health or morals might have been considered public nuisances subject to abatement eg gambling or dealing in obscene material or illicit drug use beginning with the racketeering statutes number of jurisdictions have created another category of forfeiture warranting offenses crimes that involve substantial economic gain for the defendant even if not at the expense of government revenues but which may greatly enhance government revenues eg racketeering and money laundering23 prime example of this approach is the civil asset forfeiture reform act cafra24 which makes forfeitable the proceeds from any of the crimes upon which m oney laundering or rico prosecution might be based25 following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 congress authorized the confiscation of another type of crimerelated property

process that is buried in those statutes another source of potential abuse is that the forfeited funds are kept by the department of justice as supplement to its budget thus the agency that conceives the jurisdiction and ground for seizures and executes them also absorbs their proceeds this arrangement creates incentives that evidently require morethanhuman judgment and restraint the supreme court has politely remarked on the department of justices direct pecuniary interest in maximizing drug forfeitures to meet the departments budget target see united states v james daniel good real property

forfeiture follows one of three procedural routes although crime triggers all forfeitures they are classified as civil forfeitures or criminal forfeitures according to the nature of the judicial procedure which ends in confiscation or administrative forfeitures if confiscation occurs without judicial proceedings civil forfeiture is ordinarily the product of ci vil in rem proceeding in which the property is treated as the offender27 within the confines of due process and the language of the applicable statutes the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant it is enough that the property was involved in violation to which forfeiture attaches in the manner in which statute demands28 criminal forfeiture proceedings on the other hand are in personam proceedings and confiscation is only possible upon the conviction of the owner of the property29 and only to the extent of defendants interest in the property30 historically most forfeiture statutes called for civil forfeiture the procedure for forfeiture varies according to the statute which authorizes confiscation although each usually contains few procedural features the drug money laundering and several other civil forfeiture statutes fill in their procedural gaps by crossreference to the regime established under the customs laws31 cafra contains generally applicable procedures and thus reduces the extent to which civil forfeiture procedural matters are resolved by reference solely to the customs laws 32 continued at footnote 16 supra at first glance the two seem to resemble common law forfeiture of estate 27 this civil forfeiture proceeding is in rem it is the property which is proceeded against and by resort to legal fiction held guilty and condemned as though it were conscious instead of

addressed sometimes controversial adoptive forfeitures71 adoptive forfeiture occurs when property is forfeitable under federal law and the department of justice adopts for processing under federal law forfeiture case brought to it by state or local law enforcement officials and in which the united states is not otherwise involved federal adoption is sometimes attractive because of the speed afforded by federal administrative forfeiture it may also be attractive because forfeiture would be impossible or more difficult under state law or because law enforcement agencies would not share as extensively in the bounty of successful forfeiture under state law the circumvention restriction is longer in effect but the treasury and justice departments insist that state and local law enforcement agencies indicate the law enforcement purposes to which the transferred property is to be devoted and that the transfer will increase and not supplant law enforcement resources 72

when only civil forfeiture was otherwise authorized more recently the bridge statute has been amended to permit criminal forfeiture whenever civil forfeiture is authorized regardless of whether an alternative criminal forfeiture authorization exists elsewhere thus the bridge statute 28 usc 2461c permits confiscation using its criminal forfeiture procedure as an alternative whenever civil forfeiture is authorized84 like civil forfeiture criminal forfeiture is creature of statute unlike civil forfeiture criminal forfeiture falls as consequence of conviction85 it is punishment even though it may also serve remedial purposes very effectively86 while civil forfeiture treats the property as the defendant confiscating the interests of the innocent and guilty alike criminal forfeiture traditionally consumes only the property interests of the convicted defendant87 and only with respect to the crime for which he is convicted88 when the property subject to confiscation is unavailable following the defendants conviction however the court may order the confiscation of other property belonging to the defendant in its stead substitute assets89 the indictment or information upon which the conv iction is based must list the property which the government asserts is subject to confiscation90 and the defendant is entitled to jury finding of the necessary connection between the crime of conviction and the property to be confiscated91 continued the offense of which the person is convicted b the court in imposing sentence on person described in subparagraph shall order

of the res it need not be seized before forfeiture is declared92 although the courts are authorized to issue pretrial restraining orders to prevent depletion or transfer of property which the government contends is subject to confiscation93 many are hesitant to issue pretrial restraining orders covering substitute property94 and there may be some lingering uncertainty as to whether such orders can be issued when the government has opted to use the good offices of the bridge statute95 to accomplish what would otherwise be civil forfeiture in conjunctio n with the criminal prosecution of the property owner originally section 2461c permitted criminal forfeiture under statutes that authorized civil forfeiture but made provision for criminal forfeiture96 in such cases it declared that

that section 28 usc 2461c 2000 ed section 853e then as now authorized pretrial restraining orders so it might seem that they should be available in section 2461 cases not so said the second circuit in section 2461c cases the federal rules of criminal procedure which do not include authority to issue pretrial restraining orders govern prior to conviction only after conviction does section 853 dictate the procedural path 97 the court found confirmation of its view by contrasting the language of section 2461c with that 18 usc 982 which the courts have concluded does authorize such pretrial restraining orders section 982 states that the forfeiture of property under this section including any seizure and disposition of property and any related judicial or administrative proceeding shall

conviction the court shall order the forfeiture of the property in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 85399 shortly thereafter the current version of section 2461c appeared unexplained in the conference report on the bill subsequently enacted as the usa pa triot improvement and reauthorization act100 the new language permits criminal forfeiture under the procedures of section 2461c whenever civil forfeiture is authorized regardless of whether the statute that authorizes the civil forfeiture also authorizes criminal forfeiture under different procedures 101 it thus permits the government to elect to use section 2461cs criminal forfeiture procedures even where alternative criminal forfeiture procedures were already av ailable hence perhaps its uniform procedures caption in the act but it may do more the deputy chief of the justice departments asset forfeiture section has written that the new language also overturns razmilovic and authorizes the issuance of pretrial restraining orders in section 2461c cases102 the difficulty is that the new language is not that found in section 982 which the second circuit indicated would authorize such pretrial restraining orders quite the contrary the new language appears to follow the same linguistic path that the court found led to the opposite result in the earlier version application of the federal rules before conviction confiscation order of the court upon conviction and application of section 853 thereafter on the other hand the new language does end with the statement that section 853 is to apply to all stages of criminal forfeiture proceeding some might argue that if congress intended to overturn the result in razmilovic with its amendment it selected particularly cryptic way of doing so section 2461 cases aside the defense to criminal forfeiture differs somewhat from that in cases of civil forfeiture for example since conviction is prerequisite to confiscation acquittal will ordinarily preclude forfeiture third party interests are less likely to be cut off by virtue of the propertys proximity to criminal conduct simply because only the defendants interest in the property is subject to confiscation and because bona fide purchaser exceptions are more common bona fide purchaser exceptions protect good faith purchaser who acquired the property after commission of the offense at which time title to the property vested in the united states but before the declaration of forfeiture 103 98 id at 139 quoting 18 usc 982bemphasis of the court 99 id at 139 quoting 28 usc

either confiscation of forfeitable property or money judgment in the amount of its value104 if the government seeks confiscation the court must determine whether the statutory nexus between the property and the crime of conviction exists105 determination presented to the jury at the defendants request106 if the government instead seeks money judgment the court must determine the amount the defendant must pay107 at that point the court issues preliminary forfeiture order or order for money judgement against the defendant in favor of the government108 third parties with claims to the forfeited property other than the defendant are then entitled to judicial hearing on their claims109 third party claims may be grounded either in an assertion that they possessed vested or superior interest in the property at the time confiscationtrigger misconduct occurred or that they are good faith purchases 110 in either instance they bear the burden of establishing their claim by preponderance of the evidence111 when the government is awarded money judgment it is not limited to the forfeitable assets the defendant has on hand at the time but may enforce the judgment against future and perhaps alternative assets as well112 in such cases the courts are divided over the question of whether the government may enforce the judgment like any other judgment creditor or instead is limited to substitute assets and then only if the tainted assets are unavailable113 the disposal of property that remains after claims have been resolved is matter of statute discussed below

claims against the property or granting remission or mitigation115 intergovernmental transfers and the use of special funds however are the hallmarks of the more prominent federal forfeiture statutes as noted earlier the attorney general and the secretary of the treasury enjoy considerable discretion to transfer confiscated property to state local and foreign law enforcement agencies116 federal law requires that confiscated cash or the proceeds from the sale of confiscated property which remain after any transfers or other statutorily authorized disposition be deposited in special fund the

the eighth amendment states in its entirety that excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted the lower courts had on several occasions held that criminal forfeitu res are subject to eighth amendment analysis158 but eighth amendment concerns were generally considered irrelevant in civil forfeiture cases because the amendment was thought to be limited to criminal punishments while civil forfeitures were remedial and thus neither criminal nor punishments159 this changed in 1993 when the supreme court announced that the eighth amendments excessive fines clause applies not only to crimin forfeitures but to some civil forfeitures as well160 the full impact of those decisions remained uncertain initially because the court declined to articulate test by which to measure particular forfeitures against the clauses proscriptions161 it subsequently selected the standard used as the measure under the parallel cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment punitive forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause if it is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of defendants offense162 continued libretti v

the public fisc had his crime gone undetected the government would have been deprived only of the information that 357144 had left the country 524 us at 33839 the court was unpersuaded by the governments claim that early statutes which set the fine for various customs evasion offenses at twice the value of the goods demonstrated historic acceptance of pr oportional penalties these early monetary forfeitures were considered not as punishment for an offense but rather as serving the remedial purpose of reimbursing the government for the losses accruing from the evasion of customs duties 524 us at 342 consistent with this observation several lower federal courts have rejected excessive fines clause arguments because the statutes in question were purely remedial rather than

difficulty applying the standard163 but at least as starting point they now appear to consider the bajakajian standard cumulative punitive forfeiture will not be considered an excessive fine if it is

precluded further trial and conviction it likewise precluded forfeiture the supreme courts conclusion in austin that certain civil forfeitures may be considered punitive for purposes of the eighth amendments excessive fines clause seemed to have obvious double jeopardy implications in fact the court went so far as to note that its past decisions declining to apply the double jeopardy clause to civil forfeitures arose only in cases where the forfeiture could properly be characterized as remedial167 yet the court in united states v ursery 518 us 267 1996 reaffirmed its faith in the traditional tests forfeitures that congress has designated as remedial civil sanctions do not implicate double jeopardy concerns unless the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate congress intention to establish civil remedial mechanism 518 us at 278168 g21g146g161g157g145g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561 the sixth amendment assures the accused in criminal

the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest second there has been special need for prompt action third the state has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force the person initiating the seizure has been government official responsible for determining under standards of narrowly drawn statute that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance 407 us at 91 the considerations that justified postponement of notice and hearing in those cases are present here first seizure under the puerto rican statutes serves significant governmental purposes seizure permits puerto rico to assert in rem jurisdiction over the property in order to conduct forfeiture proceedings thereby fostering the public interest in preventing continued illicit use of the property and in enforcing criminal sanctions second preseizure notice and hearing might frustrate the intere sts served by the statutes since the property seized as here yacht will often be of sort that could be removed to another jurisdiction destroyed or concealed if advance warning of confiscation were given and finally unlike the situation in

of delay the reasons for the delay the claimants assertion of his or her rights and prejudice to the claimant181 in other challenges the lower federal courts have found that due process permits the procedure of shifting the burden of proof to forfeiture claimant after the government has shown probable cause and allows use of probable cause standard in civil forfeitures182 postponement of the 177

takings clause stands as impediment to an otherwise valid forfeiture petitioner also claims that the forfeiture in this case was taking of private property for public use in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment but if the forfeiture proceeding here in question did not violate the fourteenth amendment the property in the automobile was transferred by virtue of that proceeding from petitioner to the state the government may not be required to compensate an owner for property which it has already lawfully acquired under

michigan 516 us at 45758 i join the opinion of the court and highlight features of the case key to my judgment first it bears emphasis that the car in question belonged to john bennis as much as it did to tina bennis the sole question then is whether tina bennis is entitled not to the car but to portion of the proceeds if any there be after deduction of police prosecutorial and court costs as matter of constitutional right second it was critical to the judgment of the michigan supreme court that the nuisance abatement proceedings is an equitable action that means the states supreme court stands ready to police exorbitant applications of the statute nor it is fair to charge the trial court with blatant unfairness in the case at hand the court declined to order divisio n of sale proceeds for two practical reasons the bennises have another automobile and the age and value of the forfeited car left practically nothing to divide after subtraction of costs michigan in short has not embarked on an experiment to punish innocent third parties nor do we conduct any such experiment michigan has decided to deter johns from using cars they own or coown to contribute to neighborhood blight and that abatement endeavor hardly warrants this courts disapprobation 181 united states v 8850 vasquez 461 us 555 56265 1983 united states v ninety three firearms 330 f3d 414 42426 6th cir

courts became somewhat ensnarled in the consequences that flow from finding that the government has violated due process demands in forfeiture context some concluded that the lack of due process voided the purported administrative or judicial forfeiture even if an intervening statute of limitations barred relitigation of confiscation proceedings185 others determined that the forfeiture need not be vacated186 although they sometimes held that the property owner might be entitled to disgorgement or interest187 cafra resolved the conflict by establishing timetable within which the government must restart forfeiture proceedings following claimants successful motion setting aside an earlier confiscation declaration188 g3g155g157g146g140g149g142g561g11g11g11g561 section 3 of article iii of the united states constitution does not appear to threaten most contemporary forfeiture statutes it provides in part that attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted the section on its face seems to restrict forfeiture only in treason cases but at least one court has suggested broader scope189 even if article iii when read in conjunction with the due process clause reaches not only treason but all crimes its prohibitions run only to forfeiture of estate they do not address statutory forfeitures of the type currently found in state and federal law the critical distinction between forfeiture of estate and statutory forfeiture is that in the first all of the defendants property related or unrelated to the offense and acquired before during or after the crime is confiscated in the second confiscation is only possible if the property is related to the criminal conduct in the manner defined by the statute some have suggested that congress intended to revive forfeiture of estate when it crafted the rico criminal forfeiture provisions 190 the courts have nevertheless upheld the rico provisions in the face of article iii challenges191 183 united states v mchan 345 f3d 262 26970 4th cir 2003 184 collazos v united states 368 f3d 190 202 2d cir 2004 185 united states v marolf

because of the irrationality of ruling that forfeiture of estate ca nnot be imposed for treason but can be imposed for pattern of lesser crimes 190 the confusion apparently stems from the

fourth amendment questions may appear somewhat unsettled many statutes reflected the traditional view of contraband that forfeitable property may be seized without observing the normal demands of the amendments warrant requirements192 the position of the supreme court is uncertain193 and the lower courts are split as to whether purely domestic forfeiture seizures must comply with the warrant requirements in the absence of some other applicable and recognized exception eg seizure of evidence incident to lawful arrest or vehicle seizures194 the recent promulgation of rule g forfeiture actions in rem of the supplemental admiralty and maritime claims to the federal rules of civil procedure left the issue unresolved195 continued rather whether there is any required nexus between the
