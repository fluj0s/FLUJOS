it was appropriate for him to have informal exchanges with the worlds super power since i after all have one chance in two of becoming frances next president sarkozy asked for overviews of the current us position on iranian issues and the us domestic political situation turning to french domestic politics sarkozy said things are going well for him the polls are good and the party is united he shrugged off the challenge socialist party frontrunner segolene royal might pose she doesnt bother he said while also underlining his conviction that the election would be very very close the meeting punctuated by the visit of sarkozys nineyear old louis offered rare glimpse of relaxed sarkozy end summary proud and honored to meet with president bush 2 c sarkozy underlined to the ambassador his gratitude to the president for making room in his schedule for meeting with sarkozy dropby in meeting with nsa hadley scheduled for september 12 sarkozy said he felt proud and honored to meet with president bush sarkozy confided that president chirac had pressured him not to go the us but then highlighted why he believed his trip to the us and meeting with the president was appropriate and important in typical combative selfassertive fashion sarkozy said i did not hesitate for an instant to go ahead with the trip sarkozy went on to explain that he considers it an opportunity to affirm my loyal friendship for the us which though it may be unpopular in france i nevertheless openly avow sarkozy then recalled how in major campaign speech before eight thousand union for popular movement ump party supporters two days earlier he had held out as an example to young french people the way the citizens of the united states nation of immigrants listen to the national anthem and salute the stars and stripes with their hands over their hearts 3 c sarkozy and the ambassador discussed the importance of sarkozys establishing informal contacts with us leaders before the french presidential elections before if sarkozy should become president the constraints of high office condition outreach to other leaders sarkozy judged that it was very fitting and proper for him to meet with the president of the worlds superpower since i after all have one chance in two of becoming frances next president iran was the only international issue raised by sarkozy during this meeting with the ambassador confident about his own prospects 4 c turning to french domestic politics sarkozy exuded confidence about his own presidential prospects he was uncharacteristically relaxed during the meeting as he assessed his chances of prevailing through both rounds of frances upcoming presidential contest sarkozy nonetheless underlined that whoever the socialist candidate might be the election would still be very close fiftyone fortynine very tight sarkozy dismissed as unlikely the possibility that extremeright national front leader jeanmarie pen might repeat his performance of the first round of the 2002 election sarkozy said that overall things are looking good for and he pointed to his consistently high poll numbers and his unification of the ump party as pillars of what he expects should be successful electoral effort that said he affirmed that chirac remains an adversary who seeks to trip him sarkozy up on his way to the french presidency 5 c sarkozy was nearly cavalier in his dismissal of the capabilities of poitoucharentes region president and socialist party frontrunner segolene royal he said she doesnt bother meaning that he did not believe that she would be formidable opponent he explicitly pointed to her lack of experience both in withstanding the rigors of high office and those of presidentiallevel electoral politics as crippling shortcomings in her ability to mount credible paris 00005975 002 of 002 presidential candidacy against his comment ever since her emergence as highly popular presidential contender year ago royal has been underestimated by all of frances professional politicians end comment sarkozy mentioned former prime minister lionel jospin as possible alternative to royal but did not venture view on jospins chances of upsetting royal he added that he felt royals candidacy was facing increasing turbulence in the run up to the socialists primary election in midnovember and that this along with her dominance of the popularity polls with him protects comment by absorbing so much of the attention of press and public royal is shielding sarkozy from the sort of criticism and scrutiny that might undercut his candidacy sarkozy is making good use of this blocking effect using it to set the agenda for the upcoming campaign in series of speeches that articulate both principles for action and concrete proposals end comment an unforgettable scene 6 c as the ambassador was about to leave sarkozy went to the line of floortoceiling windows that open from the interior ministers office to the gardens of the interior ministry and called over his nineyear old louis who was playing on the lawn sarkozy lives with his family in apartments above his office sarkozy was clearly happy and proud to be in the company of his young and seemed tickled to be able to introduce him to the ambassador of the united states louis appeared at the threshold with small dog at his feet and large rabbit in his arms to shake hands with the ambassador louis put down the rabbit and the dog started chasing the rabbit through sarkozys office which led to the unforgettable sight of sarkozy bent over chasing the dog through the anteroom to his office as the dog chased the rabbit and louis filled the room with gleeful laughter please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
