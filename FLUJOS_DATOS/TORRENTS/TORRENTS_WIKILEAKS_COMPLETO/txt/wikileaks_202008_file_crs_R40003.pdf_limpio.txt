cars and light trucks are requesting federal financial assistance in the form of bridge loans to assure their ability to continue in business the companies general motors gm ford and chry sler collectively known as the detroit 3 have directly appealed to congress for aid in series of hearings that began in november 2008 the companies have been affected by longterm decline in us market share the impact of general decline in us motor vehicle sales in 2008 that has impacted all producers and the effects of severe constriction of credit resulting from problems in us and global financial markets the rise in gasoline prices to more than 400 gallon in july 2008 caused significant fall in vehicle use and miles driven and structural shift in motor vehicle consumption patterns the subsequent decline in gas prices in fall 2008 has not led to increased consumer spending on autos and light trucks in spite of numerous incentives by american and foreignowned motor vehicle companies bill to provide up to 25 billion in direct loans to the companies was introduced on november 17 2008 by senate majority leader harry reid s 3688 this bill would make these loans available from 700 billion already set aside by congress in the troubled asset relief program tarp established under the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 eesa pl 110 343 earlier secretary of the treasury henry paulson rejected requests to use his existing authority to designate tarp funds for this purpose the bush administration instead proposed that bridge loans to the auto industry could be taken from the direct loan program for advanced technology vehicle production set up under section 136 of the energy independence and security act eisa pl 110140 this bill had become law in december 2007 and had been funded under pl 110329 legislation that included continuing appropriations for fy2009 number of other draft bills have been discussed in both houses but none has been introduced senator reid and house speaker nancy pelosi have said that funding for bridge loans to the industry will be considered at session of cong ress to be convened in early december 2008 after the detroit 3 present

continued to decline in late 2008 despite falling gasoline prices consumers were apparently deterred by poor economic prospects plus the impact of reduced credit availability the detroit news observed that gm and chrysler us sales in november 2008 each fell by more than 40 compared to yearearlier results ford and the three leading japanese companies toyota honda and nissan did little better with sales of each falling more than 30 the poor results occurred despite the predictions of many analysts who had expected better november sales because of aggressive automakers sales incentives and the thought that the plunge in gas prices may have put floor under sales 2 in the unfavorable economic circumstances of late 2008 all manufacturers and sellers of motor vehicles passenger cars and light trucks faced difficult times in the united states for the first ten months of the year sales were down by two million vehicles versus the same period one year earliera 15 decline moreover the decline accelerated during the latter part of the year sales were about onethird lower in october 2008 compared to the same month in 2007 virtually every manufacturer reported declines for the year within an overall down market the usowned automakers have fared the worst the major detroitbased auto manufacturers were formerly known as the big 3 they are not any more because by 2007 one japanese company toyota outsold two of the detroit companies ford and chrysler in the united states their own home market in addition honda in 2008 roughly equaled chrysler in domestic us motor vehicle sales through october 2008 the detroit 3 consisting of general motors gm ford motor company and chrysler llc owned by cerberus capital management lp had seen their annual rate of sales fall by more than 21 in total and by more than 20 in each case the japanese korean and european producers all recorded declines in the singledigit ranges except for toyota the largest company whose sales were down by 115 3 this has not been merely loss of some companies competitive position to others normal shift in the marketplace the detroit 3 are facing myriad of peculiarly disadvantageous conditions in addition to the worsening economy the credit crunch that has dampened general consumer demand for new vehicles has moreover impacted the ability of their captive credit companies to make loans to either consumers or dealers for their inventories the detroit 3 have much higher legacy costs than foreign automakers and may in some cases be more adversely affected by stricter federal corporate average fuel economy cafe standards 4 the cyclical decline in the market has combined with sudden change in consumer preferences from trucks back to cars to both sales decline and accelerated losses of market shares for

the question of rescuing one or more of the detroit 3 automakers comes up at time of considerable weakness in the overall economy in the third quarter of 2008 real gross domestic product gdp fell by 03 most economists are not very sanguine about short run prospects either the november 2008 blue chip economic indicators consensus forecast was for real gdp to decline by 04 for all of 2009 and for the unemployment rate to reach 85 by the end of next year 6 the prospect of failure of any of the big three us automakers could only cast more gloom on that outlook 5 this section was written by brian

was 3313 billion out of total gross domestic product gdp of 144292 billion7 motor vehicle production thus represents 23 of total output the total number of workers employed in the manufacture of us autos in 2007 measured on an annual basis and somewhat different from the numbers generated in the table above was 859000 of those 186000 worked in light vehicle assembly and 673000 were employed in the manufacture of parts8 economists generally assess that economic growth of at least 2 is required to accommodate growing labor force and keep the rate of unemployment from rising loss of anyt hing approaching 2 of output would very likely lead to significant increases in the unemployment rate in the short run the center for automotive research car an organization supported in part by industry contributions did an economic simulation of failure of domestic automakers based on two separate sets of assumptions 9 in the first case it was assumed that the problems of the detroit 3 automakers led to permanent 100 decline in th production of domestic automakers in the first year 2009 it was also assumed that the effect of that shock would result in such large drop in the demand for parts that suppliers would be forced to either liquidate or restructure it was assumed that the disruption to the parts suppliers would cause domestic production of foreign owned auto manufacturers to also drop to zero in the first year in this scenario the total number of jobs lost in the united states in the first year was estimated to be 295 million that figure includes jobs lost at auto manufacturers parts suppliers as well as in the rest of the economy because of the drop in consumer spending resulting from the direct job losses in the second year 2010 production at the foreignowned firms begins to pick up and employment recovers somewhat with the number of jobs lost falling to 246 million the second car analysis assumes that although in the first year 2009 domestic production of the detroit 3 automakers drops to zero auto production recovers to 50 of its former output in the second year and continues at that level in th is scenario the estimated us job loss in the first year is 246 million falling to 150 million in the second year general criticism of this analysis is that it assumes that the suppliers and all other automakers aside from the initially failed company or companies would see their output drop to zero and that they would be merely passive observers of an industry collapse 10 there are many examples in recent years of bankrupt or financially distressed suppliers being supported by their oem customers or by other suppliers that acquire parts of the business to gain new contracts or to be able to continue servicing their own contracts from failed subassembly producer different examples include collins aikman plastech nd ten visteon plants whose ownership reverted to ford as the automotive holdings group while car posits for the sake of analysis that in the first year auto manufacturing in the united states could survive major detroit 3 bankruptcy in actuality such an extreme outcome is unlikely immediate and radical restructurings among suppliers are more likely outcome and other brands would continue to produce 7 department of commerce bureau of economic analysis 8 thomas h klier and james m rubenstein who really made your car

repair shops retails parts stores and other autorelated occupations mo st of which would survive detroit 3 oem bankruptcy at least in the short term11 sales in late 2008 continued at annualized monthly rates of about 10 million vehicles indicating considerable continuing demand much of which could be supplied from discounted inventory in cases wher new vehicle supply was interrupted and even if all new car production in the united states fell to zero in the next year some of the money that would have been spent on new cars would instead be spent on repairs and maintenance so income and employment in those firms would be likely to rise moreover the car analysis is only partial with respect to the redistribution of consumer spending and the national economy some of the money that otherwise would have been spent on cars produced in the united states might instead be spent on cars manufactured abroad an increase in car imports would have several effects it would increase the supply of dollars in foreign exchange markets tending to reduce the price of the dollar in terms of foreign currencies fall in the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets would have the effect of reducing the price of goods and services produced in the united states to foreigners that would tend to stimulate exports more generally offsetting to some extent the loss of domestic car sales separately from the car simulations the chief economist of the economic consultancy firm global insight nariman behravesh has estimated wh at the effects of gm liquidation would be he assumed that associated supplier shutdowns combined with that of gm would push the national unemployment rate up by point from projected 2009 level of 85 to 95 spending for existing programs such as unemployment insurance and new measures that would be needed to revive economic growth would cost the government 200 billion should gm be forced to liquidate behravesh said in an interview expenditures would be especially focused on michigan ohio and indiana he added 12 to the extent that consumers are forced to delay new car purchases some of that money might be saved until more new cars became available any increase in saving would tend to lower interest rates below what they would otherwise be reducing the cost of other creditfinanced purchases spending for household furnishings such as appliances or furnishings might benefit if the money that might otherwise have gone to new car purchase is not saved it could result in increased output and employment in other firms some of the estimated direct effects of the loss in employment in autorelated firms might thus be mitigated by gains in other sectors but in the short run any of these offsetting gains would likely be considerably less than the immediate effect of autorelated job losses any loss of output due to the difficulties with us automakers will likely be felt nationwide but because of the geographic concentration of those firms it will be much greater in some regions than in others according to klier and rubenstein michigan accounts for onequarter of all auto parts 13 they also point out that there is corridor between the great

concentrated would experience the greatest economic difficulties resulting from any loss of us auto output it is important to keep in mind that all of the changes discussed in this section are measured relative to what would happen in the absence of disruption of detroit 3 auto production while it would certainly be noticeable in auto alley there may well be significant areas of the country where the effects would be negligible and would not be readily apparent from one quarter to the next in the long run the us economy tends toward full employment slack labor markets tend to slow wage growth and eventually lead to an increase in the demand for labor but if the demand for autos is increasingly met by foreign made cars or by increasing capacity in existing plants in other locations

financing has generally been provided for dealers by these credit organizations at favorable better than prime interest rates dealers have also been financially encouraged to refer customers to the

more difficult to raise capital to lend to dealers or customers gmac in particular has virtually ceased lending except to customers with the highest credit scores and has stopped supporting domestic

lending through its residential capital rescap division the latter has been primarily responsible for gmacs multibillion dollar losses in 200817 ford motor credit remains 100 owned by ford motor company it has sought to offset negative reports on credit availability by widely advertising that ford consumer credit is still available it has raised floorplan financing rates by 05 in view of higher borrowing costs but has also waived the increase for dealers that meet overall sales targets18 the japanese oems are not as impacted by the financial crisis traditionally weaker than the us companies financial arms and more reliant on thirdparty consumer lending by banks they have become much more competitive in recent years notably toyota has inaugurated an aggressive saved by zero consumer lending campaign that features 0 loans for qualified buyers on most models nissan has followed suit19 customers and dealers have alternatively sought to finance deals through banks but the banks are also reducing their consumer lending20 dealers have sought alternative inventory funding sources from community banks which generally have funds to loan and which have not been as severely affected by the subprime mortgage crisis as the money center banks the local banks may offer more attractive financing rates than the oems but for many dealers they do not have the scale to cover

plants have been gaining market share for decades major market shifts in the automotive sales did not happen overnight as illustrated in figure 1 the detroit 3s decline relative to the total us market has continued since 2000 however the slope through 2005 was rather gentle from twothirds of the total us market for passenger cars and light trucks in 2000 the detroit 3 share declined gradually to 582 in 2005 some of this decline represented aggressive us manufacturing and expansion plans by foreign owned companies toyota honda nissan and hyundai have all opened new assembly plants in the united states since 2000 and more are on the way however after losing eight points of market share in 20002005 the detroit 3 saw their losses accelerate by an additional 10 points between then and the first three quarters of 2008 to an annual level of just over 48 market share this occurred while the total market itself was declining the us automotive market is notoriously cyclical and the decline in 2008 is not exceptional compared to declines in earlier recessions 33 figure 1 indicates that the total domestic light motor vehicle market stabilized at around 17 million sales per year through 2005 passenger cars and light trucks which include sport utility vehicles minivans and pickup trucks it dropped about halfmillion units in 2006 to 165 million another halfmillion to just more than 16 million in 2007 then to an annual rate of just 144 million in the first threequarters of 200834 the annual rate of car and truck sales by the detroit 3 fell to less than seven million compared to 115 million in 2000 and almost 10 million as late as 2005 more detailed data show that each of the detroit 3 saw sales decline by about one million vehicles or more and each suffered significant market share losses automotive data is usually figured in units which means for example that an expensive cadillac escalade counts the same as an inexpensive kia rio but for the entire industry average new vehicle transaction prices after rising from 2004 through 2007 fell steadily in 2008 meaning less top line revenue per unit sold 35 moreover table 1 illustrates that part of the detroit 3s problems relate to the continued reliance on truck sales when light trucks are declining as an overall share of the market having become more specialized in larger vehicles the detroit 3 have been especially adversely affected by the sharper decline in the sales of such vehicles 31 this section was written by stephen cooney resources science and industry division 32 crs report rl32883 us automotive

the new collective bargaining agreements were negotiated and ratified by the time congress approved and president bush signed substantial increase in mandated fuel economy in eisa pl 110140 in december 2007 although the detroit 3 were losing money the new labor agreements combined with an eisa direct loan program for manufacturing advanced technology vehicles and components appeared to provide new resources for transition that would aid the detroit 3 in achieving improved fuel economy 42 by the time congress considered funding this program in september 2008 the economic climate for the detroit 3 had worsened markedly the downturn in the broader domestic economy reduced sales for virtually all manufacturers in the middle of the year as consumer confidence declined and credit

executive officers of the detroit 3 as well as president gettelfinger of the uaw made the case for immediate assistance to the industry they were supported by some members of congress critics of such assistance were also heard the industry ceos stated that they were asking for bridge loans to tide them over during market decline of unanticipated severity which had affected all automakers and an equally unanticipated unavailability of credit from financial markets the bridge loan would provide time for costsaving measures including the transfer of retiree health care responsibilities to work that plus hopedfor recovery of the domestic auto market by 2010 could allow the detroit 3 to return to financial stability as gm ceo g richard wagoner testified we in cooperation with the uaw have

with those who say we are not doing enough to position gm for success what exposes us to failure now is not our product lineup is not our business plan is not our employees and their willingness to work hard it is not our longterm strategy what exposes us to failure now is the global financial crisis which has severely restricted credit availability and reduced industry sales to the lowest per

representative spencer bachus who holds the same position on the house financial services committee they argued that to large extent the problems of the detroit 3 were due to the longterm consequences of poor management and labor decisions which would not be fixed with shortterm financial assistance and that the industry would soon be requesting additional federal support moreover assistance to the auto industry it was stated would encourage other industries to also importune the federal government for aid during the present economic downturn in the november 18 hearing senator bob corker of tennessee also argued that assistance should be provided until the contract provision that guarantees hourly production employees of the detroit 3 most of their pay even when they were not working

receiving protection from creditors it also provides them with opportunities to modify debts and contracts61 in way that enhances the companys possibilities of recovering from financial troubles it is generally believed that business is worth more as going concern than as an assortment of assets that are sold separately survival of the company benefits creditors employees and the community in which the business is located in most cases the company retains its management generally trustee is appointed only when management is removed for cause 62 however even when trustee is not appointed the company may decide to turn operation of the business over to turnaround specialist who has experience in guiding companies through chapter 11 and into solvency63 the reorganization plan is the key to chapter 11 bankruptcy the plan is proposal generally by the debtorinpossession dip as to how the va lid claims of each class of creditors are going to be resolved64 to be confirmed the plan must be agreed to by at least one impaired class of claims additionally each holder of claim in an impaired class must accept the plan unless the amount received under the plan is less than the amount that would have been received under chapter 765 in standard chapter 11 bankruptcy the plan proposal and negotiation with the creditors takes place after the company has filed for bankruptcy in prepackaged chapter 11 the company does not file for bankruptcy until negotiations with creditors have resulted in 58 see 11 usc 726 59 see 11 usc 507 60 the bankruptcy code is 11 usc 101 et seq 61 most executory

case this may have the effect of reducing uncertainty about the companys future negotiating prepackaged chapter 11 does take some time so it is unclear to what extent p repack would benefit the automakers who say they are rapidly running out of operating capital it is possible that conditioning receipt of government assistance on prepackaged agreement among the creditors might encourage creditors to quickly reach negotiated modifications with debtor companies an additional benefit to prepack is elimination of the need for arranging dip financing dip financing involves agreements to provide fund s to debtorinpossession dip to allow it to meet expenses incurred during reorganization if suppliers have refused to continue shipments without prepayment dip financing can provide the means of making the prepayment in some cases simply having the loan agreements is sufficient to restore suppliers confidence and willingness to ship without prepayment if one or more of the detroit 3 filed under chapter 11 it is possible that government loans could provide the dip financing the dip financing lender can enjoy the highest protection available in chapter 11 bankruptcy when used for current operating expenses the financing is an administrative expense under 11 usc 503b1 and would be priority claim under 11 usc 507a2 66 section 507 priorities are important in chapter 11 bankruptcy and must be addressed in the reorganization plan but chapter 11 provides greater flexibility in the payment of these claims than does chapter 7 the holders may agree either to modify their claims or to accept alternative payment arrangements rather than receiving full payment before other unsecured claims are paid if there is such agreement the code prescribes treatment for each priority claim that must be met for the plan to be confirmed however some of the statutory treatments allow deferred payments or installment payments of amounts due 67 this added flexibility for resolving priority claims may increase the amounts available to pay other unsecured claims it may also make it possible for the company to meet its operations expenses both shortterm and longterm the automakers have said that consumers will be unwilling to buy cars from company in bankruptcy due to concerns about future warranty coverage and availability of manufacturers parts and that therefore filing chapter 11 would lead to liquidation rather than reorganization one might question whether the recent urgent requests for financial assistance do not diminish consumer confidence at least as much as would bankruptcy filing designed to reorganize the company and lead to financial viability in the past chapter 11 bankruptcy protection has been viewed by some as providing the reorganizing company with competitive advantage in the marketplace by allowing it to reject burdensome contracts modify cbas and reduce total debt reduce required payments or both in that case filing under chapter 11 could boost consumer confidence in the troubled automakers prepackaged chapter 11 could also reduce the effect of bankruptcy filing on consumer confidence since the company would spend little time in bankruptcy however if congress finds that conc erns about warranty coverage is an issue that would doom reorganization it could be possible to provide for alternative warranty coverage this might be funded with premiums paid by automakers similar to premiums paid by financial institutions to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 66 greater protection may be available to dip lenders if credit cannot be obtained without such protection see 11 usc 364c d 67 see 11 usc 1129a9

financial assistance from the federal government is not new in 1980 the then financially troubled chrysler sought 15 billion in loan guarantees from the federal government as part of the loanguarantee package the government acquired warrants to purchase chrysler stock at set price 13s hare until 1990 in 1983 the government auctioned the warrants which chrysler retired after making the winning bid 311 million68 chrysler has operated since then without additional assistance from the federal government it fully repaid its loans within the agreed repayment period though the company has acknowledged that it faces an operating capital shortfall in late 2008 the detroit 3 are now asking for direct loans from the federal government rather than loan guarantees in the current credit market alternate loan sources might be scarce even with government guarantees for the loans however direct loans from the federal government commit government money more immediately than would loan guarantees several have questioned the advisability of extending such loans fearing that the troubled automakers may be unable to repay them even if the loan terms are very favorable one particular concern is how these loans would be treated if the automakers file for bankruptcy after receiving them under current bankruptcy law the loans if secured would enjoy priority status under 11 usc 507 this means that the government potentially could stand in line with the other nonpriority unsecured creditors and ultimately might receive only few pennies for each dollar of outstanding loan balance in the worst case there might be funds to divide between these creditors it might be possible to protect the governments financial interest however doing so might go against existing policy in bankruptcy law generally the priorities of the code favor nongovernmental creditors the major exception to th is policy is the priority given to some federal tax obligations which are eighth in line of the ten priorities provided in the code one method of protecting the governments interest in loans would be to modify the code to accord priority to those loans recognizing that such priority would potentially disadvantage other priority creditors whose claims held lower priority another method of protecting the governments interest in the loans would be to specifically exclude them from discharge in bankruptcy either permanently or for fixed period of time 69 the code specifies number of debts that are not dischargeable in bankruptcy70 these are generally more applicable to individuals than to businesses businesses generally can receive discharge of debts when they successfully emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy as an ongoing 68 gary putka chrysler to pay us 311 million for its warrants the wall street journal september 13 1983 p 3 69 11 usc 1141d6 already blocks corporations from discharging some debts including tax debts that result from fraudulent returns there are number of provisions outside of the code that limit dischargeability of debts within fixed period generally five years after the beginning of the repayment period for the debt these provisions generally involve debts to the federal government that became due after an individual failed to meet certain c onditions placed on their receiving financial benefits from the government for examples

that liquidate under either chapter 7 or chapter 11 however this is generally distinction without meaning since after liquidation there is longer an entity to remain liable for the nondischarged debts thus statutorily making loan owed to the federal government nondischargeable would provide protection for the government only if the borrower was able to successfully reorganize and remain in business ironically the presumed protection provided by making the debt nondischargeable could be illusory since such large nondischargeable debt could make it unfeasible to continue the business it is possible to combine priority status and nondischargeability 72 this combination of attributes could provide greater assurance that the government loans would be repaid however this assurance comes with cost to other unsecured creditors as mentioned above those with priority claims that are lower in the priority hierarchy w ould be disadvantaged and giving priority to the government debt increases the likelihood of nonpriority unsecured claims receiving little or nothing in chapter 7 liquidation combining priority status and nondischargeability might however make successful reorganization more likely than it would be if the debt were excluded from discharge but not afforded priority status this is because the priority status of the debt would generally result in some repayment as part of the reorganization plan leaving smaller balance to survive the bankruptcy reorganization thus making it less likely that reorganization would be quickly followed by liquidation

that would exist outside of the bankruptcy code such governmentsponsored plan could take many forms for example it could closely mirror chapter 11 or it could be modeled after the conservatorships for fannie mae and freddie mac 73 some believe that this would provide more expedient solution to the automakers current financial challenges than would reorganization within the bankruptcy code reasons cited include need for changes in the management of the companies delays caused by court proceedings and the automakers concerns about the effect of the word bankruptcy on consumers proponents of gsr want the government to condition receipt of government funding on reorganization under new management possibly under some form of government management designing gsr outside the bankru ptcy code should be possible however it is impossible to predict what form it might take there could also be constitutional considerations including possible takings clause issues it seems likely that most of what could be done outside of the bankruptcy code could also be done within it should congress decide to modify it although general chapter 11 bankruptcy does not normally involve appointment of trustee to replace the companys existing management the provisions of the railroad retirement act require trustee for railroad 71 see 11 usc 1141d for discussion of discharge under chapter 11 72

require appointment of trustee for automobile manufacturer reorganizations proponents of gsr believe that gsr would be more timeefficient than chapter 11 because it would cut out the court approval process inherent in general chapter 11 bankruptcies however if government financing were conditioned on prepackaged reorganization plan the latter might be more timeefficient since generally

defined benefit plans are insured up to certain limits by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc government corporation established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa

provided by state and local governments or benefits under defined contribution plans such as 401k plans the maximum pension benefit guaranteed by the pbgc is set by law and adjusted annually for plans that terminate in 2009 workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to 4500 month 54000 year the guarantee is lower for those who retire early or when there is benefit for survivor the guarantee is higher for those who retire after age 65 the pbgc receives funds from general tax re venues the pbgc collects insurance premiums from employers that sponsor insured pension plans earns money from investments and receives funds from pension plans it takes over when the pbgc takes over pension plan it assumes responsibility for future benefit payments to the pl ans participants up to the limits set in law in general the pbgc takes over only plans that are underfunded and that the employer is not expected to be able to fully fund because it has filed for bankruptcy or is experiencing serious financial difficulties that put its ability to fund its pension obligations at risk consequently in most cases in which the pbgc takes over pension plan it assumes pension liabilities that are greater than the assets held by the pension plan it has taken over in recent years the pbgc has taken over several large pension plans that were significantly underfunded as result the pbgcs liabilities exceed its assets according to the most recent annual report of the pbgc its insurance program for single employer plans had assets of 616 billion against liabilities of 723 billion on september 30 2008 if the current economic downturn were to result in the termination of several large defined benefit plans with significant underfunding th pbgcs deficit could grow rapidly although erisa does not

assets invested in stocks if its pension fund assets performed as the major market indices have in 2008 fords pension assets invested in equities would have lost 82 billion to 94 billi on in value through the first eleven months of 2008 this would represent 18 to 20 of the value of assets held by fords us pension plans at yearend 2007 the effect of the decline in asset prices has been offset to some extent by the rise in longterm interest rates in 2008 80 rising interest rates reduce the present value of pension liabilities in its most recent 10k filing with th sec ford estimated that an

managed by an independent board of trustees appointed by the uaw and the court88 however the extent of the negotiated 2008 to 2010 contributions to the veba will depend on the financial conditions of the detroit 3 under chapter 11 bankruptcy the detroit 3 and the uaw may seek to renegotiate retiree health insurance benefits during the reorganization process under chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation the uaw would become one in line of unsecured creditors in this situation these retirees may receive reduced coverage or even health insurance at all in the absence of bankruptcy the detroit 3 andor the uaw may also seek renegotiation to reduce the funding requirements of the veba reduced funding requirements may improve the financial pictures of the firms and help guarantee that the unionized retirees receive some health insurance benefits bankruptcy filing could also threaten health plans for union workers and nonunion workers and retirees under liquidation there would presumably be

november 2008 so measure could have been introduced excluding terms relating to loan repayment and financial oversight the stipulations related to conditions of executive pay for the recipient companies are described below in addition the house bill would have established more direct oversight of company management by federally appointed board expanded from that established under eesa

required under s 3688 for recipients of bridge loans are set out in the new 406e with which the bill would amend eesa three of them are essentially identical to provisions applied to financial institutions already in eesa new 406e2a places limits on compensation to discourage senior executive officers from taking unnecessary and excessive risks the provision is identical to compensation provision elsewhere in eesa for financial institutions that receive direct capital injections in exchange for giving the us government equity stakes the provisions operative phrase take unnecessary and excessive risks is broad thus providing interpretative leeway there is widely held view that one of the contributing causes of the financial crisis that led to the enactment of the eesa was the managerial compensation structure at wall street firms many think that their pay packages overly emphasized shortterm incentives such as bonuses helping to encourage often reckless and harmful behavior driven by the pursuit of short term corporate profits 91 concerns over the relationship between managerial incentive compensation and exceptional risk taking appears however to be largely confined to specific parts of the financial sector such as the investment banking sector and hedge funds in addition number of compensation consultants have observed that while the use of uncapped annual incentive pay has been significant element feature of many financial service firms the practice is said to be generally atypical outside of the sector 92 90 this subsection was written by gary

fundamental policy question to what extent would the discouragement of risktaking behavior also result in the discouragement of potentially beneficial innovative and entrepreneurial behavior for example in late 2007 general motors announced that it hoped to start selling cars powered by hydrogen fuelcells by 201193 if an automaker began embarking on developing such technology under the excessive risk provision should such undertakings be seen as excessive risk taking or potentially beneficial and innovative entrepreneurship the issue of the objectivity and independence of board members and senior managers in implementing the mandate has already been raised under eesa the treasury department interpretation of the identical provision in eesa places burden on corporate boards compensation committee along with certain managers to evaluate senior official compensation packages for unnecessary and excessive risks in an ostensibly unbiased manner 94 thus to the extent that legitimate concerns over excessive risk taking do exist the employee status of such managers has raised concerns over their ability to detach themselves from senior management moreover there is vigorous and ongoing debate over the extent to which members of corporate boards are able to act independently of managements influence95 new 406e2b establishes clawback provision that would provide for the recovery by the loan recipient of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to senior executive officer if the financial reporting or other criteria that it was based on are later proven to be materially inaccurate again this provision is identical to one already in eesa it represents somewhat different approach to the recoupment of executive bonuses and incentives due to financial reporting misstatements than does the clawback provision in the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 pl 107 204 both were response to the widespread cor porate misstatements of corporate earnings that were widely observed in the preceding years unlike the sarbanesoxley clawback provision which only applies to the chief executive offi cer ceo and chief financial officer cfo of publicly traded companies the provisions in s 3688 would apply to privately held firms and the top five senior officers including the ceo and the cfo the securities and exchange commission sec reportedly has rarely prosecut ed violations of sarbanesoxleys clawback provision possibly this is because executives often settle financial misstatement cases without admitting wrongdoing thus avoiding the triggering the provision and because of how the pivotal concept of misconduct is interpreted 96 new 406e2c prohibits participating institution from awarding golden parachutes to any of its top five senior executive officers during the period that loan is outstanding this provision is also identical to provision elsewhere in the eesa golden parachutes are defined in the relevant treasury department interpretation as payments of more than 299 times an executives average base compensation from firm over the five most recent years in the event of the officials involuntary termination or bank ruptcy or receivership

purposes for many years97 explaining the basic rationale for the provision treasury department official observed that our key focus is that we do not want to reward poor performance 98 there are concerns that the provision sets too high level of reward to have much impact some executive compensation consultants stress that it is uncommon for executive severance payments to reach the size that would trigger the provisions parameters they note that such relatively large payments do not normally occur unless an executive is released without cause immediately after change in control situation usually involving corporate takeover 99 echoing that view in letter of october 29 2008 to treasury secretary henry paulson senate majority leader harry reid and house speaker nancy pelosi said given the level of public outrage over these compensation schemes we would urge you in particular to consider the possibility of further restrictions on the use of golden parachutes at such participating institutions 100 new 406e2d prohibits loan recipien t from paying or accruing any bonus or incentive compensation during the period that the loan is outstanding to any executive whose annual base compensation exceeds 250000 unlike the aforementioned provisions the stricture on the payment of executive bonuses in s 3688 is not already part of eesa studies on corporate compensation describe executive bonuses as popular type of variable incentive pay normally given as onceayear payment tied to some shortterm performance goals these can range from judgments on executive performance by corporate board to levels of co mpany profits or company sectoral market share after the eesas enactment there was concern expressed both in and out of congress over reports that executives at financial firms participating in the eesa were receiving what many perceived to be excessively large bonuses an issue not specifically addressed in the laws restrictions on executive pay central concern was that participating companies were using eesa funding to pay for bonuses charge that firm executives denied among those in congress expressing concerns was representative henr waxman chairman of the house oversight committee who indicated the funds might be used for extravagant pensions or bonuses or dividends or any other purpose inconsistent with what the congress intended 101 the chairman subsequently requested documents on the compensation and bonus structures from the nine financial firms that had received eesa funds to date and this new provision was added to s 3688 some executives in recent years have received substantial bonuses in the automobile industry in 2007 ford reported that ceo allan mulally received 2 million in base salary and 4 million in bonuses he had also received 185 million in bonuses in 2006 ford also reported that the next four highest paid officials received between 1 million and 780000 in base salary and between 708000 and 439000 in

chryslers top paid executives ceo robert nardelli president james press and vicechairman tom lasorda are reportedly not participating in the plan however according to daimler filings in 2007 mr lasorda did receive 157 million bonus for his help in chryslers sale to cerberus 102 chrysler official justified the bonuses because of the need to ensure potential buyers that key company executives would remain in place after the sale while acknowledging that they had become source of controversy 103 nonetheless the official also emphasized that it was important to keep in mind that the bonuses had been crafted by daimlerchrysler the companys former owner and that they appear to have been effective in keeping its executive talent in place the sentiment was shared by number of observers including an official from challenger gray christmas national executive placement company who said that firms tend to view them as instrumental to stemming loss of leadership during critical times but others charged the executives had run the companies into the ground and questioned the need for auto industry executive retention bonuses 104 new 406e2e prohibits any compensation plan that could encourage manipulation of the reported earnings of the recipient to enhance the compensation of any of its employees this provision was not previously part of eesa earnings manipulation often referred to as earnings management is an umbrella term that is used to encompass everything from earnings smoothing to outright accounting fraud investors analysts and auditors disapprove of such actions because it makes reported corporate earnings less reliable as measure of firm performance perceived epidemic of earnings management was significant impetus behind the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 which contained broad range of corporate governance and accounting reforms publicly traded companies have long history of using stock options as major component of executive compensation the strategys central objective is aligning executives personal interests with those of shareholders in 2007 ford reported that its stock option awards to its top five senior executives ranged between 249 million and 751 million general motors reported that its option awards to its top five executives ranged from 534000 to 377 million there is growing body of research that has found that executive stock options can have unintended negative consequences with respect to encouraging greater tendency toward earnings manipulation for example one empirical study found statistical evidence that earnings manipulation is more likely where stock options play larger role in ceo compensation 105 102 tom walsh and tim higgins chrysler leaders get millions detroit free pres s november 13 2008 103

firm earnings when they had more outofthemoney stock options106 and lower holdings of conventional company stock107 jack dolmatconnell president of dolmatconnell partners an executivecompensation consulting firm observed while i think that options are an extremely good driver of performance theres downside to them from th executives standpoint you have to have someone with unethical standards who gets lots of stock options for misrepresentation and fraud to occur if you give someone with strong ethical standards lots of options nothing is likely to happen 108 thus it could be argued that to faithfully implement the provisions prohibition on any compensation plan that could encourage manipulation of the reported earnings of recipient firm companies would have to insure that executive stock option packages were tailored properly to balance their positive incentive attributes with their potential for encouraging inappropriate behavior this may assume that the process is conducted with minimum of executive influence and bias which as noted earlier may be difficult

stipulation that may be placed on any federal auto industry assistance is an improvement in vehicle fuel economy andor the incorporation of advanced technologies such as electric drive or hybrid systems for example the departme nt of energys advanced technology vehicles manufacturing tvm loan program110 requires that any projects funded by the program produce vehicles with at least 25 higher fu economy than comparable my2005 vehicle111 some auto industry critics argue that additional auto industry assistance should explicitly require the incorporation of new technologies or would require additional fuel economy improvements above those required by the atvm program key question surrounding any requirement that automakers improve fuel economy to qualify for assistance is should that improvement be above and beyond any current federal mandates in addition to the tvm program eisa requires that automakers increase their average fuel economy to 35 mpg by 2020 up from roughly 24 mpg today one potential criticism of the atvm program is that it effectively assists automakers in achieving compliance with federal mandate for additional federal assistance some have proposed that further improvements in fuel economy may be required however the auto industry will likely face high costs to comply with the upgraded cafe standards for example in its preliminary regula tory impact

of the loan program the house bill proposed authority of the board to review and prohibit any asset sale investment contract or other commitment that recipients might make if the transaction were valued at more than 25 million the house draft legislation would also have re quired longterm restructuring plan to be submitted by march 31 2009 such plans would have to address fuel efficiency and advanced technology vehicle manufacturing requirements as established in eisa rationalization of relationships with hourly workers suppliers and dealers restructuring of existing debt and raising of private capital going forward by comparison to the broadly defined elements of these plans the chrysler loan guarantee legislation of 1980 was far more prescriptive in exchange for loan guarantee that was worth far less than the 25 billion requested by the detroit 3 in 2008 even allowing for inflation114 the 1980 law pl 96185 in section 4 required that chrysler raise at least 143 billion in nonfederally guaranteed assistance including through specified minimum amounts of state and municipal loans asset sales and loans from suppliers and dealers section 6 required union wage and benefit reductions totaling 462 million including givebacks from the most recent contract bargaining agreement and further 125 million in concessions from salaried workers section 5 established general oversight of the corporation including provision that the company would guarantee substantial likelihood that it woul d be absorbed by or merged with any foreign entity while the chrysler loan guarantee program has been widely praised by members of congress and others as success it has been less noted that chrysler reduced its employment total by more than half between 1979 and 1982from 142000 to 66000 for loss of 76000 jobs 115 before any final legislation is developed and approved on this assistance it is possible that congress will impose additional conditions to those already discussed or introduced in 2008 as noted earlier some members have stated that loans should not be made unless unions accept reduction or modification of hourly workers benefits not common else where in industry on the other hand some commentators have also suggested that assistance should be linked to job protections for workers such as for example in gmchrysler merger members have also sought assurances that investments funded by federal loans should only be made in the united states such restriction could conflict with the terms of the north american free trade agreement the fact that detroit 3 operations are highly integrated across north america and the efforts of the industry also to seek government financial support from canada 116 114 chrysler received federal loan guarantee for as much as 15 billion though it only actually drew on 12 billion according to the labor department bureau of labor statis tics inflation calculator 15 billion in 1980 would be the equivalent of
