hurricane recovery bonds james m bickley specialist in public finance government and finance division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22305 severe damage and dislocations resulting from hurricanes katrina and rita have rekindled congressional interest in the concept of the sale of treasury security to finance recovery and relief operations the question has been raised whether or not the issuance of war bonds during the second world war serves as good model for new hurricane recovery bonds two bills have been introduced that would permit the issuance of some form of hurricane relief bond hr 3892 and hr 3935 during the world war ii war bonds were sold to help finance the cost of national defense war bonds were simply new name for already existing us savings bonds war bonds were aggressively marketed through well organized campaigns which appealed to citizens sense of patriotism their primary purpose was to reduce consumer spending in order to lessen inflationary pressures and black market activity also campaigns to sell war bonds were intended to raise morale by creating sense of participation in the war effort the sale of war bonds did reduce consumer spending current economic and financial conditions differ from those of the early 1940s during the war high inflation and overemployment prevailed the federal government imposed price and wage controls production controls rationing controls on the level of interest rates on treasury securities and regulations on installment loans as mentioned previously war bonds were marketed primarily to reduce consumer spending today despite concern about the low personal savings rate many federal officials are more concerned about maintaining consumer spending furthermore savings bond or any other treasury security issue has ever had its funds earmarked for any specific purpose rather all funds raised have been placed in the general fund in summary the war bonds program in world war ii is problematic model for hurricane relief bonds this report will not be updated the severe damage and dislocations caused by hurricanes katrina and rita have resulted in renewed congressional interest in the concept of selling treasury securities to finance recovery and relief operations in the federally designated disaster areas of louisiana mississippi alabama texas and florida during the first session of the 109th congressional research service the library of congress crs2 congress as of october 17 2006 two bills have been introduced which authorize the issuance of bonds in response to hurricanes katrina

representative harold rogers this act states the secretary of the treasury may designate one or more series of bonds or httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22305 certificates or any portion thereof issued under this section as hurricane relief bonds in response to hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 and the subsequent flooding and displacement of residents along the gulf coast of the united states in response to congressional attention this report describes the use of war bonds during the second world war examines their relevance as model for new bonds for hurricane relief and presents alternative policy options this analysis concludes that war bonds issued during the second world war are problematic model for hurricane recovery bonds war bonds in the second world war on march 1 1935 the first savings bonds series were issued to provide savings instrument for small savers and to lower interest costs to the treasury by expanding the potential market for treasury securities1 this bond was registered and accrued interest at fixed rate until redeemed series b c and d which were similar to series were issued subsequently before the second world war started in europe the us economy was still in the great depression hence unemployment was high unused productive capacity was extensive and wholesale and retail prices were declining after war started in europe on september 1 1939 the united states increased defense spending which was financed by new and higher taxes cuts in nondefense spending and an expansion in the national debt on march 11 1941 congress passed the lend lease act which empowered 1 us dept of the treasury savings bond division history of the united states savings bond program washington sept 1984 p 5 crs3 the president to provide defense material to foreign governments whose defense the president deems vital to the defense of the united states2 despite higher taxes and cuts in nondefense spending the large increase in defense related spending plus the absorption of significant proportion of the manpower pool by the armed forces began generating inflationary pressures as unemployment fell and unused plant capacity diminished the us government attempted to lessen inflationary pressure by encouraging the general public to buy savings bonds which were now called defense bonds3 on may 1 1941 the treasury issued new savings bond series e4 because of the comparatively high rate offered on these securities limit of 5000 maturity value was placed on the amount one person could acquire in any one calendar year5 after the united states entered the war in december 1941 defense spending soared savings bonds were renamed war bonds during the second world war existing taxes were raised new taxes imposed and price and wage controls implemented in addition production controls were instituted and rationing system established the production of many consumer products such as automobiles and refrigerators ended controls were httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22305 imposed on consumer credit and stock market credit6 the treasury and the federal reserve fixed interest rates on treasury securities at low levels to keep interest costs low the federal reserve conducted an easy money policy hence the banks had plenty of reserves although this policy kept interest costs low it contributed to inflationary pressures because the money supply expanded as war production expanded inflationary pressures increased dramatically rising employment and extensive overtime resulted in surging growth of wage incomes despite higher taxes workers had more disposable income in order to assist in lessening inflationary pressures and reducing black market activity the war savings staff at the treasury managed series of eight war loan drives employees were encouraged to purchase war bonds through payroll deduction plans while the general population purchased war bonds the us government decided to promote the purchase of treasury marketrisk securities notes bills bonds certificates and tax notes to large individual and corporate investors7 these marketrisk securities were simply regular treasury marketable securities that is they were bought and sold on financial markets victory fund committees consisting of bankers and members of the 2 paul studenski and herman krooss financial history of the united states new york

us treasury savings bond division p 15 crs4 securities industry were established in each federal reserve district to assist the treasury in marketing both war bonds and marketrisk securities which were called victory loans8 henry morgenthau secretary of the treasury combined the war savings staff managed by the treasury and the victory fund committees into new organization called the war finance division which reported to the treasury9 from may 1 1941 through december 1945 the war finance division and its predecessors were responsible for the sale of nearly 186 billion worth of government securities of this more than 54 billion was in the form of war savings bonds bonds alone accounted for 337 billion10 according to most economic historians the war loan drives were successful in encouraging the average workers to purchase war bonds and those with greater financial resources to purchase victory loans these sales absorbed potential consumer spending that would have exacerbated inflation and expanded black market activity the purchase of war bonds represented much new net savings because small savers had limited alternative saving instruments httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22305 the war loan drives had strong patriotic appeal involved 6 million volunteers and utilized extensive donated advertising each war loan drive was unique fusion of nationalism and consumerism seeking to stir the conscience of americans it invoked both their financial and moral stake in the war the sale of war bonds provided way in which patriotic attitudes and the spirit of sacrifice could be expressed11 neither war bonds nor victory loans were earmarked for defense spending during the second world war however defense related spending reached over 90 of federal outlays current savings bonds currently series ee and series i savings bonds are being issued series ee is the dominant series as measured by sales effective may 1 2005 series ee bonds issued

series i bonds are securities that accrue earnings based on both fixed rate of return and semiannual inflation rate single annual rate called the composite rate reflects the combined effects of the fixed rate and the semiannual inflation rate the fixed rate is selected by the treasury and is in effect when bond is issued and applies until the bond matures the semiannual inflation rate reflects the percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu savings bond issue or any other treasury security issue has ever had its funds earmarked for any specific purpose rather all funds raised have been placed in the general fund patriot bonds after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 both houses of congress considered and passed differing measures authorizing the sale of socalled war bonds to help give the public greater sense of participation in the war effort and to provide httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22305 revenues that could be earmarked for disaster relief and antiterrorist actions on december 11 2001 the department of the treasury designated series ee savings bonds as patriot bonds whose purpose is to fight the war on global terrorism12 the only change however was to place picture of patriot on the front of series ee bond13 this designation forestalled further congressional legislative action summary sale of hurricane bonds congress could decide that specific statutory endorsement of the decision to issue hurricane relief bonds or some other name would add to these bonds attractiveness as savings alternative some funds used to purchase these hurricane relief war bonds would likely represent the substitution of these bonds for some other form of savings the us treasury estimates that the us saving bond program is cost effective that is the savings in interest costs exceed the extra administrative costs14 these savings however have an insignificant effect on the total budget the opportunity to buy hurricane relief bonds would give the public direct sense of participation in relief and recovery from the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita 12 us department of the treasury treasury department unveils patriot bond on anniversary of september 11 attacks treasury news dec 11 2001 p 1 13 detailed information about patriot bonds is available at httpwwwpublicdebttreasgovsavsavpatriotbondhtm 14 the reliability of treasurys estimates are controversial see us government accountability office savings bonds actions needed to increase the reliability of costeffectiveness measures gao report gao03513 washington june 2003 crs6 spending for hurricane relief and recovery however is expected to be far higher than funds raised from the issuance of hurricane relief bonds15 war bond model economic and financial market conditions today differ so much from those of the second world war that the war bond model is problematic for hurricane relief debt issue the present economy is vastly different from that of the second world war war bonds were then marketed to reduce consumer spending the current economy however has low rate of inflation and low rate of unemployment controls exist on prices wages production interest rates on marketable treasury securities or installment loans goods and services are rationed instead of attempting to reduce consumer spending many federal officials are concerned about maintaining consumer spending moreover the us financial system is more complex sophisticated diverse and deregulated than in the world war ii era small savers have an array of savings vehicles httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22305 for example they can invest in money market funds and certificates of deposit cds of financial institutions today savings bonds are almost always substitute mechanism for other forms of personal savings 15 for an estimate these expenditures see us congressional budget office macroeconomic and budgetary effects of hurricanes katrina and rita statement of cbo
