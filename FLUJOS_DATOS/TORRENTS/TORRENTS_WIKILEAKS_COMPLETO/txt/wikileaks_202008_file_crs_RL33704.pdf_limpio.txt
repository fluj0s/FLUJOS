representation recent legislation the veterans benefits health care and informa tion technology act of 200652 enacted in the 109th congress modified attorney participation in the appeal process the

training and character and 2 fee criteria and limitations the secretary is authorized to charge and collect fees from the agents or attorneys to be used for administrative expenses for veterans bene fits programs the following grounds for suspension of agents or attorneys are provided in the act presenting frivolous claims prior suspensions charging exce ssive or unreasonable fees or failure to comply with the secretarys regulations the legislation signifi cantly broadens opportun ities for legal representation during administrative appeals previously an attorney could not represent veteran for fee until the bva made final decision53 this had the effect of excluding an attorney from the process until all of the administrative appeals had been exhausted the act now permits an attorney to enter the appeal process at much earlier date after the veteran has received decision on his or her claim from the va and decides to appeal this initial decision administratively through the filing of nod54 an attorney may now provide representation for fee after the nod is filed the act requires the secretary to provi congress with an evaluati on of the effect of the new system of representation the secretary is also authorized to review fee agreements and the secretary may order reduction in an agreed upon fee if the secretary finds the fee excessive or unreasonable the secretarys decision may be reviewed by the bva which is authorized to make the final review of the issue55 broadening attorney par ticipation in the veterans appeal process has been somewhat controversial pposition has
