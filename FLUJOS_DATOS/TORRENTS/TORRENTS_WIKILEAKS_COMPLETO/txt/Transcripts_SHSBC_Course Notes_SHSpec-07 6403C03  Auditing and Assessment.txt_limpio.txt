6403c03 shspec7 auditing and assessment the most complete body of knowledge there is is at class vi it took fantastic amounts of auditing to get it and codify it fortunately it is codified unlike other levels for instance prehav levels are mostly items out of actual gpms or locks thereon you are used to regarding assessment as something you use to find something to audit more recently you have regarded assessment also as way to find the source of an arc break assessment is an activity which is totally independent of auditing as you move up from class iv you find that assessment commingles with auditing arc breaks can occur because of the auditors failure to recognize the difference between assessment and auditing and failing to shift his gears from one to the other or schizophrenically trying to do both at the same time you must keep them separate for instance if the pc originates during your assessment you must instantly shift into an auditing cycle to handle it then you return to the assessment assessment is addressed to the pcs bank it is not addressed to the pc when auditing occurs during the assessment it is because the pc got restimulated by something assessed so the pc is now in need of an auditor to duplicate it so that it can asis the auditor must really understand duplicate and acknowledge so that the pc knows that he has been understood all bad assessing where the meter isnt operating properly comes about because the auditor cant shift gears smoothly and rapidly enough between auditing and assessing an auditor can get the idea that assessment is impossible if he has made mistakes in assessing that resulted in the needle tightening up the failure in this case is really an auditing failure eg the auditors inadvertent question of the pc is it all right if we assess this list an auditing question since it has not been fully handled will now get in the way of successful assessment in some cases the question went to the pc an analytical being the pc now expects to answer he may also be insufficiently indoctrinated not to think that he should answer the assessment questions too but if you dont complete the question cycle you tend to direct the rest of the assessment at the pc not the bank now the pc feels as though he should be answering each item assessed you will be assessing through the pcs withheld comm when the auditor starts to assess many pcs go on an automatically withholding state of mind they got into this state of mind because the auditor disobeyed certain tenets eg the rule that when you ask the pc question before you assess you should be sure that the pc has answered it to his satisfaction and that he gets acknowledged and that everything is handled first before you start the assessment and when you have assessed and have gotten an item and you ask the pc is that your item this is an auditing question which may take awhile for the pc to answer you have just put him into the middle of his longstanding whirlpool so dont be amazed if it takes awhile for him to complete the cycle he could be going yeah yeah thats why etc etc etc without having answered the question is it your item assessment must never interrupt the auditing cycle but the auditing cycle may at any time interrupt the assessment therefore the auditing cycle is the senior action that doesnt mean that you necessarily spend more time auditing than assessing in any given session especially in r6 auditing is senior because auditing errors can wreck assessment the auditor has two lines going out one to the pc and one to the bank when these lines cross you get sparks in assessing you might use the form is it which has the form of question but dont expect an answer during the assessment there is one home in the bank dont fool around with entities using questions in assessments can bother pc sometimes it works better to use statements so as not to make the pc think that he should answer you wont get any reaction from the bank if the pc intervenes but you dont want the pc on withhold or decision not to be involved or something that gets in the way the pc has to sit there with his ruds in and cooperative assistance and in good comm with the auditor if his bank is to be addressed keep in comm and keep your cycles complete if the pc is in good comm with the auditor you can then address the bank easily therefore the way to put yourself in good comm with the bank is to put yourself in comm with the pc but the pc being in good comm doesnt have to mean that the pc is talking the auditors who assess pcs well are those who are in good comm with the pcs repairing assessments when what is wrong is outcomm will make things far worse it invalidates things found on assessment etc if assessment goes out repair the comm cycle dont just look for bpc in general clean up the comm cycle on any case there is always bpc to be found that doesnt mean that you should spend much time looking for it you could spent lot of time trying to clean the question have i misassigned the bypassed charge because the read you would keep getting is from your assigning the bpc to bank phenomena not session outnesses it could go on reading for twelve hours in the presence of session arc break you can go on finding other bpc continually without the pc feeling any better and you will invalidate and suppress all sorts of auditing work that was done so arc break assessments should begin with is it session arc break is it an r6 arc break or is it an r4 arc break it can be as crude as what list do i use presenttime upsets always seem more important to the pc than past events however tremendous the past events may be never use heavy steel electrodes ninetynine percent of your assessment trouble is really auditing cycle trouble assessment errors themselves can be so productive of upset that the fact that there can be another source of arc breaks can easily be ignored even with the comm cycle in perfectly with the auditor and the pc in complete rapport the session can go up in smoke because of an assessment error especially on wrong goal for instance if the pcs item has been bypassed all you should do if the pc arc breaks is to assess dont try to wc it with the pc you must not audit or address remarks to the pc in the presence of an arc break you never ask the pc single question nor do you acknowledge anything the pc says experience has taught that you cannot communicate with somebody who is out of communication dont audit in the presence of an arc break dont ask question dont acknowledge what the pc says you assess if you get confused and go into shock when the pc suddenly throws the cans at you take break that is better than sitting there slackjawed dont stay near the pc dont try to talk to the pc get your wits sorted out find where the arc break started and go assess find the bpc indicate it get back in comm with the pc and go on doing what you were doing the meter will read during an arc break but only on what is causing the arc break if you find some bpc on case arc break list and the pc doesnt go vgis know that there is something else there is session arc break or some different case arc break r2h can be done either as an arc break assessment or as an assessment for bpc where you stay in comm with the pc during the assessment everything from level iv on up depends on accurate assessment so the auditor must be able to shift rapidly and smoothly from assessment to auditing just because r6 is mostly assessing dont think that you can delete auditing from the session if you try you will have disaster you assess when you assess you audit when you audit dont ever do them both at the same time assessing is straight from auditor to bank
