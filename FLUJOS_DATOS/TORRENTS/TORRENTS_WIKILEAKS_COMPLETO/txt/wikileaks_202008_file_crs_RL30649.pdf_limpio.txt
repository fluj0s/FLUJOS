standards imposed by the religion and free speech clauses of the first amendment on government involvement with religious activities and beliefs in the public schools in pertinent part the first amendment provides that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech because each of these clauses is worded as an absolute it is sometimes ambiguous whether governmental involvement in given situation is forbidden establishment of religion or permissible or required accommodation of free exercise or speech nonetheless the judicial interpretation of these clauses with respect to religious activities and expression in the public schools has been fairly consistent the supreme court has handed down eighteen rulings on various aspects of the matter and the state and lower federal courts have added hundreds more the gravamen of the courts rulings has been that government must be neutral regarding religion in the public schools serving neither as its agent nor as its adversary religious expression that is genuine ly private in turn has been held to be constitutionally protected thus the establishment clause has been held to bar government from using its authority to inculcate or proselytize about religious faith in the public schools either directly or indirectly included in this proscription have been sponsorship of devotional exercises during the school day at school events such as football games and at secondary school graduation ceremonies the adaptation of the school curriculum to particular religious dogmas letting privately sponsored teachers come into the schoolrooms during the school day to give religious instruction permitting only sectarian literature such as the gideon bible to be distributed by outside groups and posting religious affirmations such as the ten commandments on classroom walls on the other hand it has been held to be constitutionally permissible for government to give objective instruction about religion and religious literature as part of secular program of education to sponsor patriotic or ceremonial exercises which incidentally involve professions of faith to accommodate private programs of religious instruction given off the public school premises to permit studentinitiated religious groups to meet in public school facilities during the school day on the same basis as nonreligiou s student groups to allow students to distribute religious literature to permit religious expression in course work and to exempt students with religious objections from particular attendance or curricular requirements the courts have also affirmed the constitutionality of religious expression by students during the school day

life liberty or property without due process of law in cantwell v connecticut 310 us 296 1941 and everson v board of education 330 us 1 1947 the court held the limitations imposed on the federal government by the free exercise and establishment clauses to be part of the liberty protected from undue state interference by the fourteenth amendment the incorporation of the protections of the free speech clause had occurred earlier in gitlow v new york 268 us 652 1925prayer and religion in the public schools what is and is not permitted 1 introduction few issues in american public life have proven to be as persistent and as controversial as the issue of prayer and religion in the public schools the issue has sparked political turmoil at least since the middle of the 19th century and in recent decades it has spawned repeated battles in congress the state legislatures the courts political campaigns and legal journals as constitutional matter the issue primarily concerns the meaning and import of the religion and speech clauses of the first amendment to the constitution providing that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech because these clauses are all worded as absolutes it is often uncertain whether particular religious practices in the public schools should be deemed forms of private religious expression protected by the free exercise andor free speech clauses or to be so infused with governmental action as to constitute forbidden establishment of religion the cases resound with complex questions of whether governments involvement with particular practices has secular or religious purpose and effect whether certain forms of expression constitute private religious speech and whether certain facilities are the type of public fora from which religious expression cannot be excluded particularly since the 1940s when the supreme court first held the religion clauses to apply to the states as well as to the federal government2 the courts have been besieged with cases challenging the constitutionality of variety of practices relating to religion in the public schools the supreme court itself has handed down eighteen decisions on various aspects of the issue in the past four and half decades and the state and lower federal courts have handed down hundreds more the practices that have been challenged have included regular devotional exercises such as prayer and bible reading the teaching of evolution and creationism shared

prayers in commencement exercises and pregame ceremonies at football games compulsory recitations of the pledge of allegiance prescribed moments of silence the hanging of wall plaques containing religious affirmations and restrictions on religious expression in course work notwithstanding this plethora of judicial decisions and despite continuing political controversy over many of the rulings the body of law that has developed has reflected fairly consistent interpretation and application of the first amendment not all of the issues can be said to have been judicially resolved let alone politically accepted but the courts interpretation of the first amendment with respect to prayer and religion in the public schools has been sufficiently consistent to permit narrative overview this report summarizes each of the pertinent supreme court decisions gives detailed overview of what the courts have held to be constitutionally permitted and proscribed and identifies and describes two issues that arguably still remain unsettled3 supreme court decisions in eleven decisions the supreme court has held government sponsorship of or involvement with religious expression in the public schools to violate the establishment of religion clause in seven other decisions however the court has held government accommodation of religious activities or beliefs in the public schools to be constitutionally mandated or at least permissible the following sections summarize each of these decisions under the rubrics of devotional exercises b religious instruction c private religious speech and d religious objections to curricular requirements devotional exercises 1 daily prayer and bible reading in engel v vitale4 in 1962 and abington school district v schempp5 in 1963 the supreme court held the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment to be violated by government sponsorship of daily devotional activities such as prayer and bible reading in the public elementary and secondary schools engel involved requirement of local board of education in new york that students recite at the beginning of each school day prayer which had been composed and recommended for use by the new york state board of regents almighty god we acknowledge our dependence upon thee and we beg thy blessings upon us our parents our teachers and our countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs3 6 id this is the case that had been initiated by madalyn murray ohair 7 justice black authored the opinion of the court in engel in which chief justice warren and justices douglas clark harlan and brennan joined justice douglas wrote concurring opinion as well justice stewart filed dissenting opinion justices frankfurter and white did not participate 8 justice clark authored the opinion of the court in abington in which chief justice warren and justices black douglas harlan brennan white and goldberg joined justices douglas brennan and goldberg each wrote concurring opinion as well justice stewart as in engel submitted dissenting opinion 9 engel v vitale supra at 425 and 430 10 abington school district v schempp supra at 203 11 engel v vitale supra at 43132abington and the companion case of murray v curlett6 concerned state requirements that each school day begin with readings from the bible and the unison recital of the lords prayer in each case the states made provision for the excusal or nonparticipation of students at their request or the request of parent or guardian notwithstanding the excusal provisions the court by 61 majority in engel7 and an 81 majority in abington8 held the exercises to be religious in nature and the states sponsorship to violate the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment in engel the court asserted the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this country it is part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the american people to recite as part of religious program carried on by government government in this country be it state or federal is without power to prescribe by law any particular form of prayer which is to be used as an official prayer in carrying on any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity9 similarly in abington the court held the biblereading exercises are religious exercises required by the states in violation of the command of the first amendment that the government maintain strict neutrality neither aiding nor opposing religion10 in both opinions the court looked beyond the immediate words of the establishment clause to determine its meaning in engel it surveyed european and colonial history and identified two broad purposes underlying the establishment clause its first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion the establishment clause thus stands as an expression of principle on the part of the founders of our constitution that religion is too personal too sacred too holy to permit its unhallowed perversion by civil magistrate11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs4 12 idat 433 13 374 us at 216 14 id at 222 emphasis added in most subsequent cases the court has continued to use the standards articulated by justice clark and has added third aspect whether the legislative enactment leads to excessive government entanglem ent with religion walz v tax commission of the city of new york 397 us 664 1970 because the court first gave the tripartite version of the test its full articulation in lemon v kurtzman 403 us 602 1971 the test has come to be known as the lemon test the court has become sharply divided on the utility and applicability of the lemon test however and as consequence it is longer the exclusive test the court uses for establishment clause cases the court still uses the test indeed it used it in its most recent decision concerning prayer in the public schools see santa fe independent school district v doe 120 sct 2266 2000 but the court also now uses the endorsement and coercion tests in agostini v felton 521 us 203 1997 it might be noted the court modified the lemon test by making the entanglement inquiry part of the inquiry into primary effect at least for cases involving public aid to sectarian schools substantively the entanglement inquiry appears to remain unchanged and in any event the entanglement prong of the lemon test has not often been major factor in cases involving religious expression in the public schools the second purpose the court said rested upon an awareness of the historical fact that governmentally established religions and religious persecutions go hand in hand it was in large part to get completely away from systematic religious persecution that the founders brought into being our nation our constitution and our bill of rights with its prohibition against any governmental establishment of religion12 in abington the court stressed that its previous decisions had rejected unequivocally the contention that the establishment clause forbids only governmental preference of one religion over another13 taken together with the free exercise clause the court stated the establishment clause imposes on government wholesome neutrality toward religion it can neither favor one sect over all others nor religion generally over nonreligion nor nonreligion over religion to be constitutional the court said government action must be able to meet what subsequently became the lemon test the test may be stated as follows what are the purpose and the primary effect of the enactment if either is the advancement or inhibition of religion the enactment exceeds the scope of legislative power as circumscribed by the constitution that is to say that to withstand the strictures of the establishment clause there must be secular legislative purpo and primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion14 in both cases the court rejected the argument that the voluntary nature of the prayer and biblereading exercises freed them from the strictures of the establishment clause the establishment clause unlike the free exercise clause does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the enactmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs5 15 engel v vitale supra at 421 in neither case did the court actually make any finding with respect to whether participation in the exercises was in fact voluntary holding that issue not to be material to its decisions it suggested however that because of compulsory schooling peer pressure and the official sanction given the exercises voluntary participation might be an impossibility see engel v vitale supra at 431 and abington school district v schempp supra at 223 16 justice black in engel noted that those who led the fight for religious freedom were themselves religious men and that the first amendment grew out of an awareness that governments of the past had shackled mens tongues to make them speak and to pray only to the god that government wanted them to pray to thus he concluded it is neither sacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely religious function to the people themselves and to those the people choose to look to for religious guidance 370 us at 421 17 justice clark said in abington the breach of neutrality that is today trickling stream may all too soon become raging torrent and in the words of madison it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties 374 us at 225 18 justice clark stated in abington while the free exercise clause clearly prohibits the use of state action to deny the rights of free exercise to anyone it has never meant that majority could use the machinery of the state to practice its beliefs 374 us at 226 19 engel v vitale supra at 445 stewart j dissentingof laws which establish an official religion whether those laws operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not15 it rejected as well the arguments that to deny states the power to prescribe religious activities in the public schools indicated hostility toward religion16 that the encroachments on the first amendment made by stateprescribed prayer and bible reading in the public schools were so minor and insignificant as to be minimis17 and that not to allow the exercises denied the majority the free exercise of their religion18 justice stewart dissented in both engel and abington with all respect he said in engel i think the court has misapplied great constitutional principle i cannot see how an official religion is established by letting those who want to say prayer say it on the contrary i think that to deny the wish of these school children to join in reciting this prayer is to deny them the opportunity of sharing in the spiritual heritage of our nation19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs6 20 id at 446 21 abington school district

1964 per curiam on remand 171 so2d 535 fla 1965citing numerous instances in which religious affirmations are made in public life justice stewart rejected the majoritys reliance on european and colonial history to give meaning to the establishment clause what is relevant he said is the history of the religious practices of our people reflected in countless practices of the institutions and officials of our government20 similarly in abington justice stewart contended that the central value embodied in the first amendment is the safeguarding of an individuals right to free exercise of his religion 21 and he suggested that the majority ignored that right in this case compulsory state educational system so structures childs life that if religious exercises are held to be an impermissible activity in schools religion is placed at an artificial and statecreated disadvantage viewed in this light permission of such exercises for those who want them is necessary if the schools are truly to be neutral in matters of religion and refusal to permit religious exercises thus is seen not as the realization of state neutrality but rather as the establishment of religion of secularism or at the least as government support of the beliefs of those who think that religious exercises should be conducted only in private22 justice stewart did not view the prayer and bible reading exercises in abington and murray necessarily to be constitutional the records he said were too thin to know and consequently he urged that the cases be remanded for further factfinding but the key question he said is whether government authority is used to coerce preference among religious beliefs if the exercises were held before or after the official school day or were simply one among number of desirable alternatives he asserted one could claim that they did anything more than to provide an opportunity for the voluntary expression of religious belief on the other hand he said if there were excusal provision or alternative activities provided by school authorities the likelihood that children might be under at least some psychological compulsion to participate would be great23 the courts decisions in engel and abington spawned variety of efforts in the states both to avoid and to defy the rulings subsequently the court has reviewed on the merits only three of the cases resulting from these efforts but in each case it has reaffirmed the continuing vitality of engel and abington in chamberlin v dade county board of public instru ction24 the court reversed in brief per curiam

577 1992 justice kennedy authored the courts opinion in weisman which was joined by justices blackmun stevens oconnor and souter justices blackmun and souter each filed concurring opinions as well in each of which justices stevens and oconnor joined justice scalia issued dissenting opinion in which chief justice rehnquist and justices white and thomas joined 28 id at 598b v treen25 the court summarily affirmed lower federal court decision holding unconstitutional louisiana statute and local school boards implementing regulation which permitted teachers to ask for student volunteers to offer prayer at the beginning of each school day and if student volunteered to offer prayer themselves finally in wallace v jaffree26 the court summarily affirmed lower federal court decision holding unconstitutional an alabama statute which permitted teachers to lead students in prayer and set forth the text of prayer to be recited in sum then the supreme court in engel and abington and in three subsequent summary decisions has held government sponsorship of daily devotional activities such as prayer and bible reading in the public schools to constitute an establishment of religion and thus to be beyond governments constitutional power 2 commenceme nt prayers in 1992 the court in lee v weisman held unconstitutional 54 public secondary schools inclusion of an invocation and benediction by clergyman in its graduation ceremony27 in this instance the principal had decided that the prayers should be included chosen rabbi to deliver the prayers directed that the prayers be nonsectarian and instructed the students to stand as group and maintain respectful silence during the prayers explicitly reaffirming the school prayer decisions detailed in the preceding section the court said that the prayer exercises in this case are especially improper because the state has in every practical sense compelled attendance and participation in an explicit religious exercise at an event of singular importance to every student 28 reflecting its growing disenchantment with the lemon test the court for the second time in its modern establishment clause jurisprudence chose not to use the testhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs8 29 the previous instance was marsh v chambers 463 us 783 1983 in which the court upheld as constitutional the offering of prayers by chaplain at the opening of sessions of legislative bodies subsequently the court has also eschewed use of the lemon test in zobrest v catalina foothills school district 509 us 1 1993 board of education of the kiryas joel village school district v grumet 512 us 687 1994 and rosenberger v the rector and visitors of the university of virginia 515 us 819 1995 but it used the lemon test in lambs chapel v center moriches union free school district 508 us 384 1993 pointedly noting that lemon has not been overruled agostini v felton 521 us 203 1997 sante fe independent school district v doe supra and mitchell v helms

legislative prayer and school prayer the continuedin analyzing the case29 instead the court used the principle that at minimum the constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise noting that prayer exercises in public schools carry particular risk of indirect coercion the court concluded that in this instance the state in school setting in effect required participation in religious exercise even though the prayer exercises were brief the court said the intrusion on religious conscience was both real and in the context of secondary school violation of the objectors rights government it stated may more use social pressure to enforce orthodoxy than it may use more direct means30 the court rejected the argument that students were not coerced into participating in religious exercise because participation in the graduation ceremony was nominally voluntary law reaches past formalism it said and to say teenage student has real choice not to attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the extreme31 it rejected as well the argument that the nonsectarian or civic nature of the prayer exercises rendered them unobjectionable stating that the design of the constitution is that preservation and transmission of religious beliefs and worship is responsibility and choice committed to the private sphere which itself is promised freedom to pursue that mission finally the court differentiated this case from the legislative chaplains prayer held to be constitutional in marsh v chambers supra on the grounds that legislative prayer involves adults and that attendance is voluntary the atmosphere at the opening of session of state legislature where adults are free to enter and leave with little comment and for any number of reasons cannot compare with the constraining potential of the one school event most important for the student to attend the influence and force of formal exercise in school graduation are far greater than the prayer exercise we condoned in marsh at high school graduation teachers and principals must and do retain high degree of control over the precise contents of the program the speeches the timing the movements the dress and the decorum of the students in this atmosphere the stateimposed character of an invocation and benediction by clergy selected by the

religious exercise may be conducted at graduation ceremony in circumstances where as we have found young graduates who object are induced to conform holding by this court suggests that school can persuade or compel student to particip ate in religious exercise that is being done here and it is forbidden by the establishment clause of the first amendment33 justice scalia joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices white and thomas dissented accusing the majority of laying waste to tradition that is as old as public school graduation ceremonies themselves and that is component of an even more longstanding american tradition of nonsectarian prayer to god at public celebrations generally he charged that the court invents boundless and boundlessly manipulable test of psychological coercion34 the establishment clause he said should be interpreted in light of american history and the history and tradition of our nation he asserted are replete with public ceremonies featuring prayers of thanksgiving and petition moreover he stated coercion ought to be construed to mean by force of law and threat of penalty not the majoritys ersatz peerpressure psychocoercion nothing in this case he argued compelled anyone to participate in religious exercise 3 prayers at football games in santa fe independent school district v doe35 the court held school districts policy permitting students to vote on whether to have an invocation andor message delivered prior to home football games by student chosen for that purpose to violate the establishment clause 63 under the policy the high school student body would vote each spring whether to have an invocation or message during the pregame ceremonies and if they voted to do so would choose who would deliver it from list of student volunteers in another election the student would then determine what invocation or message to deliver the court held the policy on its face to violate each one of the tests it has formulated for establishment clause cases the preference given for an invocation in the text of the policy the long history of pregame prayer led by student chaplain in the school district and the widespread perception that the policy is about prayer the court said made clear that the purpose of the prayer was not secular but was to preserve popular statesponsored religious practice in violation of the first prong of the lemon test moreover it said the policy violated the coercion test by forcing unwilling students into participating in religious exercise some students the cheerleaders the band the football players had to attend it said and others were compelled byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs10 36 id at 228081 quoting lee v weisman supra at 596 37 id at 2283 38 id at 2288 rehnquist cj dissentingpeer pressure to do so the constitutional command will not permit the district to exact religious conformity from student as the price of joining her classmates at varsity football game36 the court held finally justice stevens wrote the policy violated the endorsement test the school district argued that the pregame ceremonies constituted public forum and that the election system guaranteed that the speech would be private student speech and not governmentsponsored speech but the court said that nothing evidenced any intention on the part of the school district to open the pregame ceremonies for speech generally and it stated in any event the election system violated the principle of viewpoint neutrality essential to such forum because it guaranteed that only majority views would prevail and that minority candidates and their views would be effectively silenced in addition it held the long history of pregame prayer the bias toward religion in the policy itself the fact that the message would be delivered to large audience assembled as part of regularly scheduled schoolsponsored function conducted on school property and over the schools public address system all meant that the speech was not genuine private speech but would be perceived as stamped with the schools seal of approval the court concluded the policy is invalid on its face because it establishes an improper majoritarian election on religion and unquestionably has the purpose and creates the perception of encouraging the delivery of prayer at series of important school events37 chief justice rehnquist joined by justices scalia and thomas dissented charging that the courts ruling bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life and was wrong both procedurally and substantively procedurally he argued the court should have waited for the policy to be implemented before ruling on its constitutionality so that there would be record showing whether the elections were in fact about prayer they might be he said but they might also focus on other factors and the students he stated might even choose not to have pregame message substantively he contended the court was wrong in saying that the policy was biased toward religion that the student message would be public speech and not private speech and that the history of pregame prayer in the school district evidenced purpose of continuing the practice solemnization he argued is not necessarily religious the content of any message that would be delivered was wholly within the control of the student speaker and the history of the policy showed that it was an effort to come into compliance with court order he concluded the policy at issue here may be applied in an unconstitutional manner but it will be time enough to invalidate it if that is found to be the case38 4 moments of silence in wallace v jaffree the court held unconstitutional 63 an alabama statute prescribing that each day in both elementary and secondaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs11 39 wallace v jaffree 472 us 38 1985 justice stevens authored the opinion of the court in which justices brennan marshall blackmun and powell

and rehnquist each authored dissenting opinions 40 id at 4849 41 id at 59school begin with period of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer39 the court found that the alabama legislature adopted the statute in question in 1981 for the sole purpose of expressing the states endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each school day another statute previously adopted by alabama in 1978 it noted already provided for moment of silence at the beginning of each school day for purposes of meditation the legislative history of the addition of the phrase or voluntary prayer in the later statute it concluded clearly showed that the statute was intended to serve secular purpose and was of wholly religious character the court rebutted at length what it termed alabamas remarkable contention that the establishment of religion clause bars only congress and not the states from imposing an official religion it is appropriate to recall how firmly embedded in our constitutional jurisprudence is the proposition that the several states have greater power to restrain the individual freedoms protected by the first amendment than does the congress of the united states when the constitution was amended to prohibit the states from depriving any person of liberty without due process of law that amendment imposed the same substantive limitations on the states power to legislate that the first amendment has always imposed on the congress power this court has confirmed and endorsed this elementary proposition of law time and time again40 finally the court stressed in wallace that it was not holding all moment of silence provisions to be unconstitutional the legislative intent to return prayer to the public schools is of course quite different from merely protecting every students right to engage in voluntary prayer during an appropriate moment of silence during the schoolday the 1978 statute already protected that right 41 chief justice burger and justices white and rehnquist dissented the chief justice contended that the mere addition of the word prayer to alabamas silent meditatio n statute as one of the permitted activities should not be taken as an endorsement of religion and that the majority misread the legislativ history of the statute justice white agreed and called for basic reconsideration of our precedents justice rehnquist penned an extensive critique of the metaphor wall of separation between church and state the lemon test and the history the court had previously used to support its interpretation of the meaning of the establishment clause he agreed that the states are prohibited by the incorporation of the firsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs12 42 id at 113 rehnquist j dissenting 43 id at 114 not long after wallace another moment of silence case came before the court this one involving new jersey statute prescribing moment of silence for quiet and private contemplation or introspection that had been held unconstitutional by the lower courts but the court found that the parties who brought the appeal to it had standing to do so and as consequence it did not reach the merits of the case see may v

illinois statute 45 id at 211 46 zorach v clauson 343 us 306 1952 justice douglas wrote the opinion of the court continuedamendment into the fourteenth from establishing religion but he said as its history abundantly shows nothing in the establishment clause requires government to be strictly neutral between religion and irreligion nor does that clause prohibit congress or the states from pursuing legitimate secular ends through nondiscriminatory sectarian means42 even if the alabama statute were understood to favor prayer he contended nothing in the establishment clause of the first amendment properly understood prohibits any such generalized endorsement of prayer43 b religious instruction 1 shared time programs in the 1948 case of mccollum v board of education the court held unconstitutional 81 shared time program in which the public schools permitted teachers employed by private religious groups to come into the schools each week to teach religion to consenting students44 the schools did not employ the teachers but cooperated closely with the program the teachers were subject to the approval and supervision of the superintendent of schools reports of students attendance at the classes were made to the school and nonparticipating students were required to go elsewhere in the school building the court held the program to constitute utilization of the taxestablished and taxsupported public school system to aid religious groups to spread their faith as such the court said it falls squarely under the ban of the first amendment state cannot consistently with the first and fourteenth amendments utilize its public school system to aid any or all religious faiths or sects in the dissemination of their doctrines and ideals 45 2 released time

though scopes conviction was overturned on technicality the tennessee supreme court held the statute itself to be constitutional scopes v state 154 tenn 105 289 sw 363 1927elementary and secondary school children so desiring to leave the school premises at designated time during the school day to receive religious instruction from private teachers in nearby private facilities the court differentiated this program from that held unconstitutional in mccollum by stating in the mccollum case the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction here the public schools do more than accommodate their schedules to program of outside religious instruction47 the first amendment the court stated forbids any concert or union or dependency between church and state but it does not require that they be aliens to each other hostile suspicious and even unfriendly in oftquoted dicta justice douglas concluded for the court when the state encourages religious instruction or cooperate s with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs it follows the best of our traditions for it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs government may not finance religious groups nor undertake religious instruction nor blend secular and sectarian education nor use secular institutions to force one or some religion on any person but it can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction more than that is undertaken here48 3 evolution and creationism in epperson v arkansas49 the court unanimously held unconstitutional state statute which forbade teachers upon pain of criminal penalty from teaching the darwinian theory of evolution the statute was variant of the one involved in the famous scopes trial in 192750 and made it unlawful for any teacher to teach or to use textbook which taught the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from lower order of animals the court found that fundamentalist sectarian conviction was and is the laws reason for existence and because of that held the statute to violate the establishment clause justice fortas stated the general principles governing the case as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs14 51 epperson v arkansas supra at 10304 52 epperson v arkansas supra at 106 53 id at 107 and 109 54 edwards v aguillard 482 us 578 1987 justice brennan

concurred only in the courts conclusion and authored separate opinion detailing his reasoning justice scalia joined by chief justice rehnquist filed dissenting opinion arguing that the majority misread the statutes legislative history and that in any event courts should not lightly impugn the motives of legislators 55 id at 591 56 id at 597government in our democracy state and national must be neutral in matters of religious theory doctrine and practice it may not be hostile to any religion or to the advocacy of noreligion and it may not aid foster or promote one religion or religiou s theory against the militant opposite the first amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion and between religion and nonreligion51 more particularly he said the first amendment does not permit the state to require that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma52 in this instance he stated there can be doubt that arkansas has sought to prevent its teachers from discussing the theory of evolution because it is contrary to the belief of some that the book of genesis must be the exclusive source of doctrine as to the origin of man there is doubt that the motivation for the law was the same as that in tennessees monkey law to suppress the teaching of theory which it was thought denied the divine creation of man53 the state might have acted in religiously neutral manner the court suggested if it had simply excised from its curricula all discussion of the origins of mankind but instead it said the state tried to blot out particular theory because of its supposed conflict with particular interpretation of the book of genesis by particular religious group that effort the court concluded was plainly unconstitutional two decades later in 1987 the court reemphasized this reasoning in holding unconstitutional louisiana statute that required teachers to give balanced treatment to evolution and creationism if they taught the subject at all in edwards v aguillard the court held 7254 that in enacting the statute the preeminent purpose of the louisiana legislature was clearly to advance the religious viewpoint that supernatural being created mankind55 stating that it would not be blind to the historic and contemporaneous antagonisms between the teachings of certain religious denomination s and the teaching of evolution the court struck down the statute because it seeks to employ the symbolic and financial support of government to achieve religious purpose56 there was justice brennan

justice powell wrote the opinion of the court continuedsham the acts purpose he wrote was to restructure the science curriculum to conform with particular religious viewpoint and to give preference to those religious groups which have as one of their tenets the creation of humankind by divine creator the court concluded because the primary purpose of the creationism act is to endorse particular religious doctrine the act furthers religion in violation of the establishment clause57 4 posting of the ten commandments in the fifth decision in this area the court in stone v graham held unconstitutional 54 kentucky statute which required that copy of the ten commandments purchased with private contributions be posted on the wall of each public classroom in the state58 the court notwithstanding contrary declarations by the state legislature found the preeminent purpose of the posting requirement to be plainly religious in nature the ten commandments is undeniably sacred text in the jewish and christian faiths and legislative recitation of supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact59 as consequence the court held that the mere posting of the copies under the auspices of the legislature provided the official support of the state government that the establishment clause prohibits in sum then the court in mccollum zorach epperson aguillard and stone held the establishment clause to bar government from using or permitting private groups to use the public schools to inculcate the tenets or beliefs of any religious faith c private religious speech 1 noncurricula r religious expression by students in three decisions the court has held that students at the secondary andor college levels have legal right to join together for purposes of noncurricular religious expression to the same extent as they may do so for nonreligious purposes in widmar v vincent the court in 1981 held 81 that public university which permits student groups to use its facilities for secular purposes may not bar such groups from using the facilities for religious worship and discussion60 the court based this holding not on the free

affirmed the constitutionality of the act under the endorsement test but only on the condition that westside take several steps to more effectively disassociate itself from the religious clubs speech justice stevens dissented on the grounds the act should be given more narrow construction and that the court failed to address the resulting establishment clause issues 63 20 usc 407174 1988clause but on the free speech clause of the first amendment saying that religious worship and discussion are forms of speech and association protected by the first amendment the court asserted that once the university of missourikansas city opened its facilities for use by student organizations it created limited public forum consequently it held under the free speech clause the university could not discriminate in the kinds of speech it permitted unless it had compelling reason for doing so the university argued that conformance with the establishment clause and with missouris history of strict churchstate separation constituted sufficient justification for its ban but the court disagreed saying that permitting student groups to use campus facilities for religious purposes would neither place the imprimatur of university sponsorsh ip on any sectarian belief or practice nor single out religious groups for special benefits the court concluded having forum generally open to student groups the university seeks to enforce contentbased exclusion of religious speech its exclusionary policy violates the fundamental principle that state regulation of speech should be contentneutral and the university is unable to justify this violation under applicable constitutional standards61 in board of education of westside community schools v mergens the court in an 81 decision held constitutional federal statute extending the widmar principle to the secondary school level62 the statute at issue the equal access act63 was adopted in 1984 and bars public secondary schools that

opinion in which justices stevens ginsburg and breyer joined 66 id at 834 67 lambs chapel v center moriches union free school district 508 us 384 1993 continuedspeech at such meetings in mergens the court construed the act broadly as remedy against perceived widespread discrimination against religious speech in public schools and held it to apply any time school permits even one noncurriculumrelated student group to meet the court further held the act as construed not to violate the establishment clause justice oconnor asserted there is crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion which the establishment clause forbids and private speech endorsing religion we think that secondary school students are mature enough and are likely to understand that school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on nondiscriminatory basis64 rosenberger v rector and visitors of the university of virginia raised another issue regarding student religious speech namely the constitutionality of excluding student religious publication from college program subsidizing the printing costs of all other student publications the court held the constitution to mandate the religious publications inclusion 5465 the court said that exclusion of the student religious publication from the subsidy program amounted to viewpoint discrimination in violation of the free speech clause of the first amendment it is axiomatic justice kennedy wrote that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys once the government opens limited public forum he said it may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint in this instance the university sought simply to encourage diversity of views from private speakers he stated and as consequen ce the denial of the subsidy to the religious publication violated the students right of free speech the court further held that the extension of the subsidy to the student religious publication would not violate the establishment clause central lesson of our decisions is that significant factor in upholding governmental programs in the face of establishment clause attack is their neutrali ty toward religion we have held that the guarantee of neutrality is respected not offended when the government following neutral criteria and evenhande d policies extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints including religious ones are broad and diverse66 2 afterschool use of premises by outside religious groups in lambs chapel v center moriches union free school district in 1993 the court

facilities to be used for social civic and recreational purposes outside of school hours but it prohibited their use by any group for religious purposes justice white writing for the court concluded that the exclusion of religious groups was not viewpoint neutral and thus violated the free speech clause it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and childrearing except those dealing with the subject matter from religious viewpoint he said all other groups could use the facilities for lectures or film series about family values he noted only presentations from religious perspective were banned the school argued that the establishment clause required it to exclude religious meetings but the court rejected the argument there was realistic danger in this instance justice white claimed that the community would think that the district was endorsing religion or any particular creed the film series would have been shown outside of school hours it would not have been sponsored by the school it would have been open to the public and the facilities had been repeatedly used for similar purposes by wide variety of private organizations under those conditions he concluded any benefit to religion or to any particular creed would have been more than incidental in sum then the court in widmar and mergens held that students at the secondary school and college levels have legal right to meet together in school facilities for religious purposes on the same basis as they may meet together for other noncurricular purposes in rosenberger it held that at the university level student religious publications must be treated the same as student nonreligious publications in any program subsidizing the expression of diversity of viewpoints finally in lambs chapel it held that outside religious groups cannot be discriminated against in the afterschool use of school facilities d religious objections to curricular requirements in two decisions the court has held the free exercise and free speech clauses to compel education authorities to honor religious objections to certain curricular requirements the first case arose in the middle of world war ii and confronted the court with conflict between west virginia requirement that all students join together each day in saluting the flag and reciting the pledge of allegiance and the religiously motivated refusal of students who were jehovahs witnesses to participate the court initially held the compulsory flag salute and pledge to be constitutional68 but in west virginia state board of education v barnette the court overturned that ruling and held 63 that state compulsion of such affirmations of belief invades

the decision 72 id at 210realm of intellect and spirit protected by the first amendment69 resting the decision more on the free speech clause of the first amendment than the free exercise clause the court asserted those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves eliminating dissenters compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard it seems trite but necessary to say that the first amendment to our constitution was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings if there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that official high or petty can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism or religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein70 thus the court held that government can sponsor patriotic ceremonies involving the flag salute and recitation of the pledge of allegiance in the schools but that it cannot compel students to participate in 1972 the court in wisconsin v yoder held 61 that wisconsin could not constitutionally compel amish children to attend school beyond the eighth grade over the religious objections of their parents71 the court noted that the old order amish communities hold fundamental belief that salvation requires life in church community separate and apart from the world and worldly influences and that their religion dictates devotion to life in harmony with nature and the soil72 although recognizing the importance of the states duty to educate its citizens the court found that schooling beyond the eighth grade would gravely endanger if not destroy the amish religion and way of life and as consequence held the free exercise clause to compel an exemption for them from the compulsory education requirement at the high school level in sum the court in barnette and yoder recognized albeit to an indeterminate degree constitutional right of students andor parents not to be compelled to participate in school programs or activities violative of their religious conscienceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs20 73 dicta on this matter in supreme court decisions abound in engel for instance the court noted it might well be said that ones education is not complete without study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization it certainly may be said that the bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the bible or of religion when presented objectively as part of secular program of education may not be effected consistently with the first amendment 374 us 203 225 in epperson it reiterated study of religion and of the bible from literary and historic viewpoint presented objectively as part of secular program of education need not collide with the first amendments prohibition 393 us 97 106 in stone v graham the court stated this is not

principles the supreme court has articulated the continuedthe supreme court has also held that groups that offer religious perspective on subjects otherwise permitted to be discussed in school facilities outside of school hours must be permitted to use the facilities87 finally several lower federal courts have affirmed that teachers have discretionary authority to allow religious expression in assigned course work88httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs27 88 continued court has made clear that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate but it has also made clear that the constitutional rights of students in public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings the general standard appears to be that educators do not offend the first amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in schoolsponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns see tinker v des moines independent community school district 393 us 503 506 1969 bethel school district 43 v fraser 478 us 675 682 1986 and hazelwood school district v kuhimeier 484 us 260 1988 respectively thus the courts have construed the religion and speech clauses of the first amendment to give government considerable room to teach about religion and to accommodat incidental and private religious expression in the public schools litigation in this area of the law is necessarily factspecific but in general judicial interpretations of the first amendment have held that there is constitutional or other legal barrier at the federal level to government providing objective instruction about religion in the public schools including religious literature holidays and music releasing students during the school day to receive religious instruction off the school premises accommodating nondisruptive religious speech and the distribution of religious literature by students permitting studentinitiated religious groups to meet in school facilities for religious purposes sponsoring noncompulsory patriotic or ceremonial exercises that involve incidental professions of faith legislating moments of silence for meditation or reflection exempting students with religious objections from particular course requirements renting school facilities to private religious groups for the purpose of baccalaureate services or other meetings on the same basis as rentals to nonreligious groups and allowing religious expression in student course work where pedagogically appropriate b what is legally prohibited nonetheless the scope of the limitations imposed by the establishment clause of the first amendment remains broad government is constitutionally barred from using the public schools directly or indirectly to inculcate religious faith or belief thus government has been held to be legally prohibited from sponsoring or prescribing regular devotional exercises such as prayer and bible reading in the public schools this proscription has been held to apply to organized devotional

valedictorian to deliver speech with religious content at commencement ceremony upheld all holding the inclusion of prayer in commencement ceremonies to be unconstitutionalin addition the first amendment has been construed not to prohibit government from barring teachers from wearing religious attire issues not yet definitively resolved despite the plethora of judicial decisions concerning religion in the public schools not all issues can be said as yet to have been definitively resolved two issues in particular stand out at the moment 1 the constitutionality of student initiated religious expression at high school commencement ceremonies and 2 whether religious groups are constitutionally entitled to use school facilities outside of school hours for religious worship and instruction if the facilities are generally available for social civic and recreational purposes religious expression at secon dary school commencement ceremonies as noted above the supreme court in lee v weisman supra held the establishment clause to be violated by prayers given by clergyman at the principals invitation at public secondary schools commencement exercise the court stated that because of the singular importance of graduation to every student the inclusion of prayers in the ceremony in effect coerced students into participating in an explicit religious exercise and was therefore unconstitutional prior to weisman the state and lower courts had been divided on the issue of the constitutionality of including invocations and benedictions in commencement ceremonies102 the courts reasoning in weisman appeared to some to be broad enough to lay the question to rest but subsequently the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit upheld as constitutional school district policy permitting the graduating senior class to choose whether to have prayers at their graduation ceremonies and if they decided to do so to select student volunteers to give nonsectarian nonproselytizing invocations in jones v clear creekhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs34 103 977 f2d 963 5th cir 1992 cert den 508 us 967 1993 104 168 f3d 806 1999 105 see ingebretsen v

appellate court differentiated studentinitiated and studentled prayers from the schoolinitiated and clergyled prayers struck down in weisman the purpose and primary effect of the policy the fifth circuit said was to solemnize graduation ceremonies not to advance religion it asserted that the policy passively permitted prayer but did not endorse it and it concluded that the policy had less coercive effect on participation than the schools active involvement in weisman because any prayer at graduation that resulted emanate d not from an authority figure from the school or clergy but from student peer the fifth circuit has subsequently reaffirmed that ruling and it recently made clear in santa fe independent school district v doe104 that the nonsectarian and nonproselytizing nature of the student prayers is constitutionally essential element105 however two other federal courts of appeal have reached the opposite conclusion with respect to student elections to have or not have commencement prayer in joint school district 241 v harris106 the ninth circuit before the case was held to be mooted by the students graduation held such policy to violate the establishment clause it stated that the graduating class was as bound by the constitution as the school district and that constitutional rights could not be subjected to majority vote in aclu v blackhorse pike regional board of education107 the third circuit reached an identical conclusion stating that student referendum does not erase the states imprint from this graduation prayer108 more recently the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit upheld variant of the clear creek policy in adler v duval county school board109 it found constitutional policy permitting the graduating seniors to decide whether to have brief opening andor closing message at their graduation and if they chose to do so to select student to give the message the policy made reference to prayer or an invocation and required that the student volunteer have total control over the content of the message and that it not be reviewed by school authorities the court reasoned that the policy effectively divorced school officials from the decision whether to have message as well as from its content and that as consequence any religious content in the message could not be attributed to the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs35 110 147 f3d 832 9th cir opinion withdrawn and decision vacated as moot 177 f3d 789 9th cir 1999 111 it might be noted that the result may not necessarily be the same at the public university level in tanford v brand 104 f3d 982 7th cir cert den 522 us 814 1997 the seventh circuit upheld as constitutional public universitys policy of inviting religious leader to give an invocation and benediction to its graduation ceremony each year the court differentiated this from lee v weisman supra on the grounds the attendees were mature attendance was wholly voluntary peer pressure was minimal and the prayers simply solemnized the event similarly in chaudhuri v tennessee 130 f3d 232 6th cir 1997 cert den 523 us 1024 1998 the appellate court upheld public universitys practice of having moment of silence as well as its previous practice of having nonsectarian prayers by local religious leaders and faculty members the court said the latter practice served the legitimate secular purpose of solemnizing the occasion and would not be perceived by reasonable observer as an attempt to indoctrinate the audience any effect of endorsement the court said was indirect remote and incidental similarly it said any entanglement with religion was minimis in another decision subsequently vacated as moot the ninth circuit in doe v madison school district 321110 upheld school district policy that permitted each high school administration to invite up to four students to speak at their schools commencement exercises the students were chosen according to academic standing and could choose to deliver an address poem reading song musical presentation prayer or any other pronouncement and the administration was barred from censoring or controlling any presentation in upholding the policy the court cited three factors students not clergy delivered the presentations they were selected by wholly neutral and secular criterion academic standing and they had complete autonomy over the content of their presentations the supreme court has not as yet decided to review case specifically raising any of these variants in the context of graduation ceremonies the fifth circuit decisions in clear creek and santa fe and the ninth circuit decision in harris were appealed to the court but the court chose not to review clear creek or this aspect of santa fe and it vacated the harris decision as moot adler of course is now pending on the courts docket nonetheless substantial doubt now exists that the clear creek policy remains constitutional in the part of santa fe independent school district v doe that the court did review it struck down as unconstitutional similar policy that applied to football games as noted above see p 9 the court held that notwithstanding the mechanism of student elections the policy still violated all three of the tests the court has employed for establishment clause cases the lemon test the coercion test and the endorsement test it is as consequence difficult to see how the same policy can pass constitutional muster simply because it involves graduation ceremony111 nonetheless additional litigation on this subject seems likely before it can be said to be fully settledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs36 112 508 us 384 1993 113 id at 394 quoting city council of angeles v taxpayers for vincent 466 us 789 804 1984 114 127 f3d 207 2d cir 1997 cert den 523 us 934 1998b use of school facilities after school hours for religious worship as noted above see p 17 the court in lambs chapel v center moriches free school district112 held that excluding religious groups from using school facilities for film series offering religious perspective when the facilities are generally open for use by other social civic and recreational groups violates the free speech clause of the first amendment even in nonpublic forum it stated restrictions on expression must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral public entity cannot open public forum for the discussion of certain subjects it asserted and then bar particular viewpoints from being expressed the first amendment the court stated forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others113 nonetheless number of subsequent decisions in the second circuit and one in the fifth circuit have held that even when school district opens its facilities for general use by social civic and recreational groups and allows the discussion of secular subjects from religious perspective it is constitutionally permissible to bar the use of facilities for religious worship and instruction such discrimination several courts have said is permissible content or subject matter discrimination rather than impermissible viewpoint discrimination under the free speech clause the majority of the decisions have occurred in new york and involve state statute permitting but not requiring local school districts to open school property for inter alia social civic and recreational meetings and entertainments and other community welfare uses provided such uses are nonexclusive and open to the general public the leading decision of the bronx household of faith v community school district 10114 challenged new york city board of education regulation replicating that part of the state statute but it also specifically barred outside groups from conducting religious services or religious instruction on school premises after school the regulation did permit outside groups to use school premises for the purposes of discussing religious material or distributing such material church that wanted to use school gym for worship services for its growing congregation challenged the prohibition on free speech grounds but the us court of appeals for the second circuit upheld the regulation and stated that it meticulously complied with lambs chapel it allowed the discussion of secular subjects from religious perspective the court said and simply excised in its entirety the category of religious worship and discussion such subject matter limitation in nonpublic forum the appellate court held was reasonable and viewpoint neutralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs37 115 202 f3d 502 2d cir pet for cert filed 69 uslw 3002 2000 116 see full gospel tabernacle v community school district 27 979 fsupp2d 214 sd ny 1997 affd per

tracked the state statute and then barred the use of school premises for religious purposes upon challenge by christian youth organization for children ages 612 that had been denied permission to meet in school facilities the appellate court upheld its exclusion the youth organization contended that other organizations such as the boy scouts were permitted to use school facilities to teach morals and values and that as consequence the exclusion of club because it taught morals and values from christian perspective constituted viewpoint discrimination but the appellate court found that the club was doing more than just offering religious perspective on the secular subject of morality and in fact was engaging in religious worship and instruction as consequence its exclusion it said was based on the content of its expression and not its viewpoint citing bronx household as authority the court held the clubs exclusion to be constitutional several other decisions in new york have similarly upheld regulations barring the use of school facilities for religious worship and instruction116 finally in campbell v st tammanys school board117 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit upheld as constitutional louisiana school district regulation virtually identical to that in bronx household of faith pursuant to the regulation the school district had denied permission to local chapter of the christian coalition to use school facilities for prayer meeting the fifth circuit said the regulation by allowing the schools to be used for all but few purposes skates close to establishing designated public forum but it concluded that the restrictions are minimally sufficient to maintain the school buildings status as nonpublic forum the court noted that religion may be either perspective on topic such as marriage or substantive activity in itself and said that in the latter case the governments exclusion of the activity is discrimination based on content not viewpoint agreeing with bronx household the court concluded that religious services and instruction were activities which may be excluded consistent with the free speech clause notwithstanding these decision such regulations seem likely to invite further litigation and the supreme court may eventually have to resolve the matter conclusion issues involving religion in the public schools can implicate number of constitutional provisions but most particularly the establishment of religion the free exercise of religion and the freedom of speech clauses of the first amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30649crs38 118 abington school district v schempp supra at 225 119 496 us 226 250 1990 120 epperson v arkansas supra at 103104because all of these clauses are worded as absolutes it is sometimes ambiguous whether governmental involvement in given situation is permissible or required accommodation of religion or speech or forbidden establishment of religion but the essential meaning of this part of the first amendment that has been elaborated by the courts over the last five decades appears to be that in the public schools government must be neutral regarding religious faith serving neither as its agent or advocate nor as its adversary particularly in its role as educator government is required to be objective and impartial about religion not partisan government must maintain strict neutrality neither aiding nor opposing religion118 thus government is not to be the agent of religious expression nor is it to be its censor as justice oconnor said in board of education of westside community schools v mergens119 there is crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion which the establishment clause forbids and private speech endorsing religion in other words the free exercise and free speech clause of the constitution have also been construed to provide substantial protection to private religious expression in the public schools because matters concerning religion in the public schools touch deep emotions in the american public controversies over the boundaries of religious expression in the public schools are certain to continue to arise indeed as noted above at least two issues currently remain unresolved and are likely to precipitate additional litigation but unless and until the supreme court alters its basic interpretation of the first amendment the general principles of constitutional law in this area appear to be fairly well settled as the court has summarized government in our democracy state and national must be neutral in matters of religious theory doctrine and practice it may not be hostile to any religion or to the advocacy of noreligion and it may not aid foster or promote one religion or religious theory against another or even against the militant opposite the first amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion and between religion and nonreligion120
