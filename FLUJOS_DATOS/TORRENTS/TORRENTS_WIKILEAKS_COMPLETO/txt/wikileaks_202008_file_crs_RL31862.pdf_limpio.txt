pressures on corpor ations to conform with international labor rights st andards although codes va ry somewhat they generally mandate standards at or above the levels of national labor laws chinas labor laws meet international benchmarks in most respects often the main problem or variable is not the stringency of the standards but rather the level of enforcement however not all codes apply rigorous methods for monitoring and effecting compliance some experts argue that third party nonprofit uditors are more effective in monitoring compliance than inhouse and forprofit auditors16 independent monitoring organizations in china include bureau veritas global social compliance intertek testing services and verité labor codes of conduct have reportedly produced impr ovements in some large factories that fear losing contracts to large us corporations for violating labor standards17 however some labor rights groups have found monitoring and verification problems stemming from insufficient transparency including lack of unannounced audits lack of input from workers through offsite confidential interviews without fear of retribution and lack of accessibility or disclosure of

requires written document for each employee stating that employment and overtime are voluntary the reebok code forbids the use of administrative detainees in supplier factories23 the icti code stipulates that workers are free to leave once their shift ends the labor law of china states that worker may ter minate his employment or repudiate his labor contract if the employer compels worker
