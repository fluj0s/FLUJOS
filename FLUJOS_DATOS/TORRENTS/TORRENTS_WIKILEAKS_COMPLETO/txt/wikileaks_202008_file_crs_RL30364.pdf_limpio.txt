of the test was whether congress explicitly expressed its intent to unilaterally abrogate state immunity and the second was whether congress had exercised proper authority in doing so according to the seminole tribe court congress intent to abrogate the states immunity from suit must be obvious from clear legislative statement7 the court stated that authorizing suit in federal court is not enough to show congress intended to abrogate state immunity8 further the court noted that mere receipt of federal funds cannot establish that state has consented to suit in federal court9 after finding express intent to abrogate state immunity in the text of the statute in question the court turned its attention to whether congress had exercised valid authority chief justice rehnquist writing for the majority held that through the fourteenth amendment federal power extended to intrude upon the province of the eleventh amendment and therefore that 5 of the fourteenth amendment allowed congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by that amendment10 section 5 of the fourteenth amendment gives congress the power to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment11 however the statute in question was enacted pursuant to congress power under the indian commerce clause of the constitution12 the court held that neither the indian commerce clause nor the interstate commerce clause provided congress authority to abrogate states sovereign immunity under the 11th amendment13 in its most recent term the court revisited the scope of the 11th amendment in series of cases in alden v maine group of state employees filed suit against the state to recover under the fair labor standards act flsa14 the federal district court dismissed the action based on the courts decision in

the powers delegated to congress under article i interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting states to private suits for damages in state courts15 in conclusion the court noted that states can be sued under limited circumstances states may be sued if they consent16 the united states may bring suit against state and state may be sued to enforce legislation enacted pursuant to 5 of the fourteenth amendment the court also noted that the 11th amendment only concerns suits against states but it did not extend to suits prosecuted against municipal corporation or other governmental entity which is not an arm of the state17 nor does the 11th amendment bar all suits against state officers18 the court stated the rule however does not bar certain actions against state officers for injunctive or declaratory relief even suit for money damages may be prosecuted against state officer in his individual capacity for unconstitutional or wrongful conduct fairly attributable to the officer himself so long as the relief is sought not from the state treasury but from the officer personally19 the rule established under ex parte young allows an individual to bring suit for prospective or injunctive relief against state officer to prevent the officer from continued violations of the statute20 such an injunction preventing future violation by state official could be enforced in federal or state court and would effectively prevent the state through its officers from continuing to violate federal law in alden the court noted that the federal government retains the right to sue state to enforce federal law logical extension of this could be the united states bringing suit under federal law against state on behalf of

congress power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment section 1 of the fourteenth amendment states in part that state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws22 section 5 of the fourteenth amendment states that the congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article23 in city of boerne v flores the court struck down the religious freedom restoration act rfra on the grounds that the enactment of rfra exceeded congress power24 rfra provided that the government could not burden persons exercise of religion even by generally applicable law unless the government showed that the burden 1 is in furtherance of compelling governmental interest and 2 is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest25 rfra applied to any federal state or local government statute ordinance or regulation rfra was enacted in response to the courts decision in

section 5 but not the power to create new rights under section 529 rfra did not apply merely to laws targeting religious discrimination or bigotry but to any law that had the effect of burdening the free exercise of religion the court found that the legislative history did not reflect recent history of religious persecution or widespread pattern of religious discrimination in this country30 aside from the legislative history the court found that rfras sweeping application was so out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional behavior31 rfra according to the court was not remedial legislation to enforce an existing constitutional right but instead created new right and therefore was beyond congress power to enact32 in florida prepaid postsecondary ed expense bd v college savings bank the court again addressed the scope of congress authority under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment33 reiterating the holding in boerne the court noted that the term enforce used in section 5 should be taken seriously section 5 should not be used to create new federal right but only to enforce right under the 14th amendment the court stated we thus hold that for congress to invoke 5 it must identify conduct transgressing the fourteenth amendments substantive provisions and must tailor its legislative scheme to remedying or preventing such conduct34 to summarize the courts recent cases hold that congress may not authorize an individual to bring suit against state in federal or state court to enforce federal statute without 1 the states consent or 2 express congressional abrogation of state sovereign immunity subject to legislation enacted pursuant to an appropriate exercise of jurisdiction under 5 of the fourteenth amendment the courts cases note that the 11th amendment does not bar suit against state by the federal government the issue of whether an individual may bring suit against state in the name of the federal government will be decided during the courts current term the court has also held that the 11th amendment does not bar suits against state

supreme court for review of the 11th circuits holding that the state was not subject to suit under the adea because of sovereign immunity35 the court considered whether 1 the adea contains clear abrogation of states immunity and 2 whether congress extension of the adea to states was proper exercise of congress power under section 5 of the 14th amendment to abrogate immunity36 ultimately the us supreme court held that congress did give notice of its intent to abrogate state immunity but lacked the constitutional authority under section 5 of the 14th amendment to do so37 according to the court the issue boiled down to two questions first whether congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate states sovereign immunity and second if it did whether congress acted pursuant to valid grant of constitutional authority38 as to the first question the court found that congress amendments to the adea that expanded the definition of employer to include states and that incorpor ated provisions of the fair labor standards act flsa which authorized suits in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction clearly demonstrates congress intent to subject the states to suit at the hands of individual employees39 the court rejected the argument that congress was in any way unclear about its intention to subject states to suit under the adea turning to the second question

fourteenth amendment41 however this authority is limited according to the majority congress has been given the power to enforce not the power to determine what constitutes constitutional violation42 noting that it is difficult line that congress must follow the court held that there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end43 applying the congruence and proportionality test in this instance the court found that the adea was disproportionate response to any unconstitutional conduct that conceivably could be targeted by the act44 the court noted that in three previous cases it had held that the age classifications at issue did not violate the equal protection clause45 moreover the court stated that age classifications may be tailored to meet legitimate state interest particularly since age unlike race or sex is not suspect classification46 it fails to be suspect classification because older people have not been subjected to history of purposeful unequal treatment and old age does not define discrete and insular minority 47 finally the majority opinion concluded that the adea is so out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional behavior48 the original plaintiffs argued that the adea was enacted to eliminate arbitrary age discrimination which would likely violate the equal protection clause the court disagreed finding that the adeas protection extends beyond the requirements of the equal protection clause49 the court observed that although the behavior targeted by the adea is unlikely to be unconstitutional the analysis does not end there congress may enact prophylactic legislation the court then questioned whether the adea is form of enforcement or an attempt by congress to redefine the substance of section 5 after reviewing the adeas legislative history and finding dearth of pattern or history of age discrimination the court concluded that congress 1974 extension of the act to the states was an unwarranted response to perhaps inconsequential problem50

dissenting in part justice thomas referred to the courts decision in employees of dept of public health welfare of mo v department of public health welfare of mo 411 us 279 285 1973 he noted that in employees we confronted the pre1974 version of the flsa and held that this language fell short of clear statement of congress intent to abrogate id at 3 55justice thomas wrote this sequence of events suggests in my view that we should approach with circumspection any theory of clear statement by incorporation where congress amends an act whose provisions are incorporated by other acts the bill under consideration does not necessarily mention the incorporating references in those other acts and so fails to inspire confidence that congress has deliberated on the consequences of the amendment for the other acts that is the case here the legislation that amended the flsa did not even acknowledge the enforcement provision of the adea and given the purpose of the clear statement rule to assure that the legislature has in fact faced the issue of abrogation i am unwilling to indulge the fiction that congress when it amended flsa recognized the consequences for separate act the adea that incorporates the amended provision id at 5ultimately the court stated we hold that the adea is not valid exercise of congress power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment the adeas purported abrogation of the states sovereign immunity is accordingly invalid51 however the court pointed out that state employees are still able to seek recourse under state age discrimination laws52 justice stevens wrote separate opinion dissenting and concurring in part joined by justices souter ginsburg and breyer he took issue with the judgemade doctrine of sovereign immunity and argued that if congress has the authority to enact legislation that is applicable to the states it also has the authority to determine who may bring enforcement proceedings53 justice thomas dissented from the part of the courts decision that found clear congressional intent to abrogate under the adea54 he argued that it is not clear that congress understood or was aware that the changes it made to abrogate state immunity under flsa would also apply to the adea because of the adeas incorporation of the enforcement provisions of flsa55 justice thomas concurred with the remaining parts of the decision that congress did not have authority under section 5 of the 14th amendment to abrogate state immunity under the adea httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30364crs9 5629 usca 206d west supp 1999 57varner v illinois

by nancy jones february 16 2000impact of the kimel decision the impact of the kimel decision is still being debated while state employees may continue to bring suit under state law kimel does foreclose an avenue of enforcement that had been available to approximately 5 million employees since 1974 it also effectively eliminates the ability of state employees to bring suit under other federal labor laws in which the state has not consented or where congress does not have 5 authority in larger sense kimel and alden shift to the federal government greater role in ensuring state compliance with federal labor law the kimel decision implies that only suspect classifications such as race or gender would likely meet the congruence and proportionality test however that proposition as it applies to gender has been put into question after the court requested that lower courts reevaluate the application of the equal pay act federal statute that prohibits genderbased wage discrimination to states56 the court has ordered two lower courts to reconsider in light of its decision in kimel their decisions to allow an equal pay act claim to proceed against two state universities57 it is not clear if this issue will reach the court also on january 21 2000 the court agreed to hear dickson v florida department of corrections to determine if the 11th amendment prohibits state employees from bringing suit under the americans with disabilities act ada58 in kimel threejudge panel of the 11th circuit court of appeals heard consolidated appeal of three cases regarding 11th amendment immunity two of the cases dealt with the adea and that issue was addressed by the us supreme court in kimel the remaining case dickson dealt with the ada the lower court panel was split with two of the judges finding abrogation of sovereign immunity under the ada in light of the courts recent decisions state employees are unable to bring suit under the fair labor standards act and the age discrimination in employment act however these statutes may be enforced by administrative action state employees may also have recourse under an applicable state law whether state employees can bring suit under the equal pay act or the americans with disabilities act is question that the court is likely to address in the near future
