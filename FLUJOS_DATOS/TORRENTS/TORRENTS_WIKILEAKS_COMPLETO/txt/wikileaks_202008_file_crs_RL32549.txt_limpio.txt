technology policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress project bioshield legislative history and sidebyside comparison of hr 2122 s 15 and s 1504 summary few effective countermeasures currently exist to deal with chemical biological radiological and nuclear terror agents in early 2003 the bush administration proposed project bioshield to stimulate the development of such countermeasures and to procure them for the strategic national stockpile sns congress considered three bills that incorporated much of the administrations proposal s 15 gregg hr 2122 tauzin and s 1504 gregg hr 2122 passed the house on july 16 2003 s 15 passed the senate on may 25 2004 in an amended form similar to hr 2122 this version of s 15 passed the house on july 14 2004 president bush signed s 15 into law as the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 on july 21 2004 although many of the details of project bioshield changed during congressional consideration all the proposals shared similar key provisions each bill would have provided expedited hiring procurement and grant awarding procedures for bioterrorismrelated products and services each bill would have provided market guarantee for countermeasure producers by allowing the secretary of health and human services hhs to contract to procure countermeasures still in development thus several years before company plans to be able to deliver countermeasure the company would have been assured that if they successfully develop the countermeasure the government is obligated to purchase set amount of it at set price each bill would have authorized the hhs secretary to allow the emergency use of countermeasures that lack food and drug administration approval congress changed many important aspects of the administrations proposal the most important change related to the funding mechanism the administration requested permanent indefinite appropriation to be spent at the presidents discretion for the purchase of countermeasures the enacted version of project bioshield authorizes the appropriation of 5593 billion for fy2004fy2013 the department of homeland security dhs appropriations act pl 10890 appropriated this amount the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 also transfers the sns from dhs to hhs permits procurement of countermeasures with commercial markets permits countermeasure procurement contracts to be written up to eight years before countermeasures are expected to be deliverable and authorizes appropriations to allow dhs to improve its ability to perform threat analysis provision that would have allowed hhs to develop countermeasures directly was excluded from the enacted version project bioshield this report will not be updated for more

introduction several high profile incidents since 2001 have highlighted the nations vulnerability to bioterrorism most prominent of these were the anthrax mailings of 2001 these caused five deaths required thousands to take prophylactic antibiotics and cost millions of dollars to clean up if there had not been an effective antibiotic treatment for this strain of anthrax the death toll would have been even higher other prominent incidents include the discovery of the toxin ricin in senator frists office in the dirksen senate office building office in february 2004 and in postal facility in greenville south carolina in october 2003 the secret service also intercepted letter containing ricin addressed to the white house in october 2003 ricin deadly toxin lacks any food and drug administration fda approved treatments or prophylaxis1 many of the other biological threats deemed most dangerous by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc also lack effective fdaapproved treatments and prophylactics for example botulinum toxin plague tularemia and many viral hemorrhagic fevers vhfs lack licensed vaccines while smallpox and vhfs lack any specific treatment2 additionally many of the vaccines and treatments that currently exist are suboptimal for responding to bioterrorism for example the department of health and human services hhs has called for better vaccines for anthrax and smallpox and better treatments for anthrax plague and botulism3 1 for more information on ricin see crs report rs21383 ricin technical background and potential role in terrorism by dana shea and frank gottron 2 for more information on potential chemical and biological terrorism agents and the availability of countermeasures see crs report rl32391 smallscale terrorist attacks using chemical and biological agents an assessment framework and preliminary comparisons by dana shea and frank gottron 3 national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid biodefense research agenda for cdc category agents department of health and human services washington dc february 2002 crs2 several factors likely contribute to this paucity of bioterrorism countermeasures including lack of financial incentives to develop countermeasures4 the perception of relatively high threat of litigation stemming from adverse reactions to the countermeasures5 and the lack of success of department of defense effort to develop such countermeasures6 in addition because these diseases are rare many companies apparently have balked at spending millions of dollars developing product with such small potential market7 to encourage the development of new biomedical countermeasures president bush proposed project bioshield in his 2003 state of the union address the 108th congress considered three bills that incorporated the administrations proposal s 15 gregg hr 2122 tauzin and s 1504 gregg most of the attention garnered by project bioshield has focused on countermeasures against bioterrorism however project bioshield also applies to countermeasures against chemical radiological and nuclear attacks this report provides brief legislative history and sidebyside comparison of the three bills including versions of s 15 as initially reported and as enacted such comparison may be useful both with respect to congressional oversight of project bioshield activities and with respect to future legislative initiatives relating to countermeasure procurement legislative history senate action senator gregg introduced s 15 on march 11 2003 the senate

2004 pl 108276 8 us congress project bioshield act of 2003 hrept 108147 part i 108th congress first session pp 2021 crs4 related legislation the department of homeland security appropriations act 2004 pl 10890 enacted october 1 2003 appropriated 5593 billion for fy2004fy2013 to procure medical countermeasures against biological terror attacks of this amount up to 890 million may be obligated in fy2004 and more than 3418 billion may be obligated through fy2008 the enactment of this law effectively resolved the funding differences that had been pending between s 15 and hr 2122 at that time s 15 as reported by the senate help committee called for permanent indefinite spending appropriation while hr 2122 authorized specific appropriation amount pl 10890 contained funding levels identical to those authorized in hr 2122 although pl 10890 specified that those funds were only for medical countermeasures against biological terror attacks the project bioshield act of 2004 pl 108276 changed this to allow countermeasures against chemical biological radiological and nuclear terrorism the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 pl 108136 enacted november 24 2003 contained some department of defenserelated language similar to that found in s 15 as reported by the senate help committee and hr 2122 it gave the secretary of defense some authorities similar to those given to the secretary of health and human services by the project bioshield act of 2004 these new authorities relate to the hiring of biomedical countermeasure consultants the procurement of biomedical countermeasures and the emergency use of unapproved countermeasures for the military the defense secretarys authorities relate to department of defense programs and military personnel whereas the hhs secretarys authorities relate to hhs programs and to civilian populations the consolidated appropriations act 2004 pl 108199 enacted january 23 2004 reduced the funds available for obligation in fy2004 from 890 million to 885 million comparison of the bills all of the project bioshieldrelated legislative proposals shared the same goal of increasing the development and purchase of biomedical countermeasures for the sns each also largely reflected the administrations proposals on broad scale however congress through its deliberative process changed many of the details in each bill similarities these bills shared many provisions each would have provided expedited hiring procurement and grant awarding procedures for bioterrorism related products and services these provisions were designed to make it easier for hhs to quickly commit substantial funds to biomedical countermeasure projects each bill would have provided market guarantee for countermeasure producers by allowing the hhs secretary to contract to procure countermeasures still in development thus several years before company plans to be able to deliver countermeasure the company would be assured that if they successfully develop the countermeasure the government is obligated to purchase set amount of it at set price under each bill the manufacturing company can only receive payment upon countermeasure delivery with some minor exceptions each bill would have authorized the hhs secretary to allow the emergency use of countermeasures that lack fda approval crs5 differences funding the largest difference among the bills was the difference in funding mechanism s 15 as reported by the senate help committee would have granted permanent indefinite appropriation for purchasing countermeasures to be spent at the presidents discretion this mandatory funding which was also part of the original administration proposal would not be subject to the annual appropriations process the administration predicted that it would spend approximately 56 billion for fy2004fy2013 for bioshieldrelated countermeasure procurement the congressional budget office estimated that approximately 81 billion would be spent over that time period9 hr 2122 s 1504 and s 15 as amended and enacted authorize specific funding for the program but do not appropriate funds all three of these authorize the exact appropriation amounts found in the department of homeland security appropriation act 2004 pl 10890 that was passed while the project bioshield legislation was under consideration there were minor differences in the mechanisms of funding between hr 2122 and s 1504 s 15 as enacted adopted the hr 2122 mechanism sns transfer congress created the national pharmaceutical stockpile nps the forerunner to the sns in the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 1999 pl 105277 the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 essentially redesignated the nps as the sns and listed specific requirements regarding sns management and maintenance the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 transferred the sns program to the department of homeland security s 15 as enacted transferred the sns back to hhs this provision was not in any of the other bills countermeasure qualifications the bills differed in which countermeasures qualify for procurement under project bioshield s 15 as reported by the senate help committee and s 1504 would have excluded any countermeasure that has significant market other than as countermeasure hr 2122 and s 15 as enacted allow the purchase of countermeasures even if they have other significant markets this change may encourage the development of countermeasures that can protect against more than one agent such as new wide spectrum antibiotics such products are more likely to have other commercial applications and markets thus while very desirable for the sns they would have been excluded from project bioshield funding under s 15 as reported and s 1504 s 15 as reported by the senate help committee and s 1504 required that products be likely to have fda approval within five years hr 2122 required that countermeasures be likely to be approved sometime in the future s 15 as enacted requires that countermeasures be likely to be approved within eight years the enacted language will allow the hhs secretary to contract to purchase 9 us congress cost estimate s 15 project bioshield act of 2003 congressional budget office may 7 2003 crs6 countermeasures that are earlier in the development process than would the other senate versions but not as early as hr 2122 would have allowed hr 2122 s 1504 and s 15 as reported by the senate help committee specify that countermeasures should be deliverable within five years s 15 as enacted specifies that countermeasures should be deliverable within eight years hhs countermeasure development program hr 2122 would have authorized the hhs secretary to initiate and sustain program that results in the delivery of priority countermeasures for placement in the stockpile this provision would have allowed the government to directly develop countermeasures this could be done through several mechanisms including government ownedgovernment operated gogo facilities or government ownedcontractor operated goco facilities this provision was not included in s 15 as enacted patient protection during emergencies s 1504 and s 15 as enacted grant the hhs secretary authority during national emergency to temporarily waive or modify some patient protection provisions of the social security act and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness act of 2002 these provisions concern patient privacy and which hospitals patients can be directed to or away from pursuant to state emergency plan hr 2122 and s 15 as reported by the senate help committee lacked this provision dhs terrorism analyst hiring hr 2122 and s 15 as enacted authorize appropriations to hire more biological and chemical terrorism analysts in the department of homeland securitys directorate for information analysis and infrastructure protection iaip they also authorize appropriations to acquire and deploy facilities that permit the undersecretary of iaip to access all classified information to which he is entitled s 15 as reported by the senate help committee and s 1504 lacked similar provisions other differences several other notable differences including reporting and recordkeeping requirements are detailed the tables below the italics in the
