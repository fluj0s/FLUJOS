comprised of two ethnic groups the tutsis about 14 who had been the dominant political and economic force until 1961 and the majority hutu about 85 who took power at independence shortly after indepe ndence many rwandese tutsi left rwanda and became refugees in uganda for decades rwanda suffered from periodic ethnic clashes in which hundreds of thousands died in 1990 the tutsiled rwandan patriotic front rpf launched military offensive from uganda against government troops inside rwanda government forces were able to repel the rpf and forced it to retreat into the mountains in 1993 after several failed efforts the rpf and the government of rwanda reached an agreement in tanzania referred to as the arusha peace accords in april 1994 the presidents of rwanda and bur undi along with several senior government officials were killed when their plane was shot down as it approached the capital of rwanda kigali the rwandan military and hutu militia soon began to systematically massacre tutsis and moderate hutu opposition members in the first ten weeks of the rwandan genocide an estimated 1000000 people mostly tutsis were slaughtered by government forces and the interhamwe militia millions of hutu refugees fled to neighboring democratic republic of congo drcthen zaire after rpf troops took control in kigali and ousted the hutu government in july 1994 in 1996 most of the refugees returned home after rpf troops attacked militias and former rwandan government troops inside congo the rwandan intervention in congo led to the ouster of the zairean president mobutu sese seko insurgent leader laurent kabila became pr esident of the congo with the help of the rpf led government of rwanda and uganda howeve r violence related to the rwandan upheaval continued in congo for much of the late 1990s rwanda is still very divided along ethnic lines and the 1994 genocide is fresh in the minds of many survivors and perpetrators however resentment among the majority hutu population toward the tutsis appears to have decreased in part due to reconciliation efforts by the government in 2000 the hutu president and leading figure of the ruling rpf pasteur bizimungu resigned in protest of tutsi domination in government but bizimungu was not able to garner support for his cause in april 2000 one month after president bizimungu resigned general paul kagame who had served as defense minister and vice president since july 1994 was elected by the rwandan legislature to the post of president
