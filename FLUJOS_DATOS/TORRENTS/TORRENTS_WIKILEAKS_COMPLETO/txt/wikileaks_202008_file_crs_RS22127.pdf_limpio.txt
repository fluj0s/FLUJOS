business and government relations government and finance division summary when an investor has dispute with brokerdealer in which damages of certain size or more are alleged it may be mediated by panel of securities industry and non securities industry arbitrators under the auspi ces of the nasd although the process has been criticized for having proi ndustry bias research on the issue has not substantiated the bias claims smoothly f unctioning discovery process is integral to the fairness of arbitration hearings in recent years in the wake of the market collapse of 2000 there has been surge in reported abuse of the discovery process largely concerning brokerage firms incidents of buse have attracted the attention of the nasd and others but due to the persistence of potentially perverse incentives the efforts of the nasd to remedy the problems may prove to be unsuccessful this report provides background on the nasds securities arbitrati on process examines concerns over its fairness and reports on the upcoming rger of the nasd and nyse reg which handles small fraction of arb itration cases it will be upda ted as developments warrant before 1987 securities investors claim against his or her broker for alleged wrongdoing would generally be pursued as lawsuit against the brokers brokerage firm but that year in shearsonamerican express inc v mcmahon 482 us 220 the supreme court upheld the enforceability of ag reements to arbitrate investors claims arising under the securities exchange act of 1934 since then arbitration clauses have become an integral part of the contract between investors and brokerage firms and securities arbitration has become the standard means by which investor complaints are mediated1 the arbitration process is primarily overseen by two self regulatory organizations sros the new york stoc k exchange regulation nyse reg the regulatory subsidiary of the euronext new york stock exchange group which owns

financial services subcommittee on capital ma rkets which held the hearing remarked that the system appeared to be sound house committee on financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises holds hearing on the securities arbitration process march 17 2005new york stock exchange and the nasd2 which also regulates brokerdealers the securities and exchange commission has substantial oversight over sros through the securities and exchange act of 1934 although the securities arbitr ation process has been desc ribed as relatively fast efficient flexible and inexpensive there are some concerns over its fairness these concerns were aired during hearing held by the house financial services capital markets subcommittee in march 20053 this report begins with an introductory background look at securities arbitration overseen by the nasd which received 6000 case submissions in 2005 and handles more than 90 of such cases nationwide nyse reg presides over most of the remaining cases the report then provides an examination of criticism of its fairness and the basics of the securities arbitration process securities arbitrations can take number of forms these forms are dependent on number of factors including the size of an investors claim nd whether the investor opts for voluntary mediation over going before arbitrators the variety of factors that shape the process is discussed below in securities arbitration i nvestors with cases involving less than 25000 in claims go through simplified arbitr ation in which an investor submits his allegations to single arbitrator who then makes written d ecision without resort to hearing for grievances of up to 50000 single arbitrator conducts the hearing unless the investor requests threemember panel if the claim exceeds 50000 the case automatically goes to threemember panel threemember panels are composed of one nonpublic arbitrat or who is currently employed by the securities industry and two public arbitrators with current affiliation with the securities industry historically the rationale for having nonpublic arbitrator was that such person would provide valu able insight into the inner workings of brokerage firms the rationale for the public arbitrators was that they would inject greater measure of independence into the process some investors who submit to securities arbitration engage an attorney who generally operates on continge ncy basis while others opt to represent themselves by contrast brokerage firms always us attorneys to defend themselveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22127crs3 investors who submit to securities arbitr ation can opt for voluntary mediation an informal nonbinding process in which mediator facilitates negotiations between disputants the mediation can be initiated at any stage of the arbitration process and according to the nasd results in settle ments more than 80 of the time if there is settlement the dispute proceed s to an arbitrator deliberated process an investor prevails if majority of the arb itrators on three member panel or the single member of onemember panel decide to dir ect the brokerage firm to award the claimant some or all of the claims against it decisi ons made in arbitrati ons are generally final the people who populate arbitration pane ls are drawn from nationwide pool of some 7000 potential arbitrators the much smaller potential pool for each threemember panel is initially selected by the nasds arbitrator selection system which provides the two parties to dispute with the names of 15 potential arbitrators 10 public and five nonpublic to choose from the two dis putants can then make an unlimited number of peremptory challenges to strike an arbitrators for any reasons after the peremptories the remaining arb itrators are eligible for appoin tment to the panel if more than the necessary number of arbitrators remain on the list the panelists are selected on the basis of earlier rankings by the disputants if any vacancies still remain they are filled by arbitrators who are selected on rotati onal basis by the selec tion processs computer system nonpublic arbitrators are currently employ ed by brokerage or securities firm while many public arbitrators have never had any affiliation with the brokerage business person can qualify as public arbitrator if he or she has held job in the brokerage industry for fewer than 20 years and has been out of the business for at least five years the nasd also permits accountants and lawyers to be public arbitrators if they receive less than 10 of their inco from brokerage clients key criticisms number of observers including william galvin secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts new york state attorney general eliot spitzer and representatives from the public investors arbitration bar association the trade group for lawyers who represent investors have criticized aspects of the arbitration process for injecting pro industry bias into the hearings outcomes key criticisms include the presence of the ma ndatory non public i ndustry arbitrator which some say introduces proindustr bias into the process and the existence of an overly expans ive definition of who qualifies as public arbitrator retired indivi duals who formerly worked for brokerage firm for number of years can serve as public arbitrators and in an era that has seen significant consolidation of va rious parts of the financial services industry some non securities financial service workers may be employed by firm like an insurance or banking firm that is under the same financial conglomerate ownership as brokerage firm nasd rules allow such workers to serve as public arbitrators whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22127crs4

orley ashenfelter and david bloom models of arbitrator behavior theory and evidence american economic review march 1984 pp 111124 the nasd does not supply data on the size of awards relative to the amounts sought 6 however nasd officials have acknowledged that the mandatory training that all arbitrators are required to have focuses on procedural not substantive issues related to the mechanics of investor trades in addition some investors attorneys have spoken of encountering many public arbitrators who appear to be essentia lly clueless about investment basicsraises some potentially credible questions over the possibility of pro industry bias some commentary and research on eviden ce of probrokerage industry bias in nasd securities arbitrations are discussed below generally there appears to be little concrete evidence of proindustry bias but the evidence that the arbitration process is devoid of proindustry bias does not appear to be definitive arbitration panels rule majority of the time in favor of investors attempting to rebut criticism that the arbitration pro cess has proindustry bias nasd officials observe that in 2004 the sros arbitrati on panels ruled for investors in 55 of arbitrations percentage roughly comparable to those in previous years but the fact that the arbitrators tend to rule somewhat more than half of the time for investors may not reveal much it is not known whether 60 or 70 or 40 for that matter of the arbitrated cases may have actually merited ru lings favorable to investors in addition when an investor wins securities arbitration case there is monetary award that the brokerage firm is directed to pay according to number of investor attorneys there is facto common law at the nasd that says that even in the most compelling cases awards generally shall not exceed half of an investors claim which nasd officials refute4 others however say that monetary aw ards that tend to split the difference are commonplace in the world of arbitration5 this suggests that the nasd awards are not inconsistent with awards in th realm of arbitration but it s nothing to say about whether there is proindustry bias indeed to the extent that the securities arbitration award process tends to conform to such model various nasd arbitrated cases in which investors deserved more than they got one could probably be f ound and various cases in which investors probabl got less than they actually deserved public and nonpublic arbitrators tend to reach unanimous decisions in another rebuttal to the proindustry charge nasd fficials cite the fact that 98 of nasd securities arbitrations result in unanimous verdicts which is said to be an indication that public and nonpublic arb itrators are almost always on th same page in their decision making the statistic appears to provide at least some support for the view that the outcomes in the arbitration process do not re flect the presence of proindustry bias6 the vast majority of those involved in nasd arbitration view the process as fair defenders of the arbitr ation processs fair ness also cite nasd survey and followup study involving participants in 2037 arbitration cases between

this would appear to indicate that there was significant amount of satisfaction with the process on the part of large proportion of winning and losing investors which also provides some support for those who deny the presence of an industry bias securities arbitrations on the nasd and arbitrations outside of the securities industry provided roughly similar outcomes 1992 study by the government accountability office gao8 analyzed securities arbitrations between january 1989 and june 1990 the cases were divided between t hose arbitrated by an sro like the nasd and those that were brought before the american arbitration association aaa an independent mediating organization that has connection with sro or any securities industry group the study found that investor s prevailed in the sr obased arbitrations 59 of the time and prevailed an almost iden tical 60 of the time in arbitrations before the aaa it also found that when investors pr evailed in sro arbitra tions they recovered approximately 61 of their cl aimed damages compared to 57 in the aaa arbitrations these results lend some support for the absence of proindustry bias in the process the gao study was however conducted decade and half ago and since then there have been number of changes to the arbitration process some of the changes have involved reforms that have re moved some potentially proindus try facets of the arbitration protocol for example si nce the gao study was conducted 1 public arbitrator must be retired from the securities industry for at least five years compared with the earlier requirement of at least three years and 2 investors or th eir representatives were given the opportunity to take part in the selection of the arbitrator s who are to preside over their hearing but by various accounts

have acknowledged that di scovery abuse is an issue at the nasd but they also indicate that they are getting grip on the problem for example they noted that in 2003 the nasd formally remi nded brokerage firms of their obligation to comply with nasd discovery rules and pr ocedures for production of documents and materials in arbitration claims the reminders emphasized the nasds intent to monitor the firms ongoing compliance with the discovery rules as well as its willingness to refer perceived cases of discovery abuses to its enforcement side for investigation nasd officials have also noted that in 2004 th nasd censured and fined three registered brokerage firms total of 750000 for failing to comply with their discovery obligations in 20 arbitration cases between 2002 and 2004 in april 2006 the nasd provided the sec with proposed revisions to its arbitration codes which are designed to improve the ar bitration process and re duce discovery abuses approved by the agency in early 2007 the re visions include provisions that 1 require nasd arbitrators to meet specific training or experience standards in order to serve as panel chairpersons 2 codify discovery guidelines to clarify the fact that complying with the discovery rules is mandatory and aut horizes arbitrators to impose sanctions for noncompliance and 3 give the contending parties greater control over the selection process by increasing the number of arbitr ators they may choose from while limiting the number of arbitrator strikes that each may exercise the nyse regnasd merger approximately 200 brokerdealers are bot h members of the nasd and the nyse which exclusively regulates their financial and operational ffairs and have their sales practices regulated by both nyse reg and the nasd in the fall of 2006 to eliminate the dual regulations unnecessary costs on brokerdealers the nasd and nyse reg agreed to merge their brokerdealer member regulatory operations the merger which must be approved by the sec would also involve the creation of single securities arbitration venue nd it appears that the unified ar bitration mechan ism will be under current nasd arbitration rules and
