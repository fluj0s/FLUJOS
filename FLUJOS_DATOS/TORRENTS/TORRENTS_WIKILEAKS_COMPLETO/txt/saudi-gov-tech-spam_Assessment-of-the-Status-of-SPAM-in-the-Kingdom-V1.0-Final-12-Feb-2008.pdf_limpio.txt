the identifi ed stakeholders each of these steps is described in more detail bel ow definition of spam and related spam indicators spam was defined in our research as unsolicited bul k messages and communications containing commercial abusive or objectionable content and wh ich are sent out in bulk to people or individuals without their consent by email fax or instant messages such as sms the basic spam indicator used was spam rate which is define d as the percentage of spam compared to the total number of received messages identification of sources for spam related statisti cs key sources were identified and considered relevant in the collection and reporting of spam in saudi arabia for example organizations that were able to report on the volume of spam mail received or filtered as percentage of their total emails were considered for email spam isps that were using antispam filtering tools and were able to report on the spam mail filtered by the tool as percentage of total emails were also considered for email spam for sms spam mobile service providers who own the gateway andor servers through which spam sms messages are delivered were considered for sms spam collection of spam statistics after defining the basic spam indices and the poten tial sources for data related to spam various methods were used for collecting spam relat ed data the method varies with the type of spam for email spam the key method used for colle cting the data was questionnaires and interviews targeted at selected organizations and i sps some interviews and discussion were held with third

summary spam represents major annoyance and threat to ict applications users and is spreading into all means of communications as many countries regiona l and international organizations bodies and working groups have taken steps to deal with the is sue of spam saudi arabia has taken the initiative to develop an antispam framework towards this d and besides considering other countries experiences and international bodies recommendatio ns it was necessary to assess the current state of spam in the kingdom the purpose of this report is to describe the findi ngs on the magnitude of spam in the kingdom of saudi arabia including its use for phishing and sp reading viruses awareness of spam the current antispam measures used and its impact on the vari ous stakeholders in saudi arabia spam measurement is key to evaluate the evolution of spa m and the effectiveness of the antispam framework in the kingdom to achieve this purpose all pertinent stakeholders were identified and framework for the collection of spamrelated statistics was developed this fram ework covers email sms and fax and is focused on three aspects first the definition of spam and related spam indicators where spam rate is defined as the percentage of spam compared to the t otal number of received messages second the identification of sources for spam related statisti cs where in addition to interviews filters and an spam tools used by organizations and isps were the main source for determining email spam while gateways and servers owned by mobile service provid ers were used to calculate sms spam third the collection of spam statistics achieved by inspe cting published reliable data and by conducting survey interviews and discussions with relevant pe rsonnel including citc kacst moc moi sama1 companies financial services institutions inter net service providers data service providers bulk sms licensees mobile operators solution prov iders and others although the spam rate differs depending on where t he spam is being measured spam appears to be serious problem in the kingdom of saudi arabia according to the data gathered by isps the average email spam rate in the kingdom was 54 oth er sources such as anti spam product vendors suggest that the spam rate ranges between 4 0 and 60 for instance symantec reports spam rate to be 59 for the year 2006 message labs report the spam for the year 2006 to be 48 and for the year 2007 till july to be 43 on the other hand fax spam was not considered to be major source of spam with less than 6 spam rate t he direct marketing messages constitute the major type of spam received in the kingdom reflecti ng the most majority of commercial spam in the globe as for the sms spam mobile operators r eported that the sms spam rate ranges between 125 and 175 the main findings are summarized in the table below spam emails in addition to being an annoyance to i ndividuals cause capacity bandwidth and staff performance problems while most of the companies b elieve that the primary impact of spam was on their email server resources network and time was ted isps considered that their customers were most affected by spam bandwidth and

ministry of commerce moi ministry of interior assessment of the status of spam in the kingdom final version page 8 of 37 confidential internal use only considering the impact of spam in the kingdom it ppeared that most organizations with the exception of banks did not expend much effort in ducating their employees and customers on how to deal with spam most banks conduct awareness progra ms to their employees and customers noticeably almost 83 of stakeholders have tools t argeted at combating spam however it is worthwhile noting that isps focus on filtering the email traffic hitting the mail servers hosted in th isps data center they do not filter all traffic especially outgoing traffic due to the existing constraints in budgets resources and the shortage of technically capable staff indeed isps employin g realtime blackhole lists rbls reported lower spa m rates with the absence of formal complaints reporting p rocess it is not surprising that most organization s deal with spam internally or even ignore the spam c omplaints on the other hand the observation is different in the case of banks where half of them h ave procedures in place to report phishing complaints to citc and sama when it comes to industry it was obvious that ther is code of conduct for isps or emarketing in saudi arabia moreover half of the service provide rs do not have any provisions in their acceptable use policy aup covering spam as recommended by the well know international bodie s to combat spam different areas shall be addresses such as legal enforcement technical wareness industry assistance etc according to th majority of stakeholders the legal side is of most importance to combat spam in the kingdom while having proper code of conduct between service pro viders would help substantially in preventing spam as indicated by the study spam constitutes serio us problem as being an annoyance to people organizations and service providers as mentioned there is little awareness of spam codes of conduct for service providers and emarketers moreo ver stipulations provided through licenses granted to isps bulk sms service providers and blu etooth providers are not audited or enforced this justifies the need to develop an antispam fra mework for the kingdom of saudi arabia by developing an antispam framework coupled with robu st enforcement ensuring industry assistance

stakeholders major concerns and recommendations interviews were conducted with the identified stake holders using structured questionnaires in order to obtain feedback on their views and concern s on the status of spam in saudi arabia the major concerns and recommendations of the vario us stakeholders with regard to spam have been summarized in this section all stakeholders mentioned the fact that there is c urrently law in saudi arabia to regulate spam however there are some spamrelated provisio ns that are scattered over different laws and licensing requirementsagreements for this rea there are regulations regarding the collections use and trade of personal contact det ails such as email addresses and phone numbers some stakeholders also highlighted the lack of coop eration between various agencies in combating spam for instance sama moi and citc have develo ped an informal procedure to cooperate regarding spamphishing related issues however th ere is formal process in place for handling complaints and forwarding them to the appropriate uthorities it was also raised that there is code of conduct for isps or emarketers in saudi ar abia spam emails in addition to being an annoyance are causing capacity bandwidth and staff performance problems during the meetings held with the various stakeholders many points were raised and some stakeholders suggested some technic controls as well some stakeholders suggested that citc should promot the establishment of commercial secure mail hosting providers who receive emails on behalf of companies and filter them before delivering them to the mail servers of the companie s isps isps highlighted their shortage of technically capa ble staff they indicated that they are understaffed and thus are not capable of addressing the spam issue extensively isps also indicated that they install toolsfilters to protec t the mailboxes of the customers who decide to use the email servers of the isps as such isps do not filter all the traffic flowing through their networks due to the existing constraints in b udgets resources and capacities however one of the findings is that isps who have deployed rbls on their routers or gateways report lower spam rate as do their clients dsps dsps highlighted their shortage of technically capa ble staff they indicated that they are understaffed and thus are not capable of addressing the spam issue extensively dsps also indicated that they do not have existing controls f or spam emails and they strongly advise that spam filters should be decentralized at the is p level and below since these filters might introduce degradation in the quality of service off ered by dsps if installed on their backbones however dsps agreed that rbls might be deployed on their routers to ensure that known spamers cannot send emails to users in the kingdom yet they stressed on the fact that these blacklists need to be very accurate since they migh t result in blocking legitimate traffic msps assessment of the status of spam in the kingdom final version page 22 of 37 confidential internal use only mobile service providers msps suggested that sms spam regulations should focus on bulk sms licenses and should exclude advertisements they also suggested that it is important to control websites registries as an ancillary ele ment to setup accountability and to control websites sending sms spam msps receive daily huge numbers of smses originatin g from outside saudi arabia some of these messages are spam messages although their cu rrent systems do not contain sophisticated filters to identify spam smses msps have developed some controls to ensure that bulk sms sent internationally are inspected an d blocked if deemed spam additionally the msps are upgrading their systems to ensure that they can apply smarter controls to combat spam the mobile operators reported that the sms sp am rate ranges between 125 175 bulk sms service providers bulk sms providers suggested the development and forcement of an antispam law with severe penalties as the best way to control sms spa m moreover in order to know the bulk sms providers who originated the message bulk comp anies suggested that this could be achieved by tracking the premium numbers included i n the messages sent the tracking should be done in coordination with stc and mobily sama sama took many initiatives targeted at fighting phi shing whether by encouraging the banks to join international organizations to fight phishi ng or by coordination the efforts with citc to block access to the phishing source website sam also does regular followups with banks which have been subject to phishing attacks after closing the phishing website to assess any possible damage that could have happened as r esult additionally sama stated that they have strict measures to be undertaken by banks operating under samas license and the saudi banking law sama does conduct regular audits to ensure that all financial institutions are adhering to samas regulations moreover sama has published security guidelines fo r the banks on its website wwwsamagovsa and has recorded 72 phishing attack s on saudi banks during the last year sama also mentioned that the current cooperation in law enforcement is not efficient as sama has to coordinate between moi and citc in orde r to issue an order for blocking phishing website through citc the bureaucracy some times causes severe delays before an action could be taken against the offenders moi moi suggested that either citc or the newly establi shed ecrimes fighting unit is to be contacted for reporting spam then the case would be forwarded to the bureau of investigation and prosecution who might use the tec hnical skills of other agencies including citc assessment of the status of spam in the kingdom final version page 23 of 37 confidential internal use only universities universities recognized that their networks and mac hines are attractive to spammers since they can turn them into zombies2 thus universities have deployed various security controls to mitigate the issues of spam however some of th universities do not allow the students to use their laptops to access the internet using the university networks due to the shortage of existing resources once this access is granted th threats of spam might increase and thus additional security controls might be needed unive rsities also suggested that cybercrime law should be in place to combat spam universities also suggested that an awareness program for spam is very critical to educate people kacstisu the isu division in kacst indicated that currently they do not filter the bandwidth provided to universities to clean it from spam however they might consider the idea of offering filtered bandwidth to universities especially that universities do not have the required technical resources needed to deploy those technically comple x solutions isu stressed on the importance of signing agreement s with other countries and already existing international enforcement agencies isu ggested the cooperation with regional bodies in the gcc moreover it also suggested that the reporting mechanism should be clear and straightforward while enforcement should be ver simple and international cooperation is critical to achieve this companies most companies use antispam softwares to filter sp am emails although some companies have huge databases of customer related information on their databases these companies have not invested heavily to protect the secrecy of this information and thus prohibit spamers from harvesting this information this is also due to th fact that the protection of this information is not enforced by law companies that are hit by spam have not developed p rograms to educate users on how to use the internet while minimizing the entities who know their email addresses and thus minimize the probability that spamers can discover their ema il addresses banks banks suggest that control measures and clear rep orting procedure should be enforced in case the spam is originated using local isp addi tionally formal procedure for reporting

enlisted for the purpose of this project it was concluded that the average email spam rate i n the kingdom was 515 statistics collected from other sources such as companies was ignored s ince it was considered that 3 electronic messages that was sent without the stat ed or inferred consent of the recipient and are of an advertising or promotional nature 4 messages that are sent in numbers exceeding pred efined threshold in predefined period of time 5 multiple isps participated in the survey for the duration of 8 months however we only considered t he statistics of the months where multiple isps provided us with accurat numbers also this number represents the spam av erage across these months assessment of the status of spam in the kingdom final version page 25 of 37 confidential internal use only some of the companies provided guesstimates since t hey did not procure reporting tools that can generate such information readily other companies have reported their statistics how ever their spam rate was skewed by the fact that some isps do deploy rbls on their gateway s and thus block substantial amount of spam messages before they reach these companies figures obtained from antispam product vendors ch as message labs and symantec appeared quite close to the numbers obtained from the panel of isps message labs6 reported the spam rate in ksa for the year 2006

interestingly bulk sms licensees stated that they only receive around 100 complaints per month some of them 17 even state that they dont even receive any complaints this may be due to the fact that users cannot tell who is the real origina tor of the sms that they have received the following table summarizes the key findings of the spam survey 63 the manner in which stakeholders currently address spam addressing the issue of spam needs multilevel ap proach not just deployment of tools and filters to prevent spam there is also need to have prope r processes in place to report and deal with spam on higher level as well as the availability of proper awareness and education to endusers and customers to be able to present comprehensiv view of how stakeholders currently address spam in the kingdom we have looked into three area s first we looked at the existence of antispam solu tions this also included the location at which the solution is deployed and how the solution is co nfigured second we looked at processes that are in place to control spam this includes procedures to report spam to other agencies finally we looked into whether stakeholders carry out spam awa reness programs within their organizations antispam tools as result of the survey that we conducted it bec ame evident that spam is big concern for stakeholders different types of solutions are adop ted by different stakeholders varying from general security tools that also provide protection from spam to advanced antispam tools and filters our statistics show that the average p ercentage of stakeholders who have controls targeted at combating spam is very high 83 they have deployed antispam toolsfilters on their networks to filter incoming traffic figur 9 below shows the percentage

assessment of the status of spam in the kingdom final version page 30 of 37 confidential internal use only another important finding that our survey revealed was the location where the antispam solution is deployed to filter incoming traffic st akeholders average show that almost the same percentage of respondents deploy tools on their ser vers10 37 and on their gateways 36 however as indicated in figure 10 below isps tend to have different approach most isps tend to deploy antispam solutions on their servers 47 in order to protect the mailboxes that they host on their servers while they tend to focus less on protecting or filtering the traffic going through their network only 13 of the isps t end to deploy antispam solutions on their gateways this means that spam originating or targeting the clients of the isps can pass through the network of the isps without being dete cted or filtered 4737 1336 3327 08 0 20 40 60 80 100ispsstakeholders average server gateway

from the anti spam solution looking at the outgoing traffic our survey reveale d that stakeholders are less concerned with blocking spam on the outgoing traffic on average only 51 of stakeholders deploy solutions to filter outgoing traffic compared to 83 of stakeholders who filter incoming traffic this shows that stakeholders are not too c oncerned about the spam that might originate from their networks in the case of isps in addition to the fact that most of the isps do not filter the email traffic sent by their custo mers without passing through the isps email server not all isps check whether their own mail s ervers are generating spam figure 13 below illustrates this point 6751 0 20 40 60 80 100ispsstakeholders average figure 13 percentage of respondents who deployed mail antispam toolsfilters outgoing looking at the location where the tools are impleme nted on the outgoing traffic our survey shows that only 8 of average stakeholders are conc erned with protecting the outgoing traffic on their gateways and in the case of isps only 13 are concerned with protecting their gateways this means that if subscriber installs mail server heshe can send spam emails undetected

acceptance use policy aup with cu stomers and code of conduct among entities our survey has showed that in the absence of form complaints reporting process it is not surprising contrary to banks that most of the org anizations deal with spam internally or do not do anything about spam complaints around 17 f stakeholders do not even have proper process to deal with spam as we can see from figure 16 and figure 17 below however the observation is different in the case f banks figure 16 show that almost half the banks have procedures in place to report phishing c omplaints to citc and sama by developing an antispam framework it is expected th at other industry sectors will develop such processes as well to report spam 01317 38564049 37 38010 50 0 20 40 60 80 100bankcompaniesispsstakeholder

having an antispa m law was the most effective manner in which their organizations could combat sp am head2right 26 of stakeholders also agreed that having prope r code of conduct between service providers would help substantially in preventing sp am though interestingly only 13 of isps believed that having code of conduct amongst them will help in combating spam12 head2right 24 of stakeholders especially isps and companies saw that deploying antispam tools was sufficient measure to prevent spam head2right 15 of stakeholders agreed that having strict emark eting rules including possibly code of conduct between emarketing service provid ers could help in controlling spam13 12 possibly this is because isps are aware of the fac t that having code of conduct with enforcement and audit will not help to reduce spam 13 this reflects the importance of the industry assist ance in the battle against spam although legislati on is critical having an industryspecific guideline which

view on how to combat spam this led us to have look at two other aspects do service providers ensure that their customers do not abuse the services offered to them and do service providers cooperate amongst each others in combating spam first we ticed in our survey that 46 of service providers figure 19 do not have any antispam pro visions in their acceptance use policy aup the inclusion of such clauses can help great ly in controlling spam originating from saudi arabia second we have also discovered that 93 of service providers figure 20 are not aware of any existing code of conduct amongst
