research and development the federal rd missions involved such as defense energy space and the support of much of the nations university basic research whether the government funds rd in its own laboratories or in those of industry or academia and the governments rd budget and its management of and planning for st the report also summarizes six studies by governmental and nongovernmental entities and individuals that deal with the governments changing role in st from their perspectives there are plans at this time to update this report some perspectives on the changing role of the us government in science and technology summary the congressional research service was requested by the house committee on science to provide report on the role of the us government in science and technology as an input to the committees national science policy study this report analyzes number of factors bearing on the governments role in science and technology that may be taken into consideration in the formulation of federal science policy the role of the us government in science and technology varies according to number of factors the character of research and development supported by the government basic research applied research or development the federal research and development missions involved such as defense energy space and support of much of the nations university basic research whether the government conducts research and development in its own laboratories or supports other performers of research and development such as industry academia the states and foreign entities and the federal research and development budget and the governments management of and planning for science and technology governments role in the nations science and technology increased dramatically during and immediately after world war ii since then further changes have occurred perhaps the most important being the continuing decrease in the percentage of federal versus nonfederal funding of research and development since the late 1970s other changes some caused by those federal funding changes involve the governments relative support of basic and applied research and development its defenserelated versus civilian rd missions and its relationships with the nations other funders and performers of rd mainly industry and academia this report also summarizes six studies by governmental and nongovernmental entities and individuals that deal with the governments changing role in science and technology from their perspectives those studies were selected by the committee as representing crosssection of many such reports produced since 1993 the first report summarized is the concluding report of the carnegie commission on science technology and government which resulted in over 300 recommendations covering the full range of issues in science and technology the second report was by the executive office of the president it covers about the same range of issues as covered in the carnegie commission report but from the perspective of the administration the third report sponsored by bipartisan federal advisory commission deals in depth with technology innovation policy the fourth report is the product of university conference concerned with revitalizing the government university partnership especially in regard to federal support of academic research and the training of scientific and technical personnel the fifth is commerce department report detailing the recent evolution of publicprivate cooperation partnering in the nations rd establishment the sixth report is an analysis by an economist of the price that the united states might have to pay for longterm downsizing of the federal investment in research and development

34 appendix acronyms of some federal departments and agencies referred to in this report 37 some perspectives on the changing role of the us government in science and technology introduction congress deals with many aspects of science and technology st on continuing basis in its legislative oversight activities in the development of st policies in responding to the administrations research and development rd plans and budgets and as component of broader policy issues in the 105th congress members and committees are looking at the future of us science and technology and st policy1 an important aspect of this examination is the role of the us government in st as the nation enters the 21th century the congressional research service was requested to provide report on this subject as an input to the bipartisan national science policy study headed by representative vernon j ehlers of the house committee on science there are several ways to examine the role of the us government in science and technology one is to explore that role in terms of the character of the research and development performed for example whether it is basic research applied research or development another way is by the federal missions supported such as defenserelated rd health energy space or other civilian rd or the governments support of mathematical and science education and university research also the role of the government in st is being discussed increasingly in terms of actual or possible federal cooperation with other performers of rd including the private sector academia the states and international entities lastly the governments role in science and technology is significantly affected by the level of its rd budget and the effectiveness of its rd management and planning at the heart of the debate about us science and technology policy are the difficult issues of the federal role in maintaining the health of the nations science and technology and the proper balance among the performers of st for example what is the best level and mix of federal support of research in universities versus in federal laboratories or what is the governments role versus that of the private sector in the promotion of nations technological development in addressing these questions congress and the executive branch receive steady stream of reports from government agencies nongovernmental organizations academia and others on many aspects of st policy this report summarizes six recent studies that address the role of the us government in science and technology and analyzes their findings in terms of the factors mentioned above character of 1 see for example vernon j ehlers the future of us science policy science 279 16 january 1998 302 crs2 rd federal missions other rd performers and federal rd budgets and management2 those reports represent crosssection of studies prepared since 1991 they were selected by the committee after consultation with analysts in st policy in the congressional research service their selection was based upon one or more of the following criteria the reports are recognized as influential express range of views were written by leaders in the field focus on one or more of the subjects covered andor represent views of current policymakers the six reports may not represent all policy perspectives following the reportsummary section is an appendix of acronyms of some federal departments and agencies referred to in the report the changing role of the us government in science and technology this section addresses the changing role of the us government in science and technology in terms of the character of the research and development performed federal missions supported federal support of other performers of rd and federal rd budget management and planning activities it analyzes these factors in reference to the six reports summarized in the next section character of research and development one way the federal government collects information on research and development is according to whether it can be classified as basic research applied research or development3 the government historically has supported much of the nations basic research mainly expensive longterm andor risky research that could not or probably would not be supported by the industrial sector or academia examples are research on nuclear weapons and in highenergy and nuclear physics conducted by the department of energy physical science and engineering research supported by the national science foundation and biomedical research conducted or supported by the national institutes of health applied research projects in many scientific and engineering missionrelated areas are supported by federal mission agencies such as the departments of defense and energy nasa nih and nsf in terms of development two agencies account for about 88 of the development projects funded by the government dod 75 and nasa 134 the role of the federal government in relation to the character of rd is at issue in at least two ways first there is perennial divergence of opinion among science 2 crs recently analyzed us science and technology policy efforts since world war ii and summarized ten reports that dealt with broad range of current st policy issues see congressional research service analysis of ten selected science and technology policy studies by william c boesman report 97836 24 october 1997 51 pp 3 see for example the extensive rd data series published by the national science foundation such as those cited in footnotes 4 and 17 4 fy1997 data from national science foundation federal funds for research and development fiscal years 1995 1996 and 1997 nsf 97327 1997 145147 crs3 policymakers as to whether the government should increase or decrease its funding support of basic research applied research andor development particulary civilian applied research and development visavis the private sector whether the government should increase or decrease support for rd is closely tied to the specific type of rd being considered for support rarely to the broad categories of basic research applied research or development in totality this seems to be particularly contentious today in discussions of federal technology policy as addressed in several of the reports summarized in the next section federal rd budget issues are discussed later in this section second the terms and models themselves for example basic research applied research and development and the socalled linear model of research may not adequately capture important aspects of the spectrum of scientific and engineering endeavors from basic or fundamental research through technological development innovation and commercialization number of different terms and approaches have been suggested in the recent scientific literature including in the reports summarized in this analysis the onedimensional or linear model of research proceeding from curiositydriven basic research through usedriven applied research and innovation the socalled bush model5 is suspect and considered by many to be inadequate today the importance of basic research driven by desire to solve practical problem and the complex relationship between basic research and technological development should be recognized6 some policy studies have recommended that the government abandon its use of the terms basic research and applied research and instead concentrate not just on basic research but on longterm highrisk needbased basic technology research7 likewise instead of characterizing rd as basic and applied research and development it may be more useful to organize rd by its time horizon and level of risk shorttermlowrisk primarily conducted by industry and also by notforprofits midtermmidrisk primarily industry and government also academia and longtermhighrisk primarily academia and government also government and industry8 5 vannevar bush science

crs report 97836 2933 crs4 using still different terminology recent science policy conference noted that the important midtier of the research hierarchy precompetitive research conducted by industry has all but disappeared9 this indicates the importance for policy analysis and policymaking of adequately defining the character of rd recent proposal to modify rd terminology used for federal budget purposes noted that most federally funded research is at once both applied and basic it recommended that federal science and technology fst budget include basic and applied research and fundamental technology development but exclude initial production maintenance and upgrading of largescale weapons and space systems at dod doe and nasa10 to understand the role of the federal government in st requires an examination of the terms and models used to characterize research and development recent reports suggest that there is growing acknowledgment among those involved in science policy analysis and policymaking that clarification of terms used to characterize rd and innovation would not be just an exercise in semantics but could have important substantive policy ramifications for example there may be an important midtier of research precompetitive research conducted by industry that is disappearing when such research is characterized as part of another category of rd however it may not be apparent that there is problem likewise there are questions today about the validity of the linear model of research and innovation which may bear on the governments role in supporting some research and development federal rd missions the role of the government in research and development varies according to the federal mission involved since world war ii for example the government has played dominant role in defenserelated rd because it is carried out for national security purposes and because the government has been the sole or principal customer of the technologies and products developed much space rd also is federal mission where the government has been the sole or principal customer this situation may be changing in part as federal funding for defenserelated rd continues to decline significantly in real terms and as the military increasingly relies on purchasing or adapting dualuse technologies generated in the industrial sector for commercial ends rather than for defense rd programs recent study recommended that in light of these two trends the nation move toward single national technology base rather than having separate defenseoriented and 9 gary d

if that were to occur the governments role in defense rd in many cases may shift from that of dominant developer to that of preferred customer however even though dod may be using more commercial offtheshelf technology than previously the government still is the primary funder of defenserelated rd in civilian rd the government has been the dominant funder of many areas of basic research including physical science supported by the national science foundation and the department of energy and biomedical research supported by the national institutes of health support of much basic research is federal mission because it is considered by most policymakers to be public good important to the nation but it could not or would not be performed without federal support it generally has had broad support in congress even when other components of civilian research have had less support more controversial is the federal role in support of civilian applied research and development particularly in those areas of rd and innovation where industry has natural commercial interests this issue has been particularly prominent in the interactions between the clinton administration and the 104th and 105th congresses12 several of the reports summarized below for example discuss the pros and cons of the advanced technology program atp of the department of commerce and an increased federal role in technology support programs another area in which the governments role may be controversial is in rd policy linking the environment energy and the economy the socalled e3 policy area recent report13 characterized federal environmental rd as impressive but diffuse and uncoordinated in addition the governments role in promoting the environment may affect national energy production and use and consequently national economies congress must face these issues many of them rdrelated in its consideration of the economic and energy issues inherent in the kyoto protocol on global climate change14 the federal government also historically has had strong role to play in university research and the education of scientists and engineers at the undergraduate and graduate levels increasingly also it has assumed role in the mathematics and 11 carnegie commission on science technology and government science technology and government for changing world the concluding report new

relationships with academia and the states as discussed below partnerships with other rd performers during and following world war ii the federal government forged strong rd ties with industry and academia until 1977 the government funded more than 50 of the nations research and development although industry was the major performer15 of the nations applied research and development by 1997 the governments funding of the nations total rd had decreased to about 30 while industrys funding had increased to about 65 in terms of performance of the nations total rd in 1996 industry performed almost 73 in 1996 academia performed about 50 of the nations basic research or 60 if research performed by ffrdcs16 operated by universities and colleges is taken into account17 although the government still funds the majority of academic rd about 60 in 1995 this has decreased from about 73 in the 30 years since 196518 the federal government is less dominant partner with industry and academia than it has been in the past an aspect of the changing role of the federal government in science and technology involves what if anything should be done with the federal laboratory complex the federal government has the nations largest laboratory complex and is the nations largest employer of technical personnel many of these laboratories scientists and engineers are considered to be world class questions have arisen over the last several years however as to the whether all of these laboratories are fulfilling important or productive federal missions whether some of them are redundant whether some of them should be closed or sold and how they relate to the rd capabilities of the private sector in the 104th and 105th congresses for example legislation was introduced to eliminate doe and evaluate the future of its laboratories19 although it is likely that the government will maintain its own laboratory system in many rd areas such as in national defense and in certain areas of basic research real decreases in federal rd budgets in future years could 15 the major funders and performers of rd generally are classified as the federal government industry universities and colleges and nonprofit institutions 16 federally funded research and development centers are owned by the federal government but are managed and staffed by nonfederal personnel under

congress by william c boesman crs issue brief 97012 2 april 1998 crs7 result in fewer federal laboratories and in greater federal reliance on private sector laboratories than in the past the governments traditional role visavis industry is that of being the primary customer of federally funded rd performed in industrial laboratories this role of customer may be expanding as government relies more on dualuse technologies initiated in the private sector also federal partnering with industrial laboratories is increasing although it represents only small proportion of total us rd funding in these cases government is apartner with the private sector in developing and deploying new commercial technologies that fulfill federal mission objectives and enhance us industrys market strength20 another partnership relationship is that between the government and academia particularly the governments role in the funding and managing of research in universities and colleges and supporting the education of scientists and engineers there is evidence that the strong 50yearold federalacademic relationship is showing signs of strain and needs to be revitalized21 this is of major concern to policymakers in congress addressing the future of federal science policy another aspect of the governments role in public science that is science conducted in federal laboratories universities and colleges and other public institutions is its importance to industry recent study supported by the national science foundation found that public science plays an essential role in supporting us industry across all the sciencelinked areas of industry amongst companies large and small and is fundamental pillar of the advance of us technology22 the states were identified in recent study as ready to become full partners with the federal government in meeting americas contemporary challenges23 while this would enhance the role of the states in contributing to national development through rd it would also enhance the role of the federal government as the senior partner in the relationship because of the governments broader experience and rd capabilities specific aspect of the need for the federal governments leadership in this partnership was identified in the same study federal leadership will be required over the next two or more decades if the nations precollege educational system basically state responsibility is to be improved significantly the governments role in international st partnerships also seems to be changing from traditional tendency toward independence in conducting national 20 department of commerce effective partnering report to congress on federal technology partnerships washington gpo april 1996 20 see the summary chapter below 21

other things funding problems doe entered into negotiations with cern the european laboratory for particle physics for us participation in the large hadron collider lhc project the united states currently is committed to about 450 million for this highenergy physics project the federal government is involved in many other international rd agreements and projects and according to some observers may require stronger and more centralized federal st leadership and coordination than currently exists including in the department of state24 as noted below in the summary section however the department of state recently eliminated an important st position and reorganized it st capabilities rd budget management and planning the governments fy1999 budget shows real increases in total rd funding and real increases for nondefense rd funding through fy2003 the president however has proposed that most increases in civilian rd be paid from increases in the research fund for america rffa 90 of which are dependent on money that would be obtained from the tobacco industry settlement congressional approval of which is uncertain if it does not approve the tobacco settlement congress may not fund the proposed rd increases for some civilian discretionary programs including research and development25 that would be particularly likely if the congress enacted the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act istea26 with its sixyear funding at 2330 billion annually moreover the senate budget resolution27 recommends among other things 1 reduction for fy1999 from the fy1998 level for the budget functions that include civilian doe nsf and most nasa rd the national research investment act of 199828 on the other hand would increase rd funding in 12 selected agencies from 34

comparison with historical trends also is important in terms of the nations economic and cultural development while there might be benefits from protracted downsizing of the federal investment in the nations science establishment such as contributing to reduction of the national debt and the elimination of waste and redundancy in federal laboratories and other laboratories supported by the government there also might be longterm social and cultural costs if the federal investment in rd is smaller in the future it is possible that the nations economic return on that investment also would be smaller than it otherwise would have been in the words of one of the reports summarized below this would lead to picture of diminished excellence with increasingly evident traces of mediocrity moreover with the depleted science infrastructure that exists in the downsized future it will be difficult to catch up with what the nation could have achieved under an alternative scenario of healthy scientific growth 30 an elaborate federal structure has evolved since world war ii to manage the governments rd and formulate and coordinate federal st policy some recent reports have made recommendations as to how to improve that structure including longterm planning capabilities to ensure that the health of the nations science and technology is maintained into the 21st century these recommendations include institutionalizing longterm st goalsetting as part of the policymaking and budgetsetting processes in congress and the executive branch balanced role the six reports summarized

the 1997 white house report on science and technology shaping the twenty first century dealt with science technology national security the environment health and human resources practically the entire spectrum of issues covered in the carnegie commission report but from the perspective of the executive branch the report discussed the direct role of the federal government in its rd agencies its laboratory system and its support of university research it also noted that the government has an important although indirect role in catalyzing nonfederal st institutions to function effectively investing in innovation creating research and innovation policy that works edited by branscomb and keller is report of study group sponsored by bipartisan federal advisory commission it concentrated on one of the major issue areas addressed in the first two reports discussed above the issues involved the policy debate between the republicancontrolled congress and the clinton administration regarding the appropriate federal role in fostering technological innovation the report recommended that increased attention be given to an important gray area of research basic technology research that often has been overlooked and in which both the government and the private sector have role to play the report called for new comprehensive and sophisticated technology policy that is adaptable to changing competitive conditions the university conference on the future of the governmentuniversity partnership addressed widespread concern in academia the future of research support by the government and the need for new science policy with specific regard to academic support by the government most participants agreed that the government should support longterm fundamental research and many noted that the government might have role in supporting midterm precompetitive research such research provides link between the knowledge base and products that has almost disappeared because global economic pressure has forced us industry to concentrate on new product development it also was generally agreed that critical contribution of academia to the partnership is its training of scientific and technical personnel and that the support of education through the research process is one of the governments most important roles the department of commerce report effective partnering report to congress on federal technology partnerships addressed the importance of federal industry partnering an aspect of technology policy in us science and technology this was one of the concerns also addressed in the carnegie commission white house and branscomb reports the commerce report discussed significant change currently occurring in the federalindustry relationship from government as the primary customer of federally funded rd to government as partner with industry in developing new commercial technologies that meet both federal mission objectives and contribute to the nations commercial strength the report noted that the economic wellbeing of the industrial sector is major concern crs11 of the government just as the university conference noted that the wellbeing of academia is concern of the government the brown book downsizing science will the united states pay price asked whether the united states would pay cultural and economic price for downsizing its federal investment in the nations science establishment and answered in the affirmative the report discussed how an appropriate federal role in support of academic research federal laboratories and industrial rd could prevent the nation from having to pay such price it offered criteria to evaluate legitimate governmental funding for each of these three rd sectors some of the conclusions of the book for example in regard to the department of commerces advanced technology program conflict with those of other reports discussed above many other aspects of the governments role in science and technology were addressed in these reports which are summarized in the following section summaries of selected reports on the governments role in st six st reports are summarized in this section32

quotes in this section are from that source crs12 former presidents ford and carter from 1988 through 1993 it published 19 reports including this 1993 summary produced about 12 other background and related studies and sponsored 6 books and studies that were published elsewhere from 1993 through 1996 commission staff performed followup work and task force chairman discussed many of the reports recommendations with government officials according to the commission many changes in federal st policy have been made as result of those recommendations in 1996 the commission met for the last time and approved final report on st and the next clinton administration the commission made over 300 recommendations on st policy in 15 areas of focus the president congress the federal judiciary the states us international affairs global development international st decisionmaking by governments and intergovernmental organizations us national security the nations economic performance and technology base precollege science and mathematics education environmental research and development the role of st in regulatory decision making nongovernmental st organizations federal scientists and engineers and longterm national goals for science and technology in 14 of these areas the commission published one or more formal reports formal report was published on recruiting and retaining federal scientists and engineers the role of the federal government in st was addressed throughout the reports key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st the context of the carnegie commission reports is that the federal government has continuing essential role to play in us science and technology the summary report for example seems to assume that the us government will or should continue to maintain its funding support of many areas of basic research for example high energy physics and other areas of fundamental science that otherwise would not be supported applied research and development in furtherance of the governments missions for example defense health energy space and aeronautics and agriculture and science and engineering education and scientific research in the nations universities and colleges the report also recommends improvements in the governments technical scientific engineering and st policy leadership major theme of the summary report reflecting that of the individual reports is that closer cooperation is necessary between the us government and industry the states nongovernmental organizations ngos and foreign nations in addition the report discusses the commissions proposal for federal policies linking the environment energy and the economy these aspects are discussed in the next section findings andor conclusions the commissions report dealt with improvements in federal rd policy direction federal rd cooperation with industry and the states federal rd cooperation across agencies and with foreign nations and entities federal policy linking the environment energy and the economy and longterm st planning crs13 improvements in federal rd policy direction34 the report recommended improvements in many aspects of federal rd policy direction oversight and planning it recommended that congress improve congressional access to expert advice and internal organization to better deal with st issues in the executive office of the president the st policy structure should be enhanced which the report stated already had occurred to some extent because some of the commissions recommendations had been implemented examples included the elevation of the presidents science advisor to cabinet status and the reestablishment of the presidents science advisory committee psac in the bush administration and the formulation of the clinton administration technology policy which is very much in tune with the recommendations of the commission35 the report recommended assistance to the judiciary to improve its management and adjudication of the increasing number of cases involving complex science and technology issues the independent regulatory agencies are sometimes referred to as the fourth branch of government the report recommended that the executive office of the president in cooperation with congress and the judiciary take the lead in providing broad st policy guidance and in setting and implementing coherent regulatory priorities for these agencies to improve the governments technical capabilities at the highest level specifically those of the approximately 80 top presidential st appointments the commission recommended improvements in recruitment and reductions of barriers to ensure that the most highly qualified scientists and engineers are able to fill the positions the federal government is the largest employer of technical personnel in the nation the report recommended that congress and agencies in the executive office of the president develop improved personnel policies including salaries comparable to the private sector for the approximately 200000 scientists and engineers in the federal government who account for about 10 of all federal employees cooperation with industry36 with the dramatic decrease in us defense rd spending in the postcoldwar era and the militarys increasing reliance on technologies generated in the commercial sector the commission recommended that steps be taken to integrate the nations defense and civilian technology bases into single dualuse commercial and military technology base to shape and implement federal policy related to economic performance and the national technology base under these new conditions technology policy in the executive office of the president should be enhanced the report recommended that the department of commerce play more active role in forging strong partnerships with business labor and universities that would involve an expanded role for the advanced technology program atp of

projects agency darpa from its exclusive emphasis on defense as step toward creating broader national technology base37 cooperation with states38 the report recommended that with the end of the cold war the states should become full partners with the federal government in meeting americas great contemporary challenges p 25 that would include states being represented on federal st advisory and decisionmaking organizations including those defining missions for federal laboratories the report also recommended that each state establish science advisor to its governor and an st advisory board for its legislature and aim toward establishing national organization to assist states in st matters already in existence in most states are technology programs the majority of which promote businessdriven partnerships between industry and academia the chapter on education noted that although kindergarten through high school k12 education always has been mainly state and local responsibility the system has proven to be inadequate for improving science and mathematics education nationally the commission also found that the federal effort including the activities of the department of education and the national science foundation was divided and incoherent p 50 the report stated that presidential leadership and bipartisan commitment will be necessary over the next two or more decades if the nations precollege educational system is to be improved significantly cooperation across agencies and with foreign nations and entities39 the report stated that the international relations of the united states have suffered from the absence of longterm balanced strategy for issues at the intersection of science and technology with foreign affairs p 29 it recommended that international st responsibilities be clarified across federal agencies and particularly in the department of state for example that position of science and technology counselor to the secretary of state be established and that the number of st officers in us embassies be increased40 overall there are three aims for the mid1990s to define afresh the us international goals in and for st to bring the increasingly important international programs into the mainstream throughout the st agencies of the government and to orchestrate use of the nations full technical assets especially from the private sector in order to fulfill the goals of american foreign policy p 31 37 defense was dropped from darpas name in 1994 but was restored later to emphasize the agencys continued close

and technology have an important role to play in global development but their effective application requires presidential leadership the report recommended the establishment of national action roundtable for international development to mobilize for specific challenges the government the private sector and nonprofit institutions it also recommended that the agency for international development increase its access to us science and technology and improve its operations federal policy linking the environment energy and the economy e341 in addition to the general recommendations to improve federal rd policy direction noted above the commission also dealt specifically with the federal policy role in linking the environment energy and the economy the report noted that the federal governments environmental rd system is impressive in many ways but it is diffuse and uncoordinated more farreaching however is the commissions view of the importance to the nation of linking environmental quality energy security and economic strength in the development of national policy view that has become conventional wisdom the commissions term e3 has been accepted into the policy lexicon42 the commission recommended promoting coordination of e3 in the congress and improving the toplevel mechanism for such coordination in the executive branch43 in regard to the latter the report recommended that the system be reorganized and integrated through number of specific changes in the executive office of the president mergers of existing agencies and consolidations of laboratories of the environmental protection agency longterm st planning44 the report found that devoting more attention to longterm us st policy both within and outside of government is critically important in todays rapidly changing highly competitive global economy p 69 the report recommended that mechanisms for institutionalizing longterm st goal setting should be instituted in the policymaking and budgetsetting processes of congress and the executive branch another major recommendation was that nongovernmental national forum on science and technology goals should be established as forum for the exchange of ideas about future st policies and goals among all major sectors of society 41 see the chapter environmental research and development and the individual commission report

highlighting the clinton administrations st goals and accomplishments it was required by the national science and technology policy organization and priorities act of 1976 pl 94282 as part of the executive branchs biennial reporting to congress the report incorporated key issues and policy goals from two earlier white house reports science in the national interest 1994 and technology in the national interest 199646 as well as current clinton administration st policies and programs the administrations st policy achievements were promoted by examples taken from wide range of past current and proposed programs as well as by stating the potential importance of those programs in the next century the entire spectrum of federal st policy was described or alluded to in the report including federal research agency and laboratory activities programs and other related policy initiatives key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st policy the report covered six broad policy areas science technology national security and global stability the environment health and human resources each issue was addressed in separate chapter science the report takes the position that the federal governments support of basic research is an underpinning for the nations economic wellbeing health and security pp 1133 it highlights several national science policy goals and achievements since 1993 those described in greatest detail were sustaining leadership in scientific knowledge investing in modern scientific facilities and instruments and partnering to advance scientific frontiers according to the report the federal role is very broad yet productive when it comes to supporting basic research and advancing scientific frontiers the report contended that federal support of wide range of innovative and experimental scientific research projects gives the united states its lead in international science awards and honors for example in nobel prize winners in science from 19931996 however the report also contended that unless further investment is made the united states may fall behind other nations that are increasing their national non defense rd budgets the administrations position was that competitive advantages in the future will accrue to nations through investments that produce new basic knowledge the report provided examples of how us advances in astronomy the environment advanced materials and nuclear science have provided wide range 45 executive office of the president office of science and technology policy science and technology shaping

people from new knowledge about human existence to practical applications in medicine the chapter on science also addressed the importance of the federal effort to maintain modern scientific facilities and institutions it report stated that federally funded rd facilities are among the best in the world it cited many examples including facility developments and upgrades at nasa doe nsf and nih where federal investments have paid off wide range of scientific partnerships also were noted in the report this chapter summarized the benefits of scientific partnerships with industry academia and other rd organizations to enable greater leverage of national research investments technology in february 1993 president clinton set forth his national technology policy47 science and technology shaping the twentyfirst century noted the administrations accomplishments in wide range of technology initiatives both as direct supporter of technology development and as catalyst enabling us industry to compete globally pp 3536 to maintain the us technological lead the report called for the continuation of favorable domestic technology policies as well as where appropriate removing barriers to international rd collaboration the report contended that the government has direct role in providing funding vital to technology invention and innovation in turn that has led to the creation of new industries such as the computer and biotechnology industries it also has propelled existing industries such as agriculture and telecommunications into global leadership positions by creating favorable environment for technology development federal technology policy either directly or indirectly has led to advances ranging from frozen orange juice to closecaptioned television for the deaf the report stated that since 1993 the administrations economic regulatory and trade policies have enabled us industry to develop commercialize and otherwise compete in the global economy in this role the federal government has removed barriers and streamlined procedures for technology innovation the report stated that through the advanced technology program atp of the department of commerce the clinton administration has created successful governmentindustry partnerships for example it cited the autobody consortium which has helped the us automotive manufacturing and supplier industries the chapter also discussed other types of partnerships outside of the atp an example is the nasa aeronautics enterprise which has worked with the us aerospace industry to identify highpayoff commercial technologies third area where the administration cited successful us technology policy is infrastructure that includes direct federal support for infrastructure initiatives in information technologies and the internet the next generation internet initiative transportation intelligent transportation initiative and navigation global positioning system the administration also viewed infrastructure in larger 47 see congressional research service technology policy initiatives in the clinton gore administration by glenn j mcloughlin and wendy h schacht report 93357 18 march 1993 48 pp crs18 context of networked research infrastructure in health and medicine and in standards and measurements federal investments provide payoffs in direct technology application and through partnerships for example nihs cooperative research and development agreements cradas that encourage nonfederal institutions to take more active role national security and global stability to ensure that the us military and the defense community is capable of maintaining the highest level of security and vigilance the clinton administration has called for increased investments in rd linked to us national security pp 5775 the threat to national security was defined not only in terms of warfare and the need for advanced weapons but in terms of nuclear proliferation and terrorism thus the federal st role is not just limited to the traditional one of supporting dod rd but also includes federal role in supporting and encouraging st initiatives in fields related to broad national security goals the administration report called for radical restructuring of us defense st policy there are three prongs to this federal role acquisition reform of the us military purchasing the highest quality technology at lowest cost promotion of dualuse technologies including dualuse rd integrated production and insertion of commercial technologies and increasing militarycivilian technology prototypes in nuclear proliferation the report called for wide range of efforts in which the federal role is to reduce existing threats and stem the spread the weapons of mass destruction those efforts have included new bilateral and multilateral proliferation agreements enhanced global cooperation and new technologies for monitoring and verification the lead agencies have been dod and doe the report stated that the us infrastructure from transportation to telecommunications is at risk from terrorist attacks the critical infrastructure protection commission was created by the president in 1997 to develop national policy addressing that risk several broad st initiatives to promote global stability also were included strengthening scientific ties with other nations fostering global partnerships in science and technology applying us advances in health and medicine to reduce or eliminate disease and using st agreements to help countries maintain democratic advances such as in south africa environment the administrations report cited vice president gores long standing interest in environmental policy to improve the standard of living and well being of all people pp 7793 the policy goals and achievements listed in this chapter reflect the environmental policy developed by the clinton administration since 1993 that environmental st policy is defined by the administration to include wide range of health biodiversity ecosystems and global climate change issues to promote sustainable future for the worlds environment the report contended that only the federal government can provide the broad overarching st policies and actions that will ensure cleaner environment us industry academia and state and local governments may have an interest in some environmental issues and the report cited variety of partnerships with those groups and the federal government to sustain healthy and safe future the administration crs19 contended that federal policymakers must confront variety of local regional and global environmental challenges within comprehensive policy framework in this chapter the administration described the environmental challenges addressed by federal policies and programs they included maintaining biological diversity and protecting endangered species safeguarding water resources improving air quality reducing and ultimately eliminating exposure to toxic substances limiting the impact of natural hazards for example hurricanes reversing stratospheric ozone depletion and understanding mitigating and adapting to climate change this chapter provided an extensive list of federal programs addressing those issues the list includes doe epa department of the interior nasa noaa nih and nsf programs for developing clean alternative energy disposing of toxic waste maintaining wetlands improving satellite monitoring of weather patterns using computer modeling and simulation to forecast global climate change assessing endocrine disruptions in humans and wildlife and supporting basic research initiatives where industry and other nonfederal institutions are not undertaking research and development among the international programs is uscanada mexico public partnership addressing ozone depletion health the report cited the long history of the federal interest in improving the health of the nations citizens through investments in science and technology pp 95 115 the federal role in biomedical research is primarily undertaken through nihs programs addressing health and disease issues facing americans however other federal agencies such as usda nsf nasa epa cdc and the departments of energy defense veterans affairs and commerce support research in health and food safety in biomedical research the federal rd effort supports nih programs focused on understanding treating preventing and curing diseases such as cancer hivaids and alzheimers disease as well as emerging diseases such as ebola hemorrhagic fever the nih also supports research in genetic mapping and is significant supporter of neuroscience research as part of the 1990s decade of the brain p 103 in food and health the report provided several examples of ongoing federal efforts to improve food safety nutrition and production they include federal programs that fund research in sanitary standards and improve public knowledge of nutrition agricultural st issues cited in the report include direct federal st policies such as usda programs in animal health and husbandry and broader policies that enable greater advances in agricultural development such as harmonious trade efforts the report also cited federal programs in both basic and applied agricultural research as part of the larger federal health and safety rd portfolio human resources this chapter outlined current federal efforts in wide range of st education training and literacy issues pp 117134 it described the federal policies and programs supporting st human resources both by direct support and funding to improve learning and knowledge and policies that create crs20 more informed population all of the major federal research agencies have contributed to those policies the federal role in human resources development can be likened to three concentric policy rings at the center are federal policies that are intended to create and maintain worldclass leadership in science and technology at the core of that policy thrust are the university research and federal laboratory systems which receive direct federal funding and support part of that thrust is federal policies to improve the international performance of us students in mathematics and science second policy ring is federal support for an educated technical workforce the report cited several department of education programs to support that policy goal as well as partnerships with industry and the states to develop workforce capable of dealing with advanced technologies in the 21st century the third policy ring is to expand the st literacy of the entire us population the federal role extends from child care programs that develop reading and mathematics skills to programs that support adult learning and lifelong education the report viewed all of these human resources policies and initiatives as important to the future of us science and technology all three have broad national objectives particularly in developing technical workforce and in encouraging scientifically literate population in those two areas human resources policies are combined with administration science and technology policies described in the first two chapters of the administrations report and alluded to in subsequent chapters as well findings andor conclusions in the report there are two overarching st roles for the federal government one is direct role in which government support of rd promotes supports and ensures the health welfare security and economic prosperity of the american people that role is advanced through the federal agency missions in science and technology the federal laboratory system and support of university research the other role is that in which the federal government serves as catalyst enabling nonfederal st institutions to flourish in that role the federal government fills broader but according to the clinton administration less important position the role includes supporting st education and training creating favorable tax policies providing capital investment and creating rd spin off benefits the report contended that both roles are critical and correctly according to most science policy analysts that many of st initiatives cited in it are part of an historical federal role going back several decades or centuries for example agricultural research still since the entire report was about the role of the federal government in science and technology there are virtually policies programs or activities discussed in it that fall outside either the direct role of the federal government or its indirect role as catalyst when both roles are combined the tone of the report implied an activist federal st policy regardless of which role is taken crs21 investing in innovation creating research and innovation policy that works 48 background of the report this book was the culmination of project undertaken by the science technology and public policy program at harvard university which was sponsored by the competitiveness policy council bipartisan federal advisory commission many of the recommendations originated from diverse set of experts who participated in policy conference held jointly by harvard and the competitiveness council in washington dc on november 1819 1996 the book sought to shed light on the debate that emerged between the republican congress and the clinton administration regarding the appropriate federal role in fostering technological innovation the authors argued that bipartisan consensus for technology policy requires recognition that science and technology are deeply intertwined and often indistinguishable from each other in contrast to research and development which are quite distinct activities calling for different institutional settings and different expectations from their sponsors according to the authors there is basic agreement between congress and the administration regarding the federal role in the support of basic research and the education of future scientists and engineers public activities that benefit both the public and private sectors however much intellectually exciting and economically useful research lies between the categories of basic science and commercial product development which congress and the administration agree is primarily private sector responsibility branscomb and keller argued that when political debate divides the world of rd into basic scientific research on the one side and everything else from applied research to product development on the other the debate loses sight of huge and important gray area of research the authors refer to this gray area as basic technology research in which both the public and private sectors have an interest p 467 the book concluded by developing set of principles that outline what the federal role should be in supporting needbased basic technology research keyaspects regarding the role of the us government in st the report concluded that innovation is the product of intellectual creativity and broad based collective efforts the authors argued that the process of innovation grows more complex as countries around the world join in global effort to create and exploit new possibilities they contended that the united states requires carefully crafted broadly supported approach to this global challenge the final chapter of the book concluded that the current single overall technology policy must give way to comprehensive sophisticated technology policy based on widely shared consensus that is continually evaluated and adjusted to meet changing competitive markets in that light the book outlined six principles that reflect the view that the most appropriate and effective role for the federal government is to ensure that organizations and individuals have the knowledge skills and incentives to generate private investment in innovation the authors stated that these principles are entirely 48 lewis m branscomb and james h keller eds investing in innovation creating research and innovation policy that works cambridge mit press 1998 516 pp all quotes in this section are from that source crs22 consistent with the governments central economic strategy to encourage savings and investment rather than to drive consumption findings andor conclusions branscomb and keller noted the six principles described next that are intended to provide clear framework to aid in program and policy development the principles are intended to inform decisions and provide litmus test for program evaluation and improvement before any federal money is committed for basic technology activities one should ask such questions as is there significant public problem that must be addressed by the federal government are there other entities such as the private sector willing to offer solutions to the problem if not does the government have the skills experience and political legitimacy to bring about the desired results in manner acceptable to all of those affected finally they noted that these questions are asked in an atmosphere of finite resources in which priorities must be set and difficult competing choices made pp 485 principle 1 encourage private innovation through publicprivate partnerships the government should promote private investment to spur economic growth improve living standards and accomplish important governmental missions by creating incentives for and reducing barriers to technology development and researchbased innovation the central thesis of this recommendation was that the engine of innovation and productivity growth is in the private sector wherever possible the authors argued the pursuit of technology policy should favor the use of market mechanisms such as tax incentives and create markets for nonmarket entities such as tradable permits for sulfur emissions rather than direct government funding of research and development however policymakers should realize that private firms underinvest in longerrange research and in research to meet public purposes therefore the federal government should share in the cost of developing technologies that can meet the needs of both the public and private sectors the book contended that costsharing arrangements should be basic precept of federal technology initiatives where both public and private value is produced costsharing requirements might be reduced in those cases where firms allow or even encourage the technology to be widely shared however the authors suggested that industrys costsharing requirements should be raised as the technologies being developed get closer to primarily commercial applications principle 2 emphasize basic technology research focus direct government investment in science and technology for economic purposes on longrange broadly useful basic technology research and basic science both of which produce benefits far in excess of what the private sector can capture itself with respect to direct or matching support of federal research the authors recommended that the federal government continue to focus on traditional basic scientific research and basic technology research both of which produce benefits far beyond the fair returns on investment accruing to research performers in the private sector basic technology research includes activities that involve investigating fundamental processes of specific technologies such as blue lasers biosensors and the wearable computers such activities usually start early in the innovation process and lead to knowledge that is often nonproprietary and widely diffusible though crs23 clearly on course for industrial applications basic science and basic technology research are inextricably linked and dependent upon one another p 468 further companies have become more reluctant to put resources into basic technology research that is longterm and highrisk or both even though that research could eventually pay handsome returns to society as whole the book noted that more narrowly targeted or shortterm research with clearly defined goals such as product and process development should be funded by the intended beneficiary which might be private firm or in the case of technology needed primarily for government purposes by federal agency the authors contended that publicprivate technology partnerships should be structured so that it is clear how the results will reach broad range of users and benefit the public at large that implies using consortia of private firms universities and national laboratories in almost every case except where the government is the customer for the end product the book noted that mixture of institutional performers may be best since industry universities and national laboratories have their unique ways of ensuring that new work reaches variety of potential users principle 3 facilitating access to new and old technologies promote effective use and absorption of technology across the economic spectrum with special attention to the roles of higher education and the states in technology diffusion essentially this recommendation focused on the need for stronger federal and state efforts to improve the transfer of technology to the private sector primarily smaller firms mainly because many small firms have limited ability to choose among technologies and to make effective use of them the federal government working closely with states and regions should develop closer links between technology policy and workforce training and development that will help spur the diffusion and use of technology and create strong links between technology and the creation of highwage and highskill jobs two programs of the department of commerce were discussed the national institute of standards and technology nist manufacturing extension partnership mep program was offered as an effective model of federalstate partnership in technology diffusion and regional economic development the authors also suggested that the states should play role in shaping nists advanced technology program atp for example atp should longer focus its grants on single company but should focus its resources on establishing multicompany consortia so that groups of companies can benefit from new ideas such as techniques for creating new polymers materials for semiconductors and new systems for managing information principle 4 research and innovation policy is more than rd utilize the full range of relevant policy tools for example tax incentives regulatory reform standards and intellectual property rights recognizing that different industries technologies and regions may call for different mixes of those policy tools one size fits all technology policy is almost certain not to be successful rather the book noted that every industry is different and government agencies must crs24 be sensitive to those differences which require different policy approaches and different mixes of science technology and systems research for example strong patent protection is essential to business success in pharmaceuticals but less so in the computer industry where most large firms crosslicensed their technology internationally biotechnology companies draw directly on cuttingedge basic research while chemical and materials firms are more dependent on advanced process technology besides directly funding rd the federal government should support an array of indirect incentives to help foster technology development and diffusion including in addition to those mentioned above facilitation of standards development federal procurement antitrust law and competition policy and consensus building and policy analysis such as that performed by the defunct office of technology assessment for example direct federal funding for the national information infrastructure nii is not as important as the role that the federal government is playing in ensuring that regulatory hurdles are cleared and technical projects are funded so that programs such as the secondgeneration internet can be useful for both public and private sector customers principle 5 leverage globalization of innovation encourage usled innovation abroad as well as at home and enable us firms to get maximum benefit from worldwide sources of technical knowledge essentially us technology policy must encourage and facilitate globalization and transnational collaboration not impede them the united states must learn to cooperate as well as compete given the rapidly growing technical assets in other countries assets which in many cases are the product of public investments the authors noted that resolving trade conflicts tends to receive more public attention than investing in transnational collaboration and cooperation in the development of new science and technology although the latter often produces more benefits to the us economy than the former according to the book the global information infrastructure gii in which us firms and institutions enjoy commanding lead today is an excellent example of the role of us leadership in developing harmonious international environment principle 6 improve government effectiveness in policy development make government stable and reliable partner in longrange national research effort through more effective institutions for policy development strong and stable bipartisan support and stronger participation by the states in policy formation and execution the final recommendation called for strong and stable bipartisan support for technology policy primarily because of the longterm nature of most government investments and the other policies recommended in this book american science and technology thrive because they are supported by pluralistic system there are many sources of support many types of performers and maze of linkages among funders performers and users of science and technology further there is not and should not be centralized technology policy process that undermines the value of pluralism technology policy should be explicitly experimental continually adjusted and informed by access to expert advice crs25 the executive office of the president must provide the locus for linking broad national policy objectives such as economic and security policy with the technology agenda congress must be an active but patient and sophisticated participant congress also has central decisionmaking role adjudicating among technology policy experiments policies that fail should be terminated policies that succeed must be maintained or expanded however most importantly policy experimentation must be tried for sufficiently long time and under sufficiently reasonable conditions to be judged the book noted that the administration in its first term may have moved to expand its technology policy initiatives too rapidly while congress may have moved too fast to hamstring or deauthorize those initiatives the authors hoped that all sides will show more patience during the next four years the future of the governmentuniversity partnership49 background of the report there is widespread concern among both faculty and students in the nations research universities about the future of research support from the federal government one manifestation of that concern is desire to revisit the principles on which the partnership between the government and universities has been based since the end of world war ii while there has been much work over the last several years to articulate new principles consensus has emerged this conference was held with the hope that it could move toward such consensus opening remarks were made by representative vernon j ehlers and representative lynn m rivers about what each hoped to get out of the conference rep ehlers listed several desired outcomes of the conference that would prove useful for policy action in particular he hoped that it would serve to begin development of new model for universitygovernment relations representative rivers offered several issues that she hoped would be addressed including the direction the nation should move to ensure productive academic enterprise and healthy economic future the conference did not explicitly address the role of the federal government in rd beyond the discussion of the universitygovernment partnership nevertheless references to that role during the conference and certain themes about that role did emerge this section summarizes those themes key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st conference participants discussed the character of rd performed in academia federal support of university research the governmentuniversity partnership and organizational and management issues character of rd there was general agreement among the participants that the federal government should support longterm fundamental research one speaker characterized such research as that which is not economically feasible p 111 as justification for such research the conference agreed that new knowledge 49 gary d krenz proceedings of the 1996 jerome b wiesner symposium the future of the governmentuniversity partnership ann arbor university of michigan 1996 251 pp all quotes in this section are from that source crs26 was fundamental to advances in the nations wellbeing and that fundamental research was the primary source of that new knowledge some of the participants also asserted that the government might have role in supporting midterm research this type of research was defined as midrange precompetitive research one speaker noted that such research which had been performed mainly by industry and which provided the main connection between the knowledge base and products has all but disappeared because of global economic pressure that forced industry to concentrate on new product development there was also substantial support among the speakers that critical contribution of the universitygovernment partnership is its nurturing and maintaining p 53 of the human resources needed for technological advancement therefore support of education through the research process is an important responsibility of the federal government federal missions very little was said about federal funding of research that supported specific federal missions the conference however strongly endorsed support of university research by the federal government in the context of the universitygovernment partnership the only other reference to missionrelated rd was by one speaker who argued that policymakers do not adequately understand the importance of the contribution to general research and education of the rd funded by the federal mission agencies although that statement implied that federal funding of missionoriented rd should continue there was discussion about that proposition the governmentuniversity partnership the participants spoke of governmentuniversity partnership as formed from the principles set forth in the 1945 vannevar bush report50 those principles were that the federal government would provide support for the performance of fundamental research at the nations universities and that research in turn would produce the knowledge and trained people that would lay the foundation for greater national wellbeing one speaker argued that the partnership has been major factor in the nations success over the last 50 years an important theme of the conference however was that new model for that partnership is needed although some argued that many of the principles behind the bush model were still valid most felt that new science policy was needed to guide the partnership in the future little was said about other forms of government partnerships one exception was statement by one speaker noting the recent establishment of several programs supporting governmentindustry partnerships performing generic precompetitive research he argued that those partnerships were an important new development in the nations science and technology policy organizational and management issues most of the discussion in the conference about the federal role in rd concerned broad management issues in particular several participants spoke about actions the federal government could take to reenergize the universitygovernment research partnership 50 bush science the endless frontier crs27 one speaker suggested that the governments role in the partnership is the general allocation of the funds and the establishment of the regulations and guidelines for example intellectual property under which the research is to be performed he went on to argue that in carrying out that responsibility the federal government should develop more predictable and flexible process for determining funding levels particularly with respect to large projects he also asserted that more efficient less burdensome administration of regulations would help reduce disincentives to research pp 142143 that point was echoed by other participants who noted that the growing load of regulations have added to the cost of doing research and have created large bureaucracies in both academia and government caution was raised by one speaker however who argued that while reform of regulation of research is needed universities must be accountable to the public another recommendation was that the federal government pay the full cost of performing research that it funds one speaker noted that there is an increasing tendency of federal agencies to fail to pay the full costs of research primarily through reduction in indirect cost rates forcing universities to meet those costs with funds that should be used for teaching at the same time as another speaker pointed out universities have major responsibility in seeing to it that costs are contained one speaker however stated as arguable the notion that universities are not doing enough to contain costs thereby restricting access by nontraditional student populations many participants made the point that research and education need to be more closely integrated one speaker asserted that there will need to be more emphasis on education as one of the two critical outputs from universities this speaker noted that many nsf efforts are aimed at strengthening the connection between research and education including proposal to recognize research universities that have done an outstanding job of combining research and education there was strong suggestion from those remarks that an important federal role is to see that tighter connection is made between education and research last point concerned ways to increase public support of science and technology the participants agreed that without such support sustaining the governmentuniversity partnership will be very difficult if not impossible many speakers emphasized that to gain that support it was necessary to make clearer to the public the importance of science and technology to the wellbeing of society they argued that both partners universities and the government have responsibility in undertaking that task findings andor conclusions the major theme emerging from the conference was that the research partnership between the federal government and universities must be maintained for the benefit of the nation doing so however will require significant changes by both partners to deal with changing conditions brought by the end of the cold war constraints on federal spending and uncertainties about public support of university research number of other conclusions can be drawn from the points made at the conference first federal funding of fundamental research should continue and the primary recipient of those funds should be universities second the government role crs28 in the partnership should not be too restrictive that is the government should set broad priorities for allocation of the funds and avoid excessive regulation third public support is critical to the success of the partnership the public must be made more aware of the importance of science and technology to national wellbeing at the same time universities and the federal government must pay more attention to public concerns finally universities must give higher priority to education much public concern appears to be based on belief that universities have put too much emphasis on research to the detriment of education effective partnering report to congress on federal technology partnerships51 background of the report in conjunction with the responsibility of the undersecretary of commerce for technology to serve as an advocate for innovation and industrial competitiveness52 the office of technology policy otp issued report detailing the evolution of publicprivate cooperation in the areas of research and development the study analyzed the change from government as the primary customer of federally funded rd to government as partner with the private sector in developing and deploying new commercial technologies that fulfill federal mission objectives and enhance us industrys market strength p 20 following world war ii the assumption was that technology developed to meet federal mission requirements eventually would find applications in the private sector without any formal efforts however that was not the case and in the early 1980s several new programs were implemented to actively commercialize government technologies the approach in the 1990s has been to facilitate partnership between the public and private sectors where all participants develop innovations necessary for global economy such changes indicate the existence of new paradigm in which government programs reflect increased business sector involvement in federal efforts to develop and adopt new technologies while the amount of federal funds spent on these activities is small in comparison to total us rd investment the leveraging of public and private financing has an economic impact beyond that of each separate investment there are several key elements of the new paradigm according to the otp report collaboration maximizes the return on rd investment by focusing on projects with potential for economic growth job creation and improved quality of life programs that display flexibility predictability and stability allow the government to be better partner with the private sector the increased role of the business community in projects from concept to execution provides more opportunities for economic growth through technology commercialization cost sharing gives the private

budget99budget_hilitehtm crs29 government programs while limits on the length of participation ensure that unsuccessful activities will be terminated key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st that there is an important role for the federal government in maintaining competitiveness is underscored throughout the report although the private sector has primary responsibility for the health of industrial innovation government has an interest in maximizing the economic benefit to society of the tax dollars invested in mission rd p 37 it is through collaborative efforts that federal investments of time and resources become more effective partnerships allow for the creation of critical mass of skills knowledge and resources that permit more technologically challenging work to be undertaken beyond the individual capabilities of each party for the federal departments and agencies cooperative ventures move stateoftheart information expertise and technologies from the private sector to the government for use in meeting mission requirements collaborations help decrease the costs of large expensive projects where there is both public and private sector interest by offering and facilitating commercialization opportunities beyond the original application of the research and development the economic wellbeing of the industrial community is also of concern to the government the process of innovation typically is very costly and time consuming and the outcomes often are uncertain partnerships along with other technology policies are intended to alter the balance between risk and reward so that costs and uncertainty become acceptable and there is additional incentive to undertake rd collaborative activities are designed to directly catalyze private sector investments in new technologies p 46 and foster the creation of business and research synergies p 54 the evidence of strong industry support for cooperative rd efforts is reflected in the extent of participation and the degree of costsharing in total the private sector has invested 3 billion in cofinancing for technology partnerships with the us government p 63 there is great potential for expanded participation by the business community there also is interest in other government initiatives to spur innovation those initiatives include product liability reform tax changes affecting capital formation standardsetting regulations and other regulatory policies such efforts should be designed to reduce uncertainties and costs tied to investments in research and development the new paradigm of publicprivate partnerships includes many activities agencies are placing greater emphasis on commercialization potential in selecting projects to fund nonfinancial assistance to small firms is being offered in conjunction with ongoing rd programs efforts are being made to strengthen the private sectors intellectual property rights associated with collaborative ventures to maximize the commercial effectiveness of partnerships private sector partners need both clear title and freedom from potential conflicts in product pricing and royalties p 57 federal agencies also are attempting to build speed flexibility and predictability into the partnership programs that is in conjunction with increased private sector participation in the development and implementation of relevant government programs crs30 findings andor conclusions the results of governmentindustry partnerships while apparent are hard to assess quantitatively because of difficulties in measuring the outputs of public and private investments in rd currently the executive branch is developing new methodologies to calculate the effects of research and development on the economic wellbeing of the nation however there are documented interim measures of success identified in the office of technology policy report increased licensing between federal laboratories and the private sector as well as between universities and industry demonstrates commercialization potential arising from collaborative work twentyseven percent of small business innovation research sbir program projects have resulted in product sales in both the commercial and governmental markets an increased number of cooperative research and development agreements cradas have been negotiated and are operational the advanced technology program atp of the national bureau of standards and technology nist in the department of commerce has reported accelerated development of new technologies expanded technical capabilities and reduced time to market the otp report offered several recommendations to facilitate partnerships as summarized next make partnership opportunities more accessible and easier to identify the decentralized nature of federal rd has made it difficult for the private sector to identify appropriate partnership opportunities and relevant intellectual property increased information dissemination could help remedy this situation the government can act as catalyst tying sources of privatesector funding and business expertise with companies that need such resources it can also promote expanded professional interactions including fellowship programs work details procurement contracts professional seminars or joint research ventures p 67 additional interagency coordination of research can assist in wider dissemination of partnership opportunities by providing public information on governmental interests and projects federal collaborative efforts with consortia and other umbrella organizations can multiply the effects of the work by involving several companies and universities providing effective and unambiguous intellectual property protection can overcome obstacles to industry participation in publicprivate partnerships be better partner improve speed flexibility and predictability one of the impediments to expanded collaborative work is the time necessary to establish joint ventures and the inflexibility of the arrangements once they are negotiated the goals of the negotiations of the partnership agreement should be to enable the parties to reach agreement on mutually beneficial terms in the least possible time while spending the least possible resources p 69 funding must be available in an expedient fashion and efforts must reflect the interests of firms in controlling the intellectual property generated from substantial privatesector support the office of technology policy report recommended that partnership agreements be easier to negotiate involving intermediary organizations in the process can be helpful the government needs to understand the differing research objectives of members of consortium involved in publicprivate collaboration the authority to use flexibility in administering cooperative ventures minimizes burdens on the participants as does predictability in partnership arrangements among crs31 agencies and laboratories negotiations are time and resource intensive so some conformity paired with flexibility can decrease uncertainty in the business community help small businesses secure necessary business and financial advice from state programs and privatesector sources partnerships with small firms that have strong research capabilities can be very productive however those companies often do not have the business expertise necessary to commercialize the results of research and development concerted comprehensive effort on behalf of the federal government is necessary to assist such firms in obtaining the resources to bring technologies to the marketplace successfully further increase the privatesector role in project definition and selection privatesector participation in collaborative efforts to meet agency mission requirements is important to improved partnering and does not compromise the integrity of the governments research responsibilities without such interaction it is extremely difficult to move federally funded rd into the marketplace as stated in the otp report the point is not to take the agency beyond its legitimate research mission but to ensure that within the scope of that mission the agency considers the private sectors interests in defining the areas in which it will solicit funding proposals p 74 shift to commercial financial management practices the implementation of federal costaccounting principles is major obstacle to privatesector partners because it is expensive and unfamiliar the methodology was developed to meet the needs of the government as customer rather than as partner agencies should demonstrate flexibility in moving toward commercial financial management practices when negotiating the requirements of joint venture according to otp the experience of atp and the other partnership programs with private sector partners indicates that corporate fraud or misuse of funds is extremely unusual p 75 continue developing an integrated system of measuring program results increased accountability of government programs is in the interest of both congress and the administration however measurement of the results of federally supported rd currently is difficult and inaccurate undertaking thus further efforts must be taken to assess program outputs both the immediate effects as well as the long term widespread economic impacts of such activities the agencies need to develop and implement comprehensive system of measurement such an effort will require the involvement of industry and academia downsizing science will the united states pay price53 background of the report this book reviewed the benefits of scientific research to society and the economy traced downsizing in federal support for 53 kenneth m brown downsizing science will the united states pay price washington the american enterprise institute press 1998 151 p unless otherwise noted all quotes in this section are from that source crs32 research and offered recommendations for forestalling cuts and for an appropriate federal role to support academic research federal laboratories and industrial rd key aspects regarding the role of the us government in st studies by leading economists according to kenneth m brown show that scientific research plays crucial role in enhancing the productivity of the us economy in promoting longterm economic growth and in providing social benefits according to brown economists have concluded that technological change accounts for between 80 and 90 of growth in output per worker over the long term but results are less clear about the effect of research on innovation although some consider federal support for science to be blip on historys radar screen pp1516 because of its relatively short history and because it is decreasing percentage of national rd support it is crucial for some federal missions and for academic research however brown said that federal funds for science peaked in real terms ten years ago and have drifted downward since p 5 future real dollar reductions in federal research funding are expected in defense rd and in all areas of civilian rd except for the national institutes of health and the national science foundation the reductions will occur because of firm discretionary spending caps and as more of the discretionary budget goes to support increases in entitlement funding as result of an increasingly large aging population pressure on the budget will increase if there is an unanticipated economic downturn additionally the current outlook reduction for science is all the more unsettling because it comes after rapid expansion over the period 1953 to 1990 average annual growth of rd funding was 48 percent about two percentage points above the growth of the economy as measured by the gross domestic product p 13 additional downsizing in federal science funding would be risky according to brown since the returns on investment in research are so large the empirical evidence gives little guidance though as to whether the science budget should be 50 billion or 150 billion p 28 it is likely that other area of federal investment provides such high social benefits as research and development even though the best estimates of the average rate of return on science spending suggest that it is around 50 that does not prove that there should be more spending brown cited several different economic studies that by his calculations show benefits of rd investment of about 8 to 10 of gross domestic product gdp annually another way of calculating the effects of rd is on its contribution to economic growth brown wrote another rough calculation rd is 26 percent of gdp suppose we make massive 20 percent cut in rd which would equal 05 percent of gdp if the rate of return on the lost rd had been 50 percent then we would lose 025 percentage point of growth each year fairly large amount in relation to the nations longterm growth of about 25 percent certainly anyone who could devise feasible policy that would add 025 percentage point of economic growth would be an economic miracle worker p 26 furthermore concern about the negative effects of downsizing science needs to account for the fact that many benefits of science are not captured in the national crs33 income accounts for instance the better health and longevity generated by biomedical research the effects of downsizing also need to account for the benefits lost the new knowledge not discovered federal budget cuts eliminating bad science projects might help solve the problem of budget reductions but seem to be infeasible politically other major supporters of research foundations and the private sector will not make much of contribution to replacing federally funded research dollars foundations devoted only small amount of money just about 250 million in 1993 to scientific research while federal funds have decreased in realdollar terms and as proportion of total national support for rd industrial spending for rd has increased in the past industry funded less than 50 of national rd today it funds about two thirds totaling about 130 billion in 1997 while the federal government funds about 75 million however industrial support of basic research has declined implying that the federal government should fund risky fundamental science since private companies could not fund fundamental research on the scale funded by the federal government according to brown there is vital but limited role for government in support of research p 44 he rejected the views of some economists who question any role at all for the government in promoting science they include economist william niskanen who prefers to augment private rd expenditures through the tax system by tax credit for research and experimentation and matching grants as means of inducing more government research without putting government completely in charge of selecting specific research projects p 52 he also disagreed with terence kealy who he said argues that science would be adequately supported by private means without governmental intervention p 52 he said that to support his views kealy used selective examples of failed projects that met his criteria but did not represent full spectrum of the history of projects he also disagreed with the view of charles murray who he said would wipe out all subsidies for scientific research leaving only enforcement of patent law as the sum total of science support p53 government funding should focus only on research that the private sector would not fund more attention should be given to allocating funds and determining priorities in an increasingly constrained federal research budget it is not easy to use objective criteria to evaluate or assess the value or outputs of federal research the government performance and results act gpra pl 10362 requires that outcomes of federal research programs be evaluated such evaluations are expensive to date gpra analyses have been satisfactorily completed p 130 the economic theory of public goods according to brown provides principles that guide priority setting by developing three necessary conditions for legitimate governmental funding those are the research must have reasonable chance of producing benefits that outweigh its costs these must be broad social benefits rather than benefit just to particular firm the research would not be performed in the absence of governmental support crs34 the federal agency must be able to fund or perform the research efficiently see chapter 5 pp 4454 these three criteria apply equally to research grants contracted research and mission research performed by government laboratories p 48 findings andor conclusions the difference between mediocrity and excellence in science amounts to low billions of research support dollars annually reductions in federal science funding would not cause immediate measurable showdowns in productivity growth but inevitably some needed research would never be conducted the biggest impact would be on the nations universities which will be noticeably different after ten years of diminished federal funding well endowed research universities may not suffer much but because of reductions in the less prominent universities fewer phds will be trained and more us students will have to go abroad to find expertise in certain fields as us universities obtain more funds from industry or seek to earn more from profitoriented consortia the wideranging social benefits of freely available research may be compromised or scientific research in academia may become more shortterm nevertheless commercially supported academic research seems clearly preferable to simply letting academic research shrink p 9091 the federal government should target federal funds more effectively p129 eliminate questionable programs and increase spending by around 30 or 35 percent annually in real terms in order to support science at level which is acceptable p 128 this is within the nations reach but living within tighter budgets means that the nation will have to live within the following guidelines target federal funds more effectively if we could selectively target the least efficient federal government subsidy programs for elimination then downsizing might not be so harmful unfortunately science budgets are not established in that way nor is there any actual authority that systematically reviews rd programs with efficiency as key consideration p 54 stability in federal funding also is important the process of allocating federal funds for science and technology needs to be made more coherent systematic and comprehensive p 54 brown described the proposal in the 1995 national academy of sciences report allocating federal funds for science and technology54 as reasonable attempt to organize science budgeting it called for development of federal science and technology fst budget which would exclude funding of production engineering testing and upgrading of weapons systems pp 129130 nurture but do not directly subsidize industrial rd industrial research is wellfunded by industry but is shifting away even more from fundamental research to applied research some existing federal programs directed at industrial research have strong tendency to displace what industry could have done on its own the federal government should not fund applied research projects that industry 54 national academy of sciences allocating federal funds for science and technology crs35 will fund and should eliminate those programs that are inefficient such as the department of commerces advanced technology program which now appears to displace privatesector funding subsidies are justified only to the extent that they buy social benefits benefits that accrue only to the firm are not legitimate goals for federal subsides if one accepts the marketoriented framework for economic policy p 106 brown endorsed the recommendations of the academy report on allocating federal funds for science and technology that the government should encourage but not directly fund privatesector commercial technology development with two limited exceptions development in pursuit of government missions such as weapons development and space flight or development of new enabling or broadly applicable technologies for which government is the only funder available p 106 the government should reduce actions by regulatory agencies that inadvertently reduce the effective rate of return on industrial research if industrial rd funding slows down we need to look to the more subtle and indirect causes such as tax policy federal regulations and the like the whole range of regulations health care policies and complex legalisms that surround pharmaceuticals for example probably do more to affect the rate of return on rd than ten advanced technology programs would p 131 also the federal government can aid industry by ensuring adequate funding for fundamental scientific research at universities since such research is necessary for innovation rationalize the roles of federal laboratories federal laboratory missions need to be adjusted by congress following the end of the cold war to realign and focus the laboratories missions clear agreement on precisely what role the labs should play in the nations research enterprise is lacking and pork barrel considerations are likely to warp any national plan that may emerge p 78 but the laboratories main functions in energy defense and related mission objectives in public health and the like seem appropriate the missions would entail certain amount of fundamental research but not on largescale transition into research that is best performed at universities p79 he sees the laboratories performing applied research that nonetheless has broad benefits and which for that reason companies are unlikely to perform including advanced computing techniques or intelligent robotics or new manufacturing processes and advanced materials p 79 however laboratory performance now does not meet the requirements of the third criterion federal laboratories need to be managed more efficiently he disagreed with recommendations to create commission to target laboratories for elimination the survival of highly valuable but misused resource is at stake p 131 what is needed is commission to study the role and missions of the laboratories recognize the growth of science worldwide and develop policies to take advantage of it internationally the united states now leads the world in science as it has since the end of world war ii the downsizing of us scientific research funding is occurring at time when other nations are increasing theirs these two factors combined would in the future force us scientists to cooperate more with scientists in other nations and to pay more attention to the scientific results generated crs36 by other nations leadership in science does not make lot of sense as goal of science policy p 131 the nation needs to be more interactive with the countries that are enlarging their scientific activities with the global expansion of science bringing rapid growth in the worlds knowledge base we should welcome this explosion of new knowledge as benefit to the united states not fear it as threat p 124 protect federal support for academic research the federal government plays crucial role in support of university research which is especially significant because universities are the nations largest performers of fundamental research and they train scientists and engineers on average universities receive about 60 of their research budgets from the federal government thus they would suffer large reductions in their research budgets with more downsizing in federal rd budgets that would hurt the nations potential to innovate and cause the most serious long term consequences chap 8 industry and other sources will not be able to replace federal support for university research if it is downsized therefore federal funding needs to be protected brown concluded by noting that while research on the measurement of the economic effects of rd appears to have gone about as far as it can with the existing data which are virtually mined out more research is needed on the theory of intellectual property and its applications especially in time when it is likely that public resources for science will be limited p 132 crs37 appendix acronyms of some federal departments and agencies referred to in this report cdc centers for disease control and prevention darpa defense advanced research
