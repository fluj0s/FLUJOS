family and brought the country to nearly total breakdown much of the population blamed the democratic party government for not regulating and even profiting from the shady schemes anti government demonstrations against investment losses turned violent and grew into an armed insurrection led by pockets of guerrilla insurgents based in the south of the country up to 2000 persons were killed in the first half of 1997 weapons depots were raided and the country became awash in small arms some of which flowed into neighboring kosovo in response to the crisis the security council approved the

police were killed by the middle of that year and random killings and injuries continued for months afterward the us department of states annual reports on human rights practices have noted improvements since the end of that crisis the 1999 report noted continued problems with police harassment and abusive treatment of prisoners politically motivated violent crime and lapses by the police in addressing criminal situations an inefficient and corrupt judicial system corruption and the general lack of law and order also remain problematic economy europes poorest country albania has seen dramatic economic swings since 1989 in 19901991 grim economic prospects extremely high unemployment and food shortages prompted mass exodus attempts especially by albanias younger population large inefficient industries were abandoned and collectivized farms were swiftly dismantled and privatized albanias galloping growth rates in the mid1990s surpassed most expectations but the countrys economic recovery proved to be deceptive and susceptible to corruption the 1997 pyramid scheme collapse and ensuing crisis brought the economy to virtual standstill gdp declined by an estimated 7 in 1997 the new government that took office in mid1997 worked quickly with assistance from international financial institutions to stabilize the economy and resume structural reforms especially privatization and banking and administrative reform pyramid investment schemes were banned and their assets auctioned economic growth has rebounded with 8 gdp growth recorded in 1998 and 1999 under stable macroeconomic environment the kosovo refugee crisis in 1999 presented an enormous economic burden on the albanian economy but was largely offset by the massive inflow of international humanitarian aid very low foreign investment levels poor infrastructure and corruption continue to challenge economic recovery crs4 foreign policy kosovo and neighboring states albanias population totaling about 32 million people is largely ethnic albanian2 large numbers of ethnic albanians live outside the country especially in kosovo in serbia the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and montenegro in kosovo ethnic albanians comprised about 90 of the province of nearly 2 million when violent conflict began in kosovo in march 1998 many observers feared that albania would become dragged into the conflict3 many albanians support the kosovar albanians quest for independence some observers fear that independence for kosovo could lead to its eventual annexation with albania they speculate that greater albania might also incorporate territories in neighboring montenegro and macedonia publicly the socialist albanian government has rejected the notion of greater albania during the kosovo conflict albania bore the brunt of the refugee flow from kosovo by the end of natos allied force air campaign against yugoslavia in june 1999 albania had received over 440000 kosovar refugees the majko government appealed to all albanians to accept and support the refugees posture widely applauded abroad shortly after the yugoslav army withdrew from kosovo and nato began to deploy the kosovo peacekeeping force kfor droves of kosovar refugees began to make their way back to kosovo only few thousand refugees currently remain in albania albanias relations with its other neighboring states have also been problematic but to much lesser extent ethnic albanians comprise over 20 of the population in the neighboring former yugoslav republic of macedonia mainly in the western part of the country adjacent to albania the albanian population there maintains grievances with the slav macedonian majority although its parties participate in government and parliament ethnic greeks comprise the largest minority in albania although their number is disputed between albanian and greek organizations relations with greece had been strained by the treatment of the greek minority in southern albania albanian fears of irredentist greek claims to southern albania the intermittent expulsion of migrant albanian workers from greece and occasional border skirmishes after reaching the lowest point in 1993 and 1994 relations between albania and greece began to improve in 1995 greek president kostis stephanopoulos visited tirana on march 2122 1996 and signed bilateral friendship treaty marking new beginning in bilateral cooperation european integration after many years of nearly total isolation albania made significant strides in establishing and improving

participating in the initiative as part of the strategy the eu has offered to establish stabilization and association agreements with the socalled frontline states of albania bosnia croatia macedonia and yugoslavia negotiations on an saa with albania may commence before the end of 2000 however eu officials have said that albania still needed to implement further reforms and strengthen law and

followup conference on october 30 1998 in tirana donors urged the albanian government to do more to restore law and order restore political dialogue among parties reform public administration and
