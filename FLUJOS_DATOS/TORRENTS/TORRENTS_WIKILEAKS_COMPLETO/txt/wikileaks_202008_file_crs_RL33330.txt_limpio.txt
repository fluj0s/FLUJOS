federal governments largest and most widely available source of financial assistance to support state and local governmentdirected neighborhood revitalization housing rehabilitation and economic development activities these formulabased grants are allocated to more than 1100 entitlement communities metropolitan cities with populations of 50000 or more and urban counties the 50 states puerto rico and the insular areas of american samoa guam the virgin islands and the northern mariana islands grants are used to implement plans intended to address local housing neighborhood revitalization public services and infrastructure needs as determined by local officials with citizen input due to the block grant nature of the program local and state officials exercise great deal of discretion in determining which combination of eligible activities in 25 categories to undertake when developing their community development plans eligible cdbg activities include historic preservation real property acquisition demolition site preparation and disposition economic development and job creation including assistance to forprofit entities and establishment of revolving loan funds housing assistance including rehabilitation loans and grants public service activities including job counseling and employment training and assistance to notforprofit entities including community development corporations and faithbased institutions any of the eligible activities undertaken by community must address at least one of the programs following three national objectives principally benefit low and moderate income persons aid in eliminating or preventing slums or blight or meet particularly urgent community development needs because existing conditions pose serious and immediate threat to the public it is this third program objective meeting an urgent threat that allows cdbg funds to be used to assist in disaster response activities the programs authorizing statute requires each state and entitlement community to allocate 70 of its cdbg funds to activities that primarily benefit low and moderateincome persons in response to previous disasters hud has crs2 waived this provision in order to allow community to address an urgent threat to the safety of residents cdbg disaster assistance the cdbg program has been used frequently by the federal government to respond to natural and manmade catastrophes for list of cdbg disaster recovery appropriations see appendix table a1 in general congress has provided increased flexibility and allocated additional cdbg funds to affected communities and states to help them respond to and recover from presidentially declared disasters this includes allowing communities to reprogram cdbg funds to meet disaster related needs including shortterm disaster relief mitigation activities and longterm recovery activities in assisting communities and states in responding to disasters hud may expedite grant awards for affected communities in presidentially declared disaster areas including allowing affected grantees to move up their cdbg program start dates shortterm disaster relief past disaster relief legislation has allowed cdbg funds to fill gaps in federal emergency management agency fema and small business administration sba emergency relief activities in general such legislation prohibited cdbg funds from substituting for fema or sba funding but allowed cdbg funds to be used for activities that are not reimbursable by fema or sba typically cdbg has been used to finance the removal of debris the provision of extra security patrols and the emergency restoration of essential services such as water sewer electrical and telecommunications for instance approximately 250 million in cdbg funds were used to finance the emergency temporary restoration of utilities in the affected areas of lower manhattan following the destruction of the world trade center and an additional 500 million was made available for permanent utility restoration and infrastructure improvements1 mitigation activities mitigation activities are intended to lessen the impact of disaster and can range from such physical measures as the construction of levees to protect against flooding to buildings designed to withstand earthquakes mitigation activities may also involve training exercises and public awareness programs less typical is the use of cdbg to compensate businesses and workers for lost wages or revenues mitigation can take place at any time before disaster occurs during an emergency or after disaster during recovery or reconstruction mitigation activities have involved the use of cdbgs to fund buyouts of real property in areas prone to recurrence of the event for instance following the midwest floods of 1993 cdbg and hazard mitigation grants from fema were used to acquire privatelyheld real property within flood plain areas in the nine 1 lower manhattan development corporation partial action plan s2 for

midwest floods of 1997 congress again appropriated cdbg funds to cover buyouts of privatelyheld land in flood prone areas in the affected states4 following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress appropriated 2 billion under pl 107117 for disaster relief and recovery assistance to new york5 the act earmarked at least 500 million for economic losses to individuals businesses and nonprofit organizations in an effort to mitigate the attacks economic impact that provision required hud to implement the program within 45 days after passage of the act it limited economic loss grants to small businesses located within designated area to more than 500000 in addition the act earmarked at least 10 million for the tourism and travel industry6 longterm recovery activities the third set of activities eligible for cdbg assistance is associated with longterm recovery and reconstruction efforts this would include assistance to businesses and residents affected by presidentially declared disaster as well as grants intended to attract new businesses to the area the forms of assistance may range from business loans to infrastructure improvements for instance to assist in the redevelopment of the lower manhattan area of new york following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress appropriated 35 billion in cdbg funds of the 35 billion in cdbg funds made available 149 billion has been allocated to recovery assistance including 350 million in business recovery grants to compensate businesses for lost revenue and small firm attraction and retention

cover some portion of costs incurred by edison and verizon in restoring utility and telecommunication services to the lower manhattan area other actions by hud in support of disaster recovery in addition to providing cdbg funding assistance congress has included number of other provisions in past disaster relief appropriations to facilitate relief and recovery efforts and to ensure accountability these have included the use of waivers funding transfers matching funds and reporting requirements authority to waive program requirements previous disaster relief appropriations have granted the secretary of housing and urban development significant authority to waive program requirements but have generally prohibited waivers in four areas nondiscrimination environmental review labor standards and fair housing this is consistent with the programs authorizing legislation which states that for funds designated under this title by recipient to address the damage in an area for which the president has declared disaster under title iv of the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act the secretary may suspend all requirements for purposes of assistance under section 106 for that area except for those related to public notice of funding availability nondiscrimination fair housing labor standards environmental standards and requirements that activities benefit persons of low and moderateincome10 congress on few occasions has waived or modified the cdbg programs income targeting provisions which require grantees to allocate at least 70 of their funds to activities that benefit low and moderateincome persons for instance in response to the midwest floods of 1998 and the florida hurricanes of 2004 the income targeting requirement was lowered to 5011 in response to the 1992 angeles riots congress increased the ceiling on the use of the cdbg funds for public service activities in angeles from 15 to 2512 in addition to waivers affected grantees in presidentially declared disaster areas may request the suspension of certain statutory or regulatory provisions this may include extension of the deadline for submitting annual

provisions prohibiting the use of cdbg funds for new housing construction or for repair or reconstruction of buildings used for the general conduct of local government several past disaster relief acts included language requiring hud to publish in the federal register five days in advance of the effective date any waivers or suspensions of any statute or regulation governing the use of cdbg funds for disaster relief14 funding transfers congress has included language in previous disaster relief appropriations allowing communities to transfer cdbg funds to other programs for instance disaster relief assistance legislation in response to the northridge california earthquake of 1994 included provision allowing hud to transfer 75 million in cdbg assistance to the home investment partnership program housing block grant administered by hud15 in addition congress included language in appropriations dealing with the 1998 midwest floods that transferred administrative authority over cdbg funds for land buyouts from hud to fema as part of disaster mitigation strategy16 matching funds congress has also included language in disaster relief appropriations requiring communities to meet financial match requirement as condition for receipt of cdbgfunded disaster relief assistance for instance disaster relief assistance in response to the florida hurricanes of 2004 required each state to provide not less than 10 percent in nonfederal public matching funds or its equivalent value other than administrative costs for any funds allocated to the state under this heading17 cdbgs awarded to states following the 1998 midwest floods were conditioned on each state providing 25 in nonfederal public matching funds18 reporting requirements several past appropriations acts have included provisions requiring quarterly reports on the expenditure of funds in order to provide oversight and ensure accountability in the allocation of disaster relief funds legislation providing cdbg disaster relief assistance to communities affected by the 1997 and 1998 midwest floods included provisions that required hud and fema to jointly submit quarterly reports to the house and senate

disaster recovery assistance in the defense appropriations act for fy2006 pl 109148 which was signed by the president on december 30 2005 these funds were to be used for necessary expenses related to disaster relief longterm recovery and restoration of infrastructure in the most impacted and distressed areas in the five states alabama florida louisiana mississippi and texas impacted by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma the act allows for the following the affected states may use up to 5 of their supplemental allocation for administrative costs hud may grant waivers of program requirements except those relating to fair housing nondiscrimination labor standards and the environment mississippi and louisiana the most affected states may use up to 20 million for the local initiative support corporation and enterprise foundationsupported local community development corporations and the governor of each state may designate multiple entities to administer portion or all of states share of the 115 billion the act also reduced the income targeting requirement for activities benefitting low and moderateincome persons from 70 to 50 of the states allocation limited the maximum amount of assistance any of the five states may receive to more than 54 of the total amount appropriated and required each state to develop for huds approval plan detailing the proposed use of funds including eligibility criteria and how the funds will be used to address longterm recovery and infrastructure restoration activities it did not however specify the method to be used to allocate funding among the five states hud was authorized discretion in determining the allocation methodology on january 25 2006 hud secretary alphonso jackson announced the allocation of the 115 billion among the five states see table 1 20 115 stat 221 crs7 according to an agency press release hud used number of data sources in developing the methodology for allocating the 115 billion in cdbg supplemental assistance these included data sources from fema the small business administration the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and the us geological survey using data from these agencies hud calculated for each of the five states the extent of each states unmet housing needs and areas of concentrated distress hud defines unmet housing needs as homeowners and low income renters whose homes had major or severe damage whereas concentrated distress is defined as the total number of housing units with major or severe housing damage in counties where 50 or more of the units had major or severe damage21 hud then allocates 55 of the funds based on each states unmet housing needs and the remaining 45 is allocated based on the degree of concentrated distress as measured by each states share of damaged and destroyed housing stock and business and infrastructure damage on february 13 2006 hud published in the federal register notice of allocations waivers and alternative requirements governing the 115 billion in cdbg disaster recovery assistance22 in addition to providing waivers allowing the states to allocate funds to cdbg entitlement communities and directly administer the program the notice also includes language that funds allocated are intended by hud to be used toward meeting unmet housing needs in areas of concentrated distress23 the language included in the act is not interpreted as restricting the use of these funds to unmet housing needs rather it provides some level of flexibility in allowing funds to be used for longterm recovery and infrastructure restoration in the areas most affected by the gulf coast hurricanes of 2005 fy2006 supplemental appropriations pl 109234 on february 16 2006 as part of its ongoing efforts in support of gulf coast

provided by category specifically funding related to housing and nonhousing activities and cdbg funds used to cover administrative costs although hud has sought to standardize the process when reporting budget and expenditure data by creating templates to be completed by the states publicly available data provided by the states particularly web based reports are not uniform louisiana and mississippi have the most complete reports available whereas alabama florida and texas have provided less information this lack of readily accessible detail makes comparisons difficult as does the lack of onepage standardized summary report that identifies the components by line item of activities classified as housing and non housing activities see table 3 alabama florida and texas in addition to lack of standard format for reports information has also been provided at different points in time and comparability is difficult obtaining data for the same time period on quarterly basis can allow for better comparability across the five states receiving cdbg disaster relief funds hud does have the ability to access more timely data through the use of its disaster relief grant reporting data base drgr however that information is not readily accessible to the public pending legislation gulf coast hurricane housing recovery act of 2007 hr 1227 on march 16 2007 the house financial services committee reported hr 1227 hrept 11051 on march 23 2007 the bill was referred to the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs title i of the bill includes provisions that increase the state of louisianas flexibility in the use of cdbg funds for its road home program and that provide additional oversight and reporting requirements to guard against waste fraud and abuse of cdbg funds awarded to the state for disaster recovery activities specifically the bill would transfer 1175 billion from femas hazard mitigation grant program hmgp to the cdbg program allow the transferred funds to be used in support of the state of louisianas road home program including setting aside 15 million to fund pilot program of land acquisition to be administered by the new orleans redevelopment authority allow cdbg funds to be used to meet the nonfederal matching fund requirements of other federal programs including fema in areas affected by hurricanes katrina wilma rita and dennis when such funds support disaster relief longterm recovery and infrastructure restoration crs14 eliminate the requirement for separate environmental review if one has been conducted by fema and allow cities and counties that used their regular cdbg allocations to provide rental assistance to hurricane katrina rita or wilma evacuees to be reimbursed from previously appropriated fema funds the bill also includes provision exempting cdbg program funds used to finance louisianas road home program from provisions in previous appropriation acts pl 109148 and pl 109234 prohibiting the duplication of benefits derived from hazard insurance flood insurance or disaster payments from fema the bill includes three provisions intended to strengthen oversight activities one provision would require the state of louisiana to file monthly progress reports on the road home program with the house financial services committee and the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs the second provision would require the gao to provide quarterly monitoring reports on the use of the 1175 billion in hmgp funds transferred to the cdbg program and third provision would require the gao to conduct study of the effectiveness of the pilot program administered by the new orleans redevelopment authority after two years of implementation policy considerations the cdbg programs broad list of eligible activities and its flexibility has allowed communities and states affected by disasters to undertake shortterm disaster relief efforts implement mitigation strategies and finance longterm recovery activities these funds have been used to support disaster recovery efforts spanning multiple states as well as to respond to disaster recovery efforts in highly urbanized areas as congress examines legislative proposals intended to finance longterm disaster recovery efforts it may move to consider number of cdbgrelated policy questions is the cdbg program an appropriate and effective means of providing federal support for longterm disaster recovery efforts if it is what should be the level of cdbg assistance awarded to affected areas should cdbg assistance be controlled by the individual communities by the states or by multistate regional entity or entities should congress require states to meet matching fund requirement as condition for receiving disaster recoveryrelated cdbg funds if so what level of matching funds would be appropriate would it crs15 be fixed or adjustable to account for such factors as level of damage state fiscal capacity income levels and other factors what if any additional compliance and accountability measures or actions should congress require of cdbg recipients as condition of receiving cdbg funds crs16 appendix table a1 funding history
