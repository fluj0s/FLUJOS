options and prospects for renewal by jf hornbeck and william h coopera uscolombia free trade agreement economic and political implications introduction the proposed uscolombia free trade agreement cfta is bilateral free trade agreement between the united states and colombia which if ratified would eliminate tariffs and other barriers in goods and services between the two countries the cfta negotiations grew out of regi onal effort to produce usandean free trade agreement among the united states colombia peru nd ecuador in may 2004 after negotiators failed to reach an agreement for an andean free trade agreement fta colombia continued negotiations with the united states for bilateral trade agreement on februa ry 27 2006 the united states and colombia concluded the uscolombia fta and fina lized the text of the agreement on july 8 2006 on august 24 2006 president bush notified the congress of his intention to sign the uscolombia fta the two countries signed the agreement on november 22 2006 the united statescolombia trade promotion agreement implementation act hr 5724s 2830 was introduced in the 110th congress on april 8 2008 the bills were introduced under title xxi bipartis an trade promotion authority act of 2002 of the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 this act makes ex pedited legislative procedures established in 151 of the tr ade act of 1974 pl 93618 available for congressional consideration of legislation to implement free trade agreements negotiated under authority of the 2002 act under these statutory procedures known as trade promotion authority or tpa and sometimes called fast track procedures congress has maximum of 90 days to consider the implementing legislation the measure is privileged for c onsideration the length of consideration is limited and amendments are precluded1 the house must act first on the bill because the legislation would affect revenue and under the act it must do so w ithin 60 days the senate cannot act until the bill passes the house the senate could nevertheless take up and pass its own implementing bill then hold it at the desk pending the arrival of the house companion in that case however the expe dited procedures of the statute limiting debate precluding amendment etc woul d not be applicable for the senates consideration of its measure except by unanimous consenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34470crs2 2 inside us trade house approves fasttrack rule s change for uscolombia fta april 11 2008it is currently unclear whether or how congress will consider implementing legislation in the future the house lead ership took the position that the president had submitted the legislation to implement the cfta w ithout adequately fulfilling the requirements of the trade act of 2002 for consultation with congress and on april 10 the house by vote of 224 195 adopted h res 1092 making certain provisions of the expedited procedure in applicable to the cfta implementing legislation hres 1092 suspends the tpa provision requiring that the committees of jurisdiction automatically be discharged from the implementing bill if they have not reported it by 45 days of session after its introduction it also removes the tpa provision that making motion to proceed to consideration of the bill highly privileged and not debatable thereby restoring the normal control exercised by the leadership over the floor schedule if the committees of consideration were to report the implementing bill the adoption of hres 1092 effectively removed the obligation for the house to vote on the cfta within 60 days of ssion although the house leadership retains the ability to schedule vote at any time under the general rules of the house if it chose to do so consideration would most likely occur pursuant to special rule reported by the committee on rules and dopted by the house which would presumably establish terms for consideration similar to those directed by the tpa hres 1092 did not change the tpa provisi ons that the cfta is not amendable once it comes up although in principle this restriction could be altered by the terms of special rule for considering the implementing bill nor does it alter the applicability of tpa rules in the senate if congress does not consider the cf ta during the current congress the implementing legislation will likely lose its eligibility for fast track consideration in the next congress under tpa trade agreement and its implementing legislation can be submitted to congress pursuant to the act only once and it is the presidents initial submission of the agreement that tr iggers the 90day process under expedited procedures for this reason it is genera lly understood that the eligibility of the cfta for expedited consideration under the statute would not carry over or be renewed in subsequent congress although this procedural point has not been officially tested because the speaker has made formal ruling on the matter from the chair2 the cfta implementing legisl ation however could still be re introduced in the next congress under the general rules of both houses and could be considered in the house under tpalike procedure pursuant to special rule

increases between the two countries another expect ation is that it would improve investor confidence and increase foreign direct inve stment in colombia which would bring more economic stability to

agr eement with the united states key element in his vision to promote economic growth in colombia and to help bring more economic stability to the country the ur ibe administration also views the pending agreement as way of increasing its pres ence in the global economy and strengthening democratic conditions within the country4 the colombian government recognizes that free trade agreement in itself would be insufficient to alleviate the problem of poverty and has planned other economic complementary refo rm measures such as plan to lower corporate taxes to spur competition and create jobs the government is also taking steps to reduce the regula tory burden and strengthen protection for foreign investors in colombia5 the uribe administration believes that free trade agreement with the united states is necessary to help move the country forward in its efforts on domestic reforms if the us congress approves the uscolombia free trade agreement the challenge for colombia would be to continue domestic reforms so that the trade benefits from the agr eement reach all segments of the population especially the poorer regions of the country httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34470crs4 6 the text

though the gains would be larger for colombia on sectoral level the study found that an agreement would have minor sectoral effect on the us economy but the effect would be more significant for colombia because it is the smaller partner the study indicated that colombia would face certain structural adjus tment issues with displacement of lowskilled workers in some sectors but that these

domestic producers to lower cost foreign pr oducers and result in substituting an imported good for the domestic good this process is called trade creation trade creation provides economic benefits as

colombia would eventually increase but are currently restricted by colombias lack of certification to export fresh chilled or frozen beef or pork to the united states colombias elimination of trade
