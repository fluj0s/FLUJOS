usa fvey 3 introduction srel to usa fvey this short term study overviews and document s key elements of the cotraveler analytics both under development and operational at nsa each section includes brief description of the analytic its status source data and caveats srel to usa fvey while each analytic was designed to operate on particular type of data or particular data format many can likely be scaled to operate on other data sources for instance analytics designed for dnr gcid or vlr data might also apply to dni geolocation data srel to usa fvey the process of documenting these analytics raised series of imp ortant issues that not only distinguish the analytics from each other but more importantly shape the landscape that we must consider in moving forward to meet the analytic needs at nsa some of these issues are discussed in the next section issues and questions should co travel analytic consider where gcid or vlr is physically located many gsm analytics use gcid information to identify co travelers if two selectors are seen at the same gcid around the same time they are considered co trave l candidates the analytic does not need to know where the gcid is physically located however if the individuals are using different network providers eg t mobile and verizon they may be physically standing next to each other as their mobiles regis ter with different cell towers cotravel analytics that do not consider the physical geo locations of the towers will not discover individuals that are co traveling on different networks analytics that make use of point data eg thuraya necessarily need to consider geolocational data in order to determine distance from one point to another should incidental co travel ers be considered there is difference between incidental co travel due to collective movement individuals with similar travel behav iors but other similarities and functional group based co travel among individuals with behaviorally relevant relationships ctcop makes this definition explicit but warns that we might not want to exclude seemingly incidental co travelers simply beca use we are unaware of their relationship other factors such as contact chains and target comsec behaviors frequent power down handset swapping sms behavior might assist in determining whether co travelers are associated through their travel behavior s alone or through behaviorally relevant relationships top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 4 should geography play role in cotravel because it is difficult to know where gsm target is located within gcid or vlr many of the gsm cotravel analytics use the mathematical central point in the vlr or gcid as reference point we could postulate that traveling targets will be located along roads train tracks or footpaths where network service exists this type of geographical information could theoretically be used to inform cotraveler analytic in identifying candidates especially those that are traveling via the same means of transportation geographical informationmightalsobeusedtofillinthegapswhendataismissing between locations that target visited analytics in thisstudythatmakeuseofsuchgeographicalinformationincludedsdsco travelanalyticandthegeospatialanalysistradecraftcentersgatcs opportunity volume analytic should device and collection sampling play role in determining cotravelers we may collect hundreds of events from one targets mobile phone while collecting only few events from his cotraveler s mobile phone the number of events collected may be due to collection bias differences in network service andor target comsec behavior analytics should take these considerations into account when attempting to identify cotravelers should cotravelers seen in different source databases be considered dependingonatargetspreferredcommunicationbehaviorssomeco travelers may be seen largely in dnr gsm data and other cotravelers may be seen largely in dni data we may be able to constructamorecompletepictureofatargetslocationsovertimeifwe combine dnr and dni data sources it might be worth considering the degree to which considering multiple data sources will significantly increase the number of false positives databases that do not contain geolocation information might also be considered for instance air travelers on the same reservation number are probably cotraveling on the same flight users sharing mac address are probably colocated using the same device even though we may not know where that device is located consistent observations of devices within the same laic may provide evidence of colocation evenifthelaics physical service area is unknown finally similarities between ip addresses may indicate proximity on the same lan even if the physical location of the lan nodes is unknown the one analytic in this study that attempts to combine multiple sources of information to buildamoreholisticpictureofatargetstravelpatternisthe taccafétmac cotravel analytic can cotravel be considered series of meetings we attempted to limit this study to targets cotraveling through two or more locations within an analystspecified time and space window if those locations are defined however we might consider co travelasaseriesofmeetingsatknownlocationsana lytics that detect colocation may be different in nature from those that detect cotravel the specific analytic need will define which of these approaches is more appropriate and efficient top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 5 in this study examples of meeting analytics that detect instances of colocation include the gatc opportunity volume analytic and the meetgreet spatial chaining analytic analytics chalkfun background tssireltousafveychalkfunsco travel analytic computes the date time and network location of mobile phone over given time period and then looks for other mobile phones that were seen in the same network locations around one hour time window when selector was seen at the same location eg vlr during the time window the algorithm will reduce processing time by choosing few events to match over the time period chalkfun is spcma enabled1 ssirel to usa fvey note as of 6 september 2012 the events that are chosen depend on the samplingmethodchosen by the analyst most active most per day firstlastmost or firstlastspreadthesamplingratespecifieshowmanyeventsarechosentomatchaschalkfun moves to the cloud this option will be discontinued tssirel to usa fvey the cloudbased version of chalkfun see r6 sortinglead cotraveler analytic sect ion which may be released as early as september 2012 will have number of additional features and options the system will run one query rather than separate queries for all of the imsis msisdns vlrs and gcids that an analyst enters as if the selectors and areas of interest were joined with an orthesystemcurrentlyrunsseparatequeriesforeachreturningseparatesetsofresultsfor each combination of selector and areas of interest the cloudbased version will also enable the user to set the size of the time window that the analytic considers rather than defaulting to one hour as described above the user will be able to choose the countries or locations of interest blacklist and whitelist features will enable the user to instruct the system to ignore activity within region or restrict analysis to specified regions of interest eg ignore activity in or use only activity from in considering potential cotravelers the analyst will have the option to ignore activity in which the target is in his home country 1 ssirel spcma enables the analytic to chain from through or to communications metadata fields without regard to the nationality or location of the communicants and users may view those same communications metadata fields in an unmasked form top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 6 the analyst will be able to filter in or out potential cotravelers with specified prefixes for instance return only mobiles remove all mobiles them or include only mobiles that are from the same country as the target status and summary status source data caveats operational available at analysts desktops cloud version could be available as early as september 2012 all fascia data containing vlr and gcid information current version is not cloud based and can have long processing times however cloudbased solution is imminent analytic will only return cotravelers on the same provider network dsd cotravel analytic background ssirel to usa fvey the dsd cotravel analytic predicts target locations and cotravelers by calculating timebased travel trajectories probable travel routes are calculated using observed locations and determining the most likely paths and travel times similar to that used in turn byturn navigation systems these target travel paths are represented as series of latlong waypoints or line segments along the probable travel routes such as roads the travel paths are divided into segments eg 20 to 50km along the road the analytic predicts the approximate time that the target would theoretically arrive at each segment waypoint based on projected travel times between known locations then within the travel window the analytic discovers candidate cotravellers that intersect locations along the buffered travel path the next step in the analytic is performed using interactive renoir analysis of two mode graph representing the route segments and selectors observed on these route segments within the time windows once the data is clean and candidate cotravellers are identified detailed analysis can be done in renoir or other tools such as geotime incorporating other supporting data such as communications events and content ssirel to usa fvey the analytic currently runs on netezzabased architecture called hectic snare that rapidly executes mysqlbased qfds this architecture enables interactive exploratory analysis and rapid pattern matching the analytic is distributable and could be implemented in hadoopmapreduce or accumulo ssirel to usa fvey this analytic was tested using an terrorist case study the case study used approximately 80000 base stations locations and 16 billion mobiles location records for cdrs call detail records and infrastructure collect from drt and juggernaut systems this case study showed that more candidate cotravellers were discovered by analyzing the travel paths than by considering common meeting locations alone top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 7 status and summary status source data caveats analytic implemented and tested at dsd mobile cdrs and residing in netezzabased architecture requires netezza current implementation requires renoir future work ssirel to usa fvey dsd would like to integrate key meeting locations into this analytic such as safehouses plans are also underway to identify targets based on comsec behaviors such as identifying mobiles that are turned off right before convergence between two travel paths occurs geospatial analysis tradecraft center gatc opportunity volume analytic background tssirel to usa fvey the opportunity volume analytic determines whether two entities eg devices could have been colocated by considering the possibility of their travel paths intersecting the opportunity volume analytic requires pairs of event locations and times for each entity and computes the possible locations and times in which the two entities could have been colocated it does this by computing possible travel route surfaces for each entity between the specified events using travel cost surface computed from terrain land cover and road network data these possible travel route surfaces include the temporal dimension that is the period of time in which the entity could have been at the given location the intersection between these multidimensional surfaces represents the places and times during which the entities could have been colocated the analytic was developed using gps point event data but the analytic actually uses 1km grid for the spatial resolution and 15minute period for the temporal resolution so it can be applied to any data that can be expressed in these terms status and summary status source data caveats prototype service implemented on nganet not yet ported to nsanet geohashes of gps point event data requires event locations and times for every selector designed for 1 km gridbased locations and 15 minute time intervals cotravel capability would require analyst to define series of meetings at specified locations top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 8 future work tssirel to usa fvey the purpose of this service is to determine whether two entities could have been colocated given observed event locations for those entities to detect cotravel the analyst would need to define series of meeting locations and times the opportunity volume analytic could also provide mechanism for vetting cotravel analytics by testing for possible colocation events along cotravel routes tmi cotraveler analytic background tssirel to usa fvey the track mutual information tmi cloud analytic was developed as study under their graph analytics alerting and target development program the analytic is oriented to work on 7 to 30 days worth of regional collection it has been tested on rtrg data from the region instead of using gcid information as cotravel reference points the analytic works cross network by computing target closeness based on the gcid latlong geo information and time the latlong information is obtained from rtrg tssirel to usa fvey the analytic starts by computing event sequences of lat long and time for each selector these are called tracks it then computes value that measures how far the selector has traveled in general if the selector has not traveled outside 20 to 50 km radius the selector is not considered each eligible selectors tracks are pairwisecompared to the others and measure of similarity in time and space is computed status and summary status source data caveats initial development completed in testing phase not yet operational sortinglead summaries of fascia data on gmplace and gm rtrg regional gsm collection analytic only considers tasked selectors as seeds analytic does not conside r targets that do not travel outside 20 to 50 km radius track dataset must be repopulated for each data update future work tssirel to usa fvey would like to reduce processing by creating an index containing selectors whose tracks are near each other in space to achieve this future work may make use of geoaddress hashing algorithm that uses latlong information to group cell towers into clusters that are in the same region this hash considers latitude and longitude only and is agnostic to the targets service provider it may be possible to also compare target tracks quickly by comparing these geoaddresses top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 9 cotraveler analytics background tssirel to usa fvey has developed two cotravel analytics fast follower ff and meetgreet spatial chaining mg sc the ff analytic was initially designed to detect individuals who are following station personnel detailed nonsigint path data is collected consensually on the station personnel and this reference path data provides the seeds for this analytic which attempts to discover mobile geo data indicating individuals that may be following the station personnel the mgsc analytic is designed to detect meetings between highvalue individuals and other entities tssirel to usa fvey the ff analytic begins by considering nonsigint reference paths for station personnel based on detailed knowledge of the entityslocation candidate followers are determined by identifying other individuals that have traversed some number of consecutive points determined by the analyst that match the reference path in space and time the analyst also sets parameter to specify the minimum distance that must be covered along candidate path ssirel to usa fvey the mgsc analytic is designed for elkprints data from smartphones this analytic identifies sequences of consecutive location points close in time and combines them into single data point maximum velocity movement parameter is applied to create time window around each point representing the approximate time at which the individual was located there as opposed to traveling to or from that location finally cotravelers are identified by discovering pairs of selectors that meet the duration and distance thresholds set by the analyst as input parameters spatial chaining software aggregates and presents the meeting data including the locations times and scoring metrics to the analyst status and summary status source data caveats the mgsc analytics has been tested on real elkprints data but results have not been validated by operational analysts the ff analytic has been tested on madeup data smartphone data from elkprints referencepath data ff list of selectors mg sc analytic designed for precise geolocation data eg from smartphones mgsc analytic would require the analyst to define series of meetings pact nga nsa gatc analytic background tssirel to usa fvey the pact analytic is joint nsanga effort to identify cotraveling thuraya handsets the effort was motivated by an increase in thuraya phone usage by sigint geospatial analysts were able to characterize the travel top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 10 behaviors of the targeted thuraya handsets and identifying other handsets with similar patterns the targeted handsets were observed traveling between known government and military installations therefore handsets with similar travel behaviors were inferred to be government forces tssirel to usa fvey the first step of pact is to identify set of waypoints for each target handset waypoints are generated from sequences of events that cluster together in space and time the second step is to identify which pairs of handsets contain similar waypoint clusters pairs are scored based on the number of waypoint clusters that match this analytic also considers the total possible number of waypoint clusters for each selector so that the total number of communication events per selector is taken into consideration this process is intended to reduce the possibility of producing results that include incidental cotravel the third step in this analytic identifies persistent patterns by examining the time periods over which colocation occurs for each cotravel candidate pair status and summary status source data caveats tested on voicesail data from cultweave patterns stored in qfd in process of transitioning pact to nsas2 thuraya data from cultweave 500 m waypoints in cultweave analytic designed for thuraya or other point data future work future work could involve applying this analytic to other types of qfd datasets such as inmarsat and gsm data the team is also interested in building on this analytic to enable discovery of asynchronous cotraveling relationships r6 sortinglead cotraveler analytic background srel to usa fvey r6 has been partnering with chalkfun to upgrade the chalkfun cotraveler analytic to cloudbased analytic that will run on cloud 14 to eventually be migrated to mdr2 tssirel to usa fvey the r6 cotraveler analytic accepts selector and timeframe as input and then derives an itinerary for the selector that includes the cell ids andor vlrs depending on what is available the itinerary is based on series of waypoints generated from the location information that is available in fascia pcsthentheanalyticsearchesforotherselectorsthatwerenearthese waypoints in space and time time windows are configurable and can be adjusted by the user each candidate is scored and then prioritized based on the scores tssirel to usa fvey the r6 cotraveler analytic operates on sortinglead event summaries and geo index the sortinglead event summaries provide rapid access to fascia pcs events by summarizing top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 11 and enriching key elements of selector behavior the sortinglead event summaries benefit this analytic because they can provide enriched location information about selectors that is not present in the raw metadata the geo index contains mapping between the locations gcids or vlrs visited by selector and the time dayminute that the visits occurred information from command and control networks that track ied attacks is also used to enrich the geo index tssirel to usa fvey the results that can be returned from this type of analytic can potentially be enormous each candidate will have some level of time and space overlap with the seed prioritization occurs by assessing the quality of the overlap in terms of time and space closeness the analyst may choose to triage any number of potential candidates eg top 10 or top 100 candidates or candidates that surpass given threshold status and summary status source data caveats in testing phase to be replacement backend for the current production chalkfun cotraveler tool cloud based mapr educe implementation under development to handle larger numbers of queries simultaneously fascia pcs sortinglead summaries chalkfun enrichment vlr country mapping analytic cannot recover cross network cotravelers analytic will not be effective against stationary nontraveling targets processing is memory intensive analytic is sensitive to large cells vlrs and dense areas not directly applicable to sat phones with latlong information results can be very sensitive to timeframe chosen as input for instance analytic will not be effective for large queries across multiple countries and large time frames eg anywhere in over the past year and then anywhere in future work tssirel to usa fvey because the r6 cotraveler analytic depends on gcid and vlr locations as meeting points or waypoints it will not return selectors that cotravel on different provider networks for instance it could not return verizon selector cotraveling with tmobile selector the r6 team is working on experiments that might alias seed selectors to nearby selectors on other networks to get around this problem but this poses challenges the rtrg analytic discussed later in this paper uses relative velocities to deal with the crossnetwork challenge but this approach requires precomputing travel behavior for all pairs of selectors which can be computationally expensive top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 12 rtrg sidekicks background tssirel to usa fvey the rtrg sidekick cloudbased cotraveler analytic compares average travel velocity between pairs of selectors to infer whether or not could cotravel would practically be possible the velocity factor is intended to reduce the number of false positives when considering travel among urban areas by filtering out pairs of selectors that were seen at the same series of cell ids or vlrs over time but could not have been traveling together because the location data timestamps presuppose an unreasonable velocity this may happen because one or both of the selectors in the pair may have been located at the edges of the network coverage during one or more of their travel midpoints tssireltousafveytheanalyticfirstcomputesmovementsummariesofallavailabletasked selectors the movement summaries contain list of locations that target visited during the timeframe of interest given by the analyst locations are defined by cell ids for gsm or geohashes for any other selectors with latlong then the system discovers pairs of targets that could be traveling together by comparing their sequences of physical locations and factoring out pairs that could not have reasonably arrived at the meeting waypoints within 10 minutes of each other tssirel to usa fvey one of the main benefits of the rtrg sidekicks analytic is that it is not constrained by provider network because it considers physical latlong locations and travel velocities it can provide co traveler results that include selectors on different provider networks status and summary status source data caveats qfd available at rtrg analyst desktop rtrg tools goldminer chet geot sortinglead event summaries the subset of fascia pcs currently running on rtrg could possibly scale to fascia event summaries requires accurate tower geo data location and date requires precomputing all selectors against all selectors which can be expensive current output includes only tasked selectors analytic is not designed for stationary targets future work tssirel to usa fvey currently the system is integrated with rtrg operating on gsm data it may scale to larger data source however it is designed to precompute sidekicks for each possible pair or tasked selectors tssirel to usa fvey this analytic could also be applied to dni location data top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 13 scalable analytics tradecraft center satc geospatial lifelines co travel qfd background tssirel to usa fvey the geospatial lifelines qfd appliestheconceptofdwelltimestoidentify dnr cotravelers dwell times describe the time period spent at the beginning or ending destination location is considered beginning or ending location if the dwell time at that location is greater tha n 2 hours tssirel to usa fvey this qfd first generates geohashes using gsm event data and then calculates transition lines indicating that device traveled from one geohash to another the result is graph in which the geohashes represent nodes and the transitions represent links or edges clustering algorithms are applied to the graphs to determine locations and selectors of interest tssirel to usa fvey t he geospatial lifelines represent the beginning and ending locations as defined by their dwell times and all other intermediate observations the likeliness of cotravel along paths between starting and destination points is based on the following measurements net distance time of transition mins speed kph azimuth and number of travel segments status and summary status source data caveats analytic tested on 90 days of gsm event data from code is available through satc but analytic is longer under development geohashes of gsm event data retrieved from fascia analytic designed for gsm data but could be applied to other types of data oriented to targets that remain in one location for at least 2 hours requires geocoded source data for generating geohashes future work srel to usa fvey the code for this qfd is available through satc but the analytic is longer under development ideas for future work before the project ended included adding acceleration and sinuosity to the computation ssg common imsis analytic background ssirel the common imsis analytic is model in sedb jema finds sim card activity seen on cell tower panels in multiple areas eg border crossings commonly used by traffickers it makes use of the tower qfd top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 14 ssirel analyst inputs

cotravel analytic these analytics are currently still under development however they are available to the development community on gmplace tssirel to usa fvey this analytic uses ip geolocation of active userpresence events as travel indication tssirel to usa fvey the dni analytic operates in one of two modes the first mode accepts list of tasked targets via utt and attempts to identify cotravelers for those targets that have been deemed to have travelled during specified time window typically 30 days the analytic only considers targets that traveled between at least 2 countries in given month for these traveling targets candidate co travelers are scored based on how many times they were seen in the same locations during the same times as the target target locations are given by dni selector ip geolocation provided by asdf enriched top secretcomintrel to usa fvey top secretcomintrel to usa fvey 15 with geo reference data or geotagging where available because this data provides citylevel location resolution cotraveler candidates are assigned scores based on the extent to which they were seen in the same cities and on the same days as targets tssirel to usa fvey the second mode accepts pattern representing target travel across spanning countries of interest eg and optionally the days on which the countries were visited in this mode the taccafétmac dni cotravel analytic in this mode identifies travelers that at minimum match the pattern all candidates that match the pattern are regarded as possible cotravelers srel to usa fvey the result of these analytics

get higher rank summary ssirel to usa fvey at the beginning of this paper we presented number of key issues and questions many of the analytics define themselves by 1 the key issues they address in novel ways and 2 the types of source data on which they operate ssirel to usa fvey the key issues section highlight s capabilities that might improve the accuracy of the analytic results for example analytics that have knowledge about the locations of gcids and vlrs and can augment their procedures with nonsigint data such as geographic and terrestrial data this information contains knowledge about the locations of highways and roads analytics that can geographically validate routes between meeting points can then use this information to constrain the possible cotravel routes and candidate cotrave l selectors along those routes ssirel to usa fvey analytics that can operate on variety of different source data formats including both dni and dnr benefit from the ability to exploit divergent data sources to develop more complete pictures of target travel behavior ssirel to usa fvey the cotravel analytics in this study are at various stages of development testing and deployment one possible way forward could be to have an independent organization2 perform formal evaluation of these analytics using common test dataset this would enable fa ir comparisonandassessmentoftheanalytics processing time efficiency and accuracy understanding the advantages and challenges of each analytic against common test dataset with ground truth may facilitate plan ning for future work 2 an independent organization is one that is not involved in the development of any of these analytics and that does not have stake in the outcome top secretcomintrel to usa
