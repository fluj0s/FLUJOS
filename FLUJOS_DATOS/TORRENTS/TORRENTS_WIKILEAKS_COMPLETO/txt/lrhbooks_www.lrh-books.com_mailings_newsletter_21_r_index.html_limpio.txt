bridge publications newsletter date handling life with scientology by l ron hubbard there are two distinct divisions in scientology the first is philosophic the second is technical under the philosophic heading one discovers the ways and means of forming new ways of life and evaluating or creating standards of livingness and beingness scientology concludes and demonstrates certain truths these truths might be considered to be the highest common denominators of existence itself they have the aspect of precision observation rather than philosophic hazardings when treated as precision observations many results occur when regarded as philosophic opinions only more philosophy results by this knowingness alone and without processing individual technical application it should be understood clearly that new way of life could be created or an old way of life could be understood and better endured or altered under the technical division we have long series of developed processes which applied immediately and directly to life or an organism thereof produce desirable changes in the conditions of life this division comprises applied scientology or scientology applied philosophy and contains standard technology i looked early and long at man to find out what methods he used to survive how he adapted himself to environments in his attempt at survival and what i found was that man advanced to the degree that he preserved his spiritual integrity that he preserved his values that he remained honest that he remained decent and i found that he disintegrated or deteriorated to the degree that he abandoned these things the average man is up against problems he is asking himself how can i make more money how can i make my wife faithful to how can i help my children grow up these questions absorb tremendous quantity of his energy but he cant do anything about it because he is so immersed in it so in scientology processing he resolves these questions he understands what hes doing and he turns from man who is simply puzzled static being into somebody who is more than that we see governments and societies desperately trying to help man they are trying however to solve his problems for him and their efforts to do this have not resulted in any great advance for man the real work is to put individuals into mental condition where he can confront his own problems and solve them to put him in position where he can confront life better where his reaction time is better where he can identify the factors in his life more easily and so he looks around starts solving his own problems and betters his own life that is an essential difference between scientology and other efforts to help man l ron hubbard scientology new slant on life is collection of thirty of l ron hubbards bestloved timeless articles some originally appeared as magazine articles while others are from his lectures and early radio programs every one is gem of wisdom and practical truth chapter titles include is it possible to be happy contained in this newsletter the true story of scientology mans search for his soul the arc triangle two rules for happy living what is the basic mystery happiness and interest the dynamics of existence how to live with children on marriage the anatomy of failure acceptance level confronting on bringing order professionalism on human character past present and future playing the game the vocabularies of science how to study science records of the mind are permanent the race against mans savage instincts the third party law justice what is knowledge man from mud the psychiatrist at work honest people have rights too you can be right what is greatness yes send copy of scientology new slant on life so i can discover refreshing new outlook and gain greater happiness and success in life just by ordering online ill also receive 10 off the retail price of the book free shipping and if im not satisfied for any reason i can return the book within 30 days and receive full refund satisfaction guaranteed if for any reason you are not 100 satisfied with scientology new slant on life return the book within 30 days for full refund 2003 bridge publications inc all rights reserved for copyright and trademark information removelink grateful acknowledgement is made to l ron hubbard library for permission to reproduce selections from the copyrighted works of l ron hubbard l ron hubbard scientology and dianetics are trademarks and service marks owned by religious technology center and are used with its permission bridge publications inc is registered trademark and service mark in california and is owned by bridge publications inc
