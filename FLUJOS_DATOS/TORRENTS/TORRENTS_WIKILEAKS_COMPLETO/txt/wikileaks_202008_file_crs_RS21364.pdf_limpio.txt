federal law stripped of footnotes nd citations to authority found in the longer version length of term when sentencing defendant to term of imprisonment federal court usually imposes an additional term of supervis ed release to be served upon defendants release from prison term of supervised release is required by statute in certain drug and domestic violence cases nd required by operation of the sentencing guidelines in most felony cases except for some drug or terrorism cases the statute sets the maximum terms of supervised released at not more than five years for class or class b felonies not more than three years for class c or class d felonies not more than one year for all other crimes the usa pa triot act and the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act amended the supervisory release statute so that the maximum term of supervised release for certain crimes frequently associated with acts of terrorism is any term of years or life several federal controlled substance statutes establish mandatory minimum terms of supervised release thus large scale drug traffickers in the most dangerous of controlled substances mor than kilogram of heroin for instance must be sentenced in term of supervised release of not less than five years not less than 10 years upon second or subsequent convic tion the mandatory minimums are reduced when smaller quantities or less dangerous contro lled substances are i nvolved 1 at least four years 8 years for recidivists for d ealers in slightly small amounts for the most dangerous substances between 100 and 1000 gram s of heroin for instance 2 at leasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21364crs2 three years 6 years for recidivists for slig htly less dangerous controlled substances for instance ghb one of the socalled date rape drugs 3 at least two years 4 years for recidivists for controlled substa nces such as 50 kilograms of marijuana and 4 at least one year 2 years for recidivists for schedule iv or v controlled

pregnant woman conditions defendant may be returned to prison if he violates any of the mandatory or discretionary cond itions imposed as part of the term of supervised release all supervised release orders contain conditions under which defendants must refrain from criminal activity any defendant in domestic violence case must attend an approved offender rehabilitation program if one is located within 50 miles of his residence any defendant convicted of sex offenses must register with state authorities defendants must cooperate with the authorized collection of dna sample defendants must submit to periodic drug tests and defendants must adhere to the paymen t schedule for any unpaid fine imposed restitution ordered or special assessment the sentencing guidelines add two manda tory conditions one for the payment of fines and the other for the payment of restitu tion that must be imposed unless there are recognized grounds for not doing so the probation statute contains long list of conditions that may be used in probation cases the supervised release statute adopts most of th by cross reference and grants sentencing court latitude to impose any othe r appropriate condition but allows the court to impose only those conditions that are reasonably related to the crime to the defendants crimerelated history deterren ce of crime protection of the public or the defendants rehabilitation and that involve greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary the sentencing guidelines divide the sp ecifically identified di scretionary conditions into three groups standard conditions th at are imposed in mo st cases special conditions that may be applied to particular kinds of cases such as those that may apply when defendant has unpaid fines or restitution obligati ons and additional conditions that go to defendants m obility and i nvolve things like community confinement curfews and occupational restrictions the sentencing guidelines standard conditions are crafted to permit the court to order defendants to remain in close conduct with probation officer they include the authority to order the defendant to report to probation officer allow his probation officer to visit him in addition to the visitation condition sentencing court may demand that the fendant consent to the warrantless searchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21364crs3 of his person or property as condition of supervised release as long as the condition is reasonably related to the defendants crime history or rehabilitation whether searches conducted pursuant to such condition pass muster under the fourth amendment may depend upon th facts of an individual case respond honestly to his probation officers questions and follow the officers instructions the condition requiring defenda nt to respond to completely and truthfully is valid notwithstanding th defendants fifth amendment privilege against selfincrimination but the defendants valid cla im of the privilege may not be considered viola tion of the condition notify his probation officer any change of address or employment remain in the district unless the c ourt or probation officer approves travel and notify his probation officer if the defendant is arrested the standard conditions also give instructi ons calculated to ensure that the defendant avoids criminal entanglements in this vein they demand that the defendant avoid criminal associations the general condition restricting defendants contact with felons may be expanded to those convicted of related misdemeanors the defendants associational rights notwithstanding u nder the appropriate circumstances the restriction may be c ouched in geographical terms banning defendant from the scene of her past criminal activities for instance where the defendant has history of excessive ga mbling the court may reasonably prohibit him from gambling or entering gambling establishments avoid illicit drug markets stash houses and crack houses avoid the use of illicit drugs or the excessive use of alcohol although the sentencing guidelines specifically permit court to prohibit the excessive consumption of alcoholic be verages as condition of s upervised release conditions demanding total abstention are apparently common the condition will be upheld where the defendant has history of alcohol abuse even if the abuse is unrelated to the crime for which he was most r ecently convicted the ban on alcoholic consumption however may not be imposed as cond ition of supervised release where there is evidence that alc ohol played role in the defendants crime or that the defendant has histor of alcohol abuse avoid becoming an informant without permission of the court under the general authority to impose any other conditions of supervised release the sentencing court considers appropriate the courts have upheld conditions that strive to separate the defendant from other circumst ances related to his past criminal conduct including gambling prohibitions and stay gainfully employed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21364crs4 the remaining standard conditions instruct the defendant to honor either specific or general legal obligati ons ordering him to support his family sentencing court may c ondition defendants supervised release on his compliance with the terms of state childsupport order but it may not impose more demanding payment sc hedule than the state order requires nor otherwise craft the condition in conf lict with the state support order pay any unpaid special assessment advise his probation officer of circumstances that might prevent his making fine restitution or special assessment payments and notify victims and those possibly at risk the conditions may insist on compliance with state notification procedures even t hose procedures are not otherwise required the special conditions are directions that sentencing court may include within supervised releas order involving ban on possession of weapons under the appropriate circumstances the condition limiting the possession of weapons ma extend not only to firearms but to crossbows bows and arrows limits on debt obligations the sentencing guidelines however do not authorize condition that defendant repay personal debts unrelated to the offense for which he was most recently convicted or to an other aspect of his criminal history probation officer access to financial information the sentencing guidelines authorize access where the court has ordere d restitution forfeiture notice to victims or the payment of fine but court ma condition supervised release upon access in other cases as well moreover when reasonably related to the offense the condition may include demand to provide information concerning the financial activities of the defendants spouse or gal entities under his control drug treatment the court may condition defe ndants supervisory release upon participation in drug tr eatment program based on subs tance abuse occurring prior to the offense conviction nevertheless it may not condition his supervised release on his participation in prog ram of drug or alcohol abus treatment in the absence of any evidence that drug or alcohol abus figured in the defendants offense or in his criminal history mental health treatment the courts have experienced some difficulty in formulating conditions other than trea tment in cases of sex offenders and defendants with history of sexually abusing children particularly when both the defendants crime or histor and the conditions involve computer use when the offense of conviction is sex offense or the defendant has history of sexual misconduct it is abuse of discretion for court to include within defendants supervisory release order requirement to comply with state sex offender registration laws to participate in sex offender treatment or to refrain from havinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21364crs5 contact with children from engaging in an occupation that involves access to children or from possessing sexu ally oriented material deportation and sex offender treatment the courts have experienced some difficulty in formulating conditions other than treatment in cases of sex offenders nd defendants with history of sexually abusing children pa rticularly when both the defendants crime or history and the conditions involve comput er use when the offense of conviction is not sex offense remote conviction for sex offense in the defendants past may be insufficient to justify condition requiring the defendant to register under sex offender registration laws participate in sex offe nder treatment refrain from having contact with children or from enga ging in an occupation that involves access to children or from possessing sexual oriented material the additional conditions speak to community confinement supervised release by finition is term served after release from prison yet the sentencing gu idelines and at least one circuit court indicate that this does not preclude supe rvised release conditions that involve confinement for rehabilitative pur poses other than in prison home detention community service occupational restrictions occupational restrictions are not favored the sentencing guidelines demand that they be narrowly drawn and they will not be upheld as condition on supervised released unless they are directly related to the offense of conviction curfew and any other condition the court considers to be appropriate as with any other discretionary condition sentencing c ourt may impose any condition that among other things is reasonably related to the crime the defendants crimerelated history deterrence of crime protec tion of the public and the defendants rehabilitation as long as the condition involves greater privation of liberty than is reasonably necessary 18 usc 3583c d thus history of drug abus and conviction for possession of machine gun does not jus tify supervisory release conditions that prohibits the use of tobacco or the consum ption without prescription of aspirin or over the counter cold remedies modification and revocation the sentencing court may 1 modify the supervised release conditions at any time 2 discharge the defendant from supervised release one year after the defendants rel ease or 3 revoke the defendants term of supervised release require him to return to prison and impose an additional term of supervised release to be served thereafter httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21364crs6 modifications may be base d on number of factors the nature of the crime and defendants history deterrence public safety rehabilitation the sentencing guidelines sentencing guideline policy statements sentencing disparity and restitution the grounds for modification permit both extens ion of term of supervised release and an adjustment in the conditions of supe rvised release includi ng condition for home detention notwithstanding the fact that home detention is sewhere characterized available only as an alternative to incarcera tion adjustment may also include adjustment of the conditions dealing with the payment schedule for restitution or for the defendants fine court may not however entertain petition to modi fy conditions of term of supervised release based on the purporte d illegality of the original conditions by statute court must revoke defenda nts supervised rel ease for unlawful drug or firearm possession refusal to co mply with drug testing cond ition or three positive drug tests within year the sentencing guidelines suggest as matter of policy that court should also revoke defendants supe rvised release for the commission of any felony the same considerati ons which instruct modificati on direct revocation 1 the nature of the crime and defe ndants history 2 deterrence 3 public safety 4 rehabilitation 5 the sentencing guidelines 6 sentencing guideline policy statements 7 sentencing disparity and 8 restitution revocation and modification hearings are governed by the provisions of rule 321 of the federal rules of criminal procedure the fact that the revocation hearing is held without the benefit of jury does not ma ke it constitutionally spect upon revocation of term of supervised release defenda nt may be imprisoned for term ranging from one to five years depending upon the serious ness of the original crime and upon release may be subject to new term of supervised re lease as matter of policy the sentencing guidelines recommend various terms of imp risonment to be imposed upon revocation of an original term of supervised release calibrated according to the serious of the original crime and the criminal record of the defendant
