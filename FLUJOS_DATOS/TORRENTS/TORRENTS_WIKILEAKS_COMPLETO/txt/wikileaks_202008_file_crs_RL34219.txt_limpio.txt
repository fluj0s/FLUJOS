analyst in economics government and finance division terrorism risk insurance legislation in 2007 issue summary and sidebyside summary prior to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks insurance covering terrorism losses was normally included in general insurance policies without additional cost to the policyholders following the attacks both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage because insurance is required for variety of economic transactions it was feared that lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have wider economic impact congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria pl 107297 116 stat 2322 tria created temporary program expiring at the end of 2005 to calm the insurance markets through government backstop for terrorism losses and to give the industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk from 2002 to 2005 terrorism insurance became widely available and largely affordable and the insurance industry greatly expanded its financial capacity there was however little apparent success on longer term private solution and fears persisted about wider economic consequences if insurance were not available congress responded to the expiration of tria with the passage of the terrorism risk insurance extension act triea pl 109144 119 stat 2660 triea extended the tria program until the end of 2007 while increasing the private sector exposure to terrorism risk the two years under the extended tria program were very similar to the three years under the first act the market for terrorism insurance improved but doubts remained as to capacity of the private sector to finance largescale terrorism risk in the united states as well as whether terrorism risk can be considered an insurable event at all in response the house passed hr 2761 in the 110th congress which would have extended the tria program 15 years and made substantial other changes the senate also passed hr 2761 after amending it with language from s 2285 which would have extended tria seven years while making more limited changes to the underlying law the house then passed hr 4299 which contained the language of the senatepassed hr 2761 plus some of the provisions from the previous version of hr 2761 the differences between the house and senate bills included the inclusion of group life insurance restrictions on life insurers use of travel in underwriting lowering the deductible and trigger after large terrorist attack and the reduction of the program trigger to 50 million the senate however did not act on hr 4299 and the house ultimately agreed to the amended version of hr 2761 that was previously passed by the senate the president signed this bill into law on december 26 2007 this report briefly outlines the issues involved with terrorism insurance and includes sidebyside of the previous tria law the two house triaextension bills and the senate bill that was ultimately signed by the president it will not be updated for more complete information on the issue please see crs

covering terrorism losses was normally included in general insurance policies without specific premium being paid for this coverage the attacks and the more than 30 billion in insured losses that resulted from them caused rethinking of the possibilities of future terrorist attacks in response to the new appreciation of the threat and the perceived inability to calculate the probability of loss and gather the loss data critical for pricing insurance both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage many argued that terrorism risk is essentially uninsurable by the private market due to the uncertainty and potentially massive losses involved because insurance is required for variety of economic transactions many feared that lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have wider economic impact particularly on largescale developments in urban areas that would be tempting targets for terrorism congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria1 which was signed by the president in november 2002 tria created the terrorism risk insurance program2 which was enacted as temporary program expiring at the end of 2005 to calm the insurance markets through government backstop for terrorism losses and give the private industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk terrorism insurance became widely available under tria and the insurance industry greatly expanded its financial capacity in the three years from 2002 to 2005 less progress however was made on creating terrorism models that are sufficiently robust for insurers to return to offering widespread terrorism coverage without government backstop and practically progress was made on private pooling mechanism to cover terrorism risk again fearing economic disruption from the absence of terrorism insurance congress passed and the president signed the 1 pl 107297 116 stat 2322 see crs report rs21444 the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 summary of provisions by baird webel 2 the original statute specifies the name as the terrorism insurance program while the department of treasury entitles it the terrorism risk insurance program trip and this name has become more generally accepted crs2 terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 triea3 in december 2005 triea extended the program for two years while increasing the private sector exposure under the program the two years experience under triea proved to be similar to the three under tria during this time terrorism risk insurance was available pricing was moderate and takeup rates slowly increased some additional progress was made on larger scale private solution and some private groups outlined proposals for such solution4 there was however little concrete movement towards adopting such proposals the industry focus seemed to be on promoting the possibility of another extension of the tria program some see this experience as proof of the argument that the private market will never be able to offer insurance to cover terrorism risk and continue to see the possibility of wider economic consequences if terrorism insurance again is unavailable others notably the us treasury department respond that tria itself is retarding the growth of this private market by offering essentially free reinsurance against terrorism risk thus it should be allowed to expire or at least be reduced from its current form legislative action in the first session of the 110th congress three different bills addressing the impending expiration of the tria program saw committee or floor action two in the house and one in the senate as was the case in the tria extension debate in 2005 the house bills were more significant revisions and expansions of the tria program whereas the senate bill had narrower focus extending the program while making more limited changes also as in 2005 the administration generally supported the senates approach terrorism risk insurance revision and extension act of 2007 trirea hr 2761 representative michael capuano along with 23 cosponsors introduced hr 2761 on june 18 2007 referred to the financial services committee the bill was the subject of hearing in that committees subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises on june 21 2007 hr 2761 as introduced would have extended and revised the current structure of the terrorism risk insurance program adding significant new elements to this 3 pl 109144 119 stat 2660 see crs report rl33177 terrorism risk insurance legislation in 2005 issue summary and sidebyside by baird webel 4 see for example the testimony of edmund

available at httpfinancialserviceshousegovmediapdf092706efkpdf visited on jan 14 2008 crs3 structure within the existing tria structure the bill would have extended the program 10 years to the end of 2017 while reducing the program trigger to 50 million and generally leaving the individual insurer deductibles and aggregate retention unchanged at 20 of direct earned premium and 275 billion respectively it also would have expanded the scope of tria by including domestic terrorism as covered event adding group life insurance as covered line and mandating that insurers make available coverage for nuclear biological chemical and radiological ncbr terrorist events under the bill as introduced group life insurance would have had separate pool with its own deductibles and recoupment amounts based on the amount of insurance at risk rather than direct earned premiums ncbr coverage would have had lower 75 deductible compared to nonncbr terrorist events 20 in addition hr 2761 as introduced included socalled reset provisions that would have lowered the program trigger and deductible thresholds for areas that have suffered past terrorist attacks or that suffer terrorist attacks in the future if the damage from the attacks exceeds 1 billion finally the bill would have expanded the mandatory availability provisions to include restrictions on life insurers ability to consider lawful international travel as factor in underwriting decisions hr 2761 was marked up by the house financial services committees subcommittee on insurance capital markets and government sponsored enterprises on july 24 2007 and by the full committee on august 1 20075 substantial amendments were adopted at both markups the subcommittee markup began with complete substitute amendment by chairman kanjorski being adopted by voice vote this substitute changed the nbcr provisions delaying the make available provisions until 2009 and lowering the deductible to 35 with 05 increase per year it also included requirement for biennial reporting on the tria program by the treasury and changed the composition of the independent commission created by the bill to make recommendations on the program several amendments to reduce the 10year extension of the program were rejected as was one to require full recoupment of federal funds expended beyond the 275 billion aggregate retention amount in current law amendments adopted by the subcommittee included one by representative gary ackerman to include the secretary of homeland security in the certification of terrorist attack under tria and one by representative richard baker to apply the lower trigger amount in the retrospective reset provisions to the entire country rather than just to the affected area the full committee markup began with an amendment by chairman barney frank making number of technical changes and three primary substantive changes first chairman franks amendment changed the reset provisions removing the retrospective reset altogether and applying the prospective reset provisions to the entire country thus if there were future terrorist attack resulting in more than 1 billion in damages the trigger would be reduced to 5 million and the insurer deductible would be reduced to 5 for those insurers suffering terrorism losses second it included temporary preemptions from state rate and form approval laws for nbcr coverage mandated under the bill third it would have established 5 the full committee markup began on july 26 but hr 2761 was the last of number of bills to be marked up crs4 terrorism buy down fund in the us treasury essentially allowing insurers to put aside reserves that would grow taxfree to cover losses from future terrorist attacks that are not reimbursed by tria the us treasury could have also borrowed from this fund to cover the federal share of future terrorist attack the committee adopted number of additional amendments including 1 an exemption for small insurers from the requirement to make ncbr coverage available 2 the return of farmowners multiple peril as triacovered line 3 specific allowance for insurers to partner in meeting the requirement to make ncbr coverage available 4 indexing various dollar amounts in the bill to an unspecified measure of inflation 5 provision for report by the secretary of the treasury in the event that the secretary decides not to recoup expended federal funds beyond 275 billion 6 extension of the program for 15 years to the end of 2022 and 7 an increase in the postreset deductible by 05 per year the amended bill was forwarded to the full house by vote of 4920 the congressional budget office cbo issued cost estimate for hr 2761 on september 6 2007 cbo found that the bill as reported would increase direct spending by 37 billion from 2008 to 2012 and 104 billion from 2008 to 2017 this spending would be offset by additional revenues of about 100 million from 2008 to 2012 and 20 billion from 2008 to 2017 since the cost estimate found that an increase in the budget deficit or decrease in surplus would result from the bill it appeared to fail to meet the requirements of the payasyougo paygo rule adopted by the house at the beginning of the 110th congress6 in response to the paygo issues the special rule hres 660 under which trirea was considered on the house floor included selfexecuting amendment that inserted language into the underlying bill requiring passage by congress of joint resolution before any funds could be expended hres 660 provided for expedited consideration of this future resolution including waiver of all points of order against it and its consideration this requirement for future congressional action introduced uncertainty to the tria program that did not exist before it was unclear exactly how the insurance market might have reacted to this uncertainty should this language have become law hr 2761 was brought up on the house floor under hres 660 on september 19 2007 the rule made in order two floor amendments and motion to recommit with instructions the managers amendment hamdt 801 by chairman barney frank changed the bill to include the nbcr deductible in the reset provisions modified the certification process for an ncbr attack indexed the dollar amounts in the bill specifically to the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpi u and made variety of technical and conforming changes it passed on the house floor 4261 the other amendment hamdt 802 was offered by representative steve pearce it would have changed the increase in the deductible under the post attack reset provisions from 05 per year to 1 per year this amendment failed by vote of 194230 the motion to recommit with instructions was offered by representative david drier and failed by vote of 196228 the house then passed 6 see crs report rl33850 the houses payasyougo paygo rule in the 110th congress brief overview by robert keith for more information on paygo crs5 the bill as amended by vote of 312110 hr 2761 was received in the senate on september 20 2007 read twice and referred to the committee on banking housing and urban affairs to summarize hr 2761 as passed by the house included provisions that would have made the following changes to the current terrorism risk insurance program extended the tria program for 15 years until the end of 2022 made spending by the program contingent on passage of future joint resolution added coverage for domestic terrorist acts in the program added the secretary of homeland security to the certification process added group life insurance to the program with separate set of retentions and deductibles returned farmowners multiple peril as covered line reduced the general trigger to 50 million required insurers to cover nuclear biological chemical and radiological ncbr terrorist attacks starting in 2009 lowered insurer deductible for ncbr attacks to 35 immediately and then raised that number by 05 per year in the future increased the federal share of ncbr losses from 85 to as high as 100 for attacks causing over 100 billion in losses temporarily preempted state laws on rate and form filing for ncbr coverages provided the possibility of relief from nbcr requirement to smaller insurers reset individual insurer deductibles to 5 and the program trigger to 5 million in the aftermath of future terrorist attack or series of attacks that causes more than 1 billion in damage deductible reset would have been only for insurers who suffer losses increased the postreset insurer deductibles by 05 per year established terrorism buydown fund that would have essentially allowed insurers to put aside reserves that would grow taxfree to cover future losses that are not reimbursed by tria the fund would also have been available to the secretary of the treasury to cover the federal share of tria losses restricted life insurers use of foreign travel as an underwriting tool and indexed the dollar amounts in the program to future inflation administration reaction to hr 2761 the office of management and budget omb released statement of administration policy on september 17 2007 indicating that if hr 2761

act of 2007 tripra s 2285 the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee marked up this legislation as an original bill on october 17 2007 while senator charles schumer discussed possible amendments in the markup session amendments were voted on in committee the unamended bill was ordered reported to the full senate on vote of 201 chairman christopher dodd introduced the bill numbered s 2285 on november 1 2007 and the committee report srept 110215 was issued the same day tripra as introduced was relatively straightforward reauthorization of the existing tria program the two primary changes to current law were to extend the program for seven years until 2014 and add coverage for domestic terrorist attacks to the program in addition s 2285 would have modified slightly the annual liability cap and required the secretary of the treasury to promulgate regulations on determining payments should losses exceed 100 billion rather than leaving this determination to future congress the bill called for reports from the government accountability office gao on the possibility of insurance coverage for ncbr events within one year and on the affordability and availability of terrorism insurance in specific markets within 180 days finally the presidents working group on financial markets was tasked to continue its analysis of the longer term availability and affordability of terrorism risk insurance and to report on this subject in 2010 and 2013 cbo issued cost estimate for s 2285 on october 29 2007 it found that the bill would increase direct spending by 31 billion from 2008 to 2012 and by 66 billion from 2008 to 2017 this spending would be offset by increased government receipts of 100 million from 2008 to 2012 and 15 billion from 2008 to 2017 this score caused similar paygo issues as those faced in the house8 in response to these paygo issues language was added to tripra before it was considered on the senate floor this new language increased the total amount of the recoupment surcharge to 133 of the previous mandatory recoupment amount it also increased the rate of repayment requiring that repayment be completed by september 30 2012 for any attack before 2011 and that repayment be completed by september 30 2017 for any attack after 2011 for any attack during 2011 35 of 7 continued jan 14 2008 8 see crs report rl31943 budget enforcement

by september 30 2017 it also removed the 3 limit on mandatory recoupment amounts cbo issued cost estimate for the amended version of s 2285 on november 15 2007 this estimate found that while the expected amount of direct spending would not be affected the offsetting government receipts would be increased in total cbo found the amended version would reduce budget deficits or increase surpluses by less than 50 million over the 5 and 10year windows thus the amended version would not face point of order under the paygo rules on november 16 2006 the senate took up the housepassed version of hr 2761 and amended it by unanimous consent with samdt 3800 which contained the language from the committeepassed s 2285 plus the new language as scored by cbo this amended version of hr 2761 was then
