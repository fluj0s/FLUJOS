policy issues one of the major challenges facing the appropriators continued to be the allocation of funds for the us department of transportation among numerous competing interestscompetition for these funds stemmed from various transportation interests and from themodal administrations themselves seeking portions of the transportation pie monieswere allocated for diverse array of purposes for example to pay for the expenses of theus coast guard to improve safety across the transportation system and to help financevarious infrastructure needs in the dot and related agencies appropriations actmonies are also provided to support the national transportation safety board and thesurface transportation board stb and several other transportationrelated agencies 1 the perennial question of

user fees in fy 1998 the stb and its predecessor the interstate commerce commission havenever been fully funded by user feeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97208crs3 infrastructure the administration continued to emphasize spending for new and improved transportation infrastructure as way to increase national productivity and hencecompetitiveness the largest single component of the dot budget was for

transportation system with the need to balance thebudget by 2002 during their deliberations both the house and senate appropriationscommittees adjusted the bill to reflect interests expressed by the members innovative financing the administration attempted to find more funding for infrastructure by changing the way infrastructure was financed to accomplish this objective the dot proposed tocontinue supporting state infrastructure banks sibs at the 150 million level and tofinance new transportation infrastructure credit program at the 100 million level forfy1998 the sib program combines federalstateprivate funding to help finance variety of transportation improvements such as toll roads and intermodal terminals the sibprogram has been adopted by 10 states already with an additional 15 expressing interestexamples of innovative financing include the new transportation infrastructure creditprogram intended to leverage federal dollars and encourage private sector investment inprojects of national significance that may be too large to attract local capital 2the administration also is trying to improve the efficiency of federal funds distribution indollar terms the administrations efforts to promote innovative financing represent asmall portion of the total dot budget according to hrept 105188 the sib program and the proposed transportation infrastructure

highway spending the bill also providedfor some reductions in fhwa staffing the senate report recommended total federal highway funding of 236 billion for fy1998 an amount 16 billion greater than the

conference committee report for fy1998 provided total of 484 billion for the fta this exceeded fy1997 funding by 4620 million an increase of more than9 almost all fta programs with the significant exception of the operating assistanceprogram received funding increases operating assistance was set at 1500 million adecrease of 2500 million from fy1997 however preventive maintenance previouslyeligible for funding from operating assistance is now an eligible use under an expandedcapital grants program in addition urbanized areas with populations under 200000 areguaranteed operating assistance at level equal to 75 of their fy1997 level several transit programs have been controversial almost since their inception especially the operating assistance program recent administrations beginning with thereagan administration have proposed reductions andor outright elimination of theseprograms transit tends to be supported on local basis with the majority of supportcoming from urban areas support for sometimes competing highway programs is seenas having much broader base especially because of the absence of transit systems inrural areas transit programs have continued largely due to strong congressional supportfrom members representing urban areas for fy1998 the clinton administration proposed slight increase in total fta funding over fy1997 levels
