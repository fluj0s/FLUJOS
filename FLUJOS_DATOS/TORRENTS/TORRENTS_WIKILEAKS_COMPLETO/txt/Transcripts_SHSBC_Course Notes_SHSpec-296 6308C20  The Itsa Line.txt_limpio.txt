6308c20 shspec296 the itsa line the itsa line is the pcs comm line to the auditor it is not always pursuant to the auditors whatsit sometimes it is pursuant to the pcs whatsit the auditing cycle is made up of concatenation of comm lines comm line can be very faint as with the attention line there may be lines preceding the attention line as the auditor gets the pc to put his attention on the auditor having an attention line already extant you convert it to an itsa line theres the situation where the pcs attention line is on something other than the auditor if the auditor is adroit he can flick it over to where he wants it for instance the pc says i cant stand wild parties blah blah it takes skill to flick the attention over to what you want the pc to talk about this is getting the itsa line in pc will always follow the leastcharged aberrative line with his ta action ta exists on the leastcharged aberrative line at any moment the mind is so regulated that it will not release charges that the pc considers too dangerous ta action ceases when you have too much charge you could bleed it off but you have gotten into too much charge and ta action equals case advance even if you get somatics off you can make it even worse by running the pc with ta action you can make the needle action cease too the longer you run case with ta action the more the case freezes up and the harder it will be to produce ta action the most likely way to get ta action on case is to get in the itsa line routine1c routine1comm is the process that does this it is soft touch way of getting in the itsa line this is the workhorse it requires deftness but it gets in the itsa line on jammed overcharged case and it will restore ta action per btb 4dec71r i r1c r1c consists of 1 finding something that moves the ta 2 running the ta out of that subject to fn cog vgis the usual method of finding what to run in general r1c is by assessment of dynamics assessment by dynamics gives series of questions covering each of the dynamics this is assessed by tone arm as given in emeter drill 23 take up the reading question by use of further questions on that same subject the best way to restore ta action to case that has become overcharged is to cleverly get in and handle the itsa line cleverness is required you could ask the pc who comes into session talking about something else did our last session have anything to do with this this puts his attention back into session gently without putting it on the auditor this is preferable to the psychoanalytic practice of letting the pc run on and on about irrelevancies getting your job done and having your pc like you all the time conflict and are sometimes diametrically opposed the crudest way to get the itsa line in is tell about it this is functional however what you want to do is to move the itsa line around enough to relieve his problem to the point where you can put the attention line on significance that will give him case advance it is about as skilled as building watch very adroit to the point of invisibility you duplicate what he has been talking about and pull his itsa line bit further and put it on something you want it to be on you can even reuse the pcs origination later when you have run out of ta or itsa for instance the pc complains of headaches you get him to examine how they are affected by what you are auditing then several sessions later you can bring the headaches up again as needed unless you can handle the attention line smoothly you cant get the itsa line established you are split between wanting the pc to think well of you and getting your job done in the end they come to the same thing but for the moment it is matter of making forward progress despite unavoidable or avoidable upsets be as clever and as adroit as you can plus little there are thousands of ways to shift the pcs attention say his attention is on something you ask what have you learned about _______ you get ta parallel what the mind is doing and you can control it find what the pcs attention is on and if you can get ta motion by having the pc locate things about what his attention is on he will recover from any obsessive or compulsive tendencies about it or toward it it is the ta motion that takes off the compulsion not the significance of what he digs up the pc way be talking about his grandmas jammaking but if he is getting ta motion he is getting gains the fastest recovery comes with combination of significance and ta motion the least charged aberrated area of the case is where you will get ta motion sometimes direct approach to highlycharged area may fail until it is unburdened by getting ta off some other area first when you work with that area the latter area the pc will know that processing works for him pcs always make gains if they are getting ta motion ta motion only occurs when the itsa line is in why do we call it the itsa line the itsa line is more than just comm line it is seeing something to describe and describing it person in jail cant go to anywhere to see if itsa he cant say itsa beach or itsa brighton etc nightmare is the inability to itsa followed by mocking up something that can be itsaed that is wrong itsa is the way the thetan orients himself itsa ceiling itsa floor itsa wall etc itsa therefore ima cf descartes with i think therefore i am hide somebody and the itsa line is cut on himself one else can say itsa disassociate somebody from his identity and he wont be able to itsa himself he wont be able to say itsa joe jones this is the basic aberration inability to orient identify declare or recognize it is not just the inability to solve if itsa is so important to ability memory identity and power then we would expect the major trick on the track to be that of cutting the itsa line one way or the other and so it is implanters give you all sorts of false data you get killed one way and they convince you that you died another way or that you didnt die at all they disrupt your itsa line this can go on to the point where people believe that they live only once the reportback mechanism is even used by doctors when they have insane people report back for shocks etc people think that what we are doing is unreal but we know the substance of their unreality we know where their itsa line is out the notion man is an animal at death there is cessation of cellular commotion makes nothing of everyone the itsa line can be out of arc and on kucdeiof the whole scale for r2h tell someone that something that is isnt and his itsa line will go out give someone chalk for candy he bites into it his itsa line is out this is the false level nothing say that nothing haunts this planet its all natural and anyone who thinks otherwise must be paranoid say something isnt that is or that something is that isnt like the darwinian theory inhibited tell someone not to examine something because it is dangerous enforced know this or be shot desired wanttoknow itsa curious curiosity itsa not just curious about then theres unknown itsa you have reality on the unreality of people on this planet the itsa is their unknowingness thetans tolerance rises to where he can confront an unknown comfortably without doing anything about it x in algebra would be an example of this amathematician has gone overboard on the subject of unknownnesses and having to solve it all some auditors likewise cant stand the pcs being in an unknown as he is working on an itsa and have to leap in and get the itsa line in themselves with the meter known an itsa line can be too known for instance some crimes are unsolvable because they are committed in too known fashion the obviousness of the postman makes him the ideal murderer in mystery he is too known sometimes things are too obvious that also includes the everyone knows that never gets examined itsa identifies either individually or if that is not possible by classification by type you get comfortable feeling from this which every now and then gets betrayed eg when you find out that you are in stage set not room this gives you an arc break from the false itsa gpms are full of such false itsas the subject of itsa has to do with straightening out ones arc with the universe it is an interesting question why there should be this passion for itsa getting the itsa line in has nothing to do with getting the pc to auditor comm line in the latter is more likely to be related to the pcs attention line to the auditor getting the itsa line in is getting the pc to identify inspect decide about and differentiate things in his bank or in the physical universe eg in objective processing the room you could probably get ta by running whats that and pointing at things this is not always workable itsa is familiarization eg with car or typewriter that is why familiarization processes like touch that _______ work person who is really itsaing is blowing off encysted charge caused by former confusion about an area that is the mass aspect the force aspect of it when you have itsad on area the area never comes up again until then the area keeps coming up in the future ten years in the past two trillion years in the past as this as that etc while the pc is looking for the itsa what drives some auditors nuts is the extra itsas he puts in and takes out this that lot of apparent itsas come off before you get the final itsa but you could almost say that all the running of case on through to the final cognition the final itsa consists of conditional itsas an auditor should never expect only permanent itsas it is adroit of the auditor to use the pcs attention line to get the itsa line in by steering it to areas that can be itsad put the pcs attention on things he can identify letting the itsa line exist is the lowest level of auditing putting the itsa line in is more active the universe is full of whatsit lines so concentrate on the itsa line the itsa line will suffer from being too known as in everyone knows the itsa line is the pcs line to the auditor
