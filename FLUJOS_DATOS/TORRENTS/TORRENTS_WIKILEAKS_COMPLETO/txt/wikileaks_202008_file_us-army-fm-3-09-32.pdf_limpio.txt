increases the opportunity for misunderstandi ng and delays execution this is unacceptable when mission success and safety of friendly forces is at stake 5 unmanned aircraft systems considerations uass consist of one or more unmanned airc raft ua control station datalinks and payloads the capability of uass to support or execute cas varies greatly between systems for example us air force usaf mq1 and mq9 re armed with airtosurface weapons have radio communications aboard the ua and are flown by rated aviators trained in cas procedures oth er systems may not be similarly equipped or flown by casqualified crews bu t may be employed for situational awareness target marking or as an observer for types 2 or 3 control by the controlling jtac see appendices and b for more information on uass the following uas cas cons iderations are intended for use with cascapable uas and casqualified uas operators only threat unmanned aircraft are likely to survive in heavily defended environment consideration must be given to enemy airtoair and surfacetoair weapons with the ability to engage ua at its operatin g location and altitude uas are not normally equipped with warning receivers or count ermeasures and depend on threat avoidance for mission survivability datali nks may be susceptible to jamming or interference b weather uas are susceptible to tur bulence icing and visi ble precipitation electrooptical eo ir sensors and laser designators range finders target markers require unobstructed to the target intervening haze clouds or blowing dust may interfere with or pr event mission accomplishment on the other hand synthetic aperture radar sar and inertially aide d munitions iams are unaffected by haze cloud cover or dust high winds alo ft may make it difficult for the ua to maintain station in highly restri cted location or may unacceptably delay transit between target areas c signature uas vary in visual radar ir and acoustic sign ature and in system ability and crew proficiency to manage the signature for example when minimum noise is desired to avoid tippi ng off target it may be possible to modulate power and trade altitude for ai rspeed in order to reduce the noise signature while approaching closer to target on the ot her hand it may be desirable to announce presence in order to stimulate desired response or intimidate the target d deconfliction while uass presently lack the ability to see and avoid other aircraft there are other means to integr ate uass eg voice radio tactical datalinks identification friend or foe iff formal an d informal airspace control measures apply to uass uas may hold ov erhead or offset from target relatively slow airspeeds can permit ua to operate in smaller segment of airspace than other aircraft dependi ng upon performance capabilities of the specific uas and communications with the crew it may take several nutes to reposition the ua or change altitude blocks jtacs must trade off the best position for the uass to employ sens ors weapons against the desired targets with the ability to best employ other asse ts consideration should also be given to the lost link profile autonomously flown by ua if the control datalink is lost upon initial checkin the jtac should query the uas operator for the currently programmed lostlink profile if unacceptable due to airspace limitations or other dec 2007 fm 30932mcrp 3166anttp 3092afttpi 326 9 reasons the jtac should direct new stlink profile and receive verification that the ua has been programmed communication and situational awareness some uas have onb oard radios and or secure voice providing the ability to communicate wi th the uas pilot as with any manned aircraft in addition some uass have secure chat and voice over internet protocol as well as addi tional air and ground situational awareness displays providing the ground scheme of maneuver to the supp orting uas can significantly increase the crews si tuational awareness and subsequent mission support f video downlink vdl and machinetomachine datalinks some uass can accept and provide machinetomachine di gital targeting information and many uass provide video downlinks to users with compatible video receivers this can significantly reduce voice traffi c and reduce information transfer errors see table 21 vdl link frequency player reference on p 77 for more information g tactics uass employ using vari ety of tactics ranging from wheel to variant of an iptarget runin ua performance characteristics and sensor and weapons capabilities along with the environmental and t actical situation influence the selection of tactics r anges altitudes and timi ng considerations h time on station in general uas have much longer on station when compared to manned aircraft an extended time on station enab the uas crew to develop high situational awarene ss with and for the supported unit suitably equipped uass are excellent candi dates to provide target marking or target designation for other aircraft i altitude blocks altitude blocks for employment of uas vary greatly due to widely varying performance characterist ics of the aircraft and sensors for example many manportable uas are employed at few hundred feet of altitude above ground level agl while the mq1 predator routinely perates anywhere between 500020000 feet above mean s ea level msl consider sensor capabilities against the desired target set as well as other aircraft requirements during the mission planning process j weapons delivery uas weapon delivery tactics vary based on the type of uas and standard tactical cons iderations for aircraft k further information for more in formation and consider ations on uass see fm 30415 nttp 35514 afttpi 3264 multiservice tactics techniques and procedures for the tactical employment of unmanned aircraf t systems 6 considerations for high altitude level delivery of precision munitions these considerations may be applied to any aircraft dropping precision munitions from high altitude in level delivery formerly known as bo mber cas deliveries may be from fighters bombers or uass b deconflict airspace based on ex tended weapon delivery distance and expected weapon

mission checklist and coordinated or confirmed wi th the asoc dasc and or higher echelons significant errors can result if different datums are us ed this will increase the likelihood of fratricide andor redu ce weapons effects b aircraft altitude and speed can yield si gnificant standoff ranges in excess of 10 nm therefore it is necessary to deconflict high altit ude long range release profiles from other systems operating below and above in the case of glide weapons the release altitudes signifi cant issues exist when using weapons that transit over or around friendly fo rces using preprogrammed flight paths and impact points once released these weapons may not be redire cted due to the standoff capability aircraft and aircrews can effectively avoid many enemy point defense weapons systems by employing iams however if stand off is not required aircrews may be able to minimi ze release ranges to mitigate airspace deconfliction issues c the footprint for iams in the event of malfunction such as loss of guidance or control fin hardover is very large and in some cases increa ses the probability of fratricide like all other weapons when able precisionguided munitions such

attack controller jtac is qualified certified rvice or coalition member who from forward position directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in cas and other offensive air operations qualified and

grant weapons release authority to attacking aircraft based n risk assessment the supported commander will weigh the benefits an d liabilities of authorizing particular type of terminal attack b there are three types of terminal attack control type 1 2 and 3 type 1 control is used when the jtac must vi sually acquire the attacking aircraft and the target for each attack type 2 control is used when th jtac requires control of individual attacks but assesses that either visual acquisit ion of the attacking aircraft or target at weapons release is not possible or when attacking aircraft are not in position to acquire the mark ta rget prior to weapons release launch type 3 control is used when the jtac re quires the ability to provide clearance for multiple attacks within single engagement subject to sp ecific attack restrictions type 3 control does not require the jtac to visu ally acquire the aircraft or the target however all targeting data must be coordinated through the supported commanders battle staff c as the battlefield situation changes the supported comman der and staff make continuous tactical risk assessments risk assessments involve the processing of available information to ascertain level of acceptable risk during mission accomplishment risks include failure to create desired effects collateral damage and the potential for fratricide based on the cu rrent risk assessment the supported commander will weigh the benefits and liabil ities of authorizing particular types of munitions and proximit of employment to personnel and other avoidance areas in most
