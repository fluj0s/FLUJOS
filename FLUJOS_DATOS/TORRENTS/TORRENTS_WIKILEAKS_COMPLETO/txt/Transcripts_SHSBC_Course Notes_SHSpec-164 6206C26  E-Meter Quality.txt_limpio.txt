6206c26 shspec164 emeter quality some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 28jun62 dirty needles how to smooth out needles the whole crux of auditing today is the sensitivity of the emeter and the ability of the operator to read one there is recent bulletin on how to clean up needle see above reference needles can get rough and active clean needle reacts when the auditor speaks and does nothing the rest of the time there is gradient running from occasional ticks and tocks on up clean needle reads right it gives instant reads not prior reads needle that is twitchy gives prior reads because the pc is as it were segmentalized mentally next there is needle that is reacting continuously enough that one of its actions coincides with your instant read and you get reads that are equivocal because the needle is so active that you cant read it the most extreme dirty needle is in such constant and continuous motion that you could never get an instant read on it because it has blank spot for the end of the sentence to go into fortunately you can smooth out this kind of needle with havingness see p 249 for more data an the effect of havingness on reads this is fortunate because you cant use the needle to find anything wrong and fix it the path of thought transmission is from the thought in one person th the recorded symbol to relay in someone elses mind to the thought again that is why you can find goal in english which was originally expressed in phoenician the thought is there prior to the symbol by which it is transmitted the dirtiest needle would be the one from the bank that registered the least thought and generated the most thought autogenerated reactive thought you are watching circuit go zip and zap the auditor has impingement on this bank the restimulations that the mind is getting are often in this case from the external environment at all this person is totally introverted and is just autogenerating restimulation circuits are making each other think of things the pc thinks of cat then circuit thinks of another cat and another circuit then thinks of tiger then another one thinks of tank cars which leads to milk he has had sufficient restimulation in the past to last for trillenia he is wholly on the backtrack and the physical universe doesnt even exist there is worse one yet the stage four needle this is the same restimulation going on all the time the stage four needle is like rotating neon light it wont react even to the auditor kicking the pc in the shine there isnt even crossrestimulation there is also reverse stage four needle that goes down stick swoop up these stage four needles represent fixed condition one thought there is another condition the stuck needle which doesnt move or react this could be stage four needle stuck in ridge as though the neon sign got stuck while rotating with high sensitivity you will get some read out of this pc any needle that doesnt clean isnt all right the reason you are running cchs havingness prepchecking rudiments and so forth is to get clean needle if youve got clean needle why bother doing it clean needle reads when you say so it may rise and fall bit as the pc breathes but thats all if you have that you can go ahead with your goals assessment there is reason not to what is the best operation to clean needle lrh has cleaned some up with fish and fumble hitting the middle of circuits etc but the best method is to put the pc into state of confidence this is done with predictability of sessions in most cases it is mistake to try to sort nut all the needle actions particularly on needle that is continually agitated how can you fix that one up it is the case that most needs 3ga which however you cant run on it person with dirty needle has had his purpose shifted too many times he has lots of conflicts cchs run very gently would help you must be minimally random and maximally predictable excessive randomness is the main mistake of psychiatry the more drastic the case the more drastic the measures they use what insane people need is utter predictability and randomity at all just motionless objects and quiet space the crazier the person is the more predictable is the handling get quiet attendants spread people out so that they can ignore each other have some motionless figures around that will be there tomorrow allow mail or phones get some boulders food rest and predictability are the keynote you have business auditing someone who is really nutty they are bundle of alteris give them chance for the confusion to blow off and they will be ok it is not true that an index to insanity is constantly moving needle as an auditor you can create dirty needle in anyone just by not getting ruds clean being unpredictable in session forgetting things leaving them out and changing frequently without completing cycles but the pc wouldnt be driven insane and some insane people would have perfectly clean needles you could sit them down find their goal and audit them on out to clear this is true because insanity is specialized condition it is the sensation of trying to reach and not being able to you can turn on this sensation in someone by saying get the idea that you must reach but you cant reach and that you must withdraw but you cant withdraw if he gets these ideas he will feel stark raving mad for fraction of second insanity is more of sensation than anything else total unpredictability produces almost the same effect running havingness tends to keyout circuits although not invariably predictability also does this so if the auditor ran smooth gentle series of cchs circuits would key out and the pcs needle would clean up if this doesnt happen either you are not being predictable or this person needs to confide in you and you need prepchecking the highscale companion to cchs or he needs rudiments and havingness if you have audited the pc for four to five sessions and his needle is getting dirtier you have been auditing on too high gradient of unpredictability if you are running cchs and prepchecking you will have to undercut it by dropping back to model session cchs and havingness with complicated actions on the cchs the dirtier the needle the simpler you need to get decide to get simpler after about three sessions your concentration should be in the direction of clean needle if the needle is getting dirtier as you audit the pc suspect the meter first assuming that you are reading it right and doing perfect model session and ruds evidently the meter isnt getting the rudiments in maybe the leads are disconnected or the battery may be down or the meter may be broken this is the test say to the pc do you have ptp you see the meter is clean ask the pc if he wanted to say anything about that if he has generally got something to add the fact is that your meter doesnt go as far south as you have to go to get rudiments in auditing with rudiments out is the only thing that will dirty up needle after session where the rudiments are actually but unobservably out the pc feels as roughed up as violin being used for canoe paddle and after session where the rudiments were thoroughly in the pc feels sleek as cat who has been fed fish if your meter never detects anything reactive on pc it isnt sensitive enough this can happen when the pc is near clear also when there is not enough reactivity left to show on the meter at this point also you have to ask the pc if there is anything else oddly enough you will still get reads adequate for goals if you run pc with rudiments only partially in the pc will wind up rough if you run session with rudiments thoroughly in the pc winds up very smooth the needle gets dirty because circuits are pulled in circuits are pulled in because the pc is way back on the track and low on havingness you get the pc out of circuits and up to pt by running extroversion processes and bringing his havingness up the worse you audit the pc the lower his havingness will be and the more you will get circuits keyed in and the dirtier the needle will get
