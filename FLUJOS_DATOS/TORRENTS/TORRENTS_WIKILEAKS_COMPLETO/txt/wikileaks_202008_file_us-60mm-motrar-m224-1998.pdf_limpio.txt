conditions and license application b safety precautions the radioactive material used in these instruments is tritium gas h3 sealed in glass vials these sources illuminate the instrumentation for night operations tampering with or removal of the sources in the field is prohibited by federal law in the event there is illumination notify the local rpo or acala rpo if skin contact is made with any area contaminated with tritium wash immediately with soap and water the beta radiation emitted by tritium is hazard only if the vial or source is broken tritium can be taken into the body by inhalation ingestion or skin absorptioninjection if the vial is broken the tritium gas will dissipate into the surrounding air if released in confined space such as storage locker container unventilated room or military vehicle tritium is absorbed by lungs from air or by skin contact with contaminated surfaces however the body naturally eliminates absorbed tritium c identification instruments containing radioactive selfluminous vials are identified by means of radioactive warning labels see page these labels should not be defaced or removed and should be replaced immediately

damaged instrument see medical personnel general loading mortar weapon with two men alternately can be very dangerous and could prove fatal even with oneman loading double loading can occur this is especially true in rapid fire exercises for this reason it is imperative that there be absolute certainty that the previous round left the mortar tube before new round is dropped in firing site must have mask clearance and overhead obstructions firing over the heads of unprotected troops is prohibited per ar 38563 when firing during training the minimum horizontal range is 300 meters in handheld mode place baseplate against solid object when 1firing at range more than 300 meters for charge zero 2firing at ranges of more than 950 meters for charge one in handheld mode do not fire with any

continued all personnel within fifty meters of the muzzle during firing must use single hearing protection adequate fragmentation cover will be taken when firing cartridges for distances less than 300 meters during training cartridges will be fired minimum distance of 300 meters firing temperature limits for m720 and m888 cartridges are 50f to 145f temperature limits for all other cartridges are 40f to 125f do not fire unpacked ammunition which has been dropped or packaged ammunition which has been dropped from height greater than one meter these cartridges will be returned to ammunition supply point asp as unserviceable selector should be at s safe except when firing misalignment of safe detent position on firing selector will cause malfunction which may accidentally arm the mortar and can cause an unintentional discharge of round injury or death may occur trigger firing with an unseated baseplate in the conventional mode is prohibited trigger fire only at charge 0 or 1 with either baseplate propelling charges are not interchangeable do not substitute one model for another do not mix lots propelling charge increments should be positioned as close to fin as possible to avoid short round short rounds may occur if an excessive amount of oil or water is in barrel during firing if using m525 or m527 point detonating pd fuzes see inspections and warnings on pages wp 0024
