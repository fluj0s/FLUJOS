uninsured children in families with income bove medicaid eligibility thresholds children may be enrolled in separate schip programs for whic h schip rules apply shown in the appendix table or in medicaid for which traditional medicaid or dra rules apply some states eg kentucky have both types of schip programs medicai d expansion and separate schip program for which children with the highest income levels are enrolled in the separate program servicerelated costsha ring under separate sc hip programs generally parallels the rules under trad itional medicaid for lowerinc ome subgroups there are limits specified for higherincome subgroups total schip costsharing is capped at 5 of family income per eligibility periodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22578crs3 servicerelated costshari ng under traditional medicaid is prohibited for the following specific groups and services 1 children under 18 2 pregnant women for pregnancyrelated services 3 services provided to certain institutionalized individuals 4 individuals receiving hospice care 5 emergency services and 6 family planning services and supplies for most other gr oups and services nominal amounts are allowed for example nominal copayments specifi ed in regulations range from 050 to 3 depending on the payment for the item or service these nominal amounts will be increased by medical inflation beginning in 2006 regulations not yet released under the dra option certain groups and serv ices are also exem pt from the service related costsharing provisions these exem ptions are nearly identical to those under traditional medicaid however under tr aditional medicaid all children under 18 are exempt while under dra only children cove red under mandatory eligibility groups the lowest income categories and certain foster careadoption assistance youth are exempt also groups exempted from the general serv icerelated costsha ring provisions under dra may nonetheless be subject to costsha ring for nonemergency services provided in hospital emergency room er and or for prescribed drugs see the appendix table under schip only american indian and alaskan native children are exempt from cost sharing and costsharing is also prohib ited for wellbaby and wellchild services among the four states with approval for lternative benefit packages via dra only kentucky includes costsharing for participants summarized in table 1 for many services across the four kentucky plans ther is costsharing fo r beneficiaries when applicable copayments for selected nonins titutional services acute inpatient hospital care and for generic and preferred brandname drugs are very similar to the maximums allowed under traditional medicaid for non preferred brandname drugs and for non emergency care in an er 5 coinsurance charge will be applicable in most cases for all four kentucky plans the maximum nnual outofpocket expens per member is 225 for health care services and 225 for prescr iptions additionally under dra the total aggregate amount of all costsharing pre miums plus servicerelated charges cannot exceed 5 of family income applied on monthl or quarterly basis as specified by the state under kentuckys dra spa this limit is applied on quarterly basis consequences for failure to pay costsharing the rules governing consequences for fa ilure to pay premiums differ somewhat under traditional medicaid and dra under traditional medicaid for certain groups of pregnant women and infants for whom mont hly premiums may be charged states cannot require prepayment but may terminate medicaid eligibility when failure to pay such premiums continues for at least 60 days in contrast under dra states may condition medicaid coverage on the paym ent of premiums but like traditional medicaid states may terminate medicaid eligibility only when nonpa yment continues for at least 60 days states can apply this dra provision to some or all applicable groups under both traditional medicaid and dra states may wa ive premiums in cases of undue hardship in kentucky benefits are rminated after two months of nonpayment of premiums for children in the separate schip program upon payment of missed premium re enrollment is allowed after 12 months of nonpayment payment of the missed premium is not required for reenrollment also working families with transitional medicaid will lose coverage after two mont hs of missed premiums unle ss good cause is establishedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22578crs4 there are more differences between traditional medicaid and dra with respect to rules for failure to pay serv icerelated costsharing u nder traditional medicaid providers cannot deny care to beneficiaries due to an individuals inability to pay costsharing charge however this requirement does not eliminate the beneficiarys liability for payment of such charges in contrast unde r dra states may allo w providers to require payment of authorized costsharing as condition of receiving services providers may be allowed to reduce or waive costshari ng on casebycase basis pl 109432 exempts individuals in families with inco below 100 fpl from the dra failure to pay rules for both premiums and servicere lated costsharing according to state regulations kentucky requires all providers to collect pplicable costsharing from medicaid beneficiaries at the time of service delivery or at later date provider can waive costsharing but only pha rmacy providers can deny serv ices for failure to pay as per state law finally under schip states must specify consequences applicable to nonpayment of premiums andor
