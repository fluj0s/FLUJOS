discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any pe rson who owns leases or leases to or operates place of public accommodation in addition this section provides that discrimination includes failure to make reasonable modifications in policies practices or procedures when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations to individuals with disabilities unless the entity can demonstrate that maki ng such modification would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods servi ces facilities privile ges advantages or accommodations the definition of public accommodation specifically includes the professional office of health care profe ssional and hospitals 42 usc 121817fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97826crs2 1 the department of justice disability rights section of the civil rights division has published business brief entitled communicating with people who are deaf or hard of hearing in hospital settings which details when an interpreter may be required regulatory interpretation the department of justice promulgated regulations to implement title iii of the ada which contain provision on auxiliary aids and services public accommodation shall take those steps that may be necessary to ensure that individual with disability is excluded denied services segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of au xiliary aids and services unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that taking t hose steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods services facilities privilege s advantages or accommodations being offered or would result in an undue burden ie significant difficulty or expense 28 cfr 36303 the term auxiliary aids is further defined to include qualified interpreters note takers com puteraided transcription rvices written materials id the department of justice regulations stated that in determining whether an action is an undue bur den various factors should be considered these include the nature and cost of the action the overall financial resources of the s ite the geographic separateness and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the site or sites in question to parent corporation the overall financial resources of the pare nt corporation and the type of operation or operations of any parent corporation or entity 28 cfr 36104 the department of justices analysis of its regulatory provisions when the regulations were proposed included as an example the situation where note pad and written materials were insufficient to permit effective communication in doctors office when the matter to be discussed was major surgery commentators objected to this statement as conveying the impression that not pads were sufficient except in the most extreme circumstances in its discussion of the final regulations the department of justice observed that such limitation was not intended other situations may also require the use of interpreters to ensure effective communication depending on the facts of the particular case it is not difficu lt to imagine wide range of communications involving areas such as health legal matters and finances that would be sufficient lengthy or complex to require an interpreter fo r effective communication 56 fed reg 35567 july 26 1991 in addition the department ticed that the use of computer may be an intermediate step between an interpreter and notepad id analysis the ada purposely adopted flexible standard regarding nondiscrimination requirements this flexibility was seen as allowing the nondiscr imination requirements to apply in the fairest manner to the myriad circumstances presented by employers public accommodations and individuals w ith disabilities however this very flexibility means that precise requirements are not always r eadily enunciated the answer then to the question of whether doctor or hospital must provide an interpreter for hearing impaired individual is dependent upon th particular circumstances although generally hospitals would appear to be required to provide for interpreting services in many situations1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97826crs3 2 see eg

federal funds from discriminating against individuals on the basis of disability 29 usc 794aexactly when sign language interprete r may be required s been discussed in several judicial decisions alt hough the majority of the claims regarding the failure of doctor to provide hearing impaired patient with an interpreter appear to have been resolved through either an informal or formal settlement process the department of justice has obtained number of settlement agreements with hospitals in recent years2 effective communication as the regulations indicate there is absolute requirement that an interpreter be provided in particular s ituation one key factual issue determining when there is such requirement is whether other means may provide effective communication in mayberry v van valtier 843 fsupp 1160 ed mich 1994 the court found that deaf medicare patie nt was entitled to trial on her claim that her doctor violated the ada the doctor had communicated with the patient for number of years by passing notes or using one of the patients children as an interpreter and on one occasion had noted in the patients f ile that her back pain was higher than she had originally thought and that this misunderstanding was probably due to poor communications the patient mrs maybe rry requested that the doctor provide an interpreter for physical examination the doctor complied but following the examination wrote letter to the interpreter with copy to the patient stating that she would not be able to use the interpreters serv ices again and that i really cant afford to take care of mrs mayberry at all the docto r characterized the letter as protest against what was perceived as an unfair law th court found that the allegations made were sufficient to reject motion for summary judgment and ordered the case to proceed to trial subsequently judg ment was rendered in favor of the doctor docket 114 may 22 1995 but there is record of written opinion physicians should also recognize that ev if deaf patient receives effective medical treatment the doctor may still violat the ada if the doctor did not effectively communicate with that patient in aikins v st helena hospital 843 fsupp 1329 nd cal 1994 the court found that adequate medical treatment does not defeat claims of failure to provide effective communica tion under the ada and rehabilitation act of 19733 elaine aikins hearing impaired individual and the ca lifornia association of the deaf cad alleged that st helena hospital and dr james lies failed to communicate effectively with mrs aikins during her now deceased husbands medical treatment the late mr aikins was transporte d to st helena hospital where dr lies was responsible for his medical care mrs aikins requested an interpreter to facilitate communication with dr lies instead of an interpreter the hosp ital provided mrs aikins with an ineffective finger speller allegedly mrs aikins was unable to effectively communicate with dr lies or other hospital staff til her daughter became available to interpret mrs aikins and the cad alleged that dr lies and st helena hospital violated both the ada and the rehabilitation act dr lies maintained that the rehabilitation act was inapplicable and st helena asserted that it complied with both the ada and rehabilitation act the court noted that adequate medical treatment is not defense to claim that defendant failed to provide effective communicati on under the rehabilitation act of 1973httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97826crs4 4 the court granted motion for reconsideration regarding finding of intentional discrimination because of deliberate indifference in bravin v mount sinai medical center 58 fsupp 2d 269 sd ny 1999 5 s rep 101116 101st cong 1st sess 1989 reprinted in 1 legislative history of pl 101336 the americans with disabilities act pr epared for the house committee on education and labor serial 102 pp 162163 december 1990citing aikins v st helena hospital the court in naiman v new york university 1997 wl 249970 sdny 1997 us dist 6 ad cases 1345 10 ndlr 39 found that physicians effectiveness in providing medical treatment to hearing impaired patient does not negate an ineffective communication claim under the ada mr alec naiman who is hearing impaired was ad mitted on several occasions to new york university medical center operated by new york university on each occasion mr naiman requested an interpreter on one occasion the center provided mr naiman with person minimally capable of communicating si gn language while on other visits mr naiman alleged that the center did not either provide an interpreter in timely manner or did not provide an interprete r at all mr naima n contended that he needs an interpreter to participate in his medical care and is uncer tain on his visits to the center whether he will be able to effectively communicate with doctors and staff new york university argued that mr naiman failed to state claim under the ada because he received adequate medical care from the medical center the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff holding that claim under ada alleging ineff ective communication relates to the patients exclusion from participation in their treatment and the treatment itself in majocha v turner 166 fsupp2d 316 wd pa 2001 the district court denied motion for summary judgment in case invol ving the lack of an interpreter for the father of fifteen month old boy with ch ronic ear infections the defendant doctors argued that they had offered to use note taking to communicate the district court observed that an individual with disability cannot insist on particular auxiliary aid if the aid offered ensures effective communicati on however the court relying on lay and expert testimony concerning the lack of eff ectiveness of note taking in this case found that there was genuine dispute regarding whether the note taking was an acceptable auxiliary aid undue burden the regulations also provide that an interpreter is not required if the doctor can demonstrate that doing so wo uld fundamentally alte r the nature of the goods services facilities pr ivileges advantages or acco mmodations being offered or would result in an undue burden this issue was discussed in bravin v mount sinai medical center 186 frd 293 sd ny 19994 where the plaintiff sued the hospital for failure to provide sign language inte rpreter for lamaze class conducted at the hospital the court there found that the hosp ital had alluded to an undue hardship but did not address the issue explicitly and therefore awarded summary judgment to the plaintiff the senate report on the ada noted that t echnological advances can be expected to further enhance options fo r making meaningful and ffective opportunities available to individuals with disabilities such advances may enable covered entities to provide auxiliary aids and services which today mig ht be considered to impose undue burdens on such entities5 recently

httpwwwdeaftalkcom 7 see eg gillespie v dimensions health corporation 369 fsupp2d 636 dmd 2005 where the plaintiffs alleged that the video conferencing device was wholly ineffective either because the staff was inadequately trained and unable to operate the vri device because plaintiffs were unable to understand the video interpreter due to the poor quality of the video transmission or both 8 see eg proctor v prince georgs hosp ctr 32 fsupp2d 820 dmd 1998 see also loeffler v staten island university hospital 2007 us dist ct lexis 22038 edny 2007where the court found that the mere fact that josephine visited the hospital few times since 1995 does not constitute real and imme diate threat of repeated injury the loeffler court also noted that the hospital had sufficiently amended its policy concerning interpreters to ensure that interpreters would be available when neededbusinesses6 this may render successful undue bur den arguments increasingly difficult however the use of video conferencing technology must result in effective communication7 deliberate indifference several ada cases have held that to establish claim for damages under the ada plaintiff must show that defendant is guilty of intentionally discriminating this finding can be inferred when defendant acts with deliberate indifference to the likelihood that violation of the ada will occur several cases have argued that defendant hospitals have shown deliberate indifference when requested sign language interpre ter has failed to appear in freydel v new york hospital 2000 us app lexis 31862 2d cir 2000 the c ourt of appeals found that the hospital had policy on interpreter services and had attempted to secure an interpreter for 78 year old deaf woman who communicated in russian sign language the second circuit held that proving that sta ff members failed to respond to repeated requests for russian sign language interpreter cannot by itself suffice to maintain claim of deliberate indifference similarly in constance v state university of new york he alth science center 166 fsupp2d 663 nd ny 2001 denied the plaintiffs motion for damages finding that the hospital responded quickly to request for an interpreter although the failure to follow up on the request may have been negligent the court found it did not amount to deliberate indifference in alvarez v new york city health hospitals corporation 2002 usdistlexis 12986 sdny 2002 the district court reached similar conclusion finding that the plain tiff did not make the required showing of deliberate indifference since the hospital s policy of providing interpreters and provided an interpreter with in day of the request standing one of the threshold issues plai ntiff must overcome before the merits of case can be examined is whether the plaintiff has standing to bring the action several decisions have found that plain tiff who alleges disc rimination under the ada due to lack of sign language interpreter does not have standing because there is not real and immediate threat of harm8 however in the recent case of gillespie v dimensions health corporation 369 fsupp2d 636 dmd 2005 the district court found standing for plaintiffs who alleged that the existing and ongoing policy and practice itself violates their rights under the ada in ddition the plaintiffs argued that they have sought and would likely continue to seek medical care from the hospital and thus established threat of future ada violations that give s standing to pursue injunctive relief
