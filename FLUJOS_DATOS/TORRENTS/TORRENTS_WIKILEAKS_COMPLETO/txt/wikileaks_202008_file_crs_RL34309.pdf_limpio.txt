and ncvs data it concludes by reviewing issues related to the nibrs and the ncvs the ucr represents the first effort to create national standardized measure of the incidence of crime it was conceived as way to measure the effectiveness of local law enforcement and to provide law enforcement with data that could be us ed to help fight crime ucr data are now used extensively by researchers government officials and the media for research policy and planning purposes the ucr also provides some of the most commonly cited crime statistics in the united states the ucr reports offense and arrest data for 8 different part i offenses and arrest data for 21 different part ii offenses the nibrs was developed by the federal bureau of investigation to respond to the law enforcement communitys belief that the ucr need ed to be updated to provide more indepth data to meet the needs of law enforcement into the 21 st century the nibrs collects data including data on offenses offenders victims arrestees and any property involved in an offense for 46 different group offenses and 11 different group b offenses despite the more detailed crime data that the nibrs can provide nationwide implementation of the program has been slow for variety of reasons including cost considerations the ncvs is the primary source of information on the characteristics of criminal victimization and on the number and types of crime not reported to law enforcement the ncvs has four major objectives 1 to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime 2 to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to police 3 to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes and 4 to permit comparisons over time and population type eg urban suburban and rural the ncvs asks respondents whether they have been the victim of rape and sexual assault robbery simple and aggravated assault purse snatchingpickpocketing burglary theft or motor vehicle theft in addition to collecting data on the number of victimizations the ncvs gathers data on the details of each incident of victimization this report will be updated as warranted

from the uniform crime reports ucr the national incidentbased reporting system nibrs1 and the national crime victimization survey ncvs to inform policy decisions and develop appropriate responses to crime such crime data have been used to shape policy in variety of ways for example in the 103rd congress the community oriented policing services cops program was created to provide state and local law enforcement agencies with grants to help them hire rehire and redeploy law enforcement officers to engage in community policing congress cited both ucr and ncvs crime statistics when articulating the need for more community policing officers 2 in addition to shaping policy congress has used crime data to develop formula allocations for certain grant programs for example the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant jag program formula uses ucr data to allocate federal funds to state and local governments for criminal justice programs 3 in the 110th congress two bills have been introduced s 368 and hr 1700 that would increase authorized funding for and expand the scope of the cops program4 the impetus for the legislation was recent increase in the violent crime rate as reported by the ucr5 moreover both the house and senate appropriations committees recommended increased funding for state and local law enforcement to support efforts to fight and prevent crime the house report that accompanied the house commerce justice and science appropriations bill stated that the committee was concerned about the recent increase in the violent crime rate6 in addition the house and the senate appropriations committees increased funding for the federal bureau of investigation fbi to hire additional agents to investigate violent crime7 the committees felt it was important for the fbi to help state and loca l law enforcement investigate violent crime in 1 currently there are not enough law enforcement agenci in the country submitting nibrs data for the federal bureau of investigation fbi to report annual crime statistics using nibrs data the fbi still publishes annual crime data using the ucr summary format see below as such the fbi converts data submitted from nibrscompliant law enforcement agencies into ucr summary data 2 us congress conference committees violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 conference report to accompany hr 3355

aforementioned legislation and congressional action were based on crime data collected by the ucr and the ncvs because of the importance of crime data in both shaping policy and allocating federal

standardized measure of the incidence of crime it was originally conceived as way to measure the effectiveness of local law enforcement to provide w enforcement with data that could be used to help fight crime ucr data are now used extensively by academics and government officials for research policy and planning purposes and the data are widely cited in the media the ucr also provides some of the most commonly cited crime statistics in the united states an effort is currently underway to replace the ucr with the nibrs more detailed version of the ucr however the transition from the ucr to the nibrs has been slow g23g5g20g514g156g561g10g146g156g157g152g155g162g561 in 1927 the international association of chiefs of police iacp formed the committee on uniform crime records the committee to develop system for collecting uniform crime statistics9 the iacp felt that national system of crime reporting would put inevitable and unpredictable swings in the number of reported crimes in single jurisdiction into proper context10 the iacp felt that putting changes in local crime incidence in the proper context would help reduce media pressure on local jurisdictions and police chiefs from sensational or sporadic increases in crime which had resulted in some police departments cooking the books to reduce the amount of recorded crime though there was reduction in the amount of crime reported to the police11 the committee decided that offenses known to police would be the most appropriate measure of the incidence of crime in the united states12 the committeeafter evaluating various crimes on the basis of their seriousness frequency of occurrence pervasiveness in all areas of the country and likelihood of being reported to the police identified seven crimes for which local law enforcement would report data to the national program felonious murder rape robbery aggravated assault burglary larcenytheft and auto 8 ibid 9 us department of justice federal bureau of

prevalent generally serious in their nature widely identified by victims and witnesses as criminal incidents and most likely to be reported to police14 differences in the way that state criminal codes defined different crimes prevented the iacp from simply aggregating state statistics to count the number of offenses known to police15 thus the iacp developed standardized offense definitions for the seven offense categories in 1929 iacp published uniform crime reporting manual for police records and statistics which included uniform definitions for law enforcement agencies to use when submitting data to iacp16 in that same year 400 cities in 43 states and the territories of puerto rico hawaii and alaska submitted statistics to iacp which published the data in uniform crime reports for the united states and its possessions 17 in 1930 congress at the urging of iacp authorized the attorney general to collect crime data18 the attorney general designated the fbi as the clearinghouse for crime data collected through the ucr19 the scope of the ucr program has continued to expand since it was created some of the changes to the ucr program include the following starting in 1952 law enforcement agencies began to submit data on the age sex and race of people arrested for crimes20 beginning in 1958 the fbi began to estimate annual crime rates for the nation as whole21 prior to 1958 the fbi did not aggregate the data to the national level because there were not enough law enforcement agencies submitting data to the fbi to allow it to report national crime rates instead the fbi published data in tables only according to the size of the reporting jurisdiction in 1958 the fbi created national crime index to serve as general indicator of criminality in the united states22 the national crime index was the total number of reported murder rape robbery aggravated assault burglary larcenytheft over 50 and auto theft offenses23 in 1960 the ucr started to collect national statistics on law enforcement officers killed24 in 1972 the ucr started to collect specific information on incidents in which law enforcement officers were killed or assaulted25 13 ibid 14 clayton j

to collect data where available on the age sex and race of murder victims the weapon used and the circumstances surrounding the offense in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s there was continued growth of state ucr programs which served as an intermediary between local law enforcement and the fbi see below26 in 1978 congress mandated the collection of arson data27 in 1982 congress required the fbi to permanently count arson as part i offense definition of part i offense is below28 the fbi started to publish modified crime index which included the total number of reported index crimes plus the total number of reported arsons in 1990 following the passage of the hate crime statistics act pl 10127529 the fbi started to collect data on bias motivation in criminal incidents in which the offense resulted in whole or in part because of the offenders prejudice against race religion sexual orientation or ethnicitynationality 30 in 1994 congress amended the act to require the fbi to collect data on incidents in which the offense resulted from the offenders bias against physical or mental disability31 in 2004 the fbi discontinued publishing both the crime index and the modified crime index since 2004 the fbi has published only violent crime total and property crime total32 g10g152g160g561g23g5g20g561g6g138g157g138g561g3g155g142g561g5g152g149g149g142g140g157g142g141g561

suspend using the crime index and the modified crime index after studying their appropriateness and usefulness for several years the fbi determined that both indexes were not true indicators of the degree of criminality because they were driven upward by the offense with the highest number typically larcenytheft the fbi reported that the sheer volume of those offenses overshadowed more serious but less frequently committed offenses creating bias against jurisdiction with high number of larcenythefts but low number of other serious crimes such as murder and forcible rape us department of

definitions and information required the agency responsible for collecting ucr data must have proven effective statewide program and it must have instituted acceptable quality control procedures the state crime reporting must cover percentage of the states population at least equal to that covered by the national ucr program the state ucr program must have adequate field staff assigned to conduct audits and assist contributing agencies in recordkeeping practices and crimereporting procedures the state ucr program must regularly prov ide the fbi with all of the detailed data collected from individual law enforcement agencies that report to the state ucr program in the form of duplicate returns computer printouts andor appropriate electronic media the state ucr program must have the prov capability tested over period of time to supply all the statistical data required in time to meet the publication deadlines of the national ucr program37 the fbi helps state ucr programs meet these re quirements by 1 reviewing and editing data submitted by individual agencies 2 contacting individual agencies within state when necessary in connection with crime reporting matters 3 coordinating with the state ucr program to conduct training on law enforcement recordkeeping and crimereporting procedures 4 sending reporting forms to state ucr programs so they can be distributed to law enforcement agencies within the state and 5 coordinating individual law enforcement agency contacts with the state ucr program 38 the fbi also makes quality assurance reviews qars available to state ucr programs

enforcement agencies participating in the ucr system must classify and score reported crimes classifying criminal offenses refers to the process of translating offense titles used in local and state criminal codes into the standard ucr definitions for part i and part ii offenses48 scoring criminal offenses refers to counting the number of offenses after they have been classified49 the fbi reminds state and local law enforcement agencies that they must classify and score criminal offenses based on records for calls for service complaints andor investigations50 according to the fbi ucr data must reflect offense counts not the decision of prosecutor or the findings of court coroner or jury51 uniformity in the classification and scoring of criminal offenses across jurisdictions is essential for maintaining the integrity of ucr data52 in general reporting law enforcement agencies classify and score attempted crimes as though they were completed53 for example an attempt to steal motor vehicle would be classified and scored as motor vehicle theft the only exception to this rule applies to attempted murder which is classified and scored as aggravated assault54 the fbi has instituted three rulesthe hierarchy hotel and separation of time and place rules that local law enforcement agencies must apply when they are classifying and scoring criminal offenses the hierarchy rule states that when multiple part i offenses occur in single criminal incident only the most serious offense is scored and reported to the fbi55 the hierarchy of part i offenses is provided in appendix c for example if an offender raped and then murdered victim the reporting law enforcement agency would score only the murder however there are exceptions to the hierarchy rule the hierarchy rule does not apply to cases of arson which are always scored and reported to the fbi even if other part i offenses are committed during the incident 56 another exception involves motor vehicle theft if motor vehicle is stolen and by 48 cj mosher et the mismeasure of crime p 63 49 ibid 50 ucr handbook p 7 51 ibid 52 cj mosher et the mismeasure of crime p 63 53 ucr handbook pp 15 41 54 ibid 55 the fbi states that the

motor vehicle theft is scored and reported to the fbi even though larcenytheft ranks higher on the hierarchy of part i offenses57 the final exception to the hierarchy rule involves justifiable homicide in cases of justifiable homicide two offenses are scored and reported one for the felonious offense connected with the offender and one for the justifiable homicide which is reported as an unfounded58 murdernonnegilgent manslaughter59 the hotel rule applies only to burglary offenses in cases where multiple dwelling units under single manager are burglarized and the offenses are more likely to be reported to the police by the manager rather than the individual occupants the burglaries are scored as one offense60 the hotel rule usually applies to burglaries of hotels motels lodging houses or other places where the lodging of transients is the main purpose the hotel rule would not apply in instances where multiple units that were leased or rented to tennants were burglarized such as apartments or offices in business building61 for example if five hotel rooms were burglarized it would be scored as one burglary but if five apartments were burglarized it would be scored as five burglaries the separation of time and place rule applies in instances where the same offender commits multiple offenses over short period of time in different locations62 in such cases the reporting agency treats the offenses as separate events and classifies and scores them accordingly ie applies the hierarchy andor hotel rule 63 according to the fbi the same time and place means that the time interval between the offenses and the distance between the locations where they occurred are insignificant64 normally the offenses must have occurred during an unbroken period of time and at the same or adjoining locations65 however the time and place rule does not apply in instances where offenses even if they are committed at different times and places are part of continuing criminal activity committed by the same offenders and an investigation deems the activity to constitute single criminal transaction 66 when scoring offenses the ucr program distinguishes between crimes against persons ie homicidenonnegligent manslaughter rape and aggravated assault and crimes against property ie robbery burglary larcenytheft motor vehicle theft and arson67 for crimes against persons one offense is counted for each victim in the criminal incident68 for example if gunman shot and killed three people the reporting agency would report three homicides for crimes against property one offense is counted for each distinct operation or attempt in criminal incident with the exception of motor vehicle theft in which case one offense is counted for each 57 ibid 58 unfounded crimes are crimes that

in criminal incident69 for example if someone walked into store pulled gun and robbed five customers it would be scored as one robbery in instances where multiple part i offenses are committed against multiple victims in the same criminal incident the hierarchy rule is applied first and then crimes are scored based on whether they were crimes against persons or crimes against property for example if an assailant robbed one person and murdered someone who tried to break up the robbery only the murder would be scored even though two crimes were committed against two different people in the same criminal incident in addition to classifying and scoring offense data law enforcement agencies must classify and score arrest data in many ways arrests are classified and scored similar to the way offenses are classified and scored arrest data submitted to the fbi reflect the number of people arrested not the number of charges lodged 70 for example if one person is arrested for multiple crimes the reporting law enforcement agency reports one arrest however if one person is arrested multiple times and there is separation of time and space between the arrests each arrest is recorded separately if person is arrested for multiple charges the reporting agency must use only one crime classification when reporting the arrest71 thus if person is arrested for both part i and part ii offenses the reporting agency ignores the part ii offenses and scores only the most serious part i crime see appendix c for which the person was arrested if person is arrested for part ii offenses the reporting agency must determine which is the most serious offense and score an arrest only for that offense72 if multiple people are arrested for the same crime each person is counted as separate arrest73 if reporting agency determines that someone in custody has committed other crimes the agency does not report additional arrests it reports only the original arrest74

recommended that some law enforcement agencies submit incidentbased data for all of their known offenses and all arrests ie full participation while other law enforcement agencies submit only more limited range of incidentbased data for certain crimes ie limited participation79 the study also recommended that the national ucr program implement quality assurance program80 based on the recommendation outlined in the blueprint the fbi developed guidelines and design specifications for what would later become the national incidentbased reporting system nibrs81 the fbi chose the south carolina law enforcement division sled to conduct pilot study of the newly developed nibrs guidelines and design specifications82 sled adapted its existing incidentbased ucr system to meet nibrs specifications and it enlisted the assistance of nine local law enforcement agencies in the state to participate in the pilot study83 the pilot study ran from march 1 to september 30 1987 and it resulted in further refinement of nibrss guidelines and specifications84 the fbi presented the nibrs to law enforcement at national ucr conference in march 198885 the conference gave the fbi the opportunity to receive feedback on the nibrs from the law enforcement community86 according to the fbi conference attendees overwhelmingly supported implementation of the nibrs nationwide87 attendees passed three overall recommendations 1 that there be established new incidentbased national crime reporting system 2 that the fbi manage the program and 3 that an advisory policy board composed of law enforcement executives be formed to help direct and implement the new program 88 the law enforcement community rejected the blueprint s proposal to have both full and limited participating law enforcement agencies and endorsed implementin g the full version of the nibrs nationwide89 78 ibid 79 the blueprint initially proposed that only small sample of law enforcement agencies nationwide 37 would report comprehensive incidentbased statistics the remaining law enforcement agencies would report incidentbased data but in much more abbreviated format focusing only on part i ucr offenses with

local law enforcement agencies tally the number of known offenses for each part i offense as well as arrest data for both part i and part ii offenses and submit aggregate counts on monthly basis to the fbi under the nibrs data are not aggregated rather data for each criminal incident90 are submitted to the fbi in separate report91 for each criminal incident participating law enforcement agencies collect data on 53 different data elements including data on the offenses the offenders the victims the arrestees and any property involved in the offense92 the data elements are combined into six different data segments see appendices d and the nibrs allows for data on multiple offenses offenders and victims to be collected for each criminal incident93 nibrs data are intended to be byproduct of local incidentbased reporting ibr systems94 therefore local and state law enforcement agencies can develop their own ibr systems to suit their local needs and they can use the data from their own ibr systems to participate in the nibrs as long as the data submitted to the fbi meets nibrs specifications state and local law enforcement agencies can add additional data elements or data values to their systems95 the nibrs does not use the ucrs part i and part ii offense classifications instead offenses are classified as being either group or group b offense see appendix f group contains 46 different offenses grouped into 22 offense categories group b contains 11 different offenses law enforcement agencies are required to submit incident reports which contain data from all six data segments for all group offenses96 for group b offenses law enforcement agencies are required to submit only arrest reports which contain data only from the arrestee data segment97 the expanded list of crimes required the fbi to create definitions for crimes counted only in the nibrs and to modify definitions for crimes that are part of the ucr98 for example the fbi expanded the definition of rape to include rapes of both women and men under the ucr rapes are defined as being committed against women only 90 an incident is defined for nibrs reporting purposes as one or more offenses committed by the same offender or group of offenders acting in concert at the same time and place acting in concert requires that the offenders actually commit or assist in the commission of the crimes the offenders must be aware of and consent to the commission of the crimes or even if nonconsenting their actions assist in the commission of the offenses as it is under the ucr system for the purposes of nibrs reporting same time and pl ace means that the time interval between the offenses and the distance between locations where they occurred are insignificant normally the offenses must have occurred during an unbroken period of time and at the same or adjoining locations however the time and place rule does not apply in instances where offenses even if they are committed at different time and

the incident reports submitted by the state contain errors for three consecutive months statistical reasonablenessbefore state can submit nibrs data the fbi evaluates the reasonableness of the data based on analyses of trends volumes and monthly fluctuations updating capability and responsivenessthe fbi requires the state program to have ample ability to update its records meet deadlines and

data101 if states program is certified by the fbi it means that th state program is capable of processing nibrs data at the state level and submitting virtually errorfree data to the fbi in an acceptable format102 if state program is certified as nibrscompliant local law enforcement agencies within the state must submit their nibrs data through the state program103 if state does not have certified state program the fbi will consider allowing local law enforcement agencies with nibrscompliant ibr systems to submit data directly to the fbi if the agency serves population of over 100000104 the fbi coordinates decisions regarding such requests with the appropriate state ucr program if local law enforcement agency in state without state ucr program wants to submit nibrs data directly to the fbi it will consider such request if the agency has nibrscompliant ibr system105 the fbi reported that the number of local law enforcement agencies in states without ucr programs

enforcement agencies participating in the nibrs have to classify and score offenses however the nibrs does not use the hierarchy rule discussed previously because law enforcement agencies can report all of the offenses that occurred in criminal incident 108 the fbi expanded the definition of the hotel rule under nibrs to apply to rental storage facilities ie ministorage and selfstorage buildings109 for example 10 storage units burglarized in one selfstorage building would be counted as one burglary offense however nibrs data reporting allows law enforcement agencies to report how many premises were entered see appendix d data element 10 under the offense segment using the same example the breakins at the storage facility would be reported as one burglary even though the law enforcement agency would include data in the incident report indicating that 10 premises were entered the separation of time and place rule still applies when classifying and scoring offenses under the nibrs 110 law enforcement agencies have to use the separation of time and place rule to determine whether group of offenses should be reported as individual incidents or whether the offenses should be reported as one incident where multiple offenses occurred like the ucr program the nibrs also distinguishes between crimes against persons and crimes against property crimes against persons and crimes against property are scored the same way for nibrs reporting as they are for ucr reporting however because nibrs group offenses include offenses that cannot be classified as crimes against persons because they do not involve an actual victim or classified as crimes against property because property is not the object of the crime the nibrs includes another scoring categorycrimes against society 111 for nibrs reporting crimes against society include drugnarcotics offenses gambling offenses pornographyobscene materials and prostitution offenses see appendix f reporting law enforcement agencies score one offense for each crime against society in an incident112 g3g141g159g138g151g157g138g144g142g156g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g16g11g4g20g21g561 because of the expanded amount of

above both the ucr and the nibrs collect data on the number of offenses known to law enforcement each year however not all crimes that occur are known to the police in some cases the victims of or witnesses to crime might not report the incident to the police117 researchers have reported that majority of crimes become known to the police only after they are reported by either the victims or citizens who witnessed the crime118 if crimes are not reported to law enforcement both the ucr and nibrs will undercount the actual amount of crime that occurred

the reporting practices of local law enforcement in some instances law enforcement officials usually because of political pressure to lower the crime rates might manipulate crime reports to decrease the amount of reported crime119 in other instances the number of reported offenses might be product of how assiduously local law enforcement follow the fbis definitions for crimes under the ucr or the nibrs120 for example if local law enforcement agency does not closely follow ucr or nibrs definitions the agency might classify an assault against woman as an attempted rape or trespass as burglary ironically the number of reported offenses might increase as local law enforcement agencies become more efficient 121 if law enforcement agency puts more officers on patrol the number of known offenses might increase because there are more officers to catch offenders if law enforcement agencies work to develop better relationship with the citizens they serve the reported number of offenses could increase because citizens might report more crimes the number of reported offenses might also increase as law enforcement agencies develop better recordkeeping systems and as they assign more employees to do dispatching record keeping and criminal incident reporting 122 115 cj mosher et the mismeasure of crime p 86 116 ibid 117 2005 ncvs data showed that 574 of all crimes 513 of personal

not require local law enforcement agencies to submit offense data to the ucr program although participation in the ucr program has been above 90 since the 1970s not all law enforcement agencies in the country submit ucr data to the fbi123 also law enforcement agencies are not required to submit full year of ucr data to the fbi124 in some instances local law enforcement agency will submit only few months worth of data or will fall shy of the full 12 months by 1 or 2 months125 in other instances local law enforcement agency will submit offense data but will not submit any of the other data eg the supplementary homicide report data or the hate crime data see discussion above126 one researcher found that missing data are not equally distributed among all law enforcement agencies in the country the researcher reported that for the years 19602003 law enforcement agencies serving populations under 2500 people and university and college law enforcement agencies are more likely to have missing data than law enforcement agencies that serve populations over 2500 people 127 in general the larger the population the law enforcement agency served the less likely the agency was to have missing data the analysis showed that law enforcement agencies that served 250000 or more people did not have missing data for the years 19602003128

techniques to estimate the law enforcement agencys number of reported crimes for the entire year129 the methodology differs depending on the number of months for which crime data were reported if the law enforcement agency has submitted three or more months of data the fbi estimates the total annual number of crimes for the jurisdiction by multiplying the reported number of crimes by weight equal to 12n where n equals the number of months of data submitted by the law enforcement agency 130 for law enforcement agencies that have submitted less than three months of data nonreporting agencies the missing data are estimated based on the reported number of crimes from other similar agencies based on population for core cities in metropolitan statistical area msa131 the crime rate is estimated by

calculated as 80000x100100000 the crime rates for the remaining agencies are estimated using the state rate for the agencys population group from the current year134 in absence of state rate the fbi will apply the division135 or region136 rate agencylevel estimates are always aggregated into larger geographic areas such as msas state geographic division region and the nation137 researchers have stated that the imputation methods used by the fbi to estimate crime in jurisdictions that have not reported for the full year or nonreporting jurisdictions make questionable assumptions the imputation method used by the fbi to estimate full years worth of data for jurisdictions that report three or more months of data implicitly assumes that the crime rate for nonreported months is the same as for reported months 138 if the crime rates in the months for which data were not reported differ from the rates in the months for which data were reported then the imputation procedure could either overestimate or underestimate the jurisdictions annual crime rate the imputation procedure used to estimate the crime rate for non reporting jurisdictions assumes that cities and towns with similar sized populations are also similar in other factors that might affect the city or towns crime rate such as income distribution unemployment rates population density and racial composition139

data142 in 1965 president lyndon johnson convened the presidents commission on law enforcement and the administration of justice hereafter referred to as the commission143 the commission was charged with examining the causes and characteristics of crime in the united states and formulating recommendations for polices and programs that could address crime in the country144 at the time the ucr was the only source for official crime data and the commission found that several limitations145 associated with the data prevented it from helping the commission develop policy recommendations146 to help rectify some of the limitations associated with ucr data the commission recommended the creation of national survey of crime victimization147 the first crime victimization survey pilot study was conducted in three washington dc police precincts in the spring of 1966148 the survey asked 511 washington dc residents chosen from probability sample of homes whether they had been victim of one or more of list of crimes149 the washington dc pilot study demonstrated that household surveys could provide different picture of crime than the one derived from ucr data the study showed that depending on the type of crime there were 3 to 10 times as many criminal incidents reported by victims than there were recorded in ucr data 150 supplementary study was conducted in three cities boston chicago and washington dc the second study surveyed businesses and organizations in selected highcrime areas of all three cities 141 national archive of criminal justice data national crime victimization

supplementary study also surveyed residents of chicago and boston about their households criminal victimizations152 like the washington dc pilot study the supplementary study found that the number of reported victimizations exceeded the number of reported crimes153 third victimization survey sponsored by the commission was conducted by the national opinion research center norc154 norcs victimization survey differed from the two previous surveys in that it involved national sample not just sample of local households and businesses norcs victimization survey interviewed one person in each of 10000 households nationwide155 like the two previous pilot studies norcs survey found that more crime was being committed than was being reported to law enforcement156 unlike the other two studies norcs survey collected data on which crimes were not reported to the police and on the respondents reason for not reporting the crime nonreporting was found to vary by offense for example the study found that 90 of consumer frauds were not reported but 11 of motor vehicle thefts were unreported 157 norc found that most people who chose not to report crime to the police did so because they either thought the incident was private matter or did not think the police could do anything about it158 the three pilot studies indicated that ucr data underestimated the true level of crime in the united states moreover the studies showed that household survey could help estimate the extent of unreported crime also known as the dark figure of crime 159 they also demonstrated that household survey was reasonable method for estimating the number of criminal victimizations in the united states160 the commission recommended that national criminal justice statistics center be established to collect victimization data on an ongoing basis161 in 1968 the law enforcement assistance administration leaa162 was created and charged with implementing national victimization survey163 in the early 1970s leaa in cooperation with the us census bureau worked to develop national victimization survey which would come to be known as the national crime survey ncs the pilot studies for the ncs demonstrat ed that large national sample of households would be required to obtain an accurate estimate of some crimes164 the census bureau was 151 ibid pp 5455 152 ibid p 55 153 ibid 154 ibid 155

had the capacity to field such large survey165 during the development of the ncs the surveys methodology was refined based on some of the lessons learned from the three pilot studies166 there were series of pretests trial surveys and recordcheck experiments167 to help address some of the methodological issues associated with implementing nationwide victimization survey168 some of the issues examined included the use of single household respondent as opposed to interviewing everyone in the household the respondents ability to recall events the length of the reference period the minimum age of the respondent and the appropriate question cues and wording169 as result of the studies the ncs chose to interview all members of the household about victimizations they experienced170 it was decided that the ncs would use sixmonth reference period171 it was also decided that only one person referred to as household respondent would answer questions about crimes against household property172 the first ncs was conducted in july 1972 by the census bureau173 the ncs was originally composed of four interrelated surveys national sample of households referred to as the crime panel sample of households from central cities174 and national and central city sample of commercial establishments175 as of 1976 data were longer collected for the sample of households from central cities nor were data collected for the national and central city sample of commercial establishments since 1976 the ncs consisted only of the national sample of households ie the crime panel 165 ibid 166 ibid 167 recordcheck experiments involve comparing police records to reported victimizations to determine whether crimes are being reported and if so how frequently they are being reported 168 ibid

usefulness of ncs data the leaa asked the national academy of sciences nas to evaluate the ncs176 in 1976 the nas published report that provided recommendations for how to improve the ncs177 the nas found that although the ncs was an effective instrument for measuring crime certain aspects of the surveys methodology and scope could be improved178 the nas recommended that researchers investigate the following enhanced screening questions that would better stimulate respondents recall of victimizations thus reducing underreportin g resulting from forgotten incidents screening questions that would sharpen the concepts of criminal victimization and diminish the effects of subjective interpretations of the survey questions additional questions on the nature and consequences of victimizations that would yield useful data for analysis enhanced questions and inquiries about domestic violence rape and sexual attack to get better estimates of these victimizations179 the bureau of justice statistics bjs sponsored research consortium that investigated the issues raised in the nas review and provided recommendations that would improve the accuracy and utility of the ncs180 in 1986 the consortium proposed new instrumentation and procedures to improve the ncs181 bjs chose to implement the consortiums proposals and redesign the ncs bjs stated that the overall objectives for redesigning the ncs were to increase reporting of crime victimization and provide additional details on individual crime incidents 182 bjs also had more specific objectives for the redesign including developing improved screening questions thereby stimulating recall of incidents sharpening concepts of victimization for survey respondents by providing more thorough description of criminal incidents thus diminishing effects of cognitive and subcultural differences among respondents improving data collection techniques by adopting computerassisted telephone interviewing cati for some segments of survey participants improving measures of rape and sexual attack by asking respondents directly about these crimes and 176 d cantor and jp lynch selfreport surveys as measures of crime and criminal

changes were phased in as part of two stage process nearterm and long term184 the nearterm changes focused on the ncss procedures and questionnaires but they were not substantial enough to affect the comparability of the crime rates for previous years ie they were nonrate affecting changes185 the nearterm changes were implemented by the census bureau in july 1986186 longterm changes had substantial impact on the crime rate reported by the ncs187 the longterm changes to the ncss design were phased in gradually starting in 1989 bjs and the census bureau pretested the longterm changes using 5 and 10 subsamples of the ncs sample188 after extensive pretesting the longterm changes were fully implemented by bjs in 1992189 between 1986 and 1992 the following changes were made to the survey better short cue screening questions were added to stimulate respondent recall of victimization incidents more thorough descriptions of crime incidents were added in an effort to help all respondents interpret ncs concepts correctly cati was introduced to improve data collection specific questions about rape and sexual assaults were added to improve measurement of these crimes screening questions were reworded and added to get better measure of domestic violence190 after the implementation of the redesigned ncs bjs changed the name of the ncs to the national crime victimization survey ncvs from january 1992 through june 1993 the full ncsncvs sample was divided into two parts 191 one half of the sample was administered the ncs and the other half was administered the ncvs192 bjs chose to give each half of the sample either the ncs or the ncvs to permit the continuous publication of estimates of the yeartoyear change in crime rates with comparable data while

by identifying approximately 2000 primary sampling units psus that are composed of standard metropolitan statistical areas county or small group of contiguous counties203 psus are stratified with respect to importa nt demographic characteristics such as geographic region population density population growth rate and proportion of nonwhite population204 sample of households is chosen from each stratum in manner that is proportionate to their representation in the larger population205 when household is selected for the sample all eligible people in the household are interviewed noninstitutionalized persons aged 12 and older living in the united states are eligible to be interviewed for the ncvs206 when household is selected for the ncvs sample eligible members of the household are interviewed once every six months for three years for total of seven interviews after three years the household is rotated out of the sample and new one is brought in the rotational panel design of the ncvs is accomplished by dividing all sampled households into six rotational groups with each group containing six panels of households207 each month one panel from each group is interviewed so that in any given month onesixth of the sample is being interviewed for the first time onesixth is being interviewed for the second time and so forth208 the survey instrument used in the ncvs consists of three parts the control card basic screen questionnaire and crime incident reports the control card contains basic administrative information for the sampled household including the houses address and basic household data such as the households income whether the house is owned or rented and the names age race sex marital status and education of all individuals living in the

victimizations against the household ie burglaries motor vehicle thefts and household larcenies212 the screen questionnaire is designed to elicit information about whether the household or particular respondent has experienced certain types of victimizations213 the screen questionnaire provides respondents with series of detailed questions and cues about victimizations and situations in which crimes may take place214 questions on the screen questionnaire describe crimes in plain language avoiding technical legal terms to elicit an accurate response respondents are provided with detailed features that may characterize criminal incident215 if screening question elicits positive response more information about the incident is collected on an incident report for each separate victimization incident mentioned on the screening questionnaire the respondent is asked to complete an incident report incident reports include series of questions about the particular crime event the offending parties and the consequences of the crime some of the questions on incident reports include the following was the crime reported to the police was the offense completed or just attempted did the victim know the offender or was the offender identified if known what were the demographic characteristics ie race gender age of the offender was weapon used in the crime did the victim resist was there any monetary loss or physical injury or both that resulted from the victimization216 the first interview is conducted in person and all subsequent interviews unless requested by the respondent are conducted by telephone217 data collected during first interviews are used for bounding purposes and are excluded when calculating the crime rate218 in the context of the ncvs bounding refers to process whereby the prior interview and the data collected during it are used in subsequent interviews to ensure that victimizations before the reference period and victimizations reported in prior interviews are not counted twice 219 bounding procedures can help reduce the effects of telescoping which refers to the tendency of people to incorrectly 211 ibid 212 ibid 213 ibid 214 bjs questions

asked whether he or she has been the victim of crime in the past six months the respondent might report victimization that actually occurred seven months ago the bounding procedure provides respondents with both cognitive and mechanical bound221 the prior interview can serve as an event that respondents can use to help determine whether victimization occurred within the current reference period222 furthermore if the interviewer finds that reported victimization is similar to one reported previously the interviewer can question the respondent further to ensure that the reported victimization did indeed occur in the current reference period 223 data collected during bounding interviews are not used by bjs to calculate annual victimization rates growing number of interviews for the ncvs are being conducted via computerassisted telephone interviewing cati currently about 30 of all ncvs interviews are conducted by using cati 224 as discussed above the first interview is conducted facetoface and subsequent interviews are conducted by phone facetoface and noncati telephone interviews are conducted using paper and pencil interviewing papi that is the respondents answers are recorded on printed instruments225 the survey has evolved from one in which all interviews were done facetoface to one in which most interviews are conducted over the telephone with growing number of phone interviews employing cati226 with ca interviews are conducted from centralized telephone facility where they read questions from computer screen and record answers directly into computer 227 the computer provides the interviewer with the next appropriate question based on the last answer it also allows for automated internal consistency checks and reduces transcription errors228 cati improves data quality because all interviewers are in centralized facility allowing them to be monitored for adherence to standardized interviewing techniques229 in some instances an interviewer is unable to complete an interview with household or an individual in the household ie they are noninterviews230 the ncvs classifies various types of noninterviews because the sample is sample of households and not of the people who live in the household some sampled households may not be able to be interviewed231 for example the household may be vacant occupied by pers ons who have usual residences elsewhere or temporarily or permanently converted to business232 in these instances the households are removed from the sample either until the next time the household is to be interviewed

home during the threeweek interview period if the household or persons in the household refuse to be interviewed and if the household is not reachable for example because of impassable roads235 the ncvs does not rely on the respondent or the interviewer to classify reported victimizations rather victimizations are classified based on details of the reported incident provided by the respondent236 for example woman does not have to report that she was the victim of rape for the victimization to be classified as rape if the details provided by the respondent indicate that the respondent was the victim of rape the victimization will be classified as rape in the ncvs moreover if the details of the incident do not meet the criteria necessary to define victimization as particular crime the victimization will not be counted as crime 237 for example if respondent believes that heshe was assaulted but the details do not meet the criteria of simple assault the victimization will not be counted as simple assault in the ncvs g14g146g150g146g157g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g16g5g24g21g561g6g138g157g138g561

sample of households across the country because the ncvs is sample survey it is subject to both sampling and nonsampling error meaning that the estimated victimization rate might not accurately reflect the true victimization rate whenever samples are used to represent entire populations there could be discrepancy between th sample estimate and the true value of what the sample is trying to estimate the ncvs accounts for sampling error by calculating confidence intervals for estimated rates of victimization 238 for example in 2000 the estimated violent crime victimization rate was 279 victimizations per 100000 people aged 12 and older239 the calculated 95 confidence interval240 for the estimated violent crime victimization rate was 2585 to 2995 victimizations per 100000 people aged 12 and older241 the ncvs is also subject to nonsampling error the methodology employed by the ncvs attempts to reduce the effects of nonsampling error as much as possible but an unquantified 233 ibid

being able to recall victimizations that occurred to them during the reference period nonsampling error can also occur when respondents do not report crimes to the interviewer respondents may not report crimes because they know the perpetrator or because they are victims of certain crimes frequently enough that they forget that they were victimized or they do not consider the victimizations important enough to report243 g21g138g150g153g149g146g151g144g561g4g146g138g156g561 the ncvs relies on interviews with household members to collect its data but it is likely that some people sampled will not complete the survey as shown in appendix g between 1996 and 2005 anywhere from 9 to 16 of people included in the sample did not complete the survey if nonresponders differ from responders in the number of victimizations they experienced the estimated national victimization rate might be lower or higher than the true victimization rate researchers have reported that homeless people young males and members of minority groups are less likely to be included in the ncvs sample and have higher rates of victimization than their older female nonminority counterparts 244

recall the details of each incident well enough to describe them to the interviewer the interviewer completes one incide nt report to cover the series of incidents 245 the incident report is completed using information from the most recent incident bjs does not include series victimizations when it calculates annual victimization rates246 however bjs does use series victimization data in special reports where series victimizations are an important aspect of the subject being analyzed eg domestic violence247 in these instances one series is counted as one incident it is likely that not including series victimization estimates in the annual victimization estimates would result in an underestimation of the true national victimization rate but the question remains how large would this effect be each year bjs includes data on the number and percentage of total victimizations reported as series victimizations as shown in figure 1 the percentage of personal crimes reported as series victimizations ranged from 35 in 2001 to 47 in 2003 and 2004 the percentage of property crimes reported as series victimizations was consistent from 2001 to 2004 08 and decreased to 05 in 2005 242

households is selected to be interviewed for the ncvs and it is the household not the people in the household that remains in the sample hence the interviewer interviews anyone in the household over the age of 12 at each enumeration even if the residents of the household have changed from the previous interview this can result in some cases where unbounded interviews can be included in the national victimization estimates for example if new family moves into the household while the household is in the sample the interviews with the family will be unbounded because the bounding interview for the household was conducted during the first interview with the household 248 if family member was under the age of 12 at the time of the bounding interview but turns 12 while the household is in the sample the interview with the family member that aged in to the sample is unbounded as described above unbounded interviews may result in inflated estimates of victimizations it has been estimated that between 17 and 19 of household and person interviews were unbounded in any given year of data 249 248 cm rennison and m rand introduction to the ncvs pp 3031 249 as cited in ibid

possession murder crimes perpetrated against business or commercial establishments consumer fraud possession of stolen property and public order offensesare also excluded from the ncvs as result the crimes that the ncvs collects data on make up small part of all criminal offenses committed in the united states250

administer it can affect estimated victimization rates as described above changes in the wording of questions associated with the redesign of the ncvs increased reporte d rates of victimization the redesign showed that the wording of screening questions can influence respondents ability to recall victimizations researchers have reported that both incident rates and subgroup variation in reported victimization are affected by the wording of screening questions251 it has been reported that short screening questions may cue respondents recall of only small subset of incidents that involved the most serious or frequent crimes whereas longer screening questions encourage the recounting of fuller range of victimizations252 in addition to wording and type of questions included in the survey the surveys methods can influence the number of reported victimizations as discussed above the ncvs has started to conduct more interviews using cati researchers have found that using cati can increase the number of reported victimizations for some crimes253 the use of ca from centralized telephone facility has been shown to increase the number of reported crimes254 it is believed that the combined effect of centralization ability to monitor interviewers and computerization of the survey help standardize the interviewerrespondent interaction resulting in higher and more realistic crime rates 255 ncvs surveys that used ca resulted in higher crime rates than surveys that did not for example violence crimes of theft and household larceny increased by 15 20 and burglary increased by about 10256 catis effect on motor vehicle thefts was negligible because ca provides greater anonymity for respondents than inperson interviews respondents may answer sensitive questions more honestly thereby producing greater number of reported victimizations 257 the length of the recall period used by the ncvs can affect estimated victimization rates the sixmonth reference period used by the ncvs was not chosen because it was the optimal reference period but rather because it provided balance between accuracy and economy258 250 cj mosher et the mismeasure of crime p 156 251 ibid p 160 252 ibid pp

recall past victimizations accurately259 also the longer the reference period the more likely it is that greater number of victimizations will be reported because respondents are atrisk for victimization for longer period of time shorter reference periods would increase the cost of conducting the ncvs because respondents would have to be interviewed more frequently260

magnitude nature and impact of crime in the united states both the ucr and the ncvs are important because as one pair of researchers states crime unlike the weather is phenomenon that is not directly observable one measure is capable of providing all the information about the extent and characteristics of crime262 the ucr measures offenses known to the police and the ncvs collects data on crimes that people have experienced whether they were reported to the police or not doj states each program produces valuable information about aspects of the nations crime problem because both the ucr and ncvs programs are conducted for different purposes use different methods and focus on somewhat different aspects of crime the information they produce together provides more comprehensive panorama of the nations crime problem than either could produce alone 263 the ncvs was designed to complement the ucr yet the ucr and the ncvs serve two different purposes the primary objective of the ucr is to provide reliable set of criminal justice statistics for law enforcement administration operation and management264 the ncvs was created to provide previously unavailable information about crime including crime not reported to the police victims and offenders265 the ucr and the ncvs collect data on an overlapping but not identical set of offenses against an overlapping but not identical population266 the ncvs does not collect data on homicide arson or commercial crimes and the ucr does not collect offense data on sexual assaults or simple assaults because the ucr collects data on offenses known to police it includes offenses committed against children under the age of 12 visitors from other countries and businesses or organizations267 the ncvss methodology precludes the survey from collecting data on crimes against these populations the methodologies used by the ucr and the ncvs di ffer in some important aspects first the ucr and the ncvs have different definitions for some crimes268 one example is the definition 259 ibid 260 ibid 261 this section compares only the ucr with the ncvs it does not compare the nibrs with the ncvs because the fbi still reports crime

carnal knowledge of female forcibly and against her will see appendix b however under the ncvs rape and sexual assault can be perpetrated against both men and women269 second the ucr and the ncvs use different methods for calculating the crime rates for some crimes the crime rates for all part i offenses are calculated on per capita basis ie the number of offenses per 100000 people270 the ncvs calculates property crime rates burglary theft and motor vehicle theft on per household basis ie the number of crimes per 1000 households271 third the methodologies used by both programs are subject to limitations and sources of error that can affect the quality accuracy and reliability of their estimates and hence influence comparisons of the data produced by the two programs272 as discussed above the ucr is voluntary program which means that some agencies might not submit data for the entire year or at all similarly because the ncvs interviews sample of households its victimization estimates are subject to both sampling and nonsampling errors 273 g21g142g149g142g140g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 as discussed above there are issues associated with ucr nibrs and ncvs data moreover there are issues congress might face when considering the future of each program especially the nibrs and the ncvs these issues include 1 ba rriers to implementing the nibrs nationwide 2 potential increases in the crime rate because of transitioning to the nibrs and 3 cuts in the ncvs sample size and the effects associated with the decrease in sample size each of these issues is

in ma king the transition to the nibrs search found that some law enforcement agencies record management systems rms were more capable of making the switch from the ucr to the nibrs than others search reported that some law enforcement agencies have rmss that are unable to report nibrs data either because the data are in an incompatible format ie they still follow the hierarchy rule and fail to capture multiple offenses and victims or because they do not record data for all of the mandatory data elements or code the data in nibrscompliant manner some law enforcement agencies reported that they had antiquated systems that are fragmented and in need of upgrades or replacement other law enforcement agencies have automated incidentbased systems that meet the agencys operational needs but

nibrs implementation in their jurisdictions funding search reported that the general perception was that implementing the nibrs is very costly for local law enforcement agencies law enforcement agencies are concerned that they will incur series of new costs including developing or acquiring new or upgrading existing hardware or software implementing automated incidentbased reporting at the street level hiring new data entry staff to process the additional data collected establishing new quality control procedures and having to increase the volume and complexity of training law enforcement agencies expressed concern that nibrs is not funding priority among local decision makers and stakeholders uncertainty of benefits law enforcement agencies reported that clear operational value for the use of nibrs data has been established for example nibrs data do not include information on the address where crime took place hence nibrs data cannot be used for cr ime mapping absent demonstration of its practical use law enforcement agencies felt that nibrs data were more useful to researchers than to them policy concerns law enforcement agencies expressed concern that reported crime will increase when they implement the nibrs because nibrs does not use the hierarchy rule meaning that all crimes in an incident will be reported more detailed discussion of this issue can be found below administrative issues according to search there was some concern that law enforcement officers would spend more time completing incident reports which would decrease the time they have to respond to calls for service law enforcement agencies were also concerned about the time that would have to be spent on training officers on how to complete nibrs incident reports and the technical support necessary for ongoing operations federal and state reporting search reported that some law enforcement agencies were concerned about the all or nothing policy of nibrs participation which meant that if law enforcement agencies could not meet every nibrs data reporting element they could not participate in the program law enforcement agencies were also concerned about meeting the reporting requirements set forth by state programs which had in some cases expanded reporting requirement beyond those required for the national nibrs program data elements law enforcement agencies reported that some of the data elements such as the victimoffender relationship multiple offenses and multiple victims did not provide investigative value other data elements were viewed as being largely subjective ie bias motivation and victim ethnicity or irrelevant ie residential status of an arrestee or the nature of suspected substance abuse education search found that law enforcement agencies were concerned that key decision makers and stakeholders did not have sufficient or accurate information regarding the objectives or nature of the nibrs it appears that although local law enforcement agencies are receptive to the idea of reporting nibrs data several barriers prevent law enforcement agencies from making the switch from the

concern that implementing the nibrs will result in higher reported crime rate in their jurisdictions as described above the nibrs does not use the hierarchy rule so all crimes in an incident ar

crimes committed does not change bjs conducted study that compared nibrscomputed crime rates to ucr crime rates for agencies in nine nibrscertified states 276 for 19911996 to be included in the study

showed that 925 of the cases had rate difference of 05 to 155281 almost 48 of the cases had rate difference between 05 to 05 for index crimes and 39 of the cases had difference between the nibrs rates and the ucr rates for violent crime the distribution of rate changes showed that 279 this included murder rape robbery and aggravated assault 280 this included burglary motor vehicle theft and larcenytheft 281 nibrs extends the hotel rule to temporary rental storage units which means that under nibrs burglary rates can appear to decrease because multiple burglaries of temporar rental storage units would be reported as one burglary rather than multiple burglaries as they would be under the ucr hence the nibrs index and property crime rates can be lower than the ucr crime rates ibid

and 05 and 401 of the cases had difference overall the data show that the transition to nibrs can increase the reported crime rate in most instances the increase in the crime rate will be small and property crimes rather than violent crimes are more likely to increase however there are instances where the increase in reported crime rates can be more than 155 bjs reports that jurisdictions with little crime tend to show exaggerated changes in their crime rates when they switch from the ucr to the nibrs hence most of the drastic changes in reported crime rates likely came from jurisdictions that did not report lot of crime to begin with if or when the fbi chooses to publish crime in the united states using nibrs data it may influence the way congress uses crimes statistics to develop policy and allocate funding as shown above the change from the ucr to the nibrs may make it appear like the crime rate in some states counties and cities has increased congress might want to be aware of the impact that the change to nibrs could have on the reported crime rate before deciding whether to allocate more funding to jurisdictions that show ed an increased crime rate also the formula for the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant jag program uses ucr violent crime data to allocate funding to state and local governments 282 one policy option for congress would be to change the jag formula to incorporate nibrs data another policy option would be to leave the jag formula as it currently is and require the fbi to modify each states nibrs data to produce summary ucr data

conducted in the early 1970s in june 1984 the ncss sample size was cut from the original sample size of 72000 households to 59000 households283 additional cuts to the sample size were instituted in 1992 10 reduction 1996 12 reduction and 2002 4 reduction284 all decreases in the sample size were done to reduce costs285 even with the ncvss decreasing sample size the size of the sample is still much larger than most other surveys conducted in the united states however as one researcher warned decreases in the sample size can affect the ability of the ncvs data to produce reliable annual measures and changes in annual rates of statistically rare forms of victimization such as rape286 as the size of the sample decreases the standard error287 associated with the estimate of the victimization statistic can increase which could make it harder to detect statistically significant 282 for more information on jag see crs report rs22416 edward byrne memorial justice assistance

the victimization rates of two different subgroups of people for example if decrease in sample size results in an increased standard error for the estimation of assault victimizations researchers might not be able to determine whether change in reported assault victimizations reflects an actual change in nationwide assault victimizations or simply statistical variation congress may want to consider whether to provide additional funding to bjs to allow it to expand the sample size of the ncvs additional funding could allow bjs to expand the sample size to what it was in the 1970s thereby allowing for more accuracy in estimating national victimization rates httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34309g10g152g160g561g5g155g146g150
