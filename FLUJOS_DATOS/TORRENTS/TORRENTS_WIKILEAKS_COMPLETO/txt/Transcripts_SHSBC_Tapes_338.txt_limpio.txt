shsbc308 ren 338 18 sep 63 saint hill service facsimile handling saint hill service facsimile handling lecture given on 18 september 1963 6309c18 shsbc308 clearsound checked against the old reel 85 min begin lecture thank you well now this is the audience 18th the 18th of audience september september what planet audience earth ad 13 ad 13 and solar system audience laughter theyre tearing down alcatraz did you know that did you know they were tearing it down yeah theyre abandoning it and tearing it down and i think thats awfully good news and so forth and were of course going to follow suit with this planet audience laughter anyway dont get wrong we dont intend anything violent with this planet we need rehabilitation center and i think this one will do as well as any now today im going to talk to you about the service facsimile and the state of the pc and saint hiller method of moving in with service facsimile and straightening up case now you have to know where the stops are on the organ before you can play an organ this helps great deal you have to know where the keyboard is and with the new electronic organs you have to know where the switch is and few things of that particular character so just sailing in on case with great nonchalance you see and not turning on the switch of the emeter and not finding out anything about the cases pt and having safeguards of any kind whatsoever and not knowing what youre doing anyway might be rather adventurous might be rather adventurous in fact i think every psychiatrist that has been along this ground is very adventurous never was so much done by those who knew so little this situation however stems from lack of technology and lack of knowhow now this knowhow situation with regard to the mind is very very hard to arrive at there are so many suppositions that just walking through forest of favorite beliefs and when you realize that every case and every practitioner in the field of the mind would be concentrated on one aspect of existence and then dedicated to not observing existence except through that one evaluation of existence you see at once the tremendous limitations imposed upon the discovery of anything about the mind and then secondarily getting any application of any truth known do you see that this then would be selfdefeating proposition not only are we given vast panorama of data any one of which can be favorite aberration not truth but an aberration dont you see in this vast forest but then we ask people who themselves are concentrated upon favorite data you see substituting for themselves to handle this situation and you get difficulty you get randomity right there now lets compound the randomity and realize that knowledge about the mind means freedom for life and beings in this universe once you recognize that as principle you will see that anyone who is dedicated to total enslavement or the dwindling spiral or caving anyone in and caving everyone in and so forth are immediately not in favor of total knowledge of the human mind but quite on the contrary are in favor of great ignorance and theres two ways of accomplishing that ignorance one is simply denial of information which is practiced but sometimes cannot be fully enforced for instance the catholic church for many many centuries made great thing out of ignorance is wisdom you see everybody had to be good and stupid and so forth and whether youre catholic or not youd have to admit that that was the modus operandi of the existing church over period of about oh i think it must have been eight hundred years or something like this its almost their total devotion was to ignorance well it doesnt go just that far that sooner or later gets interrupted but theres something that can be substituted for total ignorance and that is false data and false data is probably much more effective means of denying freedom one of the ways of going about false data for instance the fellow wants to get out of the woods and there are two trails and one trail lies much deeper into the woods and the other trail goes out on to the plain and all you have to do is put up sign at the crossroads and point to that trail which goes deeper into the woods and say this way lies freedom you see and youve promptly trapped lot of people and that is such an easy action that when it is added to the fact that everybody is sort of mired down in their favorite fixated data this can become quite vicious morass the trick is then to find the exact mechanics the exact precise mechanics which apply to all minds now the moment you have found the exact precise mechanics which apply to all minds you can then get broad agreement on the situation because they override the minor data on which the people are fixated in other words they also would have this broader perimeter of data and theyd recognize the truth in the broader perimeter of data but the moment that you move even sixteenth of millimeter sideways off of what is generally applicable to all minds youre again into the particularities and opinions so therefore if you had broad sphere of knowledge which was true and these were all high generalities and everybody would agree with them frankly itd be very easy to bankrupt and upset that whole operation by taking it and by false relay you see bad instruction and bad relay of the material and dropping out datum here and vital datum there and substituting something or other you eventually could then again effect sort of slavery out of that information in other words even if you arrive at the technology you still have the task of safeguarding the technology because once more it can easily turn and become false technology these are the various ramifications that scientology has had to deal with over period of many years and the solution to the difficulty is results because once the technology is applicable so that results occur by reason of its application then of course you dont get any arguments with these you dont get the intrusion of great deal of crisscrosses so the whole contest has been not for the achievement of certain truths we have had many of these for years but workability so that we attain an application of those truths toward rapid release of attention from favorite and fixated data and in that wise then the truth is carried out by demonstration that if it is used greater freedom is attained and we have to look at how long is the attention span of preclear well in actual fact as far as scientologists are concerned their attention span their willingness to go along and try in this direction is terrific but the casualties which occur along the lines occur because the body of knowledge has not arrived in an individual in the release of his attention from his favorite data do you see that this fellow is sure that all horses sleep in beds now it isnt only that he has this as fixed datum he also has this as total datum and any data that does not contribute to horses sleeping in beds he will discard you see its not just that hes got this one idea hes got this idea which then bends all ideas toward this idea and the truth of any existing situation is whether or not it fits this idee fixe his idea of separating truth from falsehood is whether or not it fits his idee fixe now if the thing is false it doesnt fit his idee fixe and therefore should be thrown away and if it is true it does fit his idee fixe and therefore should be retained all of which is rather interesting because if his idee fixe were horses sleeping in beds he would only listen to mental technology that affected horses or beds therefore therefore the early discovery and the long dormancy arising in greater use and application of the service facsimile means great deal to scientology means very great deal to scientology because youre now dealing with the one reason you cant get across general truth to preclear youre not trying to teach this preclear anything but youre trying to show this preclear that by reason of what you are doing you get release of attention so that the world looks brighter and he can look further and he feels better and more powerful now if you do not attain this in session with any given pc over sometimes it can be very long period of time but if you do not eventually attain this you will eventually lose your pc sometimes it lasts only an hour and sometimes it would last for several years now the degree that the pc will sit there patiently has direct ratio to how fixed his idea is now the pc who will sit there for years waiting for greater truth does not have his attention so involved with an idee fixe you see that he cannot absorb the greater application of the material which he is presented with to process and he will get perimeter benefits even though his idee fixe is not touched he gets these perimeter benefits solely and totally because he is not that fixed do you see hes just not that fixed now we take this bloke who says that horses sleep in beds and that is the total modus operandi of life we have to look at the totality which this can become this is the eighth seventh sixth fifth fourth third second first dynamic see all sex is answered by the fact that horses sleep in bed the way to run family is to have horses sleep in beds you see god is actually horse sleeping in bed see this has really got to be fixed datum now to the degree the datum is fixed he is not able to explore the perimeter of his ideas and therefore cannot see greater truth in other words hes more entrapped and more imprisoned than the next one now that is what is known as very bad mental condition its how fixed this one idea is now when youre dealing with neurosis you have somebody who has an idee fixe which only occasionally arises to wreck his life and he can see little more beyond that but when you have psychosis you have only the idee fixe only just as i just told you god is horse sleeping in bed see youll find the institutions are full of these blokes now thats it now that scares you when you start thinking about the fact that you of course have service facsimile that is an idee fixe and so forth all right its degree then its degree your attention isnt so pinned down by that that you cant examine greater truth or you wouldnt be sitting here this very minute so immediately youre lifted out of the ranks of the insane and the neurotic see just by definition that proves itself quite selfevident now you can see some wider idea but lets take mamie glutz or somebody the cashier at the local service station and we try to explain to her we try to explain to her that beings are beings and that each one of them has mind lets just go that far see now if shes got very furious idee fixe of one kind or another such as all men are alike see this doesnt fit so therefore you become false to her you are false do you see then any datum which you utter on the broad perimeter of life if it doesnt add up to all men are alike is false datum you could have an elephant stand in the middle of the room and say thats an elephant well its not man so therefore its false datum dont you see so that youre indicating that an elephant is standing in the middle of the room and there is an elephant there you are indicating false datum to her and therefore you are saying something foolish she knows this how does she know this well she knows this because naturally all men are alike one fine day you happen to tell her lot of men are aberrated in fact most all men have aberrations of one kind or another youre in there cooking youre now true this one accidental datum goes by and latches on to this service facsimile see just one now you spake truth and perhaps from there on everything you utter she will say that is true but once more its without evaluation or inspection now get the degree then the degree of fixation upon an all resolving datum and then you have the degree of enslavement of the individual these things actually are not degrees of knowledge or ignorance but simply degrees of freedom or slavery it is secondary entirely secondary that truth is truth and falsehood is falsehood its whether or not it leads to freedom or slavery that establishes your final amount of truth because fixation is only upon falsehood you can never get fixated on truth thats quite fascinating thing truth is an allfreeing mechanism if it is not allfreeing then the truth to some degree must be limited either limited in its conception or limited in its reception or limited in its application so that you can say that anything you were worried about must have falsehood connected with it there is always lie connected with anything that you are having hard time with you go out and you cant start your car and you fool around with it and fool around with it and fool around with it trying to start the car and you finally realize that it must be the carburetor so you have the carburetor fixed and you still cant start your car obviously you conceived falsehood about the car it couldnt have been the carburetor because after you fixed the carburetor the car still didnt run this is easily demonstrated in the field of mechanics you see because things run or dont run so there was falsehood connected with your analysis of what is wrong with the car now you say well its probably the spark and you fix the spark in some way and the car runs therefore that must have been the truth well we cant observe to that degree people running or not running their motors dont purr or stop and they appear to be all right when theyre not and they appear to be not all right when they are and very often an auditor has been very embarrassed at the end of session to sort of start apologizing for what terrible session its been and get the whole load in his face on the subject of taking away the pcs gains why i had fine session its marvelous session found out lot of things had terrific time you see and so forth far as the auditors observation was concerned the pc was sitting there quite glumly and hadnt had much of session all right another way an auditor is looking at the pc and the pc is smiling sweetly and so forth and so forth and actually the pc is practically spun in by the session dont you see now you can make that observation of the pc modus well cause here lets look at how far we have come in this direction you are actually now in position to determine without the faintest difficulty whether it was good session or bad session for the pc without asking the pc now thats rather terrific this doesnt look like much dont you see but thats pretty terrific if the pc got an acceptable amount of tone arm action in the session the pc by session end might have even been roughed up by something but still would have had gain and will be fine the next day but the pc who did not get tone arm action in the session will not feel good at session end matter what they say and the next day will probably feel terrible one session ta action pc bad off now that doesnt look like much that doesnt look like much that looks like datum which you now know and which youre living by and auditing by and it just doesnt look like much actually there was more wisdom in that discovery than there has been in the former fifty thousand years of thinking man because it immediately and directly took out of the realm of inspection worsening or improvement as result of treatment theres opinion about it now we dont have to depend on the auditors opinion or the pcs opinion theres dependency on that at all did you get tone arm action of an adequate amount all right then that pc is going to feel good at the end of session and the pc is going to feel better the next day you didnt get an adequate amount of tone arm action the pc is not going to feel good at the end of session and not going to feel better the next day matter what the pc says now once in blue moon you can turn off somatic and the pc feels nice about the somatic going off without getting great deal of tone arm action without getting great deal of tone arm action but you watch that pc during the next fortyeight hours and exactly the same result will occur i mean we havent stepped sideways from the basic data involved in it at all now thats interesting thats interesting therefore just on that little grounds alone we must know something about the mind and be able to do something about the mind which is in excess of what has been done about the mind look at the tininess of what i am giving you here you see thats hardly anything you see but that truth will hold up that truth will hold up you say well its mechanical truth its an application truth its this kind of truth but nevertheless itll hold up as you go along and audit you will find out that that truth holds up in fact youre finding it out right now youve sat there over stuck tone arm for two and half hours youve looked at the end of session and the pc has been going groan and creak and it hasnt been going too well and if you cared to look at the pc few hours later youd find the pc sort of caving in in various spots pc will be nattery to you in the next session and that sort of thing by the time youve gone three sessions without any tone arm action you will start wishing you had never started auditing this pc in the first place because the reactions are going to be rather extreme in other words this will follow out general observation so therefore we must be dealing where were dealing with the pc in certain principles of action those principles of action are also very elementary they fall back immediately upon the idee fixe the stable datum and the confusion and it must mean that all confusions are there and therefore all masses are there because they are held in abeyance so far as observation is concerned and will never asis by stable datum stable datum then prevents observation of the environment or these masses and therefore accumulates masses stable datum is dam erected across the river and with that stable datum firmly in place water is going to flow now what is wrong with the mind well it must be that stable datum was adopted in lieu of inspection person ceased to inspect for some reason or other he fell back from inspecting fell back from living fell back from being anywhere and just let everything go to pieces oh he says well ill put this stable datum there and the devil with it all to hell with it im he either said im incompetent or im bored with it or i want to be elsewhere or something of the sort he said something but he still put datum there to substitute for his own observation and his own coping with life and the situation at large and at that moment he started to get an accumulation of confusion because you can write i eat pie on piece of paper and put it in the middle of bake shop and it wont do thing it wont bake any pies it wont buy any pies it wont sell any pies it wont do thing you can put bake shop over the door so that people will know thats where the bake shop is and start handing out pies and selling pies and doing things like that and you have handled confusion just to that degree but the moment you put bake shop in the middle of the place and take the baker out you havent got bake shop see its pretty obvious well when the thetan did bunk and left an idea where he was after that confusion gets asised but on the contrary rather develops at high rate of speed you get more and more confusions and less and less asising and eventually this develops what we call mass mental mass once you shake up that stable datum whether you find the exact stable datum or not once you shake it up by finding cousin datum to it or finding something in its perimeter you have taken some bricks out of the dam that is lying across the river and water is going to start to flow down that river and as it flows it tends to wipe away more and more stable data and true as in any hydraulic works youre going to get more flow and more widening of the hole the flow is going through the more flow there is youve got to start the flow flowing now how does the stable datum become so fixed it becomes fixed by the very thing its supposed to confront it gets fixed by the confusion its supposed to handle and doesnt and the more it is in place to hold back the confusion the more confusion batters at it so the more accumulation of confusion you get around the vicinity of this stable datum its something like twirling bowl of taffy or something like that twirling fork in it youre just going to get more and more taffy on the fork dont you see because it is there if it werent there you werent going to get any now it might be there to remedy the confusion actually it accumulates confusions and you get more and more accumulation of confusion and therefore more and more mass and more and more this and more and more that and more and more eradication and less and less ability to inspect and communicate on the part of the individual and finally the whole house gets full of these things and the guy has got place to move anymore and he sort of sits there and he himself is one of these things and you cant find the pc because hes just another stable datum he knows see and so on and man man has gone the route man talks about the brain when he talks about the mind and if you want commentary if you want commentary on state of mental technology just look for the degree that the thinkingness or beingness of the man is considered to be mass and the more being is considered to be mass the lower the technology extant will be found to be why theyre just dramatizing the stable datum and the confusion so you look for modern science modern science says mans an animal haha see man is an animal and its hes brain and electronic impulses go this way and that way and that causes thought what have you got here what have you got here youve got brain substituted for the being and if all mental technology believes that what kind of condition must those practitioners be in theyre in the condition which you see them in today thats pretty grim theyre hard people to have anything to do with now you wonder why they are hard to train and they are hard to train and one of these fine days youll be training them just remember that their whole orientation has already added up to tremendous confusion which has used brain as stable datum so youd run process like tell all about the brain what decisions have you made about the brain and youre going to get tone arm action and all the charge of the former confusions which have been stopped by false data is going to flow by on your emeter tone arm and the next thing you know they have enough inspection ability to learn and thats why theyre hard to teach thats all because all the knowledge youre handing them they do this with it you say now there is the idea of flows and when flow flows too long in one direction it tends to get stuck and this is the way they receive this datum uh lets see flow flows too long brain theyre talking about blood uh this is discussion then of the causes of coronary thrombosis so they write down coronary thrombosis diagnosis of get the idea whats holding this well how come how come theres inspection well because theyre even depending on their own brains to do their inspection for them you imagine thetan getting so lazy that the brain is going to inspect everything for him well now this then is actually just putting your attention on the limitations of beings to the recognition of truth or falsehood and that recognition is limited in direct ratio to the amount of fixation upon stable datum and thats the degree of limitation very important principle how then can an individual who is totally boundaried and bound in and totally fixated and he himself is stable datum by this time hes longer living being how can he be expected to get anywhere what can you do for him well you think well lets see theres two approaches here you could take datum of enormous magnitude and you could hold gun on him and you say if you dont believe this new stable datum we will shoot you im not now talking about an unused method see you say heil hitler or youll at once be talking to the schutzstaffel see thats substitution of datum for understanding hell be talking to the schutzstaffel promptly patriotism rises on every hand see everybody says heil hitler all the time and eventually the nation goes down in defeat why does it become defeated well theres nobody there stopping any confusion or handling anything at all except stable datum known as heil hitler mussolinis empire went the route one of his boys was always expected to call rome if he had to make decision now when the allies first went into sicily they had to appoint some of these blokes back into civil positions first they appointed whole new batch and found out theyd appointed the mafia into total control of everything and they had to reverse this and get some of the old fascist officials and they said the only thing wrong with them was they couldnt think for themselves they always had to call rome to know what to do with piece of paper or something of the sort and the lines were real busy but that empire too went down to defeat so this method of holding the pistol or the sword or the fist and saying accept this stable datum or else and so forth has level of workability and it is used but normally ends up in greater slavery and certainly less effectiveness it can be counted on to wind up with less effectiveness less iq now we made study in johannesburg inadvertently but made study down there of bunch of papers that came through from school children and we had one school that was tested from one end to the other down there in the test department it was quite interesting to see the deterioration of the iq of the child i think the highest iq that we measured in johannesburg was sevenyearold boy if i remember rightly i may have this data wrong but he had an iq of about 200 and that was about the highest iq we had around there so but studying the school at large as they had progressed from class to class to class to class you saw deterioration of their iq well that was an interesting commentary on the school because the school was never asked to inspect anything never asked to understand anything but they had to accept this as datum never inspect it in any way shape or form and let it stand as substitute for themselves of course you got deterioration of iq right now thered be whole new level of education if you said to somebody look this over very very carefully and decide what is true about it and what is false about it and what is workable and what is unworkable thats whole new zone and area of education and very interesting zone and area of education but you see at once what limits it with everybody fixated on his own special idea by which hes going to tell rightness from wrongness that as totality cant exist but its another idea you see now this would be another method of going about this and that would be to free up peoples ideas so their perimeter of inspection increased and having increased let them inspect the data which lies before them therefore you have sort of cross of these two schools of thought you lead them up with certain disciplined action that finally shows them their idee fixe inadvertently not even intentionally but just leads them right straight to that that then knocked out of the way shows them greater perimeter of understanding and you could lead them forward continuously to higher and higher levels of understanding and to total freedom because remember that the individual is trapped to the degree that his ideas are fixed youre actually leading any person who is not clear then out of morass of entrapment not out of morass of ignorance and hes trapped to the degree that his ideas are fixed therefore it is of the greatest importance to you to find first and fastest the idea on which he is the fixedest thats very important then and that would give you the speed of processing that determines the speed that processing is done at its how fast can you find the idee fixe and free the individual for broader perimeter of inspection exteriorization even the state of ot depends upon bringing about greater states of freedom not greater states of wisdom this is an important differentiation because the wisdom will take place anyway but by concentrating on the wisdom you are all too prone to fall over into the idea of the implanted stable datum but if you think of it in terms of freeing his attention you then lead to freeing the being the only thing that can trap thetan is his attention that is all that can trap being stone walls do not definitely you have situation here where an individual is totally untrappable completely and utterly untrappable by anyone except himself what traps being is his unwillingness to confront things which are not interesting to him or to back out of situations in which he has lost interest or to move off and go his way but still somehow or another be responsible for where he was various combinations lead to this situation well we are studying now how does an individual fix his attention and then substitute for himself or for thinkingness or for something else some inanimate postulate joe was here you see here he is as thetan able to contest confront and handle any of the confusions in his direction see and actively doing so now he says i have an unconscious mind that does all that how has he trapped himself he says this is an unawareness area which is going to handle these confusions steentrillionsquillion years afterwards sigmund freud comes along and finds the unconscious mind well actually the unconscious mind would be that totality of stable data which are holding back that totality of confusion which the individual is longer aware of but is still doing well so much for freedom and slavery thats all it amounts to its freedom and slavery of the individuals fixed attention and so forth now of course the individual can go to extreme and extraordinary limits they say well you are the auditor and im depending on you utterly as my auditor to free and therefore my idea is fixed on you so therefore i ought to be able to go off and selfaudit myself and so forth because its very bad to have my attention fixed on you as an auditor well thats strictly ding ding ding here comes the wagon youre not part of his stable data youre part of his environment theres slight difference you are freeing his attention not entrapping it theres difference now how does all that add up in our modern swing and quick look around on technology i have just given you all the important data i havent given you the ramifications of this data or how it becomes fixed in this and how thetan exactly does it i havent given you any of the mechanics of the situation but i actually have given you the fundamental rationale which brings about aberration and actually theyre you can name lot of parts to all this but youve got it right here in just what ive just got through telling you theres actually more in the essence of the broad theory to the subject than just what i have told you theres really more to it now the technology of how you free up somebodys attention the exact method of how it is entrapped the exact comparisons that trap it the exact things he does to form these entrapments and that sort of thing thats broader field of technology but it nevertheless has total dependency on the data which ive just now given you and when you are looking for the pcs service facsimile therefore you are looking for that thing in present time on which his ideas are most fixated his attention is most fixated in present time that is what youre looking for when you have service facsimile if you find any cousins sisters aunts of the service facsimile kicking around and knock those out any other stable data that are around youre going to get tone arm flow theres going to be flow and its going to express itself on that tone arm horses sleep in beds you inadvertently hit on bedside tables oh you get lots of flow because bedside tables is part of the bed dont you see and you get flow flow flow flow flow bedside tables you see you dont ever expect that its connected with beds much less suspect its connected with horses but youve got your paws on bedside tables therefore youre finding something which is at least first cousin to his service facsimile service facsimile by definition is the last oppterm or terminal that the individual has or is forming has formed or is forming its the last pair of ris in combination its that pair that makes it last pair of ris formed up at the top of the last gpm postulated thats exactly what the service facsimile is it isnt anything else but youre going to find lot of cousins sitting around in there of course hes busy getting this one together see who opposes horses sleeping in beds you see horsemaster you see so hes busy being horsemaster or something like this and thats his beingness and stable datum for life you see and what he is opposing is horses sleeping in beds but horses sleeping in beds he believes you can get some kind of ramification out of that im not now trying to give you neat picture of these last two items thats beside the point but just take it that theyre there see now sitting around in their vicinity youve got all kinds of things youve got horsemasters hat you see so youve got hat youve got whip youve got boots and youve got bed or youve got posts you see or youve got sheets or you see youve got all of these little additional items see there are tremendous numbers of items scattered around here completely aside you see from horsemaster and bed and horse see there is much more stuff you get your hands on any one of those little things and youre going to get some tone arm action tone arm action actually depends on your getting your paws on one of those things you can call any one of them for just practical purposes you can call them well i found service fac or something like that i dont care whether you call it or not thats not neat thats not neat you wont know whether its service fac or not until youve found the actual gpm and found its two top items and then youll know what the service fac really was and your face is going to get somewhat red see its horses sleep in beds you see and its something about horses in beds you see and man you had it all figured out that it was bedside tables and had to do with the second dynamic you know you had it taped didnt have anything to do with the second dynamic at all it had to do with the fifth dynamic quite amusing youll nearly always find yourself that far off when youre just entering from the top with r3sc so just expect to be youll be on the safe side the chances of your actually finding the service facsimile itself in combination of two items is not merely rare its impossible so get that well its impossible cant be done it requires the illumination of knowing they are part of that bank before they are recognizable to the pc pc just wont recognize them thats all even if you found them the pc would reject them because they dont identify with the goal you dont have the combination of the last goal closest to pt you see and those two ris and their relationship to that goal and then youve got to get those three things before you get total hey what do you know see and then you get it see but before that you could have actually had it on the list and it wouldnt have meant anything to the pc so youre not going to find the pcs service facsimile do you understand but go ahead try like mad because its on that route that youre going to find the last gpm every one of these little goofball things like the bedside table bedside lamp chamber pot that sits under the bed any one of these things you find these things you know and he adds them all up and that fits over there and they dont fit any such place but thats all right he adds them all up and you get tone arm action tone arm action you list for the thing and he wont get any real relationship of how this relates with that but hell get some action it does mean something in his environment does have something to do with it by the way tremendous subjects come into this somebody suddenly going to cognite that were dealing with also freudian fetishism this is freudian fetishism some narrow perimeter of this would be fetishes you know the guy is absolutely fixated on getting ahold of womens dancing pumps you know he has closets full of them you see all of this sort of thing thats freudian fetish they went through all sorts of wild things along this particular direction but theyre simply objects associated on some distant perimeter with the service facsimile and of course person seldom is that fixated on any object it actually is not common to all cases but you will find these things around and its rather fun to look at them youll find grandfathers pipe or something like that you see oh you get lots of action on the thing you see terrific you see pc had an ally and hell figure it all out and hes got it all taped and that sort of thing and he wont have anything to do with it when you finally get the service facsimile service facsimile maybe has something about pipes in it you know steam pipes or something not anything about smoking pipes but you got too close an identification see so all of these things get identified into the bundle because he is incapable of inspecting them very freely they crossassociate and you can bleed charge now what has got the pc so restimulated that you cant get tone arm action the two top ris of the last gpm formed or being formed thats whats got him so restimulated thats what makes his present time so miserable and thats what charges up his tone arm so it wont move it even crossinfluences into auditing restimulation because his auditing is being monitored by these two top ris so when you get down to the the final chips are in you havent got any choice but to find the pcs goal not the pcs backtrack goal to be giant you see thats very nice goal and we appreciate that he had that goal but that happens to be trillions seventy ago you cant even write trillionsseventy on this wall you couldnt just writing along with normalsized figures just writing and writing and writing you couldnt write them on this wall thats lot of time and thats not present time you can however go skipping by goaloppose goaloppose goal oppose goaloppose you can bring it on up to pt see when you get it up to pt why youll see it ticking as the pt goal and it ticks yes you know ouijaboards your meter is this the presenttime gpm you see is this the goal youve last formed this the goal closest to present time tick you see all right and whatever the goal says is this right goal tick this wrong goal read is it wrongly worded goal read right goal tick presenttime goal tick then you look it over yourself and find out whether or not you think so like it could be the goal to be big you see or something like this and thats presenttime goal hahahaha look self evident the fellows here on earth that isnt his presenttime goal selfevident and he probably would have made some part of it if he had dont you see it may look too hightoned goal to you in which case you do another goaloppose on it and the worst that will happen to you the very worst that will happen to you is that you just run into greater and greater quantities of tone arm action youre doing goaloppose but it is the presenttime goal so youre peeling off the lower goals off of it well youll eventually see youll just run into more and more tone arm action so you just ask it on the meter is this the present time goal and you get nice read now see and there it is and you list for its top oppterm you know who or what would be the latest item formed or the latest idea formed concerning this goal to catch catfish whatever it is list it out get reasonable list not 189 pages listing the guy back and forth up and through and back and forth through his gpm and back and forth through his gpm and back and forth through his gpm eye sockets getting darker and darker and face getting blacker and blacker and back and forth through his gpm well we actually havent run all the tone arm action out of it yet weve only got 189 pages of listing im afraid that isnt quite the sensible way to go about it youre listing to find the top oppterm however you find the top oppterm is how you find the top oppterm see you want the top oppterm you dont want list and when you do this reasonable length of list you know and you got clean needle listing to clean needle is very excellent and you got clean needle why there youve got it and you null it down and you see one of them goes click of one kind or another nice little slash or surge or something let the pc cognite on it for while prepcheck it and youll see the most gorgeous rocket read you ever saw and you neednt have seen second momentary evenforaninstant rocket read the whole way and thats discovery now the way youve been finding goals is you get the goal and you lay it out and you prepcheck it and if it doesnt rocketread it isnt the goal and so forth and you have to prepcheck it until it rocketreads and this thing is falling off the pin and so forth hey what if this goal is to be god trillionshundred and youre prepchecking some pc at trillionshundred while his top ri is auditing what do you think is liable to happen the ri the service fac in which he is sitting and that hes frozen in right here in present time is auditing and thats an oppterm and the terminal is screamer or an arcbreaky pc found that on list the other day and the auditor tried to sell it to as terminal it turned out to be an oppterm fortunately but lookahere there he is up here in pt with all that restimulation see in his environment and everything else falling in on his head those ris are all ready to pull in you take him back to trillionsahundred to prepcheck goal you going to get there you going to see an rr youre going to see an arcbreaky pc going to be little bit too much strain isnt it so whats this add up to this adds up to the difficulties in finding pcs goals was getting pcs goals to rocket read that was the difficulty in finding pcs goals not getting the pc to volunteer what his goal was because pcs are always giving you big sell on what their goal is see thats easy you say to somebody so forth and so on you can finally get something to read in this direction see but to get it to rocket read to get it all polished up and laid out and that sort of thing that was our trouble well you can do this whole operation without any prepchecking and bring it off with only ticks up to the point where you have prepchecked the top oppterm and your first rocket read is after youve prepchecked after youve given the pc the top oppterm and prepchecked it and then and only then do you see your first rocket read and itll be gorgeous you dont even have his gpm rocketreading you dont even have the goal rocketreading youre not doing anything with it at all thats the way to find service fac slippery sneaky now ill give you the exact way you go about this because ive left you rather stonied and it is not quite complete but i havent told you all the steps either now the first thing you do is to find what you fondly hope is and which the pc implicitly believes is his service facsimile which gives you enough tone arm action to act as an anchor to windward this is saint hill method of finding its not just finding somebodys service facsimile but actually clearing the whole case to ot heres the way you go about it see you just hunt and punch around enough till you know youve got your paws on something that will bring about excellent tone arm action and then you dont use it well what do you want it for well just for this reason if you run session totally without tone arm action your pc is going to be pretty miserable and hes not going to get any gain from auditing and his morale is going to go down hes going to feel bad the next day and youre going to get into noauditing situation with great rapidity see so we take this this thing called service fac we hunt and punch around until we find something that can produce tone arm action we know it can all weve got to do is prepcheck it or run rightwrong on it or domination the pc is trying to cognite on it you know and that sort of thing and trying to run this thing desperately and get tone arm action and all that sort of thing and you politely youve found it see and for some reason or other you dont do anything with it its going to produce tone arm action though now therefore you can afford half of your next session if not two thirds of it to flounder around where the gpms are growing with tone arm action at all and if you havent gotten any tone arm action in the first half or two thirds of the session and you havent really got anyplace or got your hands on anything and you made few bum steers you can still cheerily cheerily cheerily say to the pc all right now were going to run your service facsimile why the hell werent you doing it earlier well thats right thats all right its all right and so on see so pocketa pocketa pocketa pocketa pocketa get some ta action ta action ta action the pc comes out of it feeling fine hes got some auditing right next session he comes back in expecting to run peanut boilers or whatever it was you start looking for gpms see half the session two thirds of the session goes by and you still havent produced adequate tone arm action you still got service facsimile to run see so he gets session doesnt he everythings fine his morale is staying up and everything is fine the next session if youre going this long youve just been complete knucklehead up to this point see you do your other list and youve ruled out few things now and what youve tried isnt so good and so forth now this one about third of the way through the session youve found the goal to be wonderful and it went tick and you said to the pc is that your actual goal or is that an implant gpm and your searchout found it to tick every time you said is that an actual goal of yours well were not going to get that thing to rocketread because that is way back down the track but were going to go what goal would oppose to be wonderful and were going to complete list and were going to find goal and were going to use this goal we find it just ticked the goal we find just nice healthy tick left in on the list see and were going to ask about this goal this goal is that an actual gpm dont you see going to go through the same routine as though wed just found it see originally is that an actual gpm is that you know your own gpm and so forth and is it so forth and is it presenttime goal and of course naturally it isnt most of the time you got it all straight dont prepcheck it or anything silly like that because we dont want it live see now lets roll up our sleeves and do new goaloppose list see and it was to be schnook see so we say what goal would oppose to be schnook see and we get to be an evil being or something like this dont you see thats pretty hightoned for present time do the same thing with it sort it all out dont you see and we finally move him up we dont care if we moved him through twenty of these things see we found this little tab out there was one goal that he claimed was his goal see and we could get tick every time we said is that your goal personally not an implant goal hes always very interested in it you guys are very lucky for instance i can look right over here guy over theres got goal to understand see i can look over here i know what goal youve got just watching your records you understand you know because absorbed attention whenever you hit those implant goals you know boy that ran you know boy that was good one got big send out of this implant goal hell naturally you got big send out of the implant goal it was your own goal except that was the implant lock on it see so youre rich so anyway you just take that goal take that goal and say is that your actual goal tick see and so on and do goaloppose list and move that thing by goaloppose list only you see up to pt and you finally get something is this your pt goal youre very suspicious of that because sometimes you can be three goals away from the pt gpm and it will still read its your pt goal we just havent discovered that other theres reasons for this too and i can give you the clue of what happens when youve got the pt goal and you do goaloppose list against it you dont land the guy up in the future with buck rogers see so you just do your goaloppose your goaloppose reasonable length of list see and you just list your needle clean null the thing down it ought to null easily and you get your goaloppose list item and youve got new goal go through the same business with that you could occasionally you know mess it up you didnt get the right goal or you fell into an implant goal but youll sort all that out on meter so you just make sure that you got the pcs own goal and its closer to pt than the goal you had last time see all right now when you finally get his pt goal you can still be suspicious of it and list what goal would oppose it see to drown myself see thats nice pt goal see to drown myself thats pretty real for pt all right now i dont say thatd be anybodys actual goal thats why im paraphrasing it all right so we list what goal would oppose it and we cant make it we cant do anything with this list because we keep developing more and more tone arm action were not now developing less and less tone arm action the way you do on normal goaloppose list you see if youre not up there youre going to produce more and more tone arm action this needle is going to get floppier and floppier and looser and looser the pc isnt going to arc break mostly because youre listing toward what his ideas would be sometime in the future dont you see but youre actually unburdening this goal and when you start running the pt goal you just start running into more and more ta action and more and more ta action so you know better than to continue that list when im saying more and more ta action i mean ta action not 25 divisions every hour or something like that im talking about ta action you know you know ta action you know its action you know you know action good action hot and you start running and you find the further you run the hotter it gets yeah you know you must be listing goaloppose against the pt goal because there isnt anything there to list against and all you can do is run out the pt goal you can also sometimes produce blowdown when youve picked up the pcs goal you list against it produce more tone arm action you sometimes can produce tremendous amount of blowdown by saying are there several of your own goals on this list ppssssewwww see you just picked up his goal out of thin air and started listing it was the pt goal well of course you list backtrack goals off the thing you wont find one of them see youll just keep listing them and youll find out lot of them will start reading little bits and the ta action is the thing to keep your eye on though you just by listing against the pt goal what would oppose that goal you just get more and more ta action see becomes fruitless task trying to find another goal now youre real safe the meter says that its the pt goal and the list and everything says the pt goal everybody knows its the pt goal all right you want to list for the top oppterm by this time you longer need this other service facsimile to windward because youre producing so much ta action that you wont be able to record it anyway so the thing to do is to list for that top oppterm and get yourself nice list for the top oppterm now it isnt probably the top oppterm the thing is truncated so you really dont know and the pc doesnt know if hes started to oppose the goal yet or not you can ask that on the meter and clarify it for the pc have you started to oppose this goal yet or are you still on the side of trying to execute it one or the other will read and you can tell the pc so hes got some kind of an idea of what to list for but even that isnt totally reliable but you could help pc out to that degree you merely want the latest opposition terminal formed for this gpm or for this goal to catch catfish or to drown myself or whatever it is see and just have him list the thing all right so we list this and you get one you null it down you got to list it to clean needle thats the main trick and you list it down you get nice clean needle and you null it dont have two rocketreading items on the list all the listing directions apply here but i wouldnt worry too much about this or worry too much about whether its the top oppterm because you know i mean dont beat the guy to death for fifteen sessions trying to find out if its the top oppterm when it obviously is getting hell of lot of ta action well dont cognite yet we dont know whether its the top oppterm yes shut up now be very careful we dont know whether its so on and so on when you actually hit the top oppterm the needle tends to go mad i mean if you hit the top oppterm and it went tick and you got tone arm action cognition i would think at that moment you probably didnt have the top oppterm this is the way to look at it you know the expected manifestation is that hes going to get lot of action out of this thing all right there you are youve got the top oppterm now and there it is let the pc cognite on them one of the tricks of 3m2 is after youve given the pc his item you sit still thats one of the tricks you sit still and let him cognite for awhile when he kind of slows down on this whole thing you put in your prepcheck buttons big mid ruds just big mid ruds on this thing get as far as you can or get as far as you can without annoying the pc and call the item and youre going to see gorgeous rocket read and its probably the first rocket read you will have seen in the whole operation see real slippy thats real fancy thats cutting corners thats driving with one hand at ninety miles an hour with your feet on the top of the windshield you understand thats going around every corner on two wheels thats making sure of nothing now i did that whole operation i have just accounted to you did the whole operation in two hours and fifty minutes i dont expect you to do it in two hours and fifty minutes but im not talking theoretical procedure which hasnt been done i didnt find the service fac as part of that two hours and fifty minutes that took closer to six hours something that would make the tone arm go boom boom boom boom see so i could turn it on unburdened the case enough so the case could run but then every part other part of the operation ive told you and now listen carefully the pc on goals list had ever put the presenttime goal including the operation i was conducting had never put this goal on goals list and didnt while i was straightening it out and checking it this was goal that i had seen give half rocket read four months ago it went just accidentally called it it was in channel of implant goals and couldnt get the implant goal to run and yet the thing went pow see i saw it do half fire couldnt get any close to it but ever afterwards whenever you ticked it called it it ticked finally just said to the pc out of thin air is that your own gpm tick and used it it turned out to be the pt gpm interesting now thats what i mean by cutting around corners because its definitely against the law to give pc goal pc had never at any time had ever said that was the pcs goal so thats definitely against the law and you shouldnt foist goal off on the pc and the only excuse i would have to do this is the pc did mention it at the time it went tick you know did half rocket read pc speculated on it for just an instant months ago and it was seen to fire so there were several other goals in this category that had been presented up at one time or another but none of those ticked as the pcs own goal you could call those off to disappear see now is that your own actual goal the deadest meter you ever saw you see to this to that you see you know to be sexual to be this to be that you know other kinds of goals that had from time to time been listed you see is that your own and all of them flunked the test none of them would read and finally i remembered this other one goal that i had seen read and mentioned that and it went ping and that was it never did see it rocketread beyond halfslash four months ago so this is done fast and rapidly just from knowing the pc or from examining the pcs record very carefully now supposing you inherit new pc well hes mentioned goals and hes thought of goals and you look back through it again and if youre real clever youll always draw redpencil box around any goal or an important datum of this kind so its easily trackbackableto see thats very very clever to do that on pcs auditor reports or print it big so that its indicated well but in actual fact i dont think the pc would have come up with this goal under interrogation but there were several other goals and on careful search i would have got one of those to read because when they were listed laterly they tried to do little quarterinch rr slashes and they were the pcs actual gpms in other words here was lot of points of interest im just giving you the extreme case of an auditor four months before has seen goal do halfflash when the pc mentioned it see half rocketread and then the auditor just runs out of chances just on an indifferent you know just shuffle out few cards the auditor says well i dont know lets see what goals have i seen what have i ever seen rocketread and pulls that goal out of the hat and calls it says is that your own gpm plang see you get the idea but this is just auditor observation of what has fired on the pc well thats driving with one hand on the wheel and your feet on the top of the windshield on curving road at ninety miles an hour you recognize that because thats cutting it awful close all right but what did one wind up with one not only wound up with the pcs service facsimile with this exact operation ive given you not only wound up with the pcs actual service facsimile but in position to run the pc all the way to ot chugata chugata chugata chugata see twelve hours hence i will have that bank the whole first gpm every item found in it all the way down and found back up to the top and cleaned up slick as whistle on the basis of an item every fifteen minutes which is rather fast auditing but which can be done thats one goal down but when you hit that one ri see that first ri when you really hit it right on the button that makes all the sense there is to make this accounts for all the presenttime restimulation this accounts for everything and if youre only looking for service facsimiles that method i have just given you i would very thoroughly recommend to you because it is safe to this degree supposing we had picked the wrong goal supposing on our goaloppose lists we hadnt come anywhere near finding the next goal up supposing the many slips twixt cup and preclear had occurred we could still turn around put in the mid ruds for the session rather rapidly turn around get the pc some tone arm action before the end of the session pc would feel good ready to go again see see thats all to the good see youre working it both ends from the middle you finally wind up with it and it tells you then that the reason we have not been able to find goals on pcs is because of the overburden of the top oppterm and the top terminal accumulating as they do all of the debris of present time they therefore mask the top gpm or any other gpm we are looking for there sits the pc with the roof pulled in and of course you cant get him to rocketread like that on his own actual goals so his own actual goals have tended to stay lost commodity but we used to find them two or three years ago we used to find them with tick many slip twixt cup and lip man but we still were able to find them with ticks now if you find them and stack them in on an opposition you know what goal would oppose the goal you found and youre moving the guy on up to pt moving him up to the pt gpm you know now what it is now you list its top oppterm youre going to find the pcs service facsimile its going to make all the difference in the world and all of that overburden is suddenly going to go bluuhhhfloof and so of course at that moment you dont call the goal even just ignore it you just got the top oppterm its going to rocket read like mad well anything that improved the rocket read to that degree youre certainly on the gpm line you havent got anything misworded there arent any mistakes here man so youre going to oppose this thing youre going to get the next one and youre going to oppose that and youre going on to the next and going to oppose next one going to oppose next one going to oppose and go on down to the bottom of the bank and finally you arrive at the bottom of it and youre going to clean that up and youre going to list it right back on up to top again and youre going to see meter action meter action meter action meter action meter action now he has new problem he has new problem brandnew problem now hes against detectives see against detectives now cant read the newspapers without getting all restimulated always coming into session restimulated terrible situation you see and we find that weve got gpm something like that to be unlocated or something you see were running this and we handle it in the same way of course weve got it now and by running it properly and running it on down youre going to be the only fault you have in actually running gpms is not following sensible routine overlisting skipping banks listing items backwards these various traps and frailties and follies that you can run into skip down over whole gpm and start running the one below leaving whole gpm in place and then wonder why the pc is coming apart in the auditors chair and not notice it but look we have all of our lists arc break assessments theyre all dataassembly material now you know whats going on we got lots of things to prevent difficulties with one way or the other used to do long long long long arduous arduous arduous arduous oh terrible aching painful lists goaloppose list of items to find top oppterm you see oh my my my my on and on and on pc caving in everybody hated to do one of those things because it was too grim actually take the risk of asking the pc to do represent on the top oppterm see what might it be do list you know these things have simplified doesnt say that youre not going to make mistakes doing it see doesnt say that because mistakes are there to be made the picture i drew you yesterday is picture of the bank and thats exactly what youre running that way you not only find that datum which prevents observation in present time at any given instant you also find the source of the datum which is the goal and all other data related to it and then all other lower goals on which it appends and all other actions of whatever kind when you get to the other end of the line you got an ot youre directly on your line thats how it is done the only security measure that you take in it is to make sure that your goal responds as the pcs goal and make sure before you start on bunch of listings and fumblings around of one kind or another make sure very very sure that you got an anchor to windward can you produce tone arm action on this pc all right theres very neat package of clearing that is based on the exact essentials the construction of the human mind and on the truths ive given you in this lecture wish you luck with it thank you end of lecture
