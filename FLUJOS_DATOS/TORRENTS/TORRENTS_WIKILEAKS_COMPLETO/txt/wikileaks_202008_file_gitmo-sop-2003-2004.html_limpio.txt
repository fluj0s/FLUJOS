techniques to use 1 check lighting is it daylight artificial or mixture 2 should the scene be lit if so how 3 every shot is important shoot it as if it is the most important of the series 4 take your time and plan your pan dont chase focus or the subject 5 dont scrub the scene by panning side to side or up and down one clean sweep is much more professional 6 before zooming to close up during take zoom focus and pull back first and then do the take this will avoid the awful spectacle of zooming out of focus 7 always take an exterior general view gv or establisher shot of the block building exercise yard etc this will leave doubt as to where the scene is located 8 before or after showing big close up of an object do long shot or mid shot of it to establish its location in relation to other parts of the scene 9 when covering long narrow section of scene such as hallway or the walkway of tier consider slow zoom from single location and pulling focus if necessary rather than clumsily walking along it dolly shot with the inevitable disconcerting sway and judder 10 if perspective has to change ie you have to see behind objects or demonstrate their separation from each other then use of dolly shot may be unavoidable in this case use the lens at its widest possible angle to minimize sway and judder and move as smoothly as possible again plan your shot route focusing points etc before moving off 11 in small rooms or spaces toilets bathrooms caves etc use of high camera angle from corner will give the maximum coverage of the area 12 high camera angles are also useful when separation of objects on similar plains is required 13 aim for quality not quantity lot of ground can be covered with few wellplanned shots unnecessarily repeating or prolonging shots will only bore or confuse and wont enhance the evidential value of the video 14 think like an editor as you shoot let technique master technology dont let technology become your master the best equipment in the

jdog personnel as to the importance of maintaining professional appropriate communication to prevent opsec violations b some of our biggest opsec violations are things that do not increase our probability of attack from an external enemy but instead make it more difficult for guards interrogators linguist and medical personnel to complete our missions these infractions will be addressed with increasing severity if corrections are not made c you are responsible to hold yourself and your fellow service members to use opsec in your mission more so than anyone else in jtf we have the ability to hurt the intelligencegathering mission do not 1 discuss current world events or history with detainees or within earshot of detainees that could upset or influence detainee actions or attitudes such as the situation in the middle east the destruction of the space shuttle or information concerning terrorist groups or personnel 2 discuss company operational or personal information that will lead the detainees to spread rumors stir up other detainees or attempt to use the information for manipulative purposes 3 share opinions or initiate discussions with detainees regarding information that is not relevant to the carrying out of essential duties this includes teaching detainees songs phrases in english spanish or other languages 4 discuss future missions inbound or outbound missions additional missions such as camp echo or the generals cottage etc unless specifically directed to do so by jdog through coordination with jig personnel 5 attempt to listen in on or influence interrogation activities on the block or in one of the jiif buildings if you are requested to be present by the interrogator or linguist please accommodate them appropriately however unless authorized to do so do not participate in an active manner only monitor and conduct security as ordered do not monitor the audio of the interrogation unless specifically requested to do so 6 allow detainees or other unauthorized personnel to see the uncovered signin roster at brown and yellow jiif building entrance use cover sheet or turn face down when not actively using this has led to detainee knowing names of several us personnel 7 conduct conversations critical of another unit the chain of command or other soldiers with detainees this also has happened and will not be tolerated 8 talk with other guards or us personnel not assigned to special missions such as camp echo dmo operations bus escort generals cottage etc about specific incidents or actions at those sites d these opsec limitations do not preclude you from talking to detainees in the conduct of your daily assignment maintain your professionalism be firm but fair and you will be able to build rapport with detainees opsec does not preclude guard from asking detainee how he is doing telling the detainee what actions need to be conducted being directive with your commands or answering routine questions being firm but polite will not compromise opsec and will promote detainee compliance general order 2 has been disseminated to all company commanders and sections and all soldiers are responsible to be familiar with its provisions prohibited activities include 1 discussing matters of personal or operational nature in the presence of detainees need not be discussed in their presence 2 communicating with detainees verbal or nonverbal or assisting others andor allowing others to communicate with detainees without the proper authorization also prohibited is failing to report any unauthorized

seclusion cells monitoring of individuals on selfharm watch nurses station two secure restraint monitoring rooms all security aspects with this section of delta and two secure interview areas have also been block must by coordinated with the psychologists constructed video monitoring is available for all cells in the delta acute section and in the passageway lockable sally port style door covered with thick plexiglass divides the block this door can be closed to control the flow of traffic to reduce noise level and control communication between acute and nonacute detainees this door will be locked only in the most extreme of emergencies ramp was constructed on the side of the facility for the ease of removing detainee by litter this ramp slopes both the front and rear of the block and accesses side door the side door is lockable and is used as general accessegress point from the nonacute section near the middle of the facility the facility is also equipped with rear sally port this gate accesses the deadzone around delta mhf and allows access to the block via sally port 4 the rear gate is intended for ranking officers and dignitaries to minimize detainee contact while still allowing access to the facility this gate is for emergency dignitary and ranking officers only and general daytoday operational use would take away for its intended purpose the green wind screening has been doubled to reduce the ability of detainee to see into the dead zone camp delta sop will guide all delta behavioral health block operations unless specifically expressed otherwise in

not be assigned to camp delta irf teams due to the high acuity of the detainees housed here because of this high acuity and higher risk of acting out behavior consistency in staffing levels is paramount gf personnel are all volunteers and are selected by the delta behavioral healthcare providers and the delta behavioral healthcare block ncoic from list provided by their chain of command through jdog s3 f the mps assigned to delta behavioral healthcare block will be expected to manage most routine situations of acting out behavior the delta block nco will determine when additional staff support is indicated and will notify the doc and onduty co as per camp delta sop g jdog s3 will identify candidates for permanent nco mp staff assignment to delta block candidates will be interviewed and recommendations for assignment made by behavioral healthcare staff to the jdog s3 h the delta behavioral healthcare block nco is the supervisor for all mps assigned to the block the

prior to the start of the shift on the operational specifics of the delta behavioral healthcare block and normal guard mount information any significant changes in treatment plans or detainees mental health condition will be briefed to the block nco as they arise 303 watch there will be minimum of one behavioral health staff present on the block at all times the guard force should direct all questions regarding the behavior or status of detainee to them b credentialed mental health provider will be designated daily for oncall purposes after normal working hours 304 crisismass casualty response mass casualty situations can arise at any time and are rarely foreseen the primary consideration in any crisis or mass casualty situation is security and safety b during mass casualty situation not involving delta block detainees one psychiatric technician will remain on the block and the remainder of unit behavioral healthcare personnel will respond to their assigned positions per the mass casualty plan the guard staff and remaining psychiatric technician will exercise additional vigilance in detainee observation during this time c while mass suicide attempt may occur anywhere in the camp detainees housed in the delta unit may be at higher risk due to the potential severity of their illness eg psychosis or the reckless or planned actions due to severe personality disorder the immediate action plan for mass suicide attempt will be to sweep from one end of the unit to the other and secure the extremities of detainees engaged in imminent self harm behaviors with flexi cuff restraints to points of their cells that would prevent acute acts of suicide this is done as quickly as possible however the safety of the guard and medical staff is paramount as these coordinated behaviors may also indicate clandestine plan to overpower staff the jdog s3 will ensure that adequate flexi cuff restraints are readily available for this contingency d in the event of crisismass casualty on delta block the following immediate action plan will be followed 1 the video monitoring mp will issue the brevity code to alert doc and the onduty co 2 the block nco will organize the mps into 2 3 soldier teams 3 the spare keys from behind the monitoring room door radios and spare trauma sheers in nurses office will be secured to aid in entering cells 4 video monitoring mp will contact the doc via landline to ensure proper response is in route 5 the block nco coordinates operations on the block in sweeping motion from one end of the tier to the other prioritizing the detainees by the level of distress then directing mp teams to the appropriate detainee cell 6 the block nco utilizes oc to stop detainees engaged in imminent selfharm behavior 7 mp team enters the cell with flexicuff restraints and the detainees will be secured to the inside of the cell on the floor laying on their back with flexi cuffs to at least 2 points of the cell 8 the minimum amount of force will be used to maintain complete control over the detainee 9 in the event detainee is cut down one mp will stabilize the detainees head while he is cut down then the detainee will be lowered to the floor and placed on his back then secured 10the door to the detainees cell must be locked remember the primary concern is soldier safety 11if additional manning is required the onduty co will call camp one irf teams if the onduty co is not on the block the doc will be notified to call for the irf teams 12the block nco coordinates all activities on the block ensuring unnecessary personnel and observers are not allowed on the tier and required personnel are being properly directed 13the behavioral healthcare service manager and delta mhf ncoic will be notified as soon as possible 14 all personnel must be vigilant to clandestine plan to overpower the guard and psych staff 15 all gf personnel file da 2823 original with doc copy to gf ncoic 305 nonacute section the nonacute section is for detainees with severe mental illnesses that require an increased level of monitoringcare detainees at increased risk for self injurious behavior and those detainees whose behavior is so maladaptive as to create significant disturbance if housed in the general or segregated housing units b the sections guard force provides security and first line observation of detainees with ready back up of behavioral health staff detainees who are at particularly high risk of selfharm eg detainees who have had repeated suicide attempts or detainees who have just returned from the acute section will have their cells marked with red tag the purpose of the red tag is to alert guard and behavioral health staff of detainees to be particularly observant of and have lower threshold for further inquiry these individuals can or have demonstrated propensity to be very secretive or resourceful in their attempts to do self harm during times of crisis or other times of potential distraction particular attention to cells marked with red tags is paramount during these times of crisis the delta block nco will verbally and immediately assign either guard to assume the responsibility of monitoring cells with red tags or task the unit nurse or unit psychiatric technician to immediately assign behavioral healthcare staff member to this task c cells with red tags will not have sheets large shower type towels will be provided only for shower purposes and will under circumstances be allowed inside any cells detainees assigned to delta mhf both acute and nonacute are issued small hand towels for use in their cells these restrictions should help guard and behavioral health staff to quickly identify highrisk detainees who have these unauthorized and potentially dangerous items in their cell d behavioral health staff will conduct visual check of detainees housed with red tags every two hours and document the detainees activity utilizing the high risk observation form when the guard force is not able to redirect detainee from behavior that is potentially selfinjurious eg head banging or scratching or creating significant disturbance the guard force will contact the unit psychiatric technician or unit nurse if the unit psychiatric technician is unable to redirect the detainee from potentially selfinjurious behavior the unit nurse will be notified 306 delta acute section and selfharm precautions the acute section is for those detainees at very high risk for selfharm and who require selfharm precautions detainee on selfharm precautions is at high risk for suicide or other selfinjury they may suffer from poor selfcontrol or lack of coping abilities they often deal poorly with anger and stress many try to manipulate others and their environment by threats of suicide and selfharm they often engage in threats or actual selfinjurious behavior threats or actual harm toward others antisocial and aggressive behaviors and inappropriate sexual behaviors their behavior can be dramatic and highly unpredictable the risk with these detainees is varying degrees of self injurious behaviors including suicide only behavioral healthcare providers nurses and psychiatric technicians or another credentialed medical provider can order selfharm precautions only credentialed behavioral healthcare providers can discontinue selfharm precautions b detainees placed on selfharm precautions will be transferred into an acute cell on the delta acute unit if space is not available the detainee will be placed into restraint cell if restraint cell is not available the detainee will be placed on constant observation in cell 1 or 22 of the delta nonacute section c selfharm precautions will be in effect until the detainee is clinically stable as determined by credentialed provider and safe to return to less restrictive environment d detainees who are on selfharm precautions that are scheduled for interrogation will have their clinical status and risk assessment verified by the licensed behavioral health staff prior to leaving the block detainees on selfharm precautions are generally not clinically stable enough to leave the block all items are normally removed from the cell exceptions may be made by the behavioral health staff on casebycase basis these exceptions will be documented on the selfharm guidelines form f detainee is to be given items at any time that may be used for selfharm such as razors sharp objects pens pencils nail cutters etc g detainee will not be placed in the segregation unit h return nothing to the detainee unless directed by behavioral health staff i serve meals on styrofoam plate with plastic spoon j mp staff on delta behavioral healthcare block will maintain 1 staff to

monitoring and improved privacy they allow detainees from the acute unit nonacute unit or general population to be transported and turned over to delta block acute unit and behavioral healthcare staff for new or ongoing mental health evaluations 2 detainees will be locked inside the cell but not shackled while in the cell 3 the unit nurse will coordinate the use of escort teams with escort control the escort teams will report to the unit nurse to ensure the teams understand any standing limitations on the block and that local and camp sops are followed 4 detainees from delta block mhf will be escorted to the interview rooms by way of the rear sally gate the escort team will remain with the detainee and ensure his safety and welfare 5 the video monitoring room mp will make the appropriate journal entry and monitor the interview cells to alert the block nco and escort teams to any possible problem the video monitoring room is not substitute for vigilance on the part of the escort team 308 restraints and seclusion i purpose to publish policy and guidelines for use of medical restraint and seclusion as means of assisting detainee in regaining control of his behavior to protect self other detainees guards and other staff ii background it is the policy of detention hospital jtf gtmo to deliver proper and humane patient care to all detainees while observing basic human rights use

d consider extreme physical debilitation with age or illness 4 environmental factors consider noise level inadequate or excessive light over stimulation from multiple strangers in the patients environment and changes in diet b application of restraint is done in humane manner that affords the detainee as much dignity and safety as possible guard staff applying the restraint will be knowledgeable in the use of this intervention familiar with the equipment and trained in the application monitoring and release protocols detainees will be restrained for medical purposes in specially designed cells located on the delta behavioral healthcare service unit when these are not available for example if all available safety cells are occupied then detainees requiring restraint or seclusion will be restrained in other cells located in the bhs unit if in extreme circumstances cells are available on the bhs unit detainees will be restrained in cells 1 and 48 of the closest available cellblocks all detainees who are in restraints will be placed on constant observation by medical personnel who have been trained on restraint monitoring procedures medical personnel will document the detainees behavior every 15 minutes all detainees placed in seclusion will be placed on close observation and observed by medical personnel after the first hour guard personnel using video equipment may continuously monitor detainee in seclusion when considering restraints always 1 attempt less restrictive measures first 2 if less restrictive measures are ineffective assemble adequate staff and guards to complete the restraint 3 restraints will be used per manufacturers instructions 4 apply restraint to the appropriate body part do not apply restraint to only the lower limbs or to only one limb due to risk of injury allow whatever freedom of movement is possible while achieving the desired effect maintain proper body alignment and ensure patient comfort 5 when placing compliantcooperative detainee in 4point restraints the following plan will be closely adhered to the detainee is escorted to the restraint room in threepiece suit the detainee is placed in the prone position on the restraint table soft restraints are applied to the legs first the legs are restrained to the end of the restraint table not the sides this limits the detainees ability to injure himself or others do not remove the shackles yet the left hand is restrained next the detainee is rolled on his right side and the hand is unshackled soft restraint is applied and the hand is secured to the restraint table at the detainees waist level the right hand is restrained next the detainee is rolled slightly on his left side and the shackle removed the soft restraint is applied and the right hand is secured to the restraint table above the detainees headshoulder level the restraints are double locked leg shackles are then removed the belly chain is unlocked and then removed behavior healthcare staff must evaluate the detainee to ensure proper circulation and correct detainee body alignment prior to securing the restraint room door if the detainee continues to act out or continues to be danger to himself fifthpoint can be applied the canvas belt is run under the restraint table and under the left arm of the detainee then through hard point on the table the wide canvas portion of the fifthpoint is aligned over the detainees shoulder blades and then snugged be very cautious not to restrict the detainees breathing the fifthpoint functions to stop the detainee from striking his head on the restraint table it is understood that an uncooperative detainee will be placed in restraints in the most expeditious and safety conscious manner soldier safety is paramount but the above listed steps should be followed as closely as possible while restraining combative detainee c monitoring and patient care 1 the monitoring process addresses physical and emotional needs of the detainee this monitoring includes simple observation vital signs circulation checks observation of the extremities range of motion emotional and physical response to restraint food hydration and toileting needs other monitoring will be done as needed based on individual needs 2 detainee care minimum intervals constant observation medical personnel will constantly observe detainee in restraints b every 15 minutes medical personnel will monitor detainees in seclusion every 15 minutes for the first hour of seclusion thereafter if clinically indicated the detainee in medical seclusion can be monitored via video by guard personnel c every one hour circulation checks of each restrained limb d every two hours fluids must be offered or more frequently as requested restroom use must be offered or more frequently as indicated if the detainee is combative or unpredictable plastic bedpan andor urinal must be provided for use restraints must be removed from each limb one at time to perform range of motion exercises at least this frequently for detainees in seclusion medical personnel will physically observe the detainee every four hours vital signs meals must be served at regular meal times using paper and plastic products f detainees will not be removed from restraints to go to shower and exercise call do to the unique nature and dynamic situation taking detainee out of restraints for shower and exercise then returning to restraints is counter productive the intent of restraining the detainee is to secure him from further selfinjurious behavior or until he can gain control of himself placing detainee in shower or exercise yard would only serve to further exacerbate the situation g other interventions extra staff and security can be called to assist with detainee care as needed to maintain detainee and staff safety an rn or psychiatric technician will assess the detainees behavior for release from restraint as soon as the detainee demonstrates that internal control has been regained the oic detention hospital will be notified when detainees are restrained or secluded for longer than 12 hours thereafter the oic will be notified every 24 hours if the restraint or seclusion continues detainees remaining in restraint or seclusion for 72 continuous hours or more than four times in any seven day period will be monitored through meeting of the responsible lip nursing and corps staff to consider alternative approaches such as changing clinical treatment plan changing medications or doses andor utilizing different behavioral interventions d documentation 1 the documentation requirement for detainee requiring restraint must incorporate the critical elements of assessment application and monitoring and reflect concern for the detainees human needs and preservation of dignity 2 each time restraint is applied or seclusion initiated the following will be documented by an rn or corpsman time and date restraint is applied b the detainees
