ramseur analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry emission allowance allocation in capandtrade program options and considerations summary when designing capandtrade program one of the more controversial and challenging questions for policymakers is how to whom and for what purpose to distribute the emission allowances regarding the method of distribution to covered sources policymakers could 1 sell the allowances through an auction process 2 allocate the allowances at cost to covered sources 3 provide allowances to non covered sources who would in turn sell them to covered sources or 4 use some combination of these methods although the emission allocation method would not affect the environmental integrity of the capandtrade program the selected allocation strategy could have considerable consequences using auctions as distribution method could avoid certain concerns that are likely to occur if covered sources receive all or most of the allowances at cost 1 consumers in different electricity markets may face inequitable price increases 2 weak price signal for electricity may be sent in areas with the most carbon intensive fuel portfolios and 3 nocost allowances may overcompensate covered sources in addition auction revenues offer unique opportunity to reduce the overall costs of the emissions program several economic studies indicate that if used in the most efficient manner overall costs could be minimized by almost 50 greenhouse gas ghg emission capandtrade program would create valuable new commodity the ghg emission allowance epa estimates that allowance value could potentially account in aggregate for tens or hundreds of billions of dollars each year when distributing this value policymakers would face choice between minimizing the costs imposed on the entire economy minimizing the expected burden on specific parties or supporting range of climate or non climaterelated policy objectives for example congress may consider providing transition assistance to carbon intensive industries studies have estimated profits could be maintained in the energy production and electricity generation sectors if approximately 20 of allowances were provided to those sectors at cost members may also consider allotting allowance value to consumers particularly lowincome households who are expected to bear the majority of the compliance costs via higher energy prices another option would involve distributing the allowance value to support various objectives technology development energy efficiency improvements biological sequestration climate change adaptation efforts or non climaterelated purposes such as deficit reduction of these objectives technology advancement is arguably the most crucial in terms of mitigation moreover deployment of new technologies could potentially lower the overall costs of the program although many of the proposals in the 110th congress eg s 2191 s 1766 and s 3036 would employ an auction to some degree none of the bills specifies the design of the auction congress may want to consider including specific design elements in legislative text particularly auction frequency and

auction revenue distribution under s 2191 29 emission allowance allocation in capandtrade program options and considerations introduction climate change issues have generated interest and debate over the past two decades in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc arguably in recent years the primary issues under debate have shifted from science such as the role of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from human activities1 to policy for instance 2005 sense of the senate resolution on climate change2 stated it is the sense of the senate that congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions at rate and in manner that 1 will not significantly harm the us economy and 2 will encourage other action and key contributors to global emissions in the 110th congress members have introduced several bills that would establish marketbased3 mandatory ghg emission reduction program4 most of these proposals would establish some type of capandtrade system to regulate ghg emissions5 for brief primer on capandtrade systems see appendix 1 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc concluded in 2007 that most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations emphasis added ipcc working group i climate change 2007 the physical basis cambridge uk

table the amendment was rejected by roll call vote 44 53 3 the policy alternative to marketbased approach would likely require specific emission limits or particular technological controls for specific emission sources 4 see crs report rl34067 climate change legislation in the 110th congress by jonathan l ramseur and brent yacobucci 5 another marketbased approach would entail carbon tax some of the capandtrade proposals include elements eg safetyvalve that are akin to carbon tax these proposals are often described as hybrid approaches see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d continued crs2 in designing capandtrade program one of the more controversial and challenging questions for policymakers is how to whom and for what purpose to distribute the emission allowances concerning the question of how to distribute allowances policymakers could 1 sell the allowances through an auction process 2 allocate the allowances at cost to covered sources 3 provide allowances to noncovered sources who would in turn sell them to covered sources via the emissions trading market or 4 use some combination of these methods regardless of the method of distribution emission allowances would have monetary value in carbonconstrained regime such as capandtrade program if an auction is used policymakers could distribute auction revenues to wide range of parties to support various policy objectives likewise policymakers could allot allowances at cost to noncovered entities eg federal or state agencies among others to promote the same or different objectives by addressing the question of how to whom and for what purpose to distribute the emission allowances policymakers would craft an allocation strategy the strategy would not affect the environmental integrity of the emissions cap6 in addition covered entities would generally face the same emission reduction decisions under either allocation strategy7 common misconception is that if covered sources receive allowances at cost the sources would behave differently from sources who purchased allowances through an auction8 economists point out free allowances9 have value and when covered entities submit an allowance for compliance purposes the entities forgo the opportunity10 to sell the unused allowance in the emissions trading market11

energy independence and global warming crs3 sections examine the potential benefits and concerns of these allocation mechanisms the final section identifies different options and policy considerations for congress when determining to whom and for what purpose to distribute the value of the emission allowances the allocation strategy would have substantial consequences for the cost of the capandtrade program and how the costs are apportioned auctions in recent years the use of auctions to allocate emission allowances has generated considerable interest12 several of the capandtrade proposals from the 110th congress including s 2191 which was reported from the senate environment and public works committee on may 20 2008 would use auctions to allocate an increasing percentage of the caps emission allowances13 this section describes the potential benefits that auctions may provide if used to distribute allowances to covered sources in capandtrade program in addition this section discusses auction design issues and considerations for policymakers implementation benefits in general the concept of an auction is relatively simple to understand14 auctions would allow the market to determine which entities receive emission allowances and at what price parties placing the highest value on the allowances would receive them with this allocation method policymakers would be relieved of the responsibility to make distribution decisions process that might be described as picking winners and losers15 for this reason auctions are generally considered to be the most transparent mechanism for distributing allowances in addition in free allocation format parties would have strong incentives to seek increasing shares of the overall allowance allotment16 parties with resources 12 the 10 states participating in the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi have agreed to auction at least 25 of their allowances and several of the rggi states intend to auction almost 100 of their allotments see crs report rl33812 climate change action by states to address greenhouse gas emissions by jonathan l ramseur 13 for comparison of the capandtrade bills see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker and brent d yacobucci 14 the logistics of establishing and running an auction are more complicated this issue is discussed below 15 us environmental protection agency epa office of air and radiation tools of the trade guide to designing and operating cap and trade program for pollution control 2003 16 this behavior is described as rentseeking in economic contexts dallas burtraw prepared testimony before the house select committee on energy independence and global warming january 23 2008 crs4 available for such efforts may have an advantage an auction system would eliminate this behavior polluter pays principle requiring emission sources to purchase emission allowances would support the polluter pays principle in general environmental policy context the polluter pays principle holds that pollution costs should be borne by the polluting facility or industry not society at large to accomplish this objective pollution costs should be included in the overall price of good proponents of the polluter pays notion would likely argue that if products are priced to reflect environmental costs air pollution land use ghg emissions demand for these products may decline advocates of polluter pays maintain that the environment and the services it provides are shared public good under this framework facilities should have to pay for the right to pollute ie emit ghgs if allowances are provided at cost to emission sources the polluter pays principle would be violated potential minimization of costs on society if congress decides to use an auction to distribute emission allowances to covered sources as opposed to providing allowances to covered sources at cost the auction revenues could be used to substantially minimize the overall costs on society of the capandtrade program economic studies have found that if revenues are used in the most economically efficient manner the overall costs imposed by capandtrade program could be reduced by approximately 5017 economists maintain that the most economically efficient application of revenues would be to offset reductions in taxes on desirable activities such as employment or personal income18 the opportunity to use allowance value in this manner and thus minimize overall costs to this extent is unique to the auction mechanism19 however many observers argue that applying auction revenues in this fashion is politically unlikely20 other potential uses of the 17 this cost savings estimate is based on an analysis that simulated

robert stavins us capandtrade system to address global climate change 2007 the hamilton continued crs5 auction revenues may or may not generate overall economic cost savings these options are discussed later in this report avoidance of economic concerns from nocost distribution auctions would avoid several of the undesired economic effects that are likely to occur if allowances are provided to covered sources at cost these concerns are discussed in greater detail later in the nocost distribution section in brief they include inefficient and inequitable price signals in the electricity sector potential overcompensation to covered sources and challenges with allotting allowances to new and retiring sources auction design issues although many of the capandtrade proposals in the 110th congress would employ an auction to some degree none of the bills specifies the design of the auction recent study that examined auction design issues for the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi found that careful attention to auction design can be critical to an auctions success in achieving the goals specified for the auction21 design considerations the success of an auction is typically measured by both its efficiency and revenue generation22 in an emission auction context efficiency is achieved when the parties that receive the allowances are the parties that place the most value on the allowances other attributes of an auction that may be used to measure its success include price discovery in costeffective emissions trading program the allowance price should mirror or closely follow the marginal cost of emission reduction ie the cost of reducing the last most expensive ton an effective auction should help identify the allowance price that is near to the marginal cost of reduction23 protection against market manipulation auctions should discourage or prohibit bidding behavior that would create inefficient outcomes in the market for example collusion among bidders may artificially lower the allowance price another concern is hoarding in which one party makes speculative bids above the competitive price in order to capture disproportionately large percentage of the allowances 20 continued project brookings institution 21 charles holt et auction design for selling co2 emission allowances under the regional greenhouse gas initiative 2007 prepared for rggi working group staff 22 holt et 2008 23 note that this value will fluctuate daily with changes in fuel prices and energy demands crs6 minimize transaction costs substantial administrative or transaction costs could reduce the costeffectiveness of using an auction moreover high transaction costs could place smaller firms at disadvantage transparency and fairness the rules should be readily available to all parties and should not favor certain participants design options certain auction designs may provide advantages or disadvantages depending on the auctions primary objective for example some auction designs in certain contexts may favor revenue generation others may be more efficient in terms of matching the market price policymakers may undertake further study before specifying the particular auction logistics although economic studies have examined the performances of different auction formats in other contexts relatively few papers have examined the relative merits of each of these auction forms in multiunit eg emission allowances auctions24 one option for congress would be to direct an implementing agency to devise the most appropriate auction format based on the ranking of objectives provided by congress policymakers may consider various auction designs in general auction designs are distinguished by 1 the number of rounds for bidding generally one round often called sealed bid versus multiple rounds and 2 whether there is uniform price or individual price discriminatory price for each buyer examples of auction designs with different combinations of these two characteristics include the following discriminatory price sealedbid auction this type of auction is used in epas so2 emission trading program25 in this system parties submit sealed bid containing multiple offers to purchase set number of allowances at certain prices the implementing agency opens the bids and distributes allowances starting with the highest offer until the supply is exhausted for example consider hypothetical auction in which the supply of allowances is 20 units and the highest bidder offered 100 per allowance for 15 allowances and the second highest bidder offered 90 per allowance for 10 allowances the highest bidder would receive 15 allowances for 100allowance the second highest bidder would receive 5 allowances at 90allowance uniformprice sealedbid auction this type of auction is similar to the above format discriminatory price sealedbid with one major difference the price paid by all bidders is the highest rejected bid ie the secondhighest bid using the above scenario the highest bidder would receive 15 allowances at 90allowance and the secondhighest bidder would receive 5 allowances at 24 holt et 2008 25 more information on epas so2 emission trading auction is at httpwwwepagov airmarketstradingfactsheetauctionhtmlhow crs7 90allowance ireland used this design to implement its auction for the eu ets26 in addition in study prepared for rggi officials researchers recommended using this approach27 uniformprice multiround english clock auction in an emission allowance auction using this format the auctioneer would post allowance price and parties would offer the quantity they are willing to buy at the posted price the first posted price would be set at low level so that demand would exceed supply the auctioneer would continue posting higher prices at set time intervals until demand is less than or equal to the allowance supply the posted price that produces this outcome would become the allowance price for all bidders virginia used this auction type to sell nitrogen oxide emission allowances pursuant to the nox sip call28 reserve price one issue that arguably transcends auction design considerations is whether or not the auction should have reserve price and if so at what level in an auction reserve price is price set by the seller below which the seller refuses to part with the item for sale in large volume multiunit auction that is expected to have substantial participation ie high demand for the items for sale reserve price would all but guarantee revenue stream in capandtrade allowance emissions auction reserve price would operate much like minimum tax or price floor reserve price may address certain logistical concerns such as bidder collusion that are often associated with auctions in addition reserve price may provide assurance to parties making emission reductions that the reductions will have some value in the allowance market for example if covered source can expect reserve price to be set at certain level eg 10ton and the source makes multiple reductions each at perton cost below the expected reserve price the source can have confidence that its efforts will be costeffective the authors of the rggi auction study recommended that rggi participants set reserve price when conducting allowance auctions concluding compelling justification for reserve price can be found in the academic literature and from previous experience with auctions and the reserve price would help the auction achieve the criteria eg the design criteria discussed above set out in this report29 26 ken macken ireland environmental protection agency presentation for rggi auction workshop march 2006 at httpwwwrggiorgdocumentshtm 27 holt et 2008 28 for more information about virginias auction see william shobe presentation for rggi auction workshop march 2006 at httpwwwrggiorgdocumentshtm 29 holt et 2008 crs8 because reserve price if established could influence revenue flows from an auction congress may consider addressing this issue specifically in legislative text rather than leave this matter open for interpretation to an implementing agency auction frequency epas so2 emissions trading program holds annual auctions to distribute small percentage of allowances likewise s 2191 would direct the implementing agency to conduct annual auctions however policymakers may consider holding more frequent auctions eg every quarter more frequent auctions could provide several benefits both for covered sources and to the efficiency of the program more auctions would give covered sources more flexibility to incorporate unanticipated events eg higher electricity demand due to warmer than expected temperatures if auctions were held more frequently the allowances sold would be in smaller lots this may help facilities particularly smaller operations maintain cash flow in terms of efficiency smaller more frequent auctions would likely reduce the potential for parties to manipulate the market eg from speculative hoarding more auctions may increase market liquidity by making allowances available for purchase in more frequent intervals the potential downside to having multiple auctions per year is that covered sources may face additional transaction costs however the authors of the rggi auction study stated past experience suggests that significant proportion of the administrative cost of holding auctions is related to the initial setup and that incremental costs of repeating particular auction type will be low in comparison to these initial costs30 after considering the costs risks and benefits the study authors recommended that participating rggi states use quarterly auction to allocate emission allowances31 30 ibid 31 ibid crs9 nocost distribution to covered sources emission trading programs in the united states32 and abroad33 have generally distributed the vast majority of allowances at cost to sources directly subject to cap in recent years however support for auctions has gained momentum this momentum likely reflects better understanding of the benefits of using auctions as well as increased scrutiny of the effects of distributing allowances at cost34 this section discusses the potential benefits and concerns of allotting allowances to covered sources at cost potential benefits mitigation of disproportionate costs the primary argument in support of nocost distribution is that carbonintensive industries are expected to face disproportional costs under carbonconstrained system these industries maintain they should receive compensation ie free allowances for the financial losses imposed by the capandtrade program the financial losses may lead to loss of jobs in particular industries the compensation may be considered form of transition assistance for industries and industry employees most impacted by ghg emissions cap this argument is perhaps stronger for industries that may have more difficult time including the costs of emission reduction in the price of their products for example certain us industries may be more vulnerable to foreign competition especially if their competitors are located in nations without ghg emissions caps for these industries increasing the price of their materials to reflect the cost of emissions abatement may entail comparative disadvantage moreover if foreign competitors in these industries increase their market share as result of us cap andtrade program the foreign facilities in uncapped economies are likely to increase their ghg emissions this potential scenario is described as emissions leakage constant concern in climate change policy in other economic sectors particularly the electricity generation sector that do not face foreign competition facilities are expected to pass along the vast majority of the emission reduction costs this would entail higher prices for consumers 32 although epa annually auctions small percentage of the allowances in its sulfur dioxide so2 capandtrade program pursuant to title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments most of the allowances are provided at cost to emission sources based on their historical emissions see crs report rl34235 air pollution as commodity regulation of the sulfur dioxide allowance market by larry parker and mark jickling 33 the european unions eu emissions trading scheme ets co2 capandtrade program that applies to power plants and certain carbonintensive industries allowed countries between 20052008 to auction up to 5 of allowance allocations only 4 of 25 countries used auctions at all and only denmark auctioned the full 5 see crs report rl34150 climate change the eu emissions trading scheme ets enters kyoto compliance phase by larry parker 34 see eg cameron hepburn et auctioning of eu ets phase ii allowances how and why 2006 climate policy 61 137160 crs10 which includes businesses and households however price increases would likely reduce consumer demand35 potentially lowering the profits of carbonintensive industries36 political feasibility capandtrade programs both domestic and international have usually provided allowances to covered sources at cost this free allocation to covered sources is arguably means to garner support for an emissions reduction program moreover industries may prefer to receive allowances at cost rather than compete for share of auction revenues transfer of free allowances may be more politically secure than government promises of compensation from auction revenues37 concerns undesirable effects in the electricity sector as the electricity sector accounts for the largest percentage 34 in 200638 of ghg emissions in the united states it would play major role in the effectiveness of capandtrade program there is concern that if allowances are distributed to electric utilities at cost the electricity consumers who purchase electricity under priceregulated structure would receive price signal that is weaker than the signal received by consumers in unregulated or competitive markets39 in contrast an auction distribution system would enable electricity generators in both priceregulated and competitive markets to send comparable price signal to consumers40 in the united states the price consumers pay for electricity may be determined by state regulatory body often described as costofservice regulation or the price may be subject to market forces often described as deregulated or competitive in general the regulatory structure varies by the type of facility andor the state in which the electricity is generated in 2007 the more traditional price regulated electric utilities generated approximately 60 of the total net electricity generated in the united states41 the remaining 40 of electricity was generated by 35 this may vary by the product sold and the level of price increase some products may display relatively inelastic pricedemand relationship

resources for the future prepared testimony before the house select committee on energy independence and global warming january 23 2008 however when covered sources receive allowances at cost figure 2 consumers in priceregulated and competitive regions experience dramatically different price changes note the asymmetrical shape of the columns as compared to those in the previous figure in most of the priceregulated regions the electricity price would remain the same or decrease while the price would increase in most of the competitive regions crs13 the different consumer impacts identified in figure 1 and figure 2 result from the dissimilar market structures priceregulated versus competitive that determine the price of electricity for us consumers the different impacts reflect the electric generating facilities varied abilities to pass through all types of costs to consumers in the form of higher electricity prices in an auction the costs to utilities would include both the costs of mitigation and the costs of purchasing allowances under nocost distribution system utilities would have mitigation costs and opportunity costs associated with the allowances discussed above if policymakers auction allowances to electric utilities both priceregulated and competitivemarket utilities would include the cost of purchasing emission allowances in the price of electricity however if allowances are distributed at cost to utilities only competitivemarket utilities would be able to pass along their opportunity costs because priceregulated facilities would not be able to pass through the opportunity costs associated with free allowances consumers in these areas would effectively receive the benefit of the free allowances in the form of stable or lower electricity bills figure 2 consumers in competitive areas would not receive the benefit of free allowances and would thus face disproportionate price increases this consequence would erode the effectiveness of the capandtrade program because consumers would likely not receive price signal that is strong enough to encourage conservation or energy efficiency improvements the effects of this inefficient outcome may be magnified because approximately 75 of coalfired electricity was generated by priceregulated utilities in 200745 thus consumers that utilize morecarbon intensive electricity would face weaker price signal than consumers using less carbonintensive electricity46 the price disparities that consumers with comparable fuel portfolios would experience under different electricity regulatory structures would be both unfair and inefficient an auction would eliminate both of these concerns consumers in price regulated and competitive regions with similar carbonintensive electricity profiles would experience more equitable impacts moreover the costs of the capandtrade program would be included in the price of electricity in each market structure this result is necessary if the carbon price is to modify consumer behavior eg spur energy conservation efforts or the installation of more energy efficient technologies overcompensation to covered entities if covered entities receive at nocost ghg emission allowances in proportion to their emissions there is concern that the recipients would be overcompensated for the compliance costs imposed by 45 calculated by crs with data from the energy information administrations 906920 database available at httpwwweiadoegovcneafelectricitypageeia906_920html 46 national commission on energy policy allocating allowances in greenhouse gas trading system 2007 crs14 capandtrade program47 depending on the percentage of emission allowances auctioned an auction could avoid overcompensation this potential outcome is function of several factors first the aggregate value of the ghg emission allowances is expected to be substantially greater than the aggregate costs of making emission reductions pursuant to the emissions cap48 see figure 3 and surrounding discussion below second if covered sources receive allowances at cost they would retain the benefits of these allowances which are essentially form of currency49 although it may be counterintuitive covered entities are expected to raise the price of their products even if entities receive allowances at cost50 thus covered sources would receive the financial benefit of the allowances and the gains associated with higher prices51 these benefits are often described as windfall profits52 windfall profit result has been observed in capandtrade models53 and in the largest existing capandtrade program the european unions eu emissions trading scheme ets the eu ets established capandtrade program for power plants and certain carbonintensive industries allocating virtually 100 of the allowances at cost to covered entities between 2005 and 2007 phase 1 one study estimated that power plants in the united kingdom received windfall profits of 800 million euro approximately 1 billion54 per year55 separate study estimated 47 see lawrence h goulder mitigating the adverse impacts of co2 abatement policies on energyintensive industries 2002 resources for the future discussion paper anne smith and martin t ross allowance allocation who wins and loses under carbon dioxide control program 2002 charles river associates 48 compared to other emissions trading programs namely the us so2 emissions acid rain program the ratio of allowance value to compliance costs is expected to be much greater 49 as discussed above priceregulated electric utilities represent critical exception 50 this is due to the opportunity costs that an entity would face if it used ie surrendered to the implementing agency for compliance its allowances instead of using the allowance the entity could have sold it for its market value 51 however higher prices could reduce consumer demand and potentially lower profits discussed below 52 us congress senate committee on energy and natural resources design elements of mandatory marketbased greenhouse gas regulatory system chairman and ranking member statement climate change conference 2006 109th congress 53 goulder 2002 simulated us

million 750 million56 per year57 however the eu ets phase 1 allowance price for reasons beyond the scope of this report dropped dramatically in april 2006 and never recovered58 thus the windfall profits were only generated in the first year 2005 of the program nevertheless 2008 study estimated that european power plants are expected to continue to receive windfall profits during the second phase 20082012 of the eu ets for example german plants are projected to generate the most windfall profits between 14 billion and 22 billion euro 21 billion 33 billion59 over that time period60 in recognition of this projection the european commission ec has proposed to address this issue stating taking into account their ability to pass through opportunity costs full auctioning should be the rule from 2013 onwards for the power sector in addition the ec has proposed that free allocation in other sectors would gradually phase out so that by 2020 auctions would distribute 100 of the allowances61 treatment of new and retiring sources an auction distribution format would address economic inefficiencies and concerns of fairness regarding new emission sources and facilities that are

and surrounding discussion to whom and for what purpose the value of allowances is distributed would affect 1 the overall cost to society of capandtrade program and 2 which parties bear the costs of the program policymakers would face choice between minimizing the costs imposed on the entire economy societys costs or using the allowance value for other purposes64 the latter choice covers range of options congress could choose to provide assistance to specific industries or groups or choose to distribute the allowance value to support various objectives to provide an example appendix b of this

allowance value that may be available for distribution in cap andtrade program the second part examines the range of options for distributing allowance value this is followed by discussion of policy considerations overview and estimate of allowance value compliance costs versus the value of emission allowances capandtrade program would impose costs covered entities would comply by reducing their own emissions purchasing emission reductions credits from other covered entities or if allowed buying offsets from noncovered sources that have reduced avoided or sequestered emissions65 the combined costs of these activities are the compliance costs of the capandtrade program66 the compliance costs are different from the aggregate value of emission allowances in the early years of capandtrade program the aggregate value of allowances would likely dwarf the costs of making or finding emission reductions 63 markus ahman et tenyear rule to guide the allocation of eu emission allowances energy policy 35 200717181730 64 however some objectives if met namely technology advancement may also reduce the overall costs of the program this is discussed below 65 see crs report rl34436 the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade program potential benefits and concerns by jonathan l ramseur 66 these costs may be described with different terms in different publications eg program costs mitigation costs or economic costs crs17 figure 3 depicts this contrast the area under the emissions cap curve represents the number of allowances the area between the emissions cap curve and the businessas usual curve represents the required reductions the former area will be larger as long as the emission reduction target is less than 50 of the emissions baseline67 the compliance costs represent the sum of the costs of each ton of reduction and the cost of each reduced ton will vary for example some projects may present lowhanging fruit reduction opportunities whereas investments in extra capital eg carbon capture technology may represent more expensive reduction option consider simplified example68 policymakers set 7ton cap on an economy that currently emits 10 tons the 3 tons that must be reduced cost 1 5 and 10 respectively the cost of the last most expensive ton the marginal cost is 10 because the marginal cost largely establishes the market price of emission allowances in capandtrade each emission allowance has value that is approximate to the marginal cost69 therefore in this example the value of the allowances would equal 70 but the compliance costs would be only

the future 69 the option to bank emission allowances would likely alter this calculus in anticipation that allowance prices will increase in subsequent years covered sources would likely purchase more allowances than are needed for compliance purposes in the early years of the program crs18 estimates of allowance value whether or not congress sells the allowances through an auction and generates revenues or distributes the allowances at cost the allowances would have monetary value to put the allowance value in context consider the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 s 2191 an

analysis of provisions of s 219171 one of the primary results of the analysis is the estimated price range for emission allowances from these price estimates potential auction revenues can be identified because the legislation specifies the percentage of allowances to be auctioned in each compliance year table 1 lists the estimated annual action revenues that would be generated under provisions of s 2191 in addition the table provides an estimate of revenues that would be generated if 100 of the emission allowances were auctioned this latter estimate represents an approximation of

billion employment taxes 838 billion corporate income taxes 368 billion options for allowance value distribution provide transition assistance to carbonintensive industries several economic studies have estimated the percentage of allowances comparable amount of auction revenues could also be used that would provide compensation for projected profit losses to specific carbonintensive industries the findings include the following goulder found that 13 of the emission allowances would compensate the fossil fuel producing industry coal mining oil and natural gas extraction for lost profits73 burtraw and palmer concluded that the electricgenerating industrys estimated profit losses could be offset with 6 of the emission allowances74 smith and ross estimated that 21 of the allowances would compensate the combined losses of primary energy producers and electric utilities ie combination of the sectors examined in the other two studies75 although these studies analyzed the net effects to certain economic sectors there are likely to be winners and losers within the sectors particularly in electricity generation for instance some facilities such as coalfired plants are expected to see greater losses while others hydroelectric or renewable energy plants may see gain in profits76 the above estimates consider that allowances would be provided to covered sources in perpetuity however some capandtrade proposals in the 110th congress eg s 2191 and s 1766 would generally phaseout free allocation as the 72 us internal revenue service internal revenue service data book 2007 publication

as such the initial percentage of allowances provided at cost in these bills is higher than estimates that provide for indefinite distribution at set percentage for example during the first five years of the program established by s 2191 fossil fuelfired power plants would receive 19 of the emission allowances at cost77 this percentage would gradually decline to zero by 203178 offset reductions in distortionary taxes economic theory generally supports tax policy that would reduce taxes on favored activities increased employment or personal income and increase taxes on less desirable behavior increased pollution79 auction revenues could be used to offset reductions in the taxes that apply to desirable activities using auction proceeds in this manner has been described as yielding double dividend 1 reduced ghg emissions and 2 reduced market distortions from the taxes on desirable behavior in the early 1990s some economists suggested that the doubledividend effect would be strong enough to keep the overall costs to society relatively small or even negative80 however more recent economic studies indicate that the costs imposed by the capandtrade program could act as an additional tax81 which would most likely at least in the united states82 exceed the benefits of revenue recycling several economic studies have estimated the cost savings to society that auction revenues could provide83 capandtrade program is expected to impose an 77 section 3901 reported may 20 2008 78 in addition note that s 2191 would not provide allowances directly to the coal industry although petroleum producersimporters would receive small percentage 2 79 the rationale for this policy is that taxes on desirable activities create market distortions discouraging increased levels of desirable actions assuming the same amount of revenue could be collected economic policy would favor placing the tax on activity that is generally considered undesirable further discussion is beyond

the range of potential cost savings reflects different uses of the auction revenues if policymakers were to distribute the revenues to us households in lumpsum payments eg increase the standard tax deduction or mail payments to households the cost savings would be on the lower end of the spectrum alternatively if congress decided to use the revenues to reduce taxes on labor or investment

simulated capandtrade program with 22 emission reduction between 2000 and 2080 crs22 an actual expense eg installing more efficient technology or switching to more expensive but less carbonintensive fuels covered sources have demonstrated this behavior in two capandtrade programs in which the vast majority of allowances was provided at cost the european unions emission trading system euets and the us sulfur dioxide emissions trading program86 because of cost passthrough consumers particularly households are ultimately expected to bear the majority of the costs associated with capandtrade program figure 5 illustrates the relative distribution of costs to different groups in capand trade program87 the figure is based on capandtrade scenario that would auction 100 of the emission allowances to fossil fuel producers often referred to as upstream sources households and businesses experience the vast majority 89 of the costs moreover the household percentage is potentially understated because many businesses would likely pass through some of their increased energyelectricity costs in the form of higher prices for their goods and services88 figure 5 relative distribution

the national commission on energy policy allocating allowances in greenhouse gas trading system 2007 note the percentages above do not account for any offsetting income from allowance allocation the figure illustrates the relative distributions that would occur if allowances were auctioned to fossil fuel producers upstream without recycling the revenues 86 congressional budget office tradeoffs in allocating allowances for co2 emissions 2007 economic and budget issue brief 87 this figure is based on national commission on energy policy ncep proposal that would lead to relatively modest reduction in ghg emissions compared to those required under current proposals in the 110th congress thus this figure is illustrative and only useful for comparing relative differences 88 national commission on energy policy allocating allowances in greenhouse gas trading system 2007 crs23 the figure is instructive for the allocation debate because it shows starting point for cost distribution however the cost percentages depicted in figure 5 do not account for distribution of auction revenues in real capandtrade system that employs an auction auction revenues would be used to support specific objectives or allotted to various parties distribution to support specific objectives policymakers may also consider distributing percentage of the allowances or auction revenues to support range of objectives including technology development promotion of emission mitigation technology is widely recognized as vital step towards making substantial ghg emission reductions89 s 2191 would distribute the majority of its auction revenues approximately 52 to promote energyrelated technologies lowcarbon energy sources carbon capture and storage ccs90 and cellulosic biofuels energy efficiency improvements in energy efficiency could make considerable contributions in achieving ghg emission reductions although energy efficiency may involve technology advancements new technologies must be used in order to realize the efficiency gains in some cases parties may need incentives beyond the efficiency gains to induce behavioral changes for example allowance value could be distributed to support efficiency gains at places residences commercial buildings that are unlikely to be covered by an emissions cap biological sequestration trees plants and soils sequester carbon removing it from the earths atmosphere allowance values could be allotted to provide financial incentives for landowners to engage in activity eg conservation tillage reforestation that would increase sequestration on their land although some of these actions may qualify as offsets if allowed in capandtrade program some activities may need additional incentives or be unable to satisfy the offset approval process91 adaptation efforts some level of global warming and associated effects will occur regardless of emission reduction efforts taken today because previous and current ghg emissions will have long term climate impacts therefore some contend that investment eg allowance value should focus on preparing communities to adapt to the effects of changing climate 89 see eg cbo evaluating the role of prices and rd in reducing carbon dioxide emissions 2006 90 see crs report rl33801 carbon capture and sequestration ccs by peter folger 91 see crs report rl34436 the role of offsets in greenhouse gas emissions capandtrade program potential benefits and concerns by jonathan l ramseur crs24 deficit reduction another proposal for the use of allowances or auction revenue is to address budget deficit that may result from capandtrade program portion of the allowances or auction proceeds could be set aside to offset projected revenue shortfalls this option is sometimes described as making the program revenueneutral in addition congress may consider using allowance value to offset shortfalls beyond those that are related to the capandtrade program policy considerations the distribution of allowance value would present policymakers with series of tradeoffs the primary options for applying the allowance value involve 1 minimizing the overall costs of the capandtrade program imposed on society 2 alleviating the disproportionate costs borne by subgroups in society and 3 providing funding to support other policy objectives such as technological development intertwined among these options is tradeoff between regressive or progressive impacts reduce costs alleviate burdens or promote technology economic studies indicate that using auction revenues ie revenue recycling to offset reductions in distortionary taxes labor income would be the most efficient use of the revenues and yield the greatest benefit to society as whole these studies show that if the revenues are used for other purposes economic efficiency would suffer and the overall cost of the program would be higher figure 492 the opportunity to substantially lower overall costs is unique attribute of the auction allocation strategy some argue that using auction revenues to offset tax reductions is an unlikely outcome93 in general when the government obtains new revenue it tends to fund new or existing programs rather than reduce existing taxes94 indeed none of the capandtrade bills in the 110th congress has proposed to use revenues in this manner95 moreover the most efficient manner of revenue recycling would generally spread the cost reductions throughout the economy while certain groups would be expected to bear disproportionate percentage of the costs of capandtrade program in particular industries that cannot pass along their increased costs for 92 however if additional funding for technology advancement leads to faster development of lowcarbon technologies the cost of the program may decrease discussed below 93 robert w hahn greenhouse gas auctions and taxes some practical considerations 2008 aei center for regulatory and market studies robert stavins us capand trade system to address global climate change 2007 the hamilton project brookings institution 94 ibid citing gary becker and casey mulligan deadweight costs and the size of the government 2003 journal of law and economics 462 95 another obstacle to this approach may concern congressional committee jurisdiction issues capandtrade proposal that would restructure elements of the tax code may overlap with multiple committee jurisdictions crs25 competitive reasons or otherwise would face higher costs compared to other economic sectors ultimately consumers are expected to absorb the vast majority of the program costs as discussed above policymakers may consider compensating through free allowances or auction revenues specific industries andor providing assistance to households that would face higher energy eg electricity and gasoline prices such compensation would forgo the opportunity to reduce the overall cost of the emission program using allowance value for other purposes eg technology development would impart tradeoff while such allotments would limit the allowances available for the purposes described above reduced overall costs or relief for disproportionate impacts new technologies in particular could have considerable impact on the costs of an emissions reduction program this is particularly the case if technologies can be commercialized ahead of their projected schedules96 or if unanticipated low or zerocarbon alternatives can be developed the amount of funding allotted to technology development under s 2191 would represent substantial increase compared to current federal funding for emission reduction and lowcarbon technologies although allocating allowance value to technological development could yield considerable gain the return in terms of additional investment to promote technology improvements remains uncertain97 in recent study the author found while academics have extensively studied how revenues from auctions can be used to make the tax system more efficient they have not done much research on examining the impact of using such revenues for retiring debt or increasing government investment in short if allowance value is used to increase funding to existing programs or provide funding for new programs the return on investment is uncertain for example some programs may be operating at full capacity and additional funding may not provide comparable impacts moreover the marketplace already provides incentive for technological change and capandtrade program would increase the incentive to develop lowcarbon or zerocarbon energy alternatives regressive or progressive economic effects another tradeoff for policymakers is whether the emission allocation strategy would produce regressive or progressive economic results98 the congressional budget office cbo analyzed the distributional effects of capandtrade program under four different scenarios 96 for example the cost models for s 2191 make assumptions about the availability of ccs when this technology actually goes online it will likely have substantial impact on the cost of capandtrade program 97 for more discussion of recent modeling results regarding technological development see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and benefits of s 2191 by larry parker and brent yacobucci 98 analogous to regressive tax policy regressive allocation strategy would disproportionately impact lower income households in contrast in progressive distribution scheme the ratio of cost to income would increase as income rises crs26 allowances auctioned and auction revenues distributed to households in lumpsum payment allowances provided to covered sources at cost allowances auctioned and revenues are used to cut corporate income taxes and allowances auctioned and revenues used to cut payroll income taxes the results are presented in figure 6 as the figure indicates an auction that distributed the revenues to households in lumpsum payment would yield the most progressive results in contrast the most regressive result occurs when allowances are provided to covered sources at cost the two other options that would cut tax rates would also produce regressive results however these two strategies would substantially lower the overall cost of the capandtrade program result not captured by figure 6 figure 6 comparison of aftertax household income

on ghg emissions from the emission sources covered by the program capandtrade programs can vary by the sources covered the covered sources are likely to include major emitting sectors eg power plants and carbonintensive industries fuel producersprocessors eg coal mines or petroleum refineries or some combination of both the emissions cap is partitioned into emission allowances typically one emission allowance represents the authority to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxideequivalent tco2e the equivalent is necessary because ghgs other than co2 methane nitrous oxide sulfur hexafluoride hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons vary in their global warming potential gwp99 thus ghg emissions are presented in standard form of measure co2e in general policymakers may decide to distribute the emission allowances to covered entities at cost based on for example previous years emissions sell the allowances through an auction or use some combination of these strategies this report examines issues associated with these allocation options covered entities that face relatively low emissionreduction costs would have an incentive to make reductions beyond what is required because these further reductions could be sold ie traded as emission credits to entities that face higher emissionreduction costs other mechanisms such as banking or offsets may be included to increase the flexibility of the program at the end of each established compliance period eg calendar year covered sources would be required to surrender emission allowances to cover the number of tons emitted if source did not have enough allowances to cover its emissions the source would be subject to penalties for more information see us environmental protection agency epa office of air and radiation tools
