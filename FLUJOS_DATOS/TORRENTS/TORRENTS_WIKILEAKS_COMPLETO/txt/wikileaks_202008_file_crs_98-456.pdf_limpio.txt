the legislative branch of th federal government the court said that federal court was not department or agency within the meaning of section 1001 and the statute therefore did not apply to false statemen ts made in judicial proceedings3 the court argued that common sense ordinary reading of the text of section 1001 did not define ag ency to include courts4 while the court did not directly address the question of whet her section 1001 still applied to congress in holding that section 1001 did not apply to the courts hubbard was interpreted by majority of the courts as holding that section 1001 covere d only the executive branch leaving congress outside its scope5 few years prior to hubbard the federal court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit had held th at the obstruction of justi ce statute 18 usc 1505 could not be used to punish lying to congressional committee 6 one of the primary charges in united states v poindexter was that poindexter violated 18 usc 1505 section 1505 forbids anyone from corruptly obstructin g or influencing t he due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which an inquiry is being had by congressional committee the court in poindexter held that the statutes language punishing anyone who corruptly endeavors to influence judicial or congressional proceeding was unconstitutionally vague the language failed the court said to give notice to poindexter that it was criminal to lie deliberately or present false and misleading evidence rather than to induce others to lie or mislead in order to obstruct or influence such proceedings the amendment in section 3 of pl 104292 regarding the prohibition on obstructing congress was designed to address this issue congress swiftly reacted to the hubbard decision bills were introduced in both chambers during the second session of the 104th congress to restore section 1001s scope to its pre hubbard dimension thereby making material false statements made to the judicial and legislative branches prosecutable7 in may 1995 representative martini introduced hr 1678 which applied section 1001 to all three branches of the federal government without exception at hearing on the bill witnesses expressed concern that the broad application of section 1001 to ll three branches would chill advocacy in judicial proceedings and also undermine the factfinding pro cess that is indispensable to the legislative process in response to th concerns representative martini introduced hr 3166 on march 27 1996 which included judicial function exception exempting from the scope of section 1001 those representa tions made by party or partys counsel to judge during judicial proceeding representative mccollum chairman of the subcommittee on crime offered an amendment

september 27 1996 the senate agreed to the bill as modified it was signed by the president and became public law 104 292 on october 11 1996 the government accountability act of 1996 pl 104292 pplies section 1001 to all three branches of the federal govern ment with two exceptions 1 it does not apply with respect to statements representations writings or documents submitted to judge or magistrate by party or th at partys counsel in judici proceeding and 2 it shall apply to the legislative branch only with respect to administrative matters or any congressional investigation or review conducted and consis tent with house or senate rules the purpose of this exception is to avoid creating an atmo sphere which might so discourage the submission of information to congress that it undermined the factfinding process which is indispensable to the legislative process sectionbysection analysis of p l 104292 the act contains several sections section 1 provides that the short title is the false statements accountability act of 1996 section 2 amends subsection 1001a of title 18 of the united states code to specify its applicability to the executive legislative and judicial branches of the government prohibiting anyone from knowingly and willfu lly making misrepresentations to the government this section covers offenses that fall into three general categories 1 falsification concealment or other coverup of material fact by any trick scheme or device 2 the making of any false fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations and 3 the making or use of any writin g or document with knowledge that such document contains false statements it also provides for the restora tion of false statement penalties by applying the cr iminal penalties of section 1001 to persons who knowingly and willfully make misrepresentations to all three branches of the federal government8 section 2 subsection 1001b provides that th provisions with respect to subsection do not apply to party to judicial proceeding or that partys counsel for statements representations writings or documents submitte d by such party or counsel to judge or magistrate in that proceeding subsection 1001c

at 5 12supra at 4 13former national security advisor john poi ndexter was charged with five felonies including one count of conspiring with former white house aide oliver l north and others to conceal the national security councils irancontra activ ities from congress and four substantive counts of obstruction and false stat ements the convictions were overturned on appeal united states v poindexter 951 f2d 369 dc cir 1991this exception is intended to codify the judicial function exception which has long been recognized by many federal courts as necessary to safeguard from the threat of prosecution statements made in th course of adversarial litigation allowing the criminal penalties of section 1001 to apply to statements made in the course of adversarial litigation would chill vigor ous advocacy thereby undermining the adversarial process the exception is c onsistent with the courts reasoning in bramblett and morgan and subsequent case law which consistently distinguished the adjudicative from the administrative f unctions of the court exempting from section 1001 only those communications made to the court when it is acting in its adjudicative or judicial capacity nd leaving subject to section 1001 those representations made to the court when it is functioning in its administrative capacity thus false statements uttered during the c ourse of court proceedings or contained in court pleadings would not be covered by section 10019 relative to exception c representative mccollum stated the legislative function exception limits section 1001s application in legislative context to administrative matters and to any investigation or review that is conducted pursuant to the authority of committee subcommittee commission or office of congress consistent with applicable rules i think it is important to note that the term review as used here refers to an action that is ordinarily initiated by the chairman of committee subcommittee office or commission consistent with the performance of their oversight or enforc ement activities investigation or review is not intended to include routine fact gathering or miscellaneous inquiries by committee or personal staff10 as amended section 1001 will have application to co mmunications to congress which includes all forms of stimony and most correspondence11 information which is neither furnished as part of an administrative filing nor furnished pursuant to duly authorized congressional investigation is not subject to the criminal penalties of section 100112 section 3 amends section 1515 of title 18 ited states code and it responds to the federal court of appeals for the di strict of columbia decision in united states v poindexter13 by clarifying that person actin g alone may obstruc t congressional committee inquiry the court dismissed two c ounts charging poindexter with obstruction on the ground that the word corruptly in 18 usc 1505 did not give poindexter fair notice that it would be illegal to lie to the committees for the purpose of obstructing their investigations the statute could be said to proscribe more than inducing another to lie to congressional committee the amendment inserted in section 3b states as usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98456crs5 14supra note 10 at h11138 15suprain section 1505 the term corruptly means acting with an improper purpose personally or by influencing another including ma king false or misleading statement or withholding concealing alteri ng or destroying documen t or other information section 4 enforcing sena subpoena amends secti
