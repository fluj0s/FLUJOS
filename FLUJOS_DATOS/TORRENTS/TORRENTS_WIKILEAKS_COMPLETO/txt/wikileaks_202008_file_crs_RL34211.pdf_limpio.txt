the internet tax moratorium the moratorium prohibits 1 new taxes on internet access services and 2 multiple or discriminatory taxes on internet commerce congress has extended the internet tax moratorium twice the most recent extension expires november 1 2014 the moratorium is distinct from the remote use tax collection issue but has been linked in past debateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34211 order code rl34211 state and local taxes and the streamlined sales and use tax agreement updated september 16 2008 steven maguire specialist in public finance government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34211state and local taxes and the streamlined sales and use tax agreement summary state sales and use taxes are consumption taxes that are levied according to the destination principle the destination principle prescrib that taxes should be paid where the consumption takes place sales tax that is collected by vendors at the point of sale implicitly assumes cons umption takes place near the point of transaction use taxes in contrast are levied on products consumers purchase from outofstate vendors usually over the telephone or internet the rate of tax is based on the destination principle in this case the delivery address sales and use taxes are almost always the same rate in given jurisdiction under current law states cannot reach beyond their borders and compel outof state vendors without nexus in the buyers stat to collect the use tax owed by state residents the supreme court has ruled th at requiring remote vendors to collect the use tax would pose an undue burden on inters tate commerce states are concerned because they anticipate gradually losing more sales tax revenue as the growth of internet commerce allows more resident s to buy products from vendors located out ofstate and evade use taxes estimates put this loss at approximately 8 billion in 2003 congress is involved because inters tate commerce typically falls under the commerce clause and in some cases due process clause of the constitution new congressional action on the remote collection issue is uncertain opponents of remote vendor use tax collection cite the complexity of the myriad state and local sales tax systems and the difficu lty vendors would have in collecting and remitting use taxes proponents would like congress to change the law and allow states to require outofstate vendors without nexus to coll ect state use taxes these proponents acknowledge that s implification and harmonizati on of state tax systems are likely prerequisites for congress to c onsider approval of increased collection authority for states number of states have been working together to harmonize sales tax collection and have created the streamlined sales and use

derive 115 of thei r tax revenue appr oximately 55 billion in fy2006 from local sales and use taxes1 both state and local sales taxes are usually collected by vendors at the point of transaction and levied at percentage of products retail price altern atively use taxes typically levied at the same rate are often not collected by the vendor if the vendor does not have ne xus loosely defined as physical presence in the consumers state consumers are required to remit use taxes to their taxing jurisdiction comp liance with this requirement however is quite low state and local governments are concer ned that the expansion of internet commerce the census bureau of the department of commerce estimated that internet commerce jumped 95 from th second quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2008 will gradua lly erode their tax base2 this concern arises in part because the us supreme court ruled outo fstate vendors are not required to collect sales taxes for states in which th ey the vendors do not have nexus3 in hopes of stemming the potential loss of tax revenue several states are participating in an initiative to simplify and coordinate their tax codes called the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ssuta the mber states hope that congress could be persuaded to allow them to require outofs tate vendors to collect taxes from resident customers congress has role in this issue because interstate commerce in most cases falls under the commerce clause of the constitution4 congress will likely be asked to choose between taking either an active or passive role in the

intends to clarify si gnificant issues in the remote sales tax collection debate beginning w ith description of state nd local sales and use taxes state and local sales and use taxes in 1932 mississippi was the first state to impose general state sales tax5 during the remainder of the 1930s an era characterized by declining revenue from corporate and individual income taxes 23 other states followed suit and implemented general sales tax6 at the time the sales tax was relatively easy to administer and raised significant amount of revenue despite relatively low rate7 given the relative success of the sales tax in raising revenue 45 states and the district of columbia added the sa tax to their tax infrastruct ure by the late 1960s the last of the 45 states to enact general sales and use tax was vermont in 19698 components of the sales and use tax the revenue generated by sales nd use tax assuming given level of compliance depends on the base of the ta x and the tax rate the narrower the base the higher the rate required to raise an quivalent amount of re venue states often have similar consumption items included in their tax base but they are far from uniform tax rates can also vary considerably pending on the states reliance on other revenue sources tax base the sales tax which is consider ed consumption tax is perhaps better identified as transaction tax on

mikesell tom neubig and andrew philips sales taxation of business inputs council on state taxation special report jan 25 2005businesstobusiness transactions are often exempt from the retail sales tax particularly in cases where the purchaser is using the good as an input to production these transactions are exempt because incl uding the transactions could lead to the pyramiding of the sales tax for example if coffee shop were to pay retail sales tax on the purchase of coffee and then impose retail sales tax on coffee brewed for the final consumer the total sales tax paid for the cup of coffee would likely exceed the statutory rate products that busin ess purchases for resale are typically not assessed retail sale s tax for similar reason if coffee shop buys beans only for resale levying sales tax on the wholesale purchase of the beans and then on the retail sale would more than double the statut ory rate the tax tr eatment of business purchases is not uniform across states according to some estimates approximately 18 of business purchases are taxable depending on the state11 many individuals and organizations ar also exempt from state sales taxes entities wishing to claim the sales tax exemption are often issued certificate indicating their taxfree status and are required to present this certification at the point of transaction nonprofit organi zations such as those whose mission is religious charitable educa tional or promoting public health often hold sales tax exempt status the ssuta would establish system where states would use common definitions for goods and services once uniform definition is established states would then indicate whether the good or servi ce is taxable in addition states would identify which entities would be exempt fro m paying sales taxe s eg nonprofit or religious organizations tax rate the second component of sales ta x is the tax rate applied to the base described in the prev ious section in 35 states local governments piggyback local sales tax which often varies among localities within the state on the state sales tax 10 states and the district of columbia levy single rate see table 2 with local taxes some states in the group of 35 may collect uniform local tax along with the state tax and send the local revenue share back to the localities this structure would look like single rate to the consumer because vendors typically do not differentiate between the state and local share for example vendors in virginia levy 50 sales tax on purchas and remit the entire amount to the state the state then sends what would have been raised by 10 tax back to the local jurisdiction where the tax was collected the state of virginia keeps the remaining 40 indiana mississippi new jersey rhode island and

against the vendor tax even though gross receipts taxes have more in common with traditional business taxes the bureau of the census has traditionallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34211crs8 13 the bureau of the census also collects data on excise taxes and selective sales we do not report these receipts because they are typica lly collected at the wholesale level not at the point of retail transaction for example th gasoline excise tax is typically paid by the carrier tanker truck at the point of collecti on the end of the pipeline not at retail sale 14 under gross receipts tax grt vendor remits designated percentage eg 5 in new mexico of monthly gross receipts or sale s revenue to the state gross receipts tax is different from the sales tax because the ve ndor not the purchaser is legally responsible for paying the tax under the sa tax the vendor acts as the collection agent for the taxing jurisdiction and is not technically paying the tax the buyer is paying the tax 15 equity has both horizontal and vertical co mponents tax is defined as horizontally continuedcombined them with general sales taxes13 depending on the state law and the vendor revenue generated by internet transactions with outofstate purchasers may or may not fall under the gross receipts tax14 state and local governments in arkansas louisiana south dakota tenne ssee and washington rely on sales tax revenue for over 40 of total tax revenue economic issues during the debate about so called streamlining legi slation there are several economic issues congress may consider 1 how will the ssuta influence the economic efficiency and equity of state tax systems 2 what will be the impact of changes in the treatment of internet transactions on states that are more reliant on the sales tax 3 what will the potential revenue loss be absent changes in the treatment of internet transactions summary of these issues follows efficiency commonly held view among ec onomists is that good tax or more precisely an efficient tax minimizes distortions in consumer behavior broadly speaking economists maintain that individuals should make the same choices before and after ta x is imposed the greater the distortions in behavior caused by tax the greater the economic welfare loss sales tax levied on all consumer expenditures equally would satisfy this definiti on of efficiency as noted earlier however under the current stat sales tax system all consumption expenditures are not treated equally the growth of taxfree internet transactions both businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer will likely amplify the efficiency losses from alte red consumer behavior an alternative theory concerning economic efficiency in sales taxation is referred to as optimal comm odity taxation under an optimal commodity tax the tax rate is based on or determined by what is termed the price elasticity of demand for the product sometimes ca lled the ramsey rule products that are price inelastic meaning quantity demanded is unresponsive to changes in price should be levied higher rate of tax in contrast products that are price elastic should have lower rate of tax if products purchased over the internet are relatively more price elastic then the lower tax rate created by effectively taxfree internet transactions may improve economic efficiency as behavioral changes are reduced however the price elasticity of products av ailable over the internet is difficult to measure and the efficiency gain if any is suspected to be small15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34211crs9 15 continued equitable if people of equal circumstances pay equal taxes tax is defined as vertically equitable if people with greater ability to pay carry greater tax burden than those less able to pay an optimal commodity tax woul d likely violate accepted principles of vertical equity 16 dennis zimmerman the internet sales tax debate sorting through the economic issues paper prepared for the 94th annual conference national tax association baltimore md nov 810 2001 17 the pretax absolute price difference betw een the two retailers is unimportant the internet price inclusive of shipping could actu ally be lower before taxes the application of the use tax makes the local retailers product relatively more expensive regardless of what the prices were before taxes 18 shipping costs can be thought of as cost of production the local retailer probably also paid shipping costs to have the product on the shelf those costs are included in the price of the good because the local retailer likely bought in bulk the shipping cost per unit would be considerably lower than the internet retaileran additional economic inefficiency aris if vendors change location to avoid collecting sales taxes the location change would likely result in higher transportation costs in the long run it is conceivable that the higher transportation costs would erode the advant age of evading the sales tax16 for example consider virginia consumer who wants to buy set of woodworking chisels the local virgin ia hardware store sells the set for 50 including profit an internet savvy hardware store in georgia is willing to sell the same chisel set for 52 inclusive of profit nd shipping costs so before taxes the local retailer could offer the chisels at lower price the marginal customer who is indifferent between the two re tailers before taxes even though the internet is more expensive it is more convenient is theref ore just as likely to buy from the internet retailer as from the local retailer17 virginia imposes state and local sales tax of 50 thus yielding final sales price to the consumer of 5250 given the hi gher relative price inclusive of the tax the marginal consumer along with many other consumers would likely switch to buying chisels from the georgiabased internet retailer assuming these consumers do not feel compelled to pay the required vi rginia use tax on the internet purchase the diversion from retail to the internet in response to the noncollection of the use tax represents loss in economic efficien cy the additional 2 in production costs 52 less 50 represents the efficiency loss to society from evading the use tax18 note that if in the absence of sales nd use taxes the internet vendor in the above example may yield to market for ces and close up shop however if the internet vendor continues to operate even without the tax advantage it could be the case that consumers are willing to pay high er prices for the convenience of internet shopping if this were true then the hi gher production costs for internet vendors would not necessarily result in an efficiency losshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34211crs10 19 regressive tax collects smaller percentage of income as income increases economists will usually avoid normative questions of what is equitable because such statement implies an interpersonal comparison of utility 20 goolsbee and zittrain 1999 found that the average internet user had on average two more years of education and 22000 more in family income than noninternet users 21 in addition those three states were well above the average state tax rate in the united states of just over 53 of th 45 states with state sales ta x and the district of columbia the state tax rates for those three states we re as follows washington 65 florida 6 and tennessee 7equity the sales tax is often criticized as regressive tax tax that disproportionately burdens the poor19 assuming internet shoppers are relatively better off and do not remit use taxes as prescribed by state law they can avoid paying tax on larger portion of their consumpti on expenditures than those without internet access at home or work20 consumers without ready in ternet access are not afforded the same opportunity to evade the sales and use tax in this way electronic commerce may arguably exacerbate the regressiveness of the sales tax at least in the short run as computers and access to the internet become more readily available the potential inequity arising from this aspect of the digital divide could diminish equity issues also arise with respect to businesses currently local retailers are required to collect sales taxes for the state at the point of sale internet retailers in contrast are not faced with the administrative burden thus two otherwise equal retailers face different state and local tax burdens in relatively high tax rate states this disparity may be significant as not ed above consumers in these high tax rate states have greater incentive to purch ase from outofstate vendors exacerbating the tax burden differential differential effect among states the growth of internetbased commerce will have the greatest effect on the states most reliant on the sales and use tax in addition to having more revenue at risk high reliance states also face greater efficiency losses because of their generally higher state tax rates as noted earlier higher rates drive larger wedge between the retail price inclusive of the sales tax and the internet price and thus exacerbate the efficiency loss from the sales tax states with low rates and less reliance would tend to have smaller wedge between the two modes of transaction states with both high rate and high reliance would tend to recognize the greatest revenue ss from ban on the taxation of internet transactions based upon crs calculations of state and local sales tax revenue as portion of total tax revenue the state and local g overnments of arkansas louisiana south dakota tennessee and washington are the most reliant on the sales and use tax21 in those states over 40 of total tax revenue is derived from the sales tax this result is not surprising south dakota washington and

commerce the streamlined sales and use tax agreement the entity that drafted the original streamline sales and use tax agreement ssuta the streamlined sales and use tax project sstp was created in 2000 by 43 states and the district of columbia these states and the district of columbia wanted to simplify and better synchronize individual state sa and use tax laws its stated goal was to create simplified sale s tax system so all types of vendors from traditional retailers to thos conducting trade over the internet could easily collect and remit sales taxes the member states believe that simplified relatively uniform tax code across states would make it easier for remote ve ndors to collect sales taxes on goods sold to outofstate customers the sstp was dissolved once the ssuta became effective on october 1 200525 the latest amendments to the ssuta were approved june 18 2008 the following is br ief description of the agreement as of this writing description of the ssuta under the ssuta member states request that remote sellers voluntarily collect sales taxes on items purchased by custom ers outside their home state vendors in participating states who voluntarily collect the sales tax would be offered amnesty for previously uncollected taxes participating states have agreed to share thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34211crs12 26 for more information see h ttp wwwstream

sellers the states obligations under the ssuta incl ude the following requirements26 standard definitions of products states participating in the ssuta must define all goods in the same way27 for example in many states food is exempt from taxation whereas candy is taxable co mmon definition of candy or food must be agreed upon to implement streamlined sale s tax regime each state retains the choice over whether or not the item is taxable local governments in state must use the same tax base and definitions simplified tax rates in many states local jurisdictions tax goods at different rates this complication is mo stly remedied under the ssuta as each state will be permitted only one stat tax rate with an exception for second state rate on food and drugs28 each state can add one additiona l local jurisdiction rate based on zip code29 the member state must maintain catalogue of rates for all zip codes for zip codes with multiple rates an average rate for that zip code would apply standard rate sourcing rules for crossjurisdictional sales sourcing rules have not yet been finaliz ed under ssuta it has been proposed that for sales within member state between local jurisdictions the vendor would collect the sales tax at the rate applicable for the vendor location this is identified as origin sourcing for sales into mber state from an outofstate vendor the vendor levies tax at the agreed upon statew ide rate applicable in the destination state this is identified as destination sourcing there is some debate about the sourci ng aspect of the ssuta the single statewide rate which is set by each member state would be combined state and local rate if the combined statewide rate is the state rate plus an average of local rates it is possible that some consumers will pay higher combined tax rate than is required it has been proposed that the mber states would be required to include provision in the implementing legisla tion that would allow consumers that overpay to receive credit for overpayments simplified administration businesses will longer file tax returns with each state and sometimes local government wh ere they conduct business as is often the case where the ssuta has not gone into effect30 instead sales taxes will be remitted to single state agency thus states will bear some of the administrative cost of the technology

the support of the national governors associ ation nga the nga has endorsed the ssuta with hopes that the agreement will address the s upreme courts concerns about the burden on interstate commerce of collecting remote taxes the association believes that requiring remote ve ndors to collect sales and use taxes under new simplified system will survive legal challenges th official st atement of the nga follows governors call on the federal government to enact legislation to require remote vendors to collect sales and use taxes on sales of taxable products destined for each state adhering to the agreement31 the nga support is shared by other stat and local government organizations including the national conference of stat legislatures ncsl the federation of tax administrators fta and the multistate tax commission mtc support also comes from large retailers w ho must collect sale s taxes and believe the current system provides an unfair adva ntage to internet retailers who do not collect such taxes many large brickandmortar companies with strong internet presence generally comply with guide lines like those under ssuta and generally collect taxes on remote sales several

simplification and increased vendor compensation from the st ates for collecting state sales taxes opponents of ssuta legisla tion include state and local governments who feel the administrative obstacles to streamlined sales taxes are too costly to overcome and may actually exceed the potential revenue gain these governments suggest that increased compliance with use tax laws may better be achieved through elevated consumer awareness and more forcement activities in additi on some business groups maintain that the collection require ment even with streamlining would still be too burdensome also opposing the ssuta are several antitax groups who see the ssuta as new tax burden rather than simplif ication of the current tax system32 antitax groups also argue that stat compete to attract busin esses and customers through lower tax rates and that this competition is good for consumers ssuta legislation in the 110th congress in the 110th congress s 34 senator enzi and the
