from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to michael mann mannvirginiaedu subject re reconstruction errors date fri aug 1 142435 2003 thanks very much for helping out with this mike rest assured that the data wont be passed on to anyone else ill let you know if i use them to compute uncertainties at different time scales cheers tim at 1618 31072003 you wrote tim attached are the calibration residual series for experiments based on available networks back to ad 1000 ad 1400 ad 1600 i cant find the one for the network back to 1820 but basically youll see that the residuals are pretty red for the first 2 cases and then not significantly red for the 3rd caseits even bit better for the ad 1700 and 1820 cases but i cant seem to dig them up in any case the incremental changes are modest after 1600its pretty clear that key predictors drop out before ad 1600 hence the redness of the residuals and the notably larger uncertainties farther back you only want to look at the first column year and second column residual of the files i cant even remember what the other columns are let know if that helps thanks mike ps i know i probably dont need to mention this but just to insure absolutely clarify on this im providing these for your own personal use since youre trusted colleague so please dont pass this along to others without checking w first this is the sort of dirty laundry one doesnt want to fall into the hands of those who might potentially try to distort things
