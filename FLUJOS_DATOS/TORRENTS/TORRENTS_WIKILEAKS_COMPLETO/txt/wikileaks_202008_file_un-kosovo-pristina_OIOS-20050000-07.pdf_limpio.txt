with the company on 29 august 2002 12 on 4 september 2002 further single source co ntract was signed by the kta divisional manager for the supply of an additional container this appears to have resulted from direct request from kfor signe d by the kfor official of air movements dated 3 september 2002 which is attache d to the justification for the single source contract 13 the tender file does not contain either justi fication memorandum or financial approval documents for the main contract and those documents have not been locate by the itf v conclusions 14 competitive tender appears to have been corre ctly held for the main contract and the addition of the single source contract to dd further container appears to be justified however there is an absence of pr oper records detailing events that gave rise to the competitive tender together with an absence of documents confirming that financial approval was sought 15 both the contracts and the justification for th single source contract appear to have been signed by the kta divisional manager 3 16 in the absence of further documents it is not p ossible to indicate whether or not there were irregularities in the financial approval procedure vi recommendations 17 it is recommended that unmik refer this matter to the dsrsg of pillar iv for any action deemed appropriate with regard to the manage ment of contract
