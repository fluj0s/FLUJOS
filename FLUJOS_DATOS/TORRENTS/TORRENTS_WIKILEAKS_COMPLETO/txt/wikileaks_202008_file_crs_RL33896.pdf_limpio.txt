unaccompanied alien children uac are aliens under the age of 18 who come to the united states without authorization or overstay their visa and are without parent or legal guardian most arrive at us ports of entry or are apprehended along the border with mexico with the passage of the homeland security act of 2002 h sa uac tasking was split between the newly created department of homeland security dhs and the department of health and human services office of refugee removal orr dhs was delegated the task of apprehension transfer and repatriation of uac while orr wa s tasked to provide longterm detention and foster placement the issue for congress concerns whether the current system provides adequate protections for unaccompanied alien children the debate over uac policy has polarized in recent years between two camps child welfare advocates arguing that the uac are largely akin to refugees by being victims of abuse and economic circumstances and immigration security advocates charging that unauthorized immigration is associated with increased community violence and illicit activities consequently these two camps advocate very different policies for the treatment of uac this polarization is to some degree reflected in the tension between dhs and orr which despite attempts and congressional urging have failed to produce memorandum of understanding between the two agencies in fy2007 dhs detained 8227 uac of these uac 76 of uac were male and 24 female with 85 being between the ages of 14 and 18 and the remaining 15 being ages 0 to 13 years old three countriesguatemala honduras and salvadoraccounted for 85 of the uac detained in orr custody in 1996 an agreement known as the flores sett lement agreement fsa was reached between the government and human rights organizations that governs policy for the processing detention and release of juveniles despite the implementation of the fsa advocacy groups have charged that dhs has failed to comply fully with the settlement terms among the concerns raised by these groups are allegations of deliberate misclassifications of uac as accompanied inaccurate age determination techniques the use of uac as bait for apprehending unauthorized alien family members and unsafe repatriation practices congress has also expressed concerns over several of these issues as an outgrowth of the debates regarding the treatment of uac child welfare advocates have contended that legal representation for uac would prevent potential maltreatment and be in the best interests of the child security advocates argue that aliens should not be granted legal representation in civil proceedings at the governments expense because it would drain valuable resources from the judicial system additionally since the division of responsibility for handling uac was divided between dhs and orr custodial disputes have occasionally surfaced this report will be updated as warranted

visa and are without parent or legal guardian they often arrive at united states ports of entry or are apprehended along the southwestern border with mexico less frequently they are apprehended in the interior usually on suspicion of illicit activity and determined to be juvenile and unaccompanied generally immigration authorities have apprehended more than 80000 juveniles both accompanied and unaccompanied annually several thousand of whom are usually detained as uac the majority of these children are aged 14 or older although number of them are youngersome as young as infants although individual circumstances dictate each juveniles case the motivations of economic need persecution or family unification have all been cited as the reason for uac coming to the united states 1 detained uac largely stem from less economically developed countries such as salvador honduras and guatemala2 frequently families will save up money to pay for child to travel to the united states to find work3 us wages and economic conditions generally offer better opportunities than the economy of the childs home country4 in some uac cases children come to the united states attempting to flee the violence or natural disasters they are subjected to in their home countries5 other uac cases may stem from parents or other family members who have settled in the united states and have sent for child to be transported from the home country in these latter cases the parent or sibling sometimes entered the united states and established employment as an unauthorized immigrant6 thus it is not uncommon for children categorized as uac to actually have family living in the united states7 the debate over uac policy has polarized in recent years between two camps child welfare advocates and immigration security advocates the former group has for decades advocated more refugeeoriented policy toward uac arguing that the uac are largely victims of trafficking abuse and economic circumstances security advocates by contrast advocate more restrictive policy of deportation and repatriation charging that unauthorized immigration is associated with increased community violence nd illicit activities such as gang memberships 1 jacqueline bhabha and susan schmidt seeking asylum alone unaccompanied and separated children and refugee protection in the us the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation

1980s allegations of mistreatment of uac by the former immigration and naturalization service ins resulted in series of lawsuits against the government these lawsuits culminated with the supreme court case of reno v flores which has become the guiding case law for government agencies handli ng of uac although the court ruled in favor of the inss uac policy settlement agreement was drafted between the parties known as the flores settlement agreement fsa this document spelled out specific guidelines for the detainment release and repatriation of uac by the ins the fsa remains the guiding document regarding the treatment of uac for both the department of homeland security dhs and the department of health and human services hhs office of refugee resettlement orr which are the two agencies currently involved in handling uac the implementation of the flores settlement agreement stems from the us supreme courts judgment in reno v flores 8 the case was brought by human rights advocacy organizations against the ins charging that the release policy and conditions of detention violated the legal rights of alien juveniles in 1993 the supreme court ruled that the ins release policy was reasonable as were the conditions of detention 9 yet three years later the plaintiffs in flores negotiated settlement agreement with the ins on the processing detention and release of juveniles the language of the agreement became the basis on which some of the new regulations were drafted10 the agreement also provided procedural instructions to field officers for implementing the new policies11 for several years following the fsa criticism continued over whether the ins had fully implemented the regulations that had been drafted12 then with the passage of the homeland security act of 2002 hsa13 the task of handling uac was split between the newly created dhs and orr dhs was delegated the task of apprehension transfer and repatriation of uac while orr was tasked to provide

definition of uac as juveniles without the accompaniment of parent or legal guardian despite the governments delegation of uac responsibility between two agencies the criticism of uac handling particularly concerning initial detention has not subsided14 child welfare advocacy groups have continued to protest the detention conditions of dhs facilities and the agencys policies on uac in 2001 these protests led the department of justice doj office of the inspector general oig to investigate the charges of continuing mistreatment of alien juveniles in custody the report found that although the ins had developed juvenile protocol manual 15 and strategic implementation plans for the fsa the report concluded that there were ongoing deficiencies in the agencys handling of uac with potentially serious consequences for the wellbeing of the juvenile16 the doj report additionally provided 28 open recommendations for complying with the fsa in 2004 the dhs oig wrote report on the implemen tation of the doj recommendations17 the oig report found that several recommendations remained open due to uncertainty over responsibility between dhs and hhs according to one study on children in government custody between january 2003 and july 2006 approximately 70 of adjudicated cases resulted in the deportation of the child18 furthermore approximately 2 of the children in closed cases were granted asylum while the majority of the remaining cases were closed because the juveniles requested to have their applications withdrawn 19

immigration and customs enforcement ice if local law enforcement authorities contact ice to notify them that possible unauthorized alien minor is in their custody ice immediately places detainer on that minor until the child can be transferred to dhs facility22 ice subsequently attempts to determine whether the minor has any family living in the united states for cases that are ambiguous the field officers23 and regional juvenile coordinators may contact the national juvenile coordinator24 in washington dc for clarification if child is determined to be unaccompanied he or she is usually transferred to office of refugee removal orr custody within 72 hours the fsa allows for 35 day time frame for transfer from dhs to orr although 72 hours has been established as the standard practice by dhs however if the juvenile is determined not to be unaccompanied then the juvenile remains in the custody of dhs according to dhs officials once an unaccompanied alien child is detained by dhs the juvenile is held separately from adults in either flexible use or continuous use facility 25 during this time period dhs authorities will determine the juveniles age conduct background checks ascertain the juveniles nationality and notify the appropriate consulate that the juvenile is being detained by dhs26 at any point the juvenile may withdraw his or her ap plication for admission and be allowed to return to his or her country of origin27 if the juvenile is from mexico or canada consular officials from those countries are contacted to arrange for the transfer of the juvenile28 if the child is from another country transportation is arranged in consultation with that countrys consulate however if the juvenile does not withdraw his ap plication for admission the child will be

philosophical positions of the government agencies involved in the handling of the children specifically the dominant cleavage line from which many other issues spring is that of whether the uac should be treated as humanitarian refugees or as unauthorized aliens subject to expedited removal those who advocate more of refugee approach see the children as victims who have been forced to migrate across borders out of hardship circumstances 45 alternatively those who focus on the enforcement issues tend to highlight the cost burden placed upon us citizens and legal immigrants by creating incentives for unauthorized juvenile immigration including detrimental spillover effects such as increased criminal enforcement costs46 these tensions have resulted in legislation pitting government 44 four hours of ground transportation or less from dro to orr facilities is transport time that dhs officials consider desirable 45 for example see jacqueline bhabha and susan schmidt

missions against each other47 and generating confusion among advocates and government actors alike48 there are few notable sources of these philosophical tensions including the guiding principles and the agency tasking stemming from the hsa orrs experience with juvenile aliens prior to uac had been the handling of unaccompanied refugees and cubanhaitian entrants 49 these juveniles have been provided with various forms of services and care governed by child welfare regulations thus when absorbing the uac detention program orr employed many of the policies and procedures that it uses in treating unaccompanied refugees and cubanhaitian entrants 50 this same philosophy is reflected in the guiding principles the agency has for the uac program including 1 treating uac with dig nity respect and special concern for their particular vulnerabilities and 2 accounting for the unique nature of each childs situation in making placement case management and release decisions 51 as guided by the flores settlement agreement fsa dhs is also concerned with the safety and wellbeing of juveniles that it apprehends yet in contrast to orrs refugeebased mission the immigration and customs enforcement ice offi ce of detention and removal dro of dhs has the mission of enforcing us immigration laws to ensure the departure from the united states of all removable aliens52 this agency also has the difficult task however of balancing potential security threats alongside child welfare concerns dhs and its subagencies operate under strategic goal of identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities to the homeland including terrorist and criminal risks 53 the previous actions of dhs indicate that it does not rule out the potential use by terrorists of alien juveniles for terrorist actions against the united states54 dhs therefore must not only provide dignified care to juvenile in their custody but they simultaneously must evaluate the potential security and criminal

unaccompanied alien child is under orr care there is memorandum of understanding between the two agencies on such matters only broad statement of principles furthermore age determination met hods and assumptions play an important role in who takes custody of potential unaccompanied alien child since current scientific methods do not offer precise age results70 some child welfare advocates believe that significant number children may be placed in the custody of the wrong agency because they are misclassified as adults71 according to dhs officials the overriding prin ciple in determining custody of juvenile for dhs is hsa72 generally if juvenile is determined to be unaccompanied as defined by hsa then the juvenile is transferred to orrs custody such transfers also include juveniles with criminal conviction or who are under expedited removal proceedings occasionally state or local jurisdictions will have custody of an unaccompanied alien child if child is apprehended by local or state authorities for some type of criminal action 73 and the child is suspected of being an unauthorized alien dhs is notified by the authorities to come and make determination if child is determined by dhs to be an unaccompanied alien child dhs will not take that child into custody until the state or local authorities have determined that their proceedings are complete 74 this may mean that an unaccompanied alien child has to serve state sentence in county juvenile detention facility or juvenile shelter care facility before being transferred to dhs custody some localities however choose to terminate their proceedings when juvenile is determined to be an unaccompanied alien child in order to expedite the transfer to dhs such state and local proceeding terminations means that dhs has record of the criminal charges in their database if the juvenile is apprehended in the future 75 consequently dhs would have information in its records to indicate whether the individual represented criminal threat upon future inspection or apprehension g5g149g138g146g150g146g151g144g561g3g156g162g149g158g150g561 for those uac who wish to claim asylum in the united states the asylum process is broadly similar to the adult process but with some key distinctions while the general statutory requirements for children remain the same as adults76 both the dhs guidelines and case law 70 ibid 71 based on crs discussions with attorneys from both the national center for refugee and immigrant children and the hebrew immigrant aid society hias council migration service of philadelphia 72 based on crs discussion with john pogash chief of the national juvenile coordination unit in dhs ices office of detention removal december 19 2006 73 since juvenile may be apprehended by local officials for delinquent activities eg violating curfew delinquent juvenile could potentially be reported to ice dro by state and local officials as well 74 detainer is placed on the uac so that the child is not released from custody when proceedings are complete but is instead transferred to dhs this is similar with alien adults who under statute must complete their criminal sentences prior to being taken into ice custody 75 based on crs discussion with john pogash chief of the national juvenile coordination unit in dhs ices office of detention removal december 19 2006 76 generally see section 208 of

the qualifying requirements for example to qualify for asylum child does not need to show that his or her persecutor had malicious intent nor that he or she sought government protection77 yet simultaneously there is ambiguity as to how old child separated from parent must be before that chil d can apply for asylum without parental consent the cases of walter polovchak78 and elian gonzalez79 established that while 12yearold minor was old enough to independently seek asylum six year old needed to be represented by an adult in immigration matters the lack of definitive age for asylum is further complicated by the fact that these two cases were decided in the context of highly charged foreign affairs considerations concerning the formersoviet union and cuba respectively

and east asia to the united states 80 observers have been concerned with the growing involvement of these gangs in human smuggling of unauthorized individuals across us borders number of these smuggled individuals are juvenile aliens some are smuggled with family members and others come unaccompanied the increased border security along the southwestern border with mexico has made the smuggling of persons both more difficult and more profitable81 some have maintained that children have become especially lucrative for smugglers who frequently charge twice as much to smuggle child than an adult82 reportedly gangs have become common link in the smuggling of uac and are charging as much as 6000 per child in central america83 in regard to the issues of uac and gang involvement in migration there are two concerns for policy makers mirroring the broader debate the gangrelated discussions divide the refugee advocates against the security advocates these two issues concern the 1 uac as impoverished victims that are easily exploited during smuggling operations and 2 the inflow of uac as potential or existing gang members 84 the first of these issues represents view largely held by refugee agencies as well as position largely refl ected in policies of orr advocates of treating all uac as victims point to the allegedly significant levels of physical and sexual abuse85

states by smugglers and gang members86 additionally number of these children reportedly do not travel of their own accord instead they are sent by impoverished families to find work in the united states and send remittance payments to their home country according to advocacy groups these mitigating circumstances along with their legal juvenile status warrants refugee paradigm for uac policy similar to how the us treats refugees87 some border security proponents contend however that despite what the uac may endure route to the united states from an immigration perspective they are not victims rather these uac are participants in human smuggling these advocates assert that participation in human smuggling is criminal action and should be treated with expedited removal88 other security proponents further point out the connection of some uac to violent crimes noting that there have been cases of uac committing criminal acts after being released in the united states89 of particular concern are the potential links that some uac may have to both gangs and terrorism90 gangs such as ms1391 have strong ties to central america and have sought to bring members to the united states92 the gangs are increasingly involved in the trafficking of guns arms and people thereby increasing the likelihood that youth gang members would promote these trafficking activities in the united states93 finally security proponents have noted the high rate of foreignborn members in these more violent gangs94 some security proponents believe that such gangs may eventually court terrorist connections in order to raise revenues for their gang activity95 the arrests of two unaccompanied alien children arriving from east asia on suspicion of terrorist intentions further elevated the concerns of continued for physical and sexual abuse by traffickers on their journey to the united states according to orr officials it is not uncommon that children arrive in the united states with special needs requiring professional services these special needs cover wide range of issues but include teenage pregnancy acute mental illness severe depression and other physical illnesses also the physical and psychological damage caused to children by human smuggling may be compounded by the fact that some children have experienced trauma or domestic abuse in their country of origin based

5 displays the number of unaccompanied alie n juveniles uac held longer than 72 hours in dro facilities by fiscal year and month and indicates the explanation see legend for extended detention it is clear from the data in table 5 that despite 74 drop from fy2005 to fy2006 in the number of uac held in excess of 72 hours there continues to be geographic disconnect between the placement of some orr facilities and dro facilities as the table demonstrates the predominant reason for uac being held in excess of 72 hours was the lack of orr bed space or beds available in reasonable 102 commuting area for fy2005 the 79 cases that were categorized in this manner accounted for 556 of juveniles held in excess of 72 hours for that fiscal year the corresponding 22 cases in fy2006 accounted for 595 of the extended detentions for fy2006 consequently while the absolute numbers of such difficulties decreased difficulties in transferring uac fro m dro to orr remained the principal reason for the majority of extended detentions the second highest cause of extended dro detention in fy2005 was escorting staff shortages in conjunction with the lack of orr bed space within reasonable proximity with 27 cases or 19 being classified as such in fy2006 total of two cases were attributed to such difficulties similar pattern is evident with the number of uac held in excess of 72 hours due to being in the custody of cbp the decline from 24 cases in fy2005 to 2 cases in fy2006 represents 95 continued to zero indicate very weak relationship but the negative sign on the correlation indicates that the two data columns actually had an inverse relationship thus as the number of juveniles held by dro increased the proportion of juveniles held 72 hours or longer would show tendency to slightly decrease one possible explanation for this lack of correlation would be that orr bed space openings varied in relation to where juveniles were apprehended random variation in bed space location would drive down the correlation 102 the term reasonable was not defined by dhs in the data they provided to crs

advocates criticism continues to be leveled against the various agencies advocates for both security and refugee paradigms for uac policy point to several practices that they claim violate existing

treatment of uac103 dhs is responsible for the transportation and removal of any unaccompanied alien child from the united states as well as the transportation and transfer of any unaccompanied alien child into orrs care those unauthorized juveniles who are unaccompanied under the hsa statutory definition belong in the custody of the orr and under the fsa any such juvenile must be transferred to their custody within 35 days of apprehension with 72 hours being the standard practice 104 critics charge that dhs frequently fails to achieve this task and that children are detained at dhs facilities for longer than 72 hours additionally uac under orrs care who are to be deported from the united states must be transferred back into dhs custody frequently such removals take more than month congress has taken notice of these transfer issues and has directed ice to contact orr immediately upon apprehension of an unaccompanied alien child and ensure that the uac is transferred to orr within 72 hours 105 officials at dro have contended that many such transfer difficulties arise from staff shortages or on the difficulties in arranging transportation to orr facilities that require anything other than standard ground transportation106 dhs has requested that orr contract with rural detention centers and consider child placed when deposited at contracted detention center under such contracting arrangement orr would be charge d with the responsibility of transporting the juvenile from rural contract center to permanent facility despite such placement difficulties dhs

unaccompanied in classifying uac specifically critics charge that dhs has misclassified many juveniles as either accompanied or unaccompanied and that in number of cases these misclassifications are deliberate the critics charge that dhs is separating children from their parents and classifying the children as uac in order to avoid spending additional resources on family unity housing additionally some advocacy groups have claimed that children who have accompanying adult have on occasion been declared accompanied by virtue of having previously lived in the united states with parent or legal guardian critics of these practices contend that it is unnecessary and harmful to the juveniles to separate them from their parents if they are available and that dhs should prevent such separations from occurring 108 in certain cases critics have argued that dhs has classified juveniles as uac and used the juvenile as bait to draw out parents who are suspected of being unauthorized in other cases the critics charge dhs has misclassified juveniles as accompanied in order to keep the juveniles in secure dhs facilities on suspicion of criminal intent although children who are apprehended with parent or legal guardian are not legally unaccompanied they are sometimes separated from the adult and detained as an unaccompanied alien child 109 such scenario may occur when the parent or legal guardian is criminal alien and must be housed in detention unit for criminal aliens in such cases dro is legally unable to keep the child with the parent or legal guardian and places the child under the care of orr since such facilities are not considered suitable for juveniles under 8 cfr 2363 in other cases the separation of children from their family is based upon shortage of bed space dhs office of inspector general oig has noted that longerterm care facilities are frequently not readily available to accommodate families under such circumstances the juveniles are treated as unaccompanied minors and placed under orrs jurisdiction 110 in each of these above cases the children involved default to status of unacc ompanied pursuant to the uac statutory definition since the parent or legal guardian although present in the united states is not available to provide care and physical custody for the child investigations by dhs and doj of some of these charges of deliberate juvenile misclassifications have confirmed that some charges are correct although they have yet to be shown to result from any malicious intent in some cases dhs has deliberately separated juveniles from their parents because of shortages of beds in family unity facilities regulations dictate that the facility must meet number of criteria in order to allow the housing of juveniles eg juveniles may not be detained in facility with adult criminal offenders in some cases where facilities were not available to provide for proper family unity detainment dhs did separate the family and place the children in juvenile facilities as uac but despite dhs construction of new family unity facilities in texas advocacy groups charge that these misclassifications continue to occur 108 based on crs discussions with attorneys from both the national center for refugee and immigrant children and the hebrew immigrant aid society hias council migration service of philadelphia

are designated as unaccompanied actually have parents or legal guardians in the united states but for various reasons the custodian does not come forward regardless of whether unaccompanied alien child is picked up by cbp or ice it is sometimes the case that parents who are unlawfully present will not come forward out of fear of facing removal111 other times there is confusion with the fami ly over where they are to appear or find their child since dhs often transfers juveniles from the original detention or apprehension locations linguistic barriers can also make communication especially difficult g3g144g142g561g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561 another issue that has concerned advocacy groups has been the age determination of uac by dhs critics charge that the dhs age determination methodologies are too reliant on forensic techniques 112 child advocacy groups argue that the forensic techniques such as bone and dental analysis are not scientifically rigorous and are prone to error113 these critics have further charged that the findings of the individuals conducting the bone analysis are skewed heavily towards adult ages and therefore reflect an investigatory bias dhs officials disputed this interpretation of its forensic procedure stating that its age determination process was more nuanced and the forensic determination was only part of this process114 congress has expressed concern over dhs forensic techniques in the report language of several appropriations bills and in so doing has urged dhs to employ more holistic methodologies including psychological evaluations 115 g20g142g153g138g157g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g561 there have been concerns expressed about the repatriation practices conducted by dhs of uac what has concerned many advocacy groups are reports that some children are not safely repatriated back to their homelands to the care of parent legal guardian or sponsoring agency 116 the standard procedure for dhs and orr is to contact the juveniles appropriate consulate in order to facilitate safe repatriation with nationals of mexico and canada apprehended along the border cbp officials may contact their respective mexican or canadian border protection counterparts and transfer the juvenile to their custody for further processing advocacy agencies have charged that many juveniles are caught within the united states and released across the border without any sponsor to care for them nor any official notification of foreign officials they have also charged that dhs does not properly verify that juvenile will be safely repatriated 117 congress has expressed concern in both committee and conference report 111 according to orr dhs does not apprehend the families in many such cases because of lack of resources dhs officials admitted that shortage of resources sometimes prevents them from fulfilling all the agencys obligations 112 jennifer smythe age determination authority of unaccompanied alien

repatriation services and has urged dhs to work with dos and orr to develop policies and procedures for the safe repatriation of juveniles118 dhs has contended that the responsibility for safe repatriation should lie at least in part with the appropriate consulate for the alien juvenile119 both dhs and orr noted that consular officials can be particularly troublesome for the repatriation process by regularly changing their documentation requests or raising objections to juvenile transfer both of these actions serve as drains on dhs resources despite such difficulties with resources

current congress in the senate senator diane feinstein sponsored the unaccompanied alien child protection act of 2007 s 844121 this legislation would have provided for several statutory changes including the rights of uac to consult with consular officer prior to repatriation criteria for treatment and detention of uac and the preference order of child placement the legislation additionally would have granted orr access to children in dhs custody to determine the childs age notably the legislation also would have provided for the appointment of child advocates for uac including counsel for all children in the custody of dhs that are not being repatriated to contiguous country these advocates would largely serve on pro bono basis senator feinstein introduced this same legislation as samdt 1146 to s 1348 which was the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 and the amendment passed the senate by voice vote the same provisions were also included in title viii of the place to
