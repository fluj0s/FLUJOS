standards courts have generally upheld laws authorizing law enforcements compulsory collection of deoxyribonucleic acid dna as reasonable under the fourth amendment of the us constitution however several developments might call this judicial consensus into question first whereas prior laws authorized compelle d extraction of dna samples only from people who had received criminal conviction new state and federal laws have expanded law enforcements dna collection authority to include people who have been arrested or detained but not convicted on criminal charges although on the federal level the us department of justice has yet to implement this expanded authority the department has proposed rule that would do so in addition several states now require dna samples from arrestees this expansion is likely to alter the fourth amendment analysis in dna collection cases in cases upholding dna collection laws courts relied in part on the reduction in privacy rights that accompanies postconviction punishment under fourth amendment precedent for people whom the government has arrested but not yet convicted it appears that this reduction in privacy rights either does not apply or applies to lesser extent second emerging scientific research suggests that the type of dna used in forensic analysis might implicate greater privacy intrusion than courts had previously assumed federal bureau of investigation fbi analysts derive dna profiles from socalled junk dna which is non genic dna because it is thought to lack both biological purpose and indicators of sensitive medical characteristics however as new studies call this assumption into question the privacy intrusion caused by dna analysis might weigh more heavily against the government in fourth amendment decisions finally most courts have yet to review the constitutionality of storing convicts dna profiles beyond the time of sentence completion especially as law enforcement officers collect dna samples from people convicted for crimes with relatively short sentences defendants are likely to challenge ongoing dna storage under the fourth amendment with these developments it is possible that future dna collection cases might raise graver fourth amendment privacy concerns than previous cases this change might lead courts to apply more stringent legal standard or to find that the intrusion upon petitioners privacy rights outweighs governmental interests in the general fourth amendment balancing test however statutory protections such as the existing federal provision requiring expungement of dna evidence after an arrestees acquittal might safeguard the government against finding that dna collection or analysis constitutes an unreasonable search or seizure under the fourth amendment this report surveys existing case law and provides constitutional analysis of these issues

recent years state and federal laws have facilitated law enforcements expanded use of deoxyribonucleic acid dna for investigating and prosecuting crimes1 such laws authorize compulsory collection of biological matter which local law enforcement agencies send to the federal bureau of investigation fbi for analysis the fbi then stores unique dna profiles in national distributive database through which law enforcement officials match individuals to crime scene evidence early laws authorized compulsory extraction of dna only from people convicted for violent or sexbased felonies such as murder kidnapping and offenses related to sexual abuse crimes associated with historically high recidivism rates and for which police were likely to find evidence at crime scenes 2 since the turn of the century new laws have greatly extended the scope of compulsory dna collection both by expanding the range of offenses triggering collection authority and more recently by authorizing compulsory collection from people who have been arrested but not convicted there is question that dna is an incredibly pow erful tool for identifying criminal perpetrators however increasing reliance on dna in forensic science implicates constitutional concerns in particular many litigants have challenged compulsory collection and the subsequent analysis and storage of dna as unreasonable searches and seizures under the fourth amendment to the us constitution although they have reached their conclusions using different analytical approaches federal and state courts have generally upheld compulsory dna collection as nonviolative of the fourth amendment however despite the emerging consensus regarding the constitutionality of compelled dna extraction it is too early to conclude that fourth amendment constraints limit the practice for several reasons first previous cases involved the collection of dna samples from people who had been convicted of crime including prisoners parolees probationers and individuals on supervised release groups who are deemed to have reduced expectation of privacy by virtue of their postconviction status courts have not fully considered legal implications of recent extensions of dnacollect ion authority to people whom the government has arrested but not tried or convicted second despite the rapid pace of technological development in the area of dna analysis 3 much of dnas scientific value remains mystery discovery that dna analysis reveals more sensitive biological information than previously assumed could alter the balance of government interests versus privacy concerns in fourth amendment cases third courts have yet to evaluate the fbis ongoing storage of convicted individuals dna profiles beyond the completion of sentences after summarizing the statutory authorities constitutional principles and case law related to compulsory dna extraction this report analyzes potential impacts of these developments for fourth amendment cases 1 for more on the progression of federal legislation authorizing use of dna see crs report rl32247 dna testing for law enforcement legisl ative issues for congress by nathan

cells and composed of two nucleotide strands which are arranged differently for every individual except for identical twins4 relatively new technology enables dna analysts to determine the arrangement of these strands thereby creating unique dna profiles5 in the law enforcement context dna profiles function like genetic fingerprints that aid in matching perpetrators to their crimes6 as with fingerprints law enforcement officers collect dna samples from specific classes of individuals such as prisoners however compulsory dna collection generally entails blood or saliva samples rather than finger impressions and dna profiles can later match any of many types of biological matter obtained from crime scenes7 for these reasons dna matching is critical complement to rather than merely supplement for fingerprint analysis in identifying criminal suspects 8 the fbi administers dna storage and analysis for law enforcement agencies across the country after law enforcement agencys phlebotomist collects blood sample pursuant to state or federal law the agency submits the sample to the fbi which creates dna profile and stores the profile in the combined dna index system database through which law enforcement officers match suspects to dna profiles at the local state and national levels 9 fbi analysts create dna profiles by decoding sequences of junk dna10 socalled junk dna the name for nongenic stretches of dna not presently recognized as being responsible for trait coding is purposefully selected for dna analysis because it is not associated with any known physical or medical characteristics and thus theoretically poses only minimal invasion of privacy11 however scientific research on junk dna is still emerging and new 4 united states v kincade 345 f3d 1095 1096 n2

than previously assumed for example in october 2008 university of iowa researchers released study findings showing that junk dna has the potential to evolve into exons which are the building blocks for protein coding genes12 other scientists have similarly argued that there might be gems among the junk in dna13 hence remaining question is whether use of junk dna will continue to offer superficial identifying information or whether it will reveal more detailed medical or biological characteristics g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g8g155g138g150g142g160g152g155g148g561 the categories of individuals from whom law enforcement officials may require dna samples has expanded in recent years the federal government and most states authorize compulsory collection of dna samples from individuals convicted for specified criminal offenses including all felonies in most jurisdictions and extending to misdemeanors such as failure to register as sex offender or crimes for which sentence greater than six months applies in some jurisdictions 14 in addition few statutes now authorize compulsory collection from people whom the government has arrested or detained but not convicted the dna analysis backlog elimination act 2000 codified as amended in title 42 of the united states code authorizes compulsory collection from individuals in federal custody including those detained or arrested and from individuals on release parole or probation in the federal criminal justice system 15 under the federal law if an individual refuses to cooperate relevant officials may use or authorize the use of such means as are reasonably necessary to detain restrain and collect dna sample16 state laws vary but nearly all states authorize compulsory dna collection from people convicted for specified crimes and small but growing number of states also authorize compulsory collection from arrestees17

technology act of 1998 authorized additional funding for dna analysis programs20 the resulting framework centers on the combined dna index system more than 170 law enforcement agencies throughout the country participate in the system21 in recent years federal and state laws have expanded law enforcement authority for collecting dna in at least two ways first laws have increased the range of offenses which trigger authority for collecting and analyzing dna in the federal context the dna analysis backlog elimination act of 2000 limited compulsory extraction of dna to people who had been convicted of qualifying federal offense22 under the original act qualifying federal offenses included limited but selected felonies such as murder kidnapping and sexual exploitation23 after september 11 2001 the usa patriot act expanded the qualifying federal offense definition to include terrorismrelated crimes24 in 2004 the justice for all act further extended the definition to reach all crimes of violence all sexual abuse crimes and all felonies25 similarly almost all states now authorize collection of dna from people convicted of any felony26 second the 109th congress authorized the attorney general in his discretion to require compulsory dna collection from people who have been detained or arrested but not convicted on criminal charges 27 specifically the dna fingerprinting act of 2005 authorized collection from individuals who are arrested or from nonus persons who are detained under the authority of the united states28 in response the us department of justice proposed rule to implement this authorization the new rule would direct us agencies to collect dna samples from individuals who are arrested facing charges or convicted and from nonunited states persons who are

appears to be natural outcome of dnas success as forensic tool the expansion to collection from arrestees appears to be more legally significant step overall it seems congress goal for the expansion to arrestees was to facilitate crime prevention through the creation of comprehensive robust database that will make it possible to catch serial rapists and murderers before they commit more crimes31 in background material for its implementing rule the justice department explains that collection from arrestees will facilitate more effective law enforcement for at least two reasons 1 it will aid in crime prevention by ensuring that the government need not wait until crime has been committed before creating an individuals dna profile and 2 it will allow federal authorities to create dna profiles for aliens detained in the united states who might not otherwise undergo judicial proceedings in us courts 32 g7g161g153g158g151g144g142g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 although congress expanded statutory authority for dna collection it has also provided some protection for arrestees when arrest does not result in conviction in particular federal law mandates expungment of dna samples upon an arrestees showing of discharge or acquittal the fbi and relevant state agencies shall promptly expunge dna information from the index upon receipt of final court

meaningfully interferes with possessory interests or freedom of movement37 in contrast searches interfere with personal privacy government action constitutes search when it intrudes upon persons reasonable expectation of privacy38 reasonable expectation of privacy requires both that an individual manifested subjective expectation of privacy in the searched object and that society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable39 in general people have reasonable expectation of privacy for physical characteristics they knowingly expose to the public40 in evaluating whether people knowingly expose identifying characteristics the supreme court has sometimes distinguished the drawing of blood and other internal fluids from the taking of fingerprints whereas the court has at times signaled that people lack reasonable expectation of privacy in their fingerprints41 it has held that extraction of blood urine and other fluids implicates an intrusion upon reasonable expectation of privacy presumably because the former category is knowingly exposed to the public while the latter category generally is not42 under modern supreme court precedent further complicating factor is that reasonable expectation of privacy depends not only on the type of evidence gathered but also on the status of the person from whom it is gathered the inquiry is not simply yesorno determination but appears to include continuum of privacy expectations for example in united states v knights the court held that the condition of probation significantly diminished probationers reasonable expectation of privacy43 this diminished privacy expectation did not completely negate the probationers fourth amendment right however it affected the outcome under the courts fourth amendment balancing test44 37

courts broader trend toward classifying more activity as constituting search and leaving the heart of the constitutional analysis for the fourth amendment reasonableness inquiry thus it appears that although the court views the drawing of blood as greater intrusion than fingerprinting both activities now qualify as searches 42 see eg skinner v ry labor executives assn 489 us 602 616 1989 we have

when government action constitutes search or seizure reasonableness is the touchstone of constitutionality45 however courts apply different standards in different circumstances to determine whether searches and seizures are reasonable the courts fourth amendment analysis falls into three general categories the first category involves traditional law enforcem ent activities such as arrests or searching of homes to be reasonable these activities require probable cause which must be formalized by warrant unless recognized warrant exception applies46 probable cause is fluid concept turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts not readily or even usefully reduced to neat set of legal rules47 yet it is considered the most stringent fourth amendment standard in the context of issuing warrants probable cause requires an issuing magistrate to make common sense determination based on specific evidence whether there exists fair probability that for example an area contains contraband 48 the second category introduced in the supreme court case terry v ohio involves situations in which limited intrusion satisfies fourth amendment strictures with reasonableness standard that is lower than probable cause49 for example in terry police officers patting of the outside of mans clothing to search for weapons required more than inchoate and unparticularized suspicion but was justified by specific reasonable inferences that the man might have weapon 50 in such situations courts permit searches justified by reasonable suspicion which is particularized suspicion prompted by somewhat less specific evidence than probable cause requires51 the third category includes exempted area administrative special needs and other suspicionless searches examples include routine inventory searches border searches roadblocks and drug testing in these circumstances courts apply general approach to the fourth amendment also called the general ba lancing general reasonableness or totality ofthe circumstances test to determine reasonableness by assessing on the one hand the degree to which search or seizure intrudes upon an individuals privacy and on the other the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests 52 although the supreme court has expanded the scope of application for this test the approach historically applied only when search or seizure satisfied parameters for one of several narrow categories in particular it applied where routine administrative purpose justified regular searches where longrecognized exception existed such as for border searches or where special need 45 knights 534 us at 118 46 see eg atwater v city of lago vista 532 us 318 354 2001 recognizing warrant

warrant and probable cause requirements impracticable53 in the context of law enforcements collection of dna from prisoners parolees and others subject to law enforcement supervision questions remain regarding when special need distinct from law enforcement interests must exist before court may apply general reasonableness standard although the special needs test arose in the context of drug testing the supreme court has held that probation and other postconviction punishment regimes qualified as special needs with purposes distinct from law enforcement for example in griffin v wisconsin the court held that states operation of probation system like its operation of school government office or prison or its supervision of regulated industry presents special needs beyond law enforcement54 as discussed below later supreme court cases seemed to suggest that defendants postconviction status alone might justify courts direct application of general reasonableness test to dna collection without any finding of special need

postconviction punishments specifically in cases involving probationer and parolee without first finding special needs justifying the government action in both cases the courts legal basis for directly applying the general balancing approach was the reduced expectation of privacy to which each defendant was entitled by virtue of his postconviction status in addition to providing justification for rejection of the special needs test this same diminishment of defendants privacy expectations also favored the government in the courts application of the general balancing test in united states v knights 2001 case california court had sentenced mark knights to probation for drug offense 55 one condition of his probation was that his person property place of residence etc were subject to search with or without search warrant56 after finding some evidence that appeared to link him w ith fire at local telecommunications vault police detective searched knights home without warrant57 emphasizing the curtailment of privacy rights that correspond with probation and other postconviction punishment regimes the court evaluated the search under the general balancing test without first identifying an administrative purpose or special needs justification58 in addition knights diminished expectation of privacy affected the outcome under the courts general fourth

officers search based on reasonable suspicion59 in samson v california 2006 case the court extended knight s to uphold search of parolees pockets for the first time directly applying the general reasonableness test to search justified only on the basis of the petitioners status as parolee rather than on any particularized suspicion60 as in knights the samson court explicitly rejected arguments that special needs analysis was required instead finding that the petitioners postconviction status diminished his privacy rights the court again directly applied general fourth amendment approach61 in addition as in knights the samson court held that parolees diminished privacy right affected the outcome of the general balancing test62 it is unclear what other categories of people might be subject to reduced expectation of privacy by virtue of their status for example given that the courts language in knights and samson emphasized petitioners postconviction status it is not clear whether the court would find comparably diminished expectation of privacy for people arrested or detained but not convicted

general reasonableness test rather than special needs test in dna collections cases73 in contrast some federal courts of appeals have held that samson did not affect their use of the special needs test in suits challenging dna collection statutes for example the court of appeals for the second circuit declined to apply samson in united states v amerson case upholding compulsory dna collection from two individuals on probation one for larceny and one for wire fraud 74 the court interpreted samson very narrowly as applying only in contexts involving highly diminished expectation of privacy75 similarly although it directly applied the general reasonableness test in wilson the sixth circuit suggested in that case that samson might not apply in case involving person who was not prisoner76 the reading of samson as limited to cases involving significantly diminished expectation of privacy appears to comport with the supreme courts emphasis in knights and samson on the diminished privacy rights that stem from petitioners postconviction status in samson the court framed the question in the case as whether condition of release can so diminish or eliminate released prisoners reasonable expectation of privacy that suspicionless search by law enforcement officer would not offend the fourth amendment77 so far whether courts apply the special needs test before applying general reasonableness test in dna cases has had little or practical import because courts have consistently upheld dna collection laws regardless of the standard they apply thus courts have signaled that change in analytic tools would not affect the ultimate determination of constitutionality in dna collection cases involving convicted criminals 78 however these courts have not yet addressed expanded legal authority for collecting arrestees dna nor have they addressed implications of potential discoveries regarding junk dnas biological purpose as these new issues develop the legal standard applied may be relevant to the outcome of future cases in closer case the decision to apply the special needs test as an initial hurdle could become outcome determinative in addition courts that have previously applied special needs analyses in dna cases might change their approach in cases involving arrestees perhaps by adopting an interpretation of samson as limited to circumstances involving highly diminished expectations of privacy 73 504 f3d 1 3 1st cir 2007 we interpret the supreme courts decision in samson v california to require that we join the majority of the circuits in applying totality of the circumstances approach to th issues in this case rather than the special needs analysis used by the minority of circuits citations omitte d similarly some state courts have interpreted samson as applicable in compulsory dna collection cases for example despite continuing to apply the special needs test in dna cases the supreme court of new jersey recognized that the most recent united states supreme court decision in samson strongly suggests that the balancing test which is an easier test for the state to satisfy should apply to fourth amendment analysis state v ohagen 189 nj 140 158 2007 74 483 f3d at 73 79 2d cir 2007 75 id while after samson it can longer be said that the supreme court has never applied general balancing test to suspicionlesssearch regime nothing in samson suggests that general balancing test should replace special needs as the primary mode of analysis of suspicionless searches outside the context of the highly diminished expectation of privacy

complicate future cases involving dna collection analysis and storage in particular 1 the proposed depart ment of justice rule and new state laws which authorize collection from arrestees 2 emerging science regarding biological purposes for junk dna and 3 the fbis longterm storage of dna profiles each of these factors potentially increases the likelihood that expectation of privacy will outweigh governmental interests in future fourth amendment analyses however for all issues it is possible that existing expungement provisions together with additional protections that congress could add might create sufficient safeguards such that dna collection and analysis would withstand future fourth amendment challenges

arrested but not yet convicted on criminal charges are likely challengers in future dna collection cases the justice departments proposed rule would implement the 2006 law expanding collection authority to arrestees 79 and several states have already taken that step this expansion of compulsory collection authority could alter the fourth amendment analysis for at least two reasons first courts may be less likely to disregard the special needs test in cases involving arrestees because courts justify direct application of general reasonableness test in part by focusing on the reduced expectation of privacy to which various convicted individuals are entitled under supreme court precedent second the outcome of the general balancing test might differ in cases involving arrestees rather than convicts because courts would be less likely to devalue the privacyintrusion side of the balance on the basis of defendants reduced expectation of privacy for these reasons any change in fourth amendment analyses involving arrestees may depend in large part on differences that the courts find to exist if any between an arrestees reasonable expectation of privacy and convicts reasonable expectation of privacy although it appears from supreme court dicta that at least lesser reduction in privacy rights would apply to arrestees versus people with postconviction status courts have generally not addressed the specific issue in knights and samson the supreme court referred to parolees and probationers as being along continuum of stateimposed punishments 80 lower federal courts have interpreted these and other supreme court decisions as suggesting that prisoners privacy expectations are the most diminished parolees have the next lowest diminishment in privacy expectations followed by people on supervised release and probationers81 presumably arrestees and detainees would have an even lower if any diminishment of their reasonable expectation of privacy under the fourth amendment the supreme courts justifications for convicted individuals reduced privacy expectations emphasize the governments authority to punish or otherwise restrict the freedom of people who have been fairly convicted in samson the court held that parolee lacked an expectation of 79 dnasample collection under the dna fingerprint act of 2005 and the adam walsh child protection

because searches were condition of parole which was an established variation on imprisonment82 thus some federal courts of appeals have stated that the fact that dna was collected from probationer or parolee rather than prisoner does not greatly affect the fourth amendment analysis83 however such statements compared fellow convicts they do not address potential differences between convicts and people who have been arrested but not convicted arguably arrestees are not on the continuum of punishment and thus should have analogous diminishment in privacy rights on the other hand one might argue that an arrestees or detainees position is similar to other individuals such as people hoping to enter the countrys borders for whom courts have found reduced expectation of privacy not premised on an authority for punishment if arrestees have normal or only minimally diminished reasonable expectation of privacy several legal consequences are likely to occur in future dna cases first courts would be more likely to find that samson does not apply and thus that dna collection must be supported by special need distinct from the need for law enforcement furthermore although the supreme court has found that special need exists in the governments operation of probation system 84 for arrestees there is arguably clearly analogous system separate from law enforcement thus governments would need to prove that an alternative special need justification supports dna collection second the fourth amendment general reasonableness test would likely entail closer contest between governments interest in preventing and prosecuting crimes on one hand and the intrusion of privacy resulting from gathering and analyzing persons blood or saliva on the other hand however despite the likelihood that the balancin g test would present greater hurdles for the government in future cases it is possible that statutory protections could sufficiently offset perceived intrusions on arrestees privacy to result in an outcome favoring the government for example existing expungement requirements under federal law which require expungement of dna records upon proof of acquittal or release might offset the degree of intrusion on an individuals privacy enough that the general balancing test would result in finding for the government furthermore governments are likely to offer new arguments to persuade courts that dna collection implicates only minimal privacy intrusion for example in its proposed rule the us department of justice emphasizes an analogy between dna collection and fingerprinting 85 it is unclear how effective such analogies will prove in judicial cases at least one court has likened dna collection to fingerprinting that occurs during routine booking86 in order to show that the privacy intrusion especially given the status of the petitioner in the case as probationer was relatively small87 however as noted above the supreme court has previously drawn distinctions 82 see samson 547 us at 852 quoting morrissey v brewer 408 us 471 477 1972 83 see eg banks v united states 490 f3d 1178 1184 10th cir 2007 holding that the fact that the plaintiffs here are on parole supervised release or probation whereas the offenders in our prior cases were prisoners does not materially change the courts fourth amendment analysis 84 griffin 483 us at 87384 85 dnasample collection under the dna fingerprint act of 2005 and the adam walsh child protection act of 2006 73 fed reg at 2108485 86 in general the routine booking rationale has been used in fifth amendment selfincrimination clause rather than in fourth amendment jurisprudence 87 amerson 483 f3d at 86 while we do not hold that probationer has expectation of privacy in his or her identity we agree that like all convicted felons probationers expectation of privacy in his or her identity is severely continued

suggesting that blood extraction poses greater intrusion than taking fingerprints in addition although the routine nature of government conduct has been factor influencing courts decisions to apply general reasonableness rather than probable cause or reasonable suspicion standard for instance in routine roadblock cases it would not eliminate the general reasonableness inquiry under the fourth amendment instead the routine nature of dna collection would at best serve as one factor influencing courts determination regarding the degree of privacy intrusion at issue the extent to which such arguments would persuade courts in fourth amendment balancing inquiries remains to be seen g16g142g160g561g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561g152g151g561g12g158g151g148g561g6g16g3g561 second issue could alter courts determinations regarding the constitutionality of dna analysis and storage because fbi analysts rely on junk dna thought not to reveal sensitive medical or biological information courts have assumed th at dna analysis and storage involves only minimal privacy intrusion however language in some opinions suggest that this assumption might change if scientists discover new uses for junk dna for example the us court of appeals for the first circuit has suggested that discovery of new uses for junk dna would require reevaluation of the fourth amendment reasonableness balance 88 proponents of expansive dna collection argue that any privacy intrusion resulting from dna storage or analysis is minimal at most when he introduced the amendment that authorizes collection and analysis of dna from arrestees in the federal system senator kyl emphasized that storage of dna samples would not intrude upon in dividuals privacy rights stating that the sample of dna that is kept is what is called junk dna it is impossible to determine anything medically sensitive from this dna 89 fourth amendment challenges might gain legal traction if researchers discover that junk dna does in fact contain clues which reveal sensitive biological or medical information

arise in future dna cases is the constitutionality of storing convicts dna profiles after their sentences have ended although federal law requires the fbi to expunge dna profiles for people who receive acquittals or whose convictions are overturned90 the expungement provisions do not address storage of dna from people who have been convicted but have successfully completed their sentences rather as the ninth circuit court of appeals noted in united states v kriesel once they have persons dna police at any level of government with general criminal investigative interest can tap into that dna without any consent suspicion or warrant long after his period of supervised release ends91 defendants continued diminished given the limits imposed on the collection analysis and use of dna information by the statute we see the intrusion on privacy effected by the statute as similar to the intrusion wrought by the maintenance of fingerprint records which are collected as part of everyday routine booking procedures dna differs primarily from fingerprinting in its greater accuracy quoting nicholas 430 f3d at 671 88 united states v stewart 532 f3d 32 36 1st cir 2008 89 151 cong rec

become more prevalent argument since laws have expanded collection authority to reach people convicted for relatively minor charges some courts have signaled that storage after sentences are completed could alter the fourth amendment analysis for example in an opinion upholding collection of dna from person on supervised release the us court of appeals for the first circuit warned that its opinion had an important limitation namely because the petitioner was on supervised release and will remain so until 2009 the court did not resolve the question of whether it is also constitutional to retain the dna profile in the database after he is longer on supervised release 92 such courts might be receptive to arguments regarding the longterm storage of dna as an unconstitutional search especially if court views completing sentence as restoring persons reasonable expectation of privacy alternatively court might view ongoing dna storage as an unconstitutional seizure especially if court view s people as having possessory interest in their blood as at least some courts appear to do however as previously noted courts have typically resisted seizure analyses in dna cases alternatively the government might argue that conviction permanently diminishes persons fourth amendment rights such that longterm dna storage permissibly accompanies postconvic tion status it is unclear how courts would respond to such an argument g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 although nearly all courts that have addressed the issue have upheld compulsory dna collection and analysis as constitutional under the fourth amendment it would be premature to assume that all compulsory dna collection laws would survive fourth amendment scrutiny first amid quickly expanding authority for dna collection constitutional analyses might change when dna is collected from people merely arrested rather than convicted for criminal behavior second in light of rapidly developing science regarding junk dna courts might find that dna collection implicates greater privacy concerns than currently assumed finally courts have not yet addressed the constitutional ity of ongoing storage of dna however although these issues are likely to complicate future case law statutory protections could ensure that courts would continue to up hold expansions of dna collection authority as constitutional for example existing expungement provisions might aid the government in cases involving arrestees or detainees in the future additional protections such as restrictions on the use of dna in analysis or expungement of dna profiles after sentence completion might become necessary if constitutionality of dna collection practices under the fourth amendment is to be ensured 92 weikert 504 f3d at 2
