section by section analysis introduction somewhat different safe acts have been introduced in both the house and senate s 737 the security and freedom enhancement act of 2005 introduced by senator craig and hr 1526 the security and freedom ensured act of 2005 introduced by representative otter1 although the senate b ill is more detailed they address many of the same issues most of which relate to the usa patriot act roving foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa wiretaps delayed notification of sneak and peek search warrants library and similar exemptions from fisa tangible item orders and communications related to national security letters the definition of domestic terro rism and expansion of the sunset provisions of the usa patriot act2 section 1 short title section 1 of the bills contains their short titles the security and freedom ensured act of 2005 safe act in the case of hr 1526 and security and freedom enhancement act of 2005 or safe act in the case of s 737httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32907crs2 section 2 limitation on roving wiretaps under foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 proposed amendment of 50 usc 1805c the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa permits federal judges assigned to serve on the foreign intelligence surveillance court to issue orders authorizing for foreign intelligence gathering purposes electronic surveilla nce wiretapping 50 usc 18011811 physical searches 50 usc 1821 1829 the use of trap and tr ace devices and pen registers surreptitious caller id vices 50 usc 18411846 and access to tangible items partic ularly business records 50 usc 18611862 subsection 1805c describes the speci fications and directions for fisa electronic surveillance orders before 911 fisa electronic surveillance orders specified 1 the identity if known or the description of the target of the surveillance 50 usc 1805c1a2000 edemphasis dded 2 the nature and location of the facilities or places at which the surveillance was directed 50 usc 1805c1b2000 ed and 3 if reque sted the identity of communications providers landlords and other person whose assistance would facilitate execution of the order 50 usc 1805c2b2000 ed section 206 of the usa patriot act tem porarily altered this third feature to permit general command for third party ssistance without identifying specific person if the target of the order regula rly changed telephones or meeting places or took other evasive steps in order to thwart surveillance efforts 50 usc 1805c2b the intelligence authorizati on act for 2002 altered the second feature to require identification of the nature and location of target ed facilities and places only if they were known 50 usc 1805c1 b thus at least temporarily fisa surveillance orders may be issued that simply describe the target but do not otherwise identify the target the facilities or places to be targeted or those communications providers or others whose assistance will be commanded to facilitate execution of the order both the house and senate bills amend subsection 1805c to require that fisa surveillance orders identify either the target or the facilities or places targeted orders merely describing the target because th targets identity is unknown must identify the facilities or places targeted and orders that do not identify the facilities or places because they are unknown must identify the target if the facilities or places cannot be identified in the order both bills limit execution of fisa surveillance order to times when the target is present at th facility or place under surveillance section 3 limitations on delayed notice search warrants in general the fourth amendment to the united states constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and izures usconst amend iv the amendment does not apply when there is reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the item seized such as inform ation or other property in the possession of third party for example united states v miller 425 us 435 1976a customer has expectation of privacy with respect to the records of his financial transactionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32907crs3 subpoenaed from the customers bank yet where reasonable expectation of privacy exists and subject to certain exigent circumstances the fourth amendment requires officers executing search wa rrant to knock and announce thei r purpose before entering to execute the warrant richards v wisconsin 520 us 385 1997 wilson v arkansas 514 us 927 1995 prior to the usa patriot act the federal rules of criminal procedure which implement the amendment instructed officers to leave notice of the search and an inventory of any items seized at the location where the search occurred frcr imp 41d2000 ed the lower federal appellate courts were divided over whether failure to provide notification should be treated as violation of the rule or as constitutional violation and they likewise could not agree on how long notification might be postponed when exigent circumstances justifie d delayed notification united states v freitas 800 f2d 1451 9th cir 1986 united states v pangburn 983 f2d 449 2d cir 1993 united states v simmons 206 f3d 392 4th cir 2000 federal law permits delayed notification to cust omers of government access to their communications stored with serv ice providers 18 usc 2705 2703b situation under which there may well be judicially recognized reasonable expectation of privacy the law limits delays to instances where contemporaneous disclosure would have adverse conseque nces the list of adverse consequences includes factors traditionally recognized as exigent circumstances for fourth amendment purposes risk of injury or flig ht of the destruction of evidence or of the intimidation of potential witness nd two factors which probably would not be thought to constitute exigent circumstances seriously jeopardize an investigation or unduly delay trial 18 u sc 2705a2 b section 213 of the usa patriot act amends 18 usc 3103a to permit delayed notification of the execution of search warrant or court order for reasonable time in presence of any of the adverse conditions listed in 18 usc 2705 18 usc 3103ab the two bills amend subsection 3103ab first to limit the grounds justifying delay to those that can be considered exigent circumstances injury flight destruction of evidence witness intimidati on risks and second to confine the period of delay to more than 7 days with the possibility of 21day extensions b reports the bills direct the attorney general to issue public report every six months documenting the number of notify postponeme nts and extensions requested and granted or nied proposed 18 usc 3103a c the senate bill also insists that the report identify the nature of the crimes that have given rise to subsection 3103ab requests pr oposed 18 usc 3103ac2c section 4 privacy protections for library bookseller and other personal records under foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 in general before the usa patriot act fisa authorized judges and magistrates of the fisa court to issue orders affording the federal bureau of investigation fbi access to certain busine ss records during the course of gatheringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32907crs4 foreign intelligence information or investigating international terrorism 50 usc 18611863 2000 ed applications were to include speci fic and articulable facts for belief that the subject of the business records was foreign power or the agent of foreign power 50 usc 1862b2b2000 ed the orders could be addressed to any transportation comm on carrier public accommodation provider storage facility or vehicle rental bus iness 50 usc 1862d12000 ed and recipients could not disclose them except to the extent necessary to provide access to the records 50 usc 1862d22000 ed section 215 of the usa patriot act temporarily rewrote this portion of fisa 50 usc 18611862 in the form scheduled to sunset on december 31 2005 fisa court orders are available for fbi access to any tangible things including books records papers documents and other items without regard to whether they pertain to foreign power or any of its agents as long as access is sought to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning united states person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities 50 usc 1861a1 section 215 kept the nondisc losure feature and granted recipients protection from civil liability for compliance with fisa order 50 usc 1861de both bills restrict the temporary fisa tangible things access orders to instances where there are specific and articulable reasons to believe that the records pertain to foreign power or one or more of its agents proposed 50 usc 1861bc the senate bill alone provides that the order may be more sweeping than grand jury subpoena duces tecum issued in the context of an espionage or international terrorism investigation ie it must yield to federally recognized privileges and may not be unreasonable or oppressive proposed 50 u sc 1861c3 the senate bill also calls for the order to include notice of the recipient rights that the bill provides proposed 50 usc 1861c4 b oversight both bills add the house and senate judiciary committees to the congressional authorities that the attorney general must keep apprised of the extent of the fbis use of the fi sa access order authority 50 usc 1862 c amendments unique to s 737 the senate bill adds 1 exceptions and 180 day time limits to the nondisclosure feature with the possibility of 180 day extensions 2 procedure to allow recipi ent to quash or modify an order and 3 use provisions comparable to those that pply to the use of information generated by fisa surveillance and physical

generally have explicit enforcement mechanism nor any means for recipient to have request modified or set aside bar disclosure by recipients of the requests and have uniform provisions concerning use of the information pr ovided in response to the request section 505 of the usa patriot act ame nded three of the four provisions 18 usc 2709 12 usc 3414 15 usc 1681u and section 358 created the fourth 18 usc 1681v each of the amendments 1 made it clear that the request did not have to come from fbi headquarters but c ould be issued by any of the agents in charge of the various fbi field offices 2 substituted relevancy issuance standard for the earlier reason to believe standard 3 dropped the requirement that the records sought pertain to foreign power or its agents and 4 asserted that access could not be sought in connection with an investiga tion based solely on an americans exercise of his first amendment rights in case now on appeal one federal di strict court found that the manner of exercising the national security letter authority under 18 usc 2709 violated both the fourth and the first amendments the fourth because of the want of judicial supervision or review and the first because of the facially all encompassing permanent form of the gag order doe v ashcroft 334 fsupp2d 471 sdny 2004 hr 1526 the bills treat the national security letter statutes differently hr 1526 simply exempts libraries from the cove rage of 18 usc 2709 library shall not be treated as wire or electroni c communication servi ce provider for purposes of this section proposed 18 usc 2709a2 later in the bill it adds section 505 of the usa patriot act with its amendments to the national security letter statutes 18 usc 2709 12 usc 3414 and 15 usc 1681u to the list of usa patriot act provisions that expire on december 31 2005 s 737 the senate makes such addition to the list of terminating sections nor does it exempt libraries per from an of national security letter statutes instead it rewrites each of the statutes in much the same way it rewrites the fisa access order provisions within each of the national security letter statutes ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32907crs6 reestablishes the demand that the info rmation sought be based on specific and articulable facts that suggest that the information sought pertains to foreign power or one or more of its agents sets 90 day time

privileges nd may not be unreasona ble or oppressive explicitly permits disclosure to those n ecessary to comply with the request and to the recipients attorney and establishes procedure for use and s uppression of evidence generated by the letters section 6 modification of definition of domestic terrorism hr 1526 section 7 in s 737 federal law employs two terrorismrelated definitions fairly extensively the first defines federal crimes of terrorism by listing series of specific federal offenses likely to be committed for terro rist purposes 18 usc 2332bg5text is appended the second defi nes domestic terrorism ge nerically rather than by reference to any specific fe deral crime 18 usc 23315 as used in this chapter 5 the term domestic terrorism means activities that involve acts

2332bg 5b that involves the risk of serious injury to another person is not subject to the usual statute of limitations and may be prosecuted at any time 18 usc 3286b similarly property derived from and used to facilitate internati onal or domestic terrorism as defined by 18 usc 2331 is subject to confiscations 18 usc 982a1g both bills amend 18 usc 23315 so as to merge the two definitions as used
