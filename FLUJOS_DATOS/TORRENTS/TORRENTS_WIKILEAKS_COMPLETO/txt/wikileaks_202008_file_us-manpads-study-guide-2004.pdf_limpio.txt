introduction to man portable air defense system manpads introduction the us department of homeland securitys concern that law enforcement officer may come in contact with manpads is real and genuine it is the intent to provide the law enforcement officer the tools needed to identify manpad s if they come into contact with one and have the information needed to respond and handle an incident involving manpads through extens ive research and partne rships the federal law enforcement training center has came up with this guide book which is designed to aid the law enforcement officer in the identification and response to manpads incident officers agents response not in ready fire the below are the minimum recomme nded steps if law enforcement officer agent finds manpads co mponents or complete system not in the ready fire position 1 correctly identify manpads or basic components the first thing that the law enforcem ent officer must do is identify the manpads or its components correc tly this can be done by using knowledge of the system from personal xperience or past training if you do not possess the knowledge then the officeragent can refer to fletc trifold handout on manpads or the law enforcement officersagents manpads guide in order for the law enforcement offi ceragent to successfully start the manpads incident procedures correct identification is imperative ramifications from the incorrect id entification of manpads or its components can only be imagined due to so many agencies and businesses affected 2 remove all subjects from the area and properly secure depending one the law enforcement officer sagents situation training and local protocol will vary the meaning of properly secure if the officeragent is faced with multiple subjects and b ackup is miles aw ay then properly secure may mean to place them at disadvantage until reinforcements arrive properly secure may mean to ndcuff and search if single subject is encountered this is only guideline as in all cases agen cys protocol will supercede 3 make proper timely detailed notification to your dispatch communications center in order to get the ball rolling in m anpads incident it is important that the law enforcement officer agent makes timely and complete notification to their dispatch communications cen ter it is recommended that at minimum the following be related 1 positive identification of manpads has been made 2 the exact location 3 number and disposition of subjects 4 request for the immediate response of supervisor and additional units if the law enforcement offi cer is an agent then local law enforcement may need to be notified 5 ensure that the supervisor and dispatch communications center is aware that notification to the fede ral bureau of investigation fbi is mandatory under pdd39 6 also additional notifications ma need to be made to alcohol tobacco and firearms atf transportation security administration tsa and the federal aviation administration faa 4 setup perimeter cordon as when dealing with any explosive device the manpads should be treated as an improvised explosive device even though it has only about one pound of explosive it is made up with propellant that could also provide fo r additional explosive and you really dont know if it has been rigged with boobytrap or homemade self destruct mechanism the federa l law enforcement training center recommends the following minimum perimeter cordon standards 1 300 feet if in or around buildings 2 1000 feet if in open area and there are buildings to use as shield these are only recommended standards agency protocol will dictate the following perimeter cordon requirements 5 notify the nearest military expl osive ordnance disposal eod unit if there is local eod unit available and on scene they will be able to assist in cordon perimeter and some techni cal advice howeve r manpads is military ordnance and the best way to deal with military ordnance is through the military eod it makes differen ce what branch of the service the military eod is from they all have and go through the same training they are the technical experts having trained on and have in their possession the technical reference manuals to dispose of the manpads it is recommended that the first notificati on be given to the military eod units and if there is not one around at nimum an fbi or atf eod unit should be notified next officers agents response in ready fire 1 correctly identify manpads and person is attempting to launch the manpads the below are the minimum recomme nded steps if
