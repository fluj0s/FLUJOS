million and family violence 62 million child welfare amendments the following amendments to child welfare foster care and adoption assistance programs under title ivb and ive of the social security act were included in the final version of welfare reform legislation that was signed by president clinton on august 22 1996 pl 104193 foster care eligibility before enactment of the new law states could be reimbursed under title ive for the costs of foster care or adoption assistance on behalf of children whose biological families were eligible for aid to families with dependent children afdc or in the case of adoption assistance children who were eligible for supplemental security income however the central feature of the new welfare law replaces afdc with stateadministered block grant thus foster care eligibility criteria had to be adjusted to conform to this change under pl 104193 foster or adoptive children will be eligible for title ive subsidies if their families would have been eligible for afdc as in effect in the state on june 1 1995 this provision takes effect on july 1 1997 children eligible for ssi will continue to be eligible for adoption assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96823crs5 although the new welfare law also amends ssi eligibility criteria for children foster children and children receiving adoption assistance will remain eligible for medicaid forprofit foster care providers under title ive federal reimbursement has been available for foster care provided by foster families or public or private nonprofit institutions private forprofit providers have never been eligible for federal reimbursement under title ive the new law amends title ive effective upon enactment to allow for profit providers to participate the conference agreement on the legislation hrept 104 725 notes that states are responsible for ensuring that children are in safe and reliable care whether it is provided by public or private entities and that there is reason to automatically refuse participation by an entire sector of the child caring community enhanced match for data collection during fy1994fy1996 states were eligible for federal reimbursement at an enhanced matching rate 75 federal instead of the usual 50 under title ive for the costs of statewide automated child welfare information systems sacwis this enhanced rate was scheduled to expire at the end of fy1996 however pl 104193 extends the 75 matching rate through the end of fy1997 so that states can have one additional year to complete their data collection systems child welfare study pl 104193 amends title ivb to require hhs to conduct national random sample study of children who have been abused or neglected or who are at risk of abuse or neglect the welfare reform law appropriated 6 million for each year from fy1996 through fy2002 for this study however fy1997 appropriations legislation pl 104208 rescinded these appropriations for fy1996 and fy1997 kinship care the new law amends title ive effective upon enactment to require states to consider giving preference to an adult relative over nonrelated caregiver when determining foster or adoptive placement for child provided that the relative caregiver meets all relevant state child protection standards in related provision pl 104193 directs the census bureau to collect data in connection with the decennial and middecade census on grandparents who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren interaction with tanf as stated above the new welfare law repeals and replaces afdc with block grant to states for temporary assistance for needy families tanf states will design their own public assistance programs subject to certain federal constraints the law creates entitlement for individuals to cash assistance and requires states to deny assistance to certain categories of recipients including any adult who has received benefits for more than 2 years and is not engaged in work activity and anyone who has received benefits for more than 60 months in their adult lifetime because foster care will continue as an openended entitlement to states under title ive the replacement of afdc with capped block grant could create an incentive for states to transfer costs from their cash assistance programs into foster care where possible the congressional budget office cbo notes that in 1993 approximately 500000 afdc children lived in households without parent in the future states could classify some of these kinship households as foster families and pay them foster care subsidies if they meet eligibility requirements of title ive cbo estimates that federal foster care outlays could increase by 10 million in fy1999 and by 45 million annually by fy2002 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96823crs6 block grant proposals proposals in the 104th congress to convert child welfare programs into block grants originated in the house the original house welfare bill hr 4 passed in march 1995 would have created child protection block grant cpbg to states that would have replaced many existing programs titles ivb and ive of the social security act capta adoption opportunities abandoned infants temporary child care and crisis nurseries family support centers under the mckinney act parts of the victims of child abuse act family unification under the housing act and missing childrens assistance as welfare reform evolved during the 104th congress the child welfare provisions became less sweeping for example the housesenate conference version of hr 4 which was vetoed by president clinton would have created two child welfarerelated block grants the cpbg to replace social security act programs and child and family services block grant to replace capta and related activities maintenance payments for foster children and adoption assistance subsidies were not included in either block grant and would have remained openended entitlements as under current law under the next house version of welfare reform hr 3734 administrative and training costs related to foster care and adoption assistance also were removed from the block grant as were independent living services for older foster children ultimately all child welfare block grant provisions were dropped from the bill which was enacted as pl 104193 proponents of child welfare block grants argued that consolidation of categorical programs and elimination of federal mandates could have allowed states to design more comprehensive service systems for vulnerable children and families without the constraints of funding sources tied to specific services states would have been required to maintain the key features of child protection system such as mandatory abuse and neglect reporting and investigation foster care and permanency planning for foster children but without the existing funding structure and regulations which were characterized as cumbersome accountability would have been assured through audits and penalties data collection and reporting and in the original housepassed hr 4 citizen review panels that would have allowed the public to assess the adequacy of child protection programs opponents argued that by enacting block grants the federal government would have abdicated its leadership role in the area of child protection which is an issue of national concern while the legislation would have required states to certify that their programs contained certain features the federal government would have had limited enforcement authority with earmarked funds for preventive and supportive services for families the ongoing demand to investigate abuse and neglect reports and remove children from unsafe homes would have left few resources available for states to pursue less crisisdriven activities by eliminating federal mandates the proposal would have limited the ability of abused and neglected children to seek protection in the federal courts block grants also were seen as first step toward reductions in federal spending for child welfare activities
