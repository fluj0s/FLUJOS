defenselinkmilnewsaug2004d20040824finalreportpdfapplying us army field manual standards the first provision of the mccain ame ndment provides that person in the custody or effective control of the dod or detained in dod facility shall be subject to any interrogation treatment or technique that is not authorized by and listed in the united states army field manual on intelligence interrogation2 the field manual establishes procedures for the treatment and questioning of persons by military personnel3 prior to the enactment of the mccain amendment dod had authorized certain interrogation techniques for possibl use in the interrogation of security detainees whom the administration had deemed to be ineligible for prisoner of war status under the geneva conventions na mely taliban fighters designated as unlawful combatants and members of qaeda these techniques were more aggressive than those authorized by th army field manual and were prohibited from being used against lawful prisoners of war4 though the mccain amendment generally requires the interrogation of persons in dod custody to be consistent with field manual requirements an exception is made for individuals being held pursuant to us criminal or immigration laws the mccain amendment does not requir nondod agencies such as nonmilitary intelligence and law enforcement agencies to employ field manual guidelines with respect to interrogations they conduct the mccain amendment does not prev ent dod from subsequently amending the field manual as discussed later an updated version of th army field

their respective jurisdiction id at arts 13 16was released on september 6 2006 the 2006 manual contains ge neral requirements that are similar to those in the earlier version of the manual requiring all detainees to be treated in manner consistent w ith the geneva conven tions and prohibiting the use of torture or cruel inhuman nd degrading treatment in any circumstance it further provides that the only authorized interrogation techniques or approaches are those included in the manual prohibition on cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the second provision of the mccain am endment prohibits persons in the custody or control of the us government regardless of their nationality or physical location from being subjected to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment5 the amendment specifies that this restriction is without geographical limitation as to where and when the government must abide by it unlike the first section of the mccain amendment th is provision covers not only dod activities but also intelligence and law enforcement activities occurring both inside and outside the united states this provision does not appear to prohibit us agencies from transferring persons to other countries where those persons would face cruel inhuman or degrading treatme nt or punishment so long as such persons were longer in us custody or control ho wever such transfer s might nonetheless be limited by applicable treaties and statutes6 the mccain amendment also provides that this provision may not be supersede d except by provision of law enacted after the date of the enactment of this act which specifically repeals modifies or supersedes the provisions of this section7 in interpreting whether treatment falls below this standard the mccain amendment defines cruel unus ual and inhuman treatment or punishment to cover those acts prohibited under the fifth eight h and fourteenth amendments to the constitution as stated in us reservations to the convention against torture and other forms of cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat8 the constitution applies to us citizens abroad thereby protecting them from the extraterritorial infliction by us st ate or federal official s of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited under the fifth eighth andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33655crs4 9

habeas statute 28 usc 2241c3 under which petitioners challenged their detention whether the rasul ruling meant only that federal habeas jurisdiction extended to guantanamo or more broadly found that noncitizens detained at guantanamo possessed constitutional rights has been subject to conflicting rulings by courts in june 2007 the supreme court granted certiorari to hear the consolidated cases of

challenges in federal court by jennifer k elsea and kenneth r thomas 11 the mccain amendment also appears aimed at resolving controversy concerning us implementation of cat article 16 which obligat cat parties to prevent cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment within territories under their jurisdiction when the us ratified cat it did so w ith the reservation that the cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment prohib ited by cat covered only those types of actions prohibited by the us constitution there is some legal dispute as to whether cat article 16 as read in light of us reservations applies to noncitizens held outside the united states for further background see crs report rl32438 convention against torture cat overview and application to interrogation techniques by michael john garciafourteenth amendments9 however noncitizens arguably only r eceive constitutional protections after they have entered the united states10 the mccain amendment prohibits persons under us custody or control from being subjected to cruel inhuman or grading treatment or punishment of any kind prohibited by the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendments regardless of their geographic location or nationality accordingly it appears that the mccain amendment is intended to ensure that pe rsons in us custody or control abroad cannot be subjected to treatment that w ould be deemed unconstitutional if it occurred in the united states11 the scope of the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendment prohibitions upon harsh treatment or punishment is subject to evolving case law interpretation andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33655crs5 12 the eighth amendments prohibition on c ruel and unusual punishment concerns the imposition of criminal punishment ingr aham v wright 430 us 651 1977 the constitutional restraint of persons in other ar eas such as pretrial interrogation is found in the due process clauses of the fifth amendmen t concerning obligations owed by the us federal government and fourteenth amendmen t concerning duties owed by us state governments these due process rights protect persons from executive abuses which shock the conscience see eg rochin v california

philadelphia 174 f3d 368 375 3rd cir1999 the exact degree of wrongfulness necessary to reach the conscienceshocking level depends upon the circumstances of particular case nevertheless there may be some actions which are constitutionally prohibited matter what the circumstance see lewis 523 us at 856 1998 kennedy j concurring 14 hope v pelzer 536 us 730 2002 15 chandler v crosby 379 f3d 1278

for 16 days was involuntary even though he was interrogated only an hour each day he was heldconstant legal and scholarly debate12 the types of acts that fall within cruel inhuman or degrading tr eatment or punishment c ontained in the mccain amendment may change over time and may not always be clear heightening this uncertainty is the possible difficulty of comparing situations that might arise in the context of hostilities and the war on rror with interrogation detention and incarceration within the us criminal justice system courts have recognized that circumstances often determine wh ether conduct shocks the conscien ce and violates persons due process rights13 accordingly us court might employ different standard to determine whether interrogation techniques employed against criminal suspect are unconstitutionally harsh than it would use to assess whether those same techniques were unconstitutional if employed against an enemy combatant in war zone nevertheless types of treatment in criminal law context that have been deemed prohibited under the fifth eigh th and fourteenth amendments may be instructive to reviewing court sampling might include inter alia handcuffing an individual to hitching post in standing position for an extended period of time that surpasses the need to quell threat or restore order14 maintaining temperatures and ventilation systems in detentionfacilities that fail to meet reasonable levels of comfort 15 and prolonged interrogation over an unreasonably extended period of time16 including interrogation of duration that might not seemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33655crs6 17 see leyra v denno 347 us 556 1954 johns on v new jersey 384 us 719 1966 ashdown v utah 357 us 426 1958 18 rhodes v chapman 452 us 337 1981 19 hutto v finney

circumstances17 again whether such conduct would also be considered cruel inhuman or degrading punishment or trea tment prohibited by the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendment when employed in other circumstances eg against terrorist suspects or enemy combatants abroad or whether different constitutional standards could govern such conduct remains unclear conduct that has not been deemed to vi olate the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendments includes inter alia the doublecelling of those in custody at least so long as it does not lead to deprivations of essentials an unreasonable increase in violence or create other conditi ons intolerable for confinement18 solitary or isolated confinement so long as such confinement is within cell in acceptable conditi on and is not of an unreasonable duration19 and in detention situations the use of constant lighting in prisoner cellswhen the detainees inconvenience and discomfort is outweighed by the need to protect safety and welfare of the other detainees and staff 20 it is not clear that these and similar treatments may never be deemed constitutionally impermissible outside the criminal context including when such treatments are used upon enemy combatants or terrorist suspects who have not been charged with criminal offense on september 6 2006 the army released an updated version of the field manual that implements the requirements of the mccain amendment the manual prohibits cruel inhuman nd degrading treatment eigh t techniques are expressly prohibited from being used in conjunction with intelligence

continuedapplying beatings electric shock burns or other forms of physical pain waterboarding using military working dogs inducing hypothermia or heat injury conducting mock executions and depriving the detainee of necessa ry food water or medical care21 in addition the manual restricts the us of other interrogation techniques but these restrictions may be due to other legal obligations besides those imposed by the mccain amendment22 in october 2007 the new york times reported that in early 2005 the department of justice issued legal opi nion which remains cla ssified authorizing the use of certain harsh interrogation tec hniques against terrorist suspects including headslapping simulated drowning w aterboarding and exposure to frigid temperatures23 later that year as congress considered enactment of the mccain amendment the doj reportedly issued nother classified opi nion declaring that these techniques would not be barred under the mccain amendment at least when employed against terrorist suspects with crucial information regarding future terrorist attack24 according to the new york times the memorandums remain in effect and their legal conclusions have been confirmed by several more recent memorandums that are not publicly available25 the opinions have been the subject of controversy with some members of congress disputing their legal conclusions and claiming that

are probably already impermissible under mccain ame ndment standards additionally the mccain amendment arguably imposes less stringent requirements concerning the treatment of detainees than the plain text of common article 3 and may permit us personnel to engage in mo re aggressive means of interrogation than common article 3 might otherwise allow40 the mca also authorized the president pursuant to an executive order published in the federal register to more restrictively interpret the meaning and application of convention requirements and promulgate administrative regulations implementing this interpretation41 although the president is generally permitted to interpret the geneva conventions so as to enlarge the scope of conduct deemed not to violate them the act did not permit the

barred under the more general restrictive langua ge of the order remains unclear in public address on september 7 2007 cia director general michael hayden stated that one ever claimed that the army field manual exhausted all the lawful tools that america could have to protect itself and suggested that additional interrogation techniques may be employed by the cia than are permitted to be used by dod personnel48 nonetheless as discu ssed previously the cia has apparently stopped using so interrogation techniques including waterboarding which are expressly prohibited unde r army field manual standards49 recent legislative developments in the 110th congress several pieces of legisla tion have been introduced that are intended to limit the use of certain interrogation techniques against security detainees by members of the intelligence community one measure proposed in several pieces of legislation would require the cia to use only those interrogation techniques that are authorized by under the army field manua l as previously discussed the field manual expressly bars several interrogati on techniques including waterboarding which are deemed to be inconsistent w ith the mccain amendments prohibition on cruel inhuman and degrading treatment more broadly the manual restricts the use of number of other techniques thoug h not necessarily because they are incompatible with mccain amendment re quirements including for example the use of good cop bad cop interrogation tac tics or the separation of detainees during interrogation without special approval50 the white house

critical intelligence that has helped us prevent number of attacks the program helped us stop plot to stri ke us marine camp in djibouti planned attack on the us consulate in karachi plot to hijack passenger plane and fly it into library tower in s angeles and plot to crash passenger planes into heathrow airport or buildings in downtown london and it has helped us understand qaidas structur and

legislation would jeopardize the safety of the american people by undermining the cias enhanced interrogation program which has helped the united states capture senior qaeda leaders and disrupt multiple attacks against the homeland51 the white house also alleged that legislation requiring all security detainees to be treated in accordance with field manual provisions would not be consistent with the presidents obligation to take all lawful measures to protect the citizens of the united states from future attacks52 hr 2082 the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 2008 as reported out of conference on december 6 2007 woul d generally have barred any person in the custody or effective control of either an element of the intelligence community or contractor or subcontractor of th intelligence community from being subjected to any treatment or interrogation tactic not authorized by the army field manual this prohibition would have effectively barred the cia and others from employing certain controversial interrogation techni ques such as waterboarding or sleep deprivation that are barred by the army field manual regardless of whether the intelligence community had previously deemed such techniques as legally permissible hr 2082 would not have prohibited the army field manual from being revised in the future meaning th at the scope of pr ohibited

dangerous qaida operatives particularly those who might have knowledge of attacks planned on our homeland the best source of information bout terrorist attacks is the terrorists themselves if we were to shut down this program and restrict the cia to methods in the field manual we could lose vital information from senior qaida terrorists and that could cost american lives white house office of the
