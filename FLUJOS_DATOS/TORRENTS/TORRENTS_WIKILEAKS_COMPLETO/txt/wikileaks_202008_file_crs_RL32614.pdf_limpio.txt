commonly known as continuing resolutions have been an integral component of th annual appropriations process for decades whenever action on one or more of the re gular appropriations acts for fiscal year is incomplete as the end of congressional session nears one issue that arises is the appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used continuing resolutions may have rela tively short duration in the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks alternatively continuing resolutions may have longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections or into the beginning of the next cong ressional session finally continuing resolution may provide funding for the rema inder of the fiscal year the duration of continuing resolution re fers to the period for which continuing appropriations are made available for the use of agencies legislative provisions as opposed to funding provisions containe d in continuing resolution may remain in effect for longer period even as pe rmanent law the period ends either upon enactment of the applicable regular ppropriations act or on an expiration date specified in the continuing re solution whichever occurs first over the past half century the timing patterns for congressional action on regular appropriations acts ve varied considerably but tardy enactment has been recurring problem during the 57year period covering fy1952fy2008 all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only four instances fy1977 fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 continuing resolutions were enacted for three of these fiscal years but continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs whose f unding had been dropped from the regular appropriations acts further conti nuing resolutions were enacted for fy1953 even though all but one of the regula r appropriations were enacted late fullyear continuing resolutions provide funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the remainder of the fiscal year while congress has employed fullyear continuing resolutions on many occasions it has not done so consistently over time for each of th 11 fiscal years covering fy1978fy1988 congress enacted fullyear continuing resolution three years later congress enacted another fullyear continuing re solution for fy1992 most recently full year continuing resolution was enacted for fy2007 during the past 11 fiscal years fy1998fy2008 congress provided funding under continuing resolutions for an averag each year of about three and onehalf months 110 days the period for which continuing appropria tions were provided in these 11 years ranged from 21 days to

appropriations process for decades whenever action on the regular appropriations acts for fiscal year is incomplete as the end of congressional sessi on nears one issue that arises is the most appropriate duration of any period for which continuing resolutions will be used continuing resolutions may have rela tively short duration in the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks alternatively continuing resolutions may have longer duration to postpone final action on ppropriations decisions til after elections or into the beginning of the next congressional session finally continuing resolution may provide funding for the rema inder of the fiscal year this report provides information on congre ssional practices with respect to the duration of continuing resolutions includi ng the use of fullyear measures and focuses particularly on th period covering fy1998fy2008 features of continuing resolutions the routine activities of most federal ag encies are funded by means of annual appropriations provided in one or more of the regular appropriations acts1 when action on the regular appropriations acts is delayed congress turns to one or more continuing appropriations acts to provide stopgap funding2 in the absence of regular appropriations the failure to enact continuing appropriations in timely manner results in funding gap3 funding gaps usually requi re that affected federal agencies shut down and furloug h many of their employees4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32614crs2 continuing appropriations acts commonly are referred to as continuing resolutions or crs because usually they provide continuing appropriations in the form of joint resolution rather than bill occasionally however continuing appropriations are provided in bill form in most of the years in which continuing resolutions have been used series of two or more have been enacted into law continuing resolutions may be designated by their order eg first continuing resolution second continuing resolution and so on or after the initial continuing resolution has been enacted designated merely as further continuing resolution the duration of continuing resolution re fers to the period for which continuing appropriations are made available for the use of agencies legislative provisions as opposed to funding provisions containe d in continuing resolution may remain in effect for longer period even as pe rmanent law the period ends either upon enactment of the applicable regular ppropriations act or on an expiration date specified in the continuing resolution whic hever occurs first the duration of continuing resolution may vary for diffe rent agencies covered thereunder as an agencys regular appropriations act is acted and its coverage under the continuing resolution ceases in addition continuing resolution may contain an expiration date for one or more agencies or programs that differs from the one that applies generally to the covered agencies and programs section 107 of pl 10884 117 stat 1043 the first continuing resolution for fy2004 which bega n on october 1 2003 set the duration of the measure at 31 days sec 107 unless otherwise provided for in this joint resolution or in the applicable appropriations act appropr iations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this join t resolution shall be available until enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this joint resolution or b the enactment into law of the applicable appropriations act by both houses wit hout any provision for such project or activity or c october 31 2003 whichever first occurs oftentimes subsequent continuing resolu tions simply will replace the expiration date in the preceding continuing resolution with new one for example section 1 of the second continuing resolution for fy2004 pl 108104 117 stat 1200 stated that public law 10884 is amended by striking the date specified in section 107c and inserting november 7 2003 this action ex tended the duration of the preceding continuing resolution by seven days based upon their duration continuing reso lutions may be classified as either partialyear or fullyear measures pa rtialyear continuing resolutions provide funding for periods usually measured in days or weeks but sometimes months while fullyear continuing resolutions pr ovide funding through september 30 of the next congressional session the st day of the fiscal year by enacting series of partialyear continuing resolutions congress secures increments of time for itself to complete action on some or all of the remaininghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32614crs3 5 section 1414 of pl 82547 66 stat 661 made regular appropriations enacted late available as of july 1 1952 the first day of fy1953 and ratified any obligations incurred before their enactment 6 section 501 88 stat 321 of pl 93344 july 12 1974 this section later was replaced by the federal credit reform act of 1990 but th start of the fiscal year remains october 1 see 31 usc 1102regular appropriations acts be fore ending the congressi onal session the duration of the continuing resolutions may be shortened sometimes to single day to keep pressure on legislators to c onclude their business or ma be lengthened to weeks to accommodate lengthy negotiations or cong ressional recesses in some cases continuing resolutions have carried over into the next session when congress wanted to postpone making difficult political or policy decisions finally when it does not seem likely that one or more of the regula r appropriations acts for fiscal year will be enacted separately fullyear continuing resolution may be used to complete legislative action continuing resolutions usually fund activities under form ulatype approach that provides spending at restricted vel such as at rate for operations not exceeding the current rate ie genera lly equivalent to the total amount of appropriations provided for the prior fiscal year the amount of funding available for particular activities often is increased when the regular appropriations act subsequently is enacted congress is not bound by these conventions in determining funding levels however and there have been several variations in practice in continuing resolutions over the years in addition continuing resolutions ge nerally do not allow new activities to be initiated instead funding usua lly is available only for activ ities c onducted during the past year and existing conditions and limitations on program activity are retained persistent need for continuing resolutions over the past half century the timing patterns for congressional action on regular appropriations acts ve varied considerably but tardy enactment has been recurring problem during the 57year period covering fy1952fy2008 all of the regular appropriations acts were enacted on time in only four instances fy1977 fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 continuing resolutions were enacted for three of these fiscal years but continuing resolutions were enacted for fy1977 to fund certain unauthorized programs whose f unding had been dropped from the regular appropriations acts further conti nuing resolutions were enacted for fy1953 even though all but one of the regula r appropriations were enacted late5 in an effort to reduce the reliance on continuing resolutions the congressional budget act of 1974 lengthened the time available for congress to act on annual appropriations measures by moving the star t of the fiscal year back three months from july 1 to october 16 procedures under the act firs t were implemented fully for fy1977 during the preceding 25 fiscal years covering fy1952fy1976 congress did not once enact all of the regular appropriations acts on time as result one orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32614crs4 7 although regular appropriations measures for fy1953 were enacted into law after the start of the fiscal year on july 1 1952 continuing appropriations were provided section 1414 of pl 82547 july 15 1952 supplemental appropriations measure for fy1953 resolved the legalities arising from the tardy enactme nt of appropriations for that year 8 the fullyear continuing resolution for fy 1976 pl 94254 provided funding through the end of the fiscal year june 30 1976 as well as through the end of transition quarter september 30 1976 made necessary by the change in the start of the fiscal year from july 1 to october 1more continuing resolutions were enacted each year during this period except for fy19537 the change made by the 1974 act in th start of the fiscal year yielded immediate results all 13 of the regu lar appropriations acts for fy1977 were enacted on time despite this achievement two continuing resolutions were enacted to fund certain unauthorized programs th at had been excluded from the regular appropriations acts the initial success wa s shortlived and c ongressional reliance on continuing resolutions has pe rsisted in the ensuing years after fy1977 all of the regular appropr iations acts were enacted on time in only three other instances for fy1989 fy1995 and fy1997 consequently one or more continuing resolutions were need ed each year during this period except for these three fiscal years in most years more than one conti nuing resolution was needed as congress worked to complete action on the regu lar appropriations acts the number of continuing resolutions enact ed for fiscal year durin g the period covering fy1977 fy2008 ranged from zero to 21 on average about five continuing resolutions were enacted each year during this interval use of fullyear continuing resolutions fullyear continuing resolutions provide funding for one or more of the regular appropriations acts for the remainder of th fiscal year ie through june 30 for fy1976 and prior years and through ptember 30 fo r fy1977 and subsequent years they represent determination by congress to abandon any further efforts to enact separately any unfinished regular appropriations acts for the fiscal year and to bring the annual appr opriations process for that year to close except for the later consideration of supplemen tal appropriations acts while congress has employed fully ear continuing resolutions on many occasions it has not done so consistently over time prior to th full implementation of the 1974 congressional budget act for fy1977 fullyear continuing resolutions were used periodically fullyear continui ng resolutions for example were enacted into law for four of the six preced ing fiscal years fy1971 fy1973 fy1975 and fy19768 following the successful completion of ac tion on the regular appropriations acts for fy1977 congress returned to the use of fullyear continuing resolutions for morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32614crs5 than decade for each of the 11 fis cal years following fy1977 covering fy1978 fy1988 congress enacted fullyear continuing resolution three years later congress enacted another fullyear c ontinuing resolution for fy1992 most recently fullyear continuing resolution was enacted for fy2007 fullyear continuing resolutions may pr ovide appropriations in different ways including 1 by formulaic pr ovisions eg at rate fo r operations not in excess of the current rate or the rate provided in the budget estimate whic hever is lower in which the amounts available for individual projects and activities must be determined by comparing two or more alternatives 2 by incorporating the full text of the applicable regular appropriati ons acts including incorpor ation by crossreference to other measures thereby obvi ating the need to make an funding determinations or 3 by combination of the two from functional perspective fully ear continuing resolutions that do not include any formulaic provisions but inst ead provide appropriations using the full text of acts including by crossreferen ce may be regarded by some as omnibus appropriations acts rather than continuing resolutions even if they are entitled an act making continuing appropriations or m aking further continuing appropriations table 1 identifies the 13 fullyear continuing resolutions enacted for the period covering fy1977fy2007 seven of the meas ures included at least one formulaic funding provision while the remaining six did not nine of the 13 fullyear continuing re solutions during this period were enacted in the first quarter of the fiscal year three in october two in november and four in december the four remaining measures however were enacted during the following session between february 15 and june 5 as table 1 shows fullyear continuing reso lutions enacted during the first five years of this period were relatively short measures ranging in length from one to four pages in the statutesatlarge beginning with fy1983 and extending through fy1988 however the measures became much lengthier ranging in length from 19 to 451 pages averaging 244 pages the greater page length of fullyear continuing resolutions enacted for the period covering fy1983fy1988 may be explained by two factors first fullyear continuing resolutions enacted prior to fy1983 generally estab lished funding levels by formulaic reference to pending regula r appropriations acts with regard to specific appropriations act for example funding levels ma have been keyed to the lesser of the amounts provided in the house passed or sena tepassed versions of the act beginning with fy1983 however congress largely abandoned the use of formulaic references to establish funding levels instea d the full text of some or all of the covered regular appropr iations acts usually was incorporated into the fullyear continuing resolution thereby incr easing its length considerably secondly the number of regular appr opriations acts covered by fullyear continuing resolutions increased significantly during the fy1983fy1988 period for the period covering fy1978fy1982 the number of regular appropriations acts covered by continuing resolutions for the full fiscal year ranged from one to fivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32614crs6 averaging 24 beginning with fy1983 and extending through fy1988 the number of covered acts ranged from four to 13 averaging 87 table 1 fullyear continuing

means for an average each year of about three and one half months 110 days taking into account all of the continuing resolutions enacted for each year the period for which continuing appropriations were provide d ranged from 21 days to 365 days on average each of the 75 continuing resolutions enacted lasted for 16 days9 one full year continuing resolution was used during this period covering fy2007 in the first four instances the expiration date in the final continuing resolution was set in the first quarter of the fiscal year on date occurring between october 21 and december 21 the expiration date in th final continuing resolution for the next three fiscal years however was set in the following session on date occurring between january 10 and february 20 the expiration dates for the next two fiscal years shown in the table fy2005 and fy2006 and for the final fiscal year fy2008 were in the first quarter of the fiscal year between december 8 and december 31 finally the final
