auchi had with the iraqi dictator are not known he has always denied dealing with saddam after the last gulf war and claims the dictator murdered his two brothers but it is beyond doubt that the iraqi businessman first established himself in britain in the early 1980s with money he had earned from deals carried out for the regime in the presanctions era from the moment he arrived in this country auchi was immersed in controversy his first business coup was to broker deal to sell italian frigates to the iraqi defence ministry for which he received millions of dollars in commission the deal to buy the ships and other military equipment from the italian naval shipyards cantiri navali riuniti sparked an italian parlamentary investigation into alleged bribes investigators discovered that

demanding payment of 17 million dollars to be paid into bank account in luxembourg while auchi has never denied the existence of this deal he has always denied any wrongdoing in ths case and was never prosecuted this was not be his last brush with the italian authorities over his deals with saddam regime four years later he began relationship with one of italys most controversial bankers pierfrancesco pacini battaglia man whose role at the heart of italian political scandals was exposed by the clean hands anticorruption investigation such was battaglias influence he was dubbed the one below god in 1987 saddam hussein ordered the construction of giant pipeline from iraq to saudi arabia after the port southern port of umm qasr had been destroyed by air raids during the lengthy war with iran the contract to build the pipeline was one of the most lucrative in the world and the italianfrench joint venture used battaglia and auchi to secure the contractguardian unlimited politics

investigating the sources of saddam husseins wealth battaglia claims that auchi was used to pay bribes to iraqi government officials to win the deal for the italians auchis price was juicy commission of 11 million which was allegedly paid via network of secret slush funds in guernsey and liechtenstein into another auchi company in panama barsy services in his confession battaglia said to acquire the contract it was necessary as is usual especially in middle eastern countries to pay commission to characters close to the iraqi government in this case the international intermediary who deal with this matter was the iraqi nadhmi auchi despite battaglias evidence auchi was never called to answer these allegations while the clean hands investigation wiped out whole generation of italys political and business elite the iraqi tycoon escaped untouched by the scandal with his role at the centre of two major italian political scandals auchi was fast developing reputation as the scarlet pimpernel of the international business world always at the scene of the crime but always one step ahead of the law his next big opportunity came when saddam hussein invaded kuwait while the world held its breath fearful of the consequences of global conflict auchi stepped in to cut new business deal that would enrich him even further after the invasion the kuwaiti government desperately needed ready cash and wanted to sell an oil refinery it owned in spain the french stateowned oil giant elfaquitaine had agreed to buy it but needed clearance from the european authorities kuwait couldnt wait and in stepped auchi to act as intermediary it was deal that would return to haunt him and eventually lead to his arrest in london 12 years later once again the deal involved alleged secret commission payments to auchi but this time investigators belive cut of the payments from elfaquitaine found its way back into the pockets of the senior oil company executive alfred sirven who orchestrated the deal it appeared to be classic kickback scandal that soon aroused the suspicion of french anticorruption investigators who were busy piecing together web of corruption involving the french oil giant that led to the heart of the frenchguardian unlimited politics special reports tyc httpwebarchiveorgweb20030424213627http 4 of 7 09212008 0453 pmgovernment investigators believe that auchi recieved total of 56 billion pesetas for arranging the deal for elf and siphoned off 24 billion pesetas to secret account set up for sirven in bank owned by auchi in luxembourg the account was in the name of irishregistered company travlane despite the appearance of regular company account travlane turned to have the sole purpose of funnelling kickbacks to sirven in second deal investigators allege that sirven pocketed 2 million kickback thanks to deal facilitated by auchi to buy property for elf in japan auchi has always claimed that the money received in the ertoil refinery deal was legitimate commission but this explanation never satisfied the tenacious french investigative magistrates who issued an international arrest warrant for auchi in 2000 it stated that auchi is suspect of complicity in the misuse of company assets and receiving embezzled assets for t ony blair the events in france may have seemed unimportant but scandal was about to cross the channel in spectacular fashion auchi despite being one of the country richest men with fortune estimated at 17 billion had managed to keep an extremely low profile but he had already begun quietly buying influence at the very highest level of british public life he hired former conservative chancellor lord lamont to serve on the board of his luxembourg banking company cipaf and lord steel speaker of the scottish parliament agreed to take up directorship with the british arm of the auchi empire general mediterranean holdings for steel the new revelations will prove deeply embarrassing as the former liberal leader has enjoyed thousands of pounds of auchis generosity over the years the lastest register of interests in the scottish parliament show that last september steel flew firstclass on the auchis private jet to amman to attend gmh board meeting and the formal opening of royal hotel by king abdullah of jordan the cost of the flight alone was 2200 he then stayed two nights at company fivestar hotel in amman at 268 night he flew back via amsterdam on commercial flight paid by the company steel receives 1000015000 year as board director of gmh but declined to comment on the relationship

but auchis most spectacular coup came on 23rd april 1999 the occasion of the 20th anniversary of gmh when fellow billionaire and labour science minister lord sainbury presented auchi with painting of the house of commons on behalf of tony blair it was signed by the prime minister and over hundred fellow mps including party leaders william hague and charles kennedy the painting now has pride of place above auchis desk at gmhs plush kensington headquarters auchi hit the headlines in britain for the first time in 2001 when the observer revealed that he hired the senior new labour politician keith vaz as director of gmh although he resigned when he became minister but it later emerged that vaz remained in contact with auchi when he was made europe minister in the foreign office and made enquiries on his behalf over the french extradition warrant it emerged that auchi had called vaz at home and asked the minister for advice labour party spokesman admitted that vaz made some factual enquiries to the home office about the extradition procedure since then speculation has mounted over auchis relationship with the blair administration with recent rumours circulating of meetings with the prime minister himself to discuss the future of iraq norman lamb liberal democrat mp for north norfolk has written to blair to demand answers lamb said given these serious allegations against mr auchi it is essential to have transparency about the governments contacts and relations with him on the subject of postwar iraq the government must identify who hes been meeting with why these meetings have taken place and what was discussed far too many questions remain unanswered for over two years it appeared that auchi had fended off the attentions of the french authorities exactly as he had done with the italians but last monday officers at charing cross police station finally acted on the interpol warrant and arrested auchi in london the iraqi tycoon continues to protest his innocence but now for the first time since his apperance in baghdad court as 23yearold he will have to make his case in courtroom the politicians who have taken his money and favours are doubt praying he will go free once again the observer has sought to put its allegations to auchi but he declined to answer themguardian unlimited politics special reports tyc httpwebarchiveorgweb20030424213627http
