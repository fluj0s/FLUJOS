and escalation of force eof during traffic control point operations in fullspectrum operations it is important to meet stringent force protection requirements accomplish the mission and minimize chances for collateral damage against coalition forces and friendly civilians soldiers must balance these force protection requirements against maintaining the ability to effectively communicate and interact with the civilian population eofrelated definitions eof is defined as sequential actions that begin with nonlethal force measures visual signals to include flags spotlights lasers and pyrotechnics and may graduate to lethal measures direct action to include warning disabling or deadly shots to defeat threat and protect the force defensive actions are defined as eof procedures that terminate with successful employment of nonlethal means handarm signals colored flags spotlights pyrotechnics or any other available resource eof procedures are not substitutes for but are part of roe eof is an aspect of roe that helps commanders and soldiers apply roe principles for selfdefense use of force military necessity proportionality and unnecessary suffering however commanders and soldiers must understand that roe may limit eof options for example warning shots may not be authorized by the roe for given operation this handbook expands the discussion of roeeof beyond traffic control point operations to include convoy movement cordon and search and mounted dismounted patrols the terms eof and graduated response are used interchangeably throughout this handbook digital versatile disc dvd is enclosed with this handbook the scenarios included on the dvd depict how to set up and execute snap traffic control point under potential hostile conditions in urban and open

training improves leader and soldier awareness when planning preparing executing and assessing methods to prevent unnecessary casualties of soldiers and civilians synchronizing rules of engagement roe with eof is vitally important to shaping eof training the desired end state is for soldiers and leaders at all levels to understand and apply eof procedures in order to lengthen response time and prevent unnecessary lethal force engagements the following eofrelated tasks should be integrated into training soldiers at every level must understand eof procedures before during and after an eof event to include the possible second and thirdorder effects andor the strategic impact of eof incidents which can lead to misperceptions by the local populace soldiers must continually train and rehearse eof procedures at home station during mobilization training and mission rehearsal exercises and while deployed to designated theater of operation all soldiers must understand eof in order to prevent hesitation or secondguessing when making decision to apply force units should be resourced with the correct force protection equipment in order to increase reaction time reduce unnecessary eof incidents resulting in the use of lethal force and reduce casualties if these important eofrelated tasks are successfully integrated into training and soldiers and leaders adhere to the training principles unnecessary lethal force engagements can be reduced or eliminated adhering to eoftrained principles also supports the goal of enhancing the partnership with local governments by reinforcing positive image of coalition forces eoftrained soldiers are able to make the right decision on what is legitimate target eof training lengthens the time available to positively identify targets and apply force commensurate with the level of threat eof never limits the soldiers inherent right to selfdefense in accordance with the established roe note for information on roe training in the united kingdom please see appendix section i training scenarios scenario 1 securing incident site your squadplatoonpatrol is providing security in builtup area when vehicle explodes killing two civilians and wounding several others civilians are trying to surround the vehicle while your squadplatoonpatrol tries to keep them back 9eof handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use

considerations weapons observed in crowd or on top of roof suspicious personnel in crowd hostile andor curious crowd crowd responds to instruction or does not respond favorably shots fired at coalition forces scenario 2 cordon and search us and coalition forces receive an intelligence report that suspected enemy has bombbuilding devices in an apartment building there is an extended family living there your squadplatoonpatrol task is to search and clear the building you could receive light to heavy resistance when you enter the building possible reaction points and eof considerations personnel with weapons in rooms discovery of bombbuilding material separate and search occupants scenario 3 mobilehasty traffic control point tcp your squadplatoonpatrol is part of security force in an improvised explosive device ied clearing operation vehicle in your convoy is hit by an ied you take immediate action by employing the 5cs confirm clear check cordon and control possible reaction points and eof considerations unmarked vehicles approaching the area unable to identify occupants unmarked vehicle approaches your position and does not heed warnings shots are fired at the convoy by an unknown assailant note scenarios 4 through 14 apply to convoy movementcombat logistics patrols scenario 4 your convoypatrol reports vehicle approaching at high rate of speed from the rear you apply all available nonlethal procedures and equipment including hand and arm signals followed by the use of laser device visual signal and bullhorn 10center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyaudible signal to wave the vehicle off but the vehicle continues you fire warning shot nonlethal or lethal and the vehicle stops the two civilians in the vehicle jump out possible reaction points and eof considerations vehicles highspeed approach driver does not respond to warnings the occupants reaction threatening or nonthreatening posture after vehicle stops trigger point safe separation scenario 5 assume the same facts as the above scenario but now you have confirmed that you are being engaged you can see and hear the rounds impacting you can identify the general direction from where they are originating but you have not yet fixed the point of origin what do you do possible reaction points and eof considerations you cannot engage the target until you get positive identification pid reasonable certainty that the object of the attack is legitimate military target this is made more difficult because it is at night you must get fix on the source of fire before you can engage the target in this circumstance you may engage the origin of the muzzle flashes you do not need absolute certainty for pid rather you just need reasonable certainty scenario 6 you are gunner in convoy heading southbound through village you are passing an outdoor market there are visible coalition forces in the area as well as number of local nationals in the market you observe number of young men with weapons who begin to fire at your convoy you can clearly identify them but they are surrounded by number of civilians who do not appear to be supporting them what do you do possible reaction points and eof considerations you clearly have hostile acts and pid under the roe you can engage the target in this scenario the risk of collateral damage to both local national and coalition forces might be too great to justify engaging the targets especially if you have the ability to egress safely 11eof handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyyour response should be reasonable in intensity duration and magnitude but still defeat the threat shoot maybe move definitely communicate absolutely scenario 7 assume the facts are the same as the above scenario however two of the individuals are armed with rocketpropelled grenades does this make difference in whether you engage possible reaction points and eof considerations the lethality of the enemy threat is significantly higher than when facing small arms fire take wellaimed shots intended to kill the hostile individuals although noncombatants should never be intentionally engaged limited incidental injury to or killing of noncombatants may be acceptable in this situation use the amount of force necessary to defeat the threat and then cease fire scenario 8 you are the gunner in the rear gun truck of convoy passing through an urban area you receive word that young adult male is throwing softballsize rocks at your convoy from an upcoming overpass as you approach the overpass you spot young man on the overpass with what appears to be large rock there are six to eight civilians walking in the same area as the rockthrower what do you do possible reaction points and eof considerations you clearly have hostile acts and pid under the roe you can engage the target if he poses threat consider the following ºyou have an uparmored high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle hmmwv is there threat ºyou have vehicle with an open top and personnel exposed to the rockthrower is there threat ºconsider the risk of collateral damage can the target be engaged while minimizing damage to the surrounding noncombatants 12center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyºwhat is the level of threat if your armor can protect you from the rocks is there threat is engagement with lethal force required to defeat the threat scenario 9 your convoy is on the outskirts of city and approaching an overpass crowd is gathering in the area just beneath the overpass you see man running in an alley toward the overpass with an ak47 what do you do possible reaction points and eof considerations increase the aggressiveness of your posture use eof to negate the potential threat remember that locals may legally have small arms for the protection of their homes attempt to identify the individual with the weapon do not engage unless there are further indications of hostile intent or hostile act scenario 10 you are in the lead armored vehicle escorting fourvehicle convoy along highway there is flash behind you followed by loud explosion as one of the nontactical vehicles in the convoy disappears in cloud of dust and smoke you then see two males 200 meters m away from you mount motorcycle and speed away you also see an orange sedan back out of driveway 150 m south of your position and speed away three males standing 100 m up the road run into nearby house you start taking small arms fire from different house 150 m west of your position what do you do possible reaction points and eof considerations you should respond to the hostile fire coming from the house with deadly force you should not engage the motorcycle car or people running away from the attack as there is evidence to conclude that they possess hostile intent have committed hostile act or are linked to the attack they may be fleeing for their own safety you may detain people fleeing in order to collect intelligence scenario 11 you are in convoy on the outskirts of city when the convoy suffers an ied attack as you focus your attention on the location of the ied you notice two individuals in civilian clothes and weapons jump up out of hiding about 80 m away from where the ied exploded and run away from you you quickly ascertain 13eof handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlythat the individuals were within commanddetonation range of the ied commanddetonation is common method of detonation what can you do possible reaction points and eof considerations you may engage the individuals with the necessary force including deadly force to prevent their escape if you are reasonably certain that they commanddetonated the ied whether you can engage depends on all of the circumstances and whether you are reasonably certain that the fleeing individuals detonated the ied and are attempting to evade capture if so these individuals have committed hostile act against coalition forces and you may respond in selfdefense with necessary and proportional force scenario 12 you are conducting cordon and search of neighborhood when you see an individual acting suspiciously the onscene commander decides to stop and temporarily detain the individual for tactical questioning the individual flees from the patrol possible reaction points and eof considerations the individual is not demonstrating hostile intent because there is imminent threat of force against the unit the unit does however have the authority to detain the individual based on the circumstances the unit may at this point use proportionate force give chase tackle the individual restrain him to stop the individual under these circumstances lethal force would not be authorized under the roe because it would not be proportionate to the threat the individual poses to the unit if lethal force is not authorized then warning shot would not be authorized scenario 13 dismounted patrol you are in dismounted patrol and your unit sees an individual digging on the side of route frequently traveled by the unit the individual sees the patrol approaching and runs away possible reaction points and eof considerations you have reasonable grounds to detain the individual for questioning however although the digging may seem suspicious the activity of digging hole by itself is not demonstration of hostile intent it is possible that there could be additional facts such as digging holes in known red zone where us forces are attacked with ieds that would make the patrol believe the man is actually threat to your unit you should not use deadly force unless you feel the individual poses threat you can give chase and physically restrain the man but you 14center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyshould not fire warning shots to stop the man or shoot at the individual unless there is threat action against your unit every soldier must be vigilant and attuned to the surrounding environment situational awarenesssituational understanding when conducting dismounted patrols ºbe alert when interacting with the local population ºlook for behaviorsindicators that clue you to the possibility of insurgent activity in the patrol area the following actions could signal possible imminent insurgent activities such as small arms attack complex ambush sniper or suicide improvised explosive device ied attack either by vehicle or explosive vest c42is there sudden absence of people in what is normally congested urban area c42what does the graffiti on buildings say do you have an interpreter with you on patrol c42do you notice suspicious body language eye movement and tense posture when interacting with locals c42is it time for scheduled islamic prayer at local mosque yet locals are conspicuously absent c42are shops closed during what are normally regularly scheduled business hours c42do you notice video cameramen in the area but recognizable news media personnel c42are there children using cell phones when they come into contact with your element ºwhen you interact with the local populace be approachable yet cautious and always maintain an offensive posture scenario 14 mounted patrol during patrol your unit sees two men digging on the side of road frequently traveled by us forces you know there have been multiple attacks with buried ieds on this stretch of road within the last two weeks and the s2 has templated this particular area for possible ied attacks in the next 72 hours you also know that farmers in this area do not dig at this particular time of day the men see the patrol and flee possible reaction points and eof considerations determination of hostile intent is based on all the available facts and evidence the threat may not be immediate or instantaneous the facts 15eof handbook us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyknown to the patrol make it reasonable to believe the individuals should be detained there is also reason to believe the men pose hostile threat to the patrol you should use eof measures to include warning shots and if necessary deadly force if circumstances allow for it less than lethal force should be used however you may immediately use the full range of eof measures scenario 15 mounted or dismounted patrol during patrol you see two adult men digging hole beside welltraveled route you see that one of them has an ak47 and the other bundle of wires your patrol attempts to stop the men who flee at the sight of the patrol possible reaction points and eof considerations given the facts there are reasonable grounds to detain the men for tactical questioning furthermore there is evidence that the men are demonstrating hostile intent under the standing roe definition of imminent use of force the use of force does not necessarily have to be immediate and based on all the facts you could reasonably conclude us forces were threatened with force you may use force up to and including deadly force to prevent the men from escaping you should if possible use eof measures to include firing warning shots if at any time you feel threat to your patrols safety for example one of the men turns and points the ak47 in the patrols direction you may

adapting basics to the operational environment paradigm linking doctrine to ttp the army has always taught the principles needed to win the eof fight the jrtc focus is on soldiers because the individual soldier is the one who makes life and death decisions to shoot or not jrtc leaders and ocs fully understand that training soldiers in eof is monumental responsibility requiring extraordinary guidance and supervision from leaders at every level turning to basics offers way to approach the complexities of eof consider defense leaders do not put soldiers into positions without guidance leaders define an engagement area position forces and assign sectors of fire provide information about adjacent units and give instruction on what to do upon contact leaders define engagement priorities and engagement criteria these same steps can be applied to tcp and eof multinational corpsiraq mnci and the army have defined the eof process applying it to given tcp is exactly the same as defining defense as the engagement area is defined leaders must draw the trigger lines from nonlethal to lethal for their soldiers those same leaders must rehearse their soldiers this approach frames how the jrtc implements and trains rotational units on eof issues prerotation contacts and training as part of all prerotational training ocs monitor mnci and major subordinate commands secret

process through daily synchronization meeting that reviews and adjusts to unit interactions and consequencemanagement efforts in support of that effort the jrtc center for army lessons learned office developed standardized eof report that allows the ocs to collect data on eof events throughout the rotational unit area of operations for example scripted or planned events for rotational unit fob such as pregnant woman or injured local present opportunities to train the unit on eof as ocs gather data on the results oc divisions also report all planned and hasty tcp locations so that plansemc can direct roleplay personnel and vehicle traffic to those locations these hasty tcps afford the operations group an opportunity to facilitate eof training data from these reports is collected by the joint operations center battle captain and used in the commanding generals daily situational update the information is also provided to the unit as part of the bct aar eof incident report eof

soldiers and the citizens of the host nation which creates positive image of coalition forces summary eof procedures integrated into training are intended to replicate the operational environment soldiers face every day eof training has the primary goal of improving both leader and soldier reactions when graduated response is necessary demonstrating appropriate eof procedures begins with mindset that balances offensive and defensive operations the ultimate benefit of eof training is the prevention of unnecessary loss of life and injuries to soldiers and noncombatants the presence of perceived hostile action or demonstrated hostile intent only creates the necessity to act or respond the guidelines for proportionality mandate that the action or response be reasonable in intensity duration and magnitude based on the totality of circumstances lethal force cannot be the default option other options including military nonlethal weaponscapabilities must be available and used when appropriate commanders report that there is direct correlation between an increase in eof incidents and the number of fratricide incidents everyone must maintain heightened sense of situational awareness of the immediate environment including visibility on elements that are not normally part of the organic task organization contractors on the battlefield nongovernmental organizations

delivery and wishes for healthy but his first thought is oh god what will they do if i die at us checkpoint civilians dont know what to do when coming into contact with the us military c45true or false the answer is decidedly true in fact as hard as it is for soldiers to predict the next move of an ordinary civilian approaching hasty checkpoint it may be just as hard for that civilian to discern the exact intentions of soldier pointing gun at or near him in iraq and afghanistan i met families whose homes were destroyed by us operations their loved ones were taken in the blink of an eye i also visited with american soldiers who told stories of the splitsecond decisions they have to make every day sometimes ending in tragedy what struck was how many soldiers and civilians wanted the same two things stability in the country and to stay alive if mishandled escalation of force eof threatens both groups and both goals it is therefore in the militarys interest to do it right and that must include an understanding of what ordinary civilians experience when interacting with our troops an early 2007 poll conducted by the american broadcasting channel british broadcasting channel and usa today found that when asked the source of violence near their neighborhood more than fortyfour percent of respondents cited unnecessary violence against citizens by us or coalition forces whether accurate or not the numbers paint picture of perception on the ground among the local population from baghdad to kabul civilian perception of us intentions is critical it is just as important for us forces to understand the intentions of civilians and to see them as necessary part of the militarys working group on the question of force escalation civilians have life or death stake in the answer the same as our troops do in iraq i participated in working group of civilians discussing how to make it safer for them nearly every concern centered on how to interface with the us military what do they mean when they wave their hands at my car what do they mean when they shout at what should i do when i see checkpoint that wasnt there yesterday is it really americans or is it insurgents that want to kidnap without answers american soldiers intentions however noble may be easily misunderstood one suggestion i heard was to announce by loudspeaker an imminent home raid so as to allow women and children to escape to do so naturally would undercut the militarys ability to target insurgents believed to be hiding there but the civilians misunderstanding of the military imperative only

job of laying out how to deal with civilians in potentially volatile situations the following recommendations from the civilian perspective may help ensure the splitsecond eof decisions made in theater dont cost unnecessary loss of life on either side someone elses shoes consider waiting at busy checkpoint an american soldier is waving and has shown his weapon is he gesturing to you or to the shady character in the car next to you should you proceed what if the car next to you is suicide bomber and now youre forced to stop next to him with your kids in the back seat considering the civilian view in situation like this can help explain lot of seemingly erratic and hostile behavior public relations hearts and minds wont be won solely by mitigating harm civilians have to be told that harm is being mitigated and they need to see the results of the improvements the military is making when an iraqi mother loses her to stray bomb she will never get him back improvement of procedures will often reduce the death toll but to those suffering the losses its important to remember that less death is still more than death at all clear signs are all signs at checkpoints posted in all of the local languages are they big enough in areas of low literacy like much of afghanistan are the signs also clearly illustrated this is particularly important in preparing the population to deal with hasty checkpoints us troops using the element of surprise neednt bear the emotional weight of having killed or maimed innocent lives warnings in iraq there has emerged pattern of deaths caused by warning shots fired into vehicles at checkpoints to the passengers in those cars and their families that the shot was intended as warning is understandably of little consolation if its believed at all respecting suffering tragic outcome following an eof incident should always be acknowledged american humanity means showing compassion for suffering and thinking strategically means reassuring civilians that soldiers are trying their best in difficult situation to avoid harming them ultimately peace in iraq and afghanistan depends on an understanding of when where and how force will be used c45and that means avoiding one misunderstanding at time 82center for army lessons learned us unclassified rel nato gctf isaf mcfi abca for official use onlyappendix c references for
