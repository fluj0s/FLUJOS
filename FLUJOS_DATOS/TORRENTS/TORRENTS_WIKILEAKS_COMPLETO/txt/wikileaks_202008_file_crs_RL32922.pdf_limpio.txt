first designed in the early 1900s has kept pace with changes in the food production and marketing industries several significant changes in meat and poultry inspection programs were included in the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 signed into law in june 2008 these include permitting some state inspected meat and poultry products to enter interstate commerce just like usdainspected products bringing

issues that could received continued attention in the 111th congress which also could consider broader legislation to reform food safety programsincluding those of the us food and drug administration fda which oversees all foods other than meat and poultry among the more sweeping options has been proposal to consolidate federal food safety responsibilities including those of fsis under single independent food agency is enough being done to address longstanding concerns about naturally occurring microbiological contamination in 1996 fsis added sweeping new system known as hazard analysis and critical control point haccpessentially plantspecific contamination prevention planson top of the traditional sight smell and touchbased inspection system however large recalls due to pathogen problems are still occurring and significant declines in the incidence of major foodborne pathogens have not occurred in recent years according to government data past proposals to delineate pathogen performance standards andor safe tolerance levels could again be offered should usda have new authority to mandate recalls of suspect meat and poultry products as advocates have requested fsis now relies on the establishments to recall adulterated products but asserts that this approach along with othe r enforcement tools is sufficient to protect consumers those wanting mandatory recall authority also contend that an improved ability to trace animals meat and poultry products should be built into the system to make recalls more effective does fsis have adequate funding and resources andor should industry pay more for inspection fsis inspection is mainly funded through usdas annual appropriation congress has denied successive administrations proposals for new user fees separately congress slowed fsiss implementation of controversial new risk based inspection system rbis now being retooled as the public health based inspection system aimed at shifting some existing fsis

particularly with regard to its import safety program at the same time large recalls of fresh and processed meat and poultry products often due to microbiological contamination and illness outbreaks caused by such products continue to challenge the industry and government regulators fsis policies came under renewed scrutiny in early 2008 after the agency announced the largest meat recall ever after evidence emerged that california beef plant had slaughtered for food number of nonambulatory cattle in viol ation of both humane slaughter law and food safety rules these incidents fueled interest in number of bills in the 110 th congress to change other elements of usdas authorizing statutes what if any additional changes should the 111congress consider to improve safety oversight of meat and poultry production g21g157g138g157g158g157g152g155g162g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g146g142g156g561

to inspect all cattle sheep swine goats horses mules and other equines brought into any plant to be slaughtered and processed into products for human consumption since passage of the fy2006 usda appropriation pl 10997 section 798 these types of animals are now called amenable species pl 10997 also gave the secretary of agriculture the discretion to add additional species to the list but none have been added under this discretionary authority as noted the 2008 farm bill makes catfish an amenable species 1fsis responsibilities are separately authorized and operate under considerably different regulatory framework than those of fda these differences could have significance in the longstanding debate over the need if any for reorganizing us food safety authorities and programs see

agreement with fsis must demonstrate that its system is equivalent to federal inspection however state inspected meat and poultry products are limited to intrastate commerce only in states that have discontinued their inspection systems for meat or poultry or both fsis has assumed responsibility for inspection at the formerly stateinspected plants however actual inspection is performed by state

imals also is an important nonfood source in the initial years of haccp implementation plants that failed three consecutive salmonella tests could have their usda inspectors withdrawn this would effectively shut down the plant until the problem could be remedied however federal court ruled in 2000 that the meat and poultry inspection statutes do not give usda the authority to use salmonella standards as the basis for withdrawing inspection from plant that has not met them an appeals court upheld this decision in 2001 subsequently usda has adopted the position that the court decision did not affect the agencys ability to use the standards as part of the verification of plants sanitation and haccp plans nonetheless the appeals court ruling supports ar guments of those who say that pathogen testing results should not be basis for enforcement actions until scientists can determine what constitutes an unsafe level of salmonella in ground meat and number of other meat and poultry products consumer groups and other supporters of mandatory testing and microbiological standards as well as of increased enforcemen t powers have used the case to bolster their argument for amending

noted that coli o157h7 is one of hundreds of strains of the bacterium escherichia coli although most strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals this strain produces powerful toxin and can cause severe illness coli o157h7 was first recognized as cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea the outbreak was traced to contaminated hamburgers since then most infections have come from eating undercooked ground beef cdc also noted that people have also become ill from eating contaminated bean sprouts or fresh leafy vegetables such as lettuce and spinach personto person contact in families and child care centers is also known mode of transmission in addition infection can occur after drinking raw milk and after swimming in or drinking sewage contaminated water 10 in october 1994 fsis began testing samples of raw ground beef for coli o157h7 and declared that any such product found with this pathogen would be considered adulteratedthe first time foodborne pat hogen on raw pr oduct was declared an adulterant under the meat inspection law industry groups immediately asked texas federal court for preliminary injunction to halt this effort on the grounds that it was not promulgated through appropriate rulemaking procedures was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded usdas regulatory authority under law in december 1994 the court denied the groups request and appeal was filed leaving the program in place fsis has taken tens of thousands of samples since the program began to date hundreds of samples have tested positive in september 2002 fsis issued press release stating that the scientific data show that coli o157h7 is more prevalent than previously estimated and in october 2002 the agency published notice requiring manufacturers of all raw beef products not just ground beef to reassess their haccp plans and add control points for coli o157h7 if the reassessment showed that the pathogen was likely hazard in the facilitys operations fsis inspectors are to verify that corrective steps have been taken and conduct random testing of all beef processing plants including all grinders some previously

the testing starting in march 2007 of beef trim which is used in ground beef requiring beef plants to verify that they are effectively controlling coli o157h7 during slaughter and processing directing its inspectors to use new checklist to review establishment control procedures beginning testing other types of materials used in ground beef in addition to beef trim and requiring importing countries to conduct equivalent sampling better targeting its routine coli testing and working to speed up recalls 14 nonetheless as noted coli positives climbed in 2008 as the year was ending fsis and other

confirmed 46 cases of the disease with 7 deaths and 3 stillbirths or miscarriages the recall covered products made as early as may 2002 and officials stated that very little of the meat was still available to be recovered in december 2002 fsis issued directive to inspection program personnel giving new and specific instructions for monitoring processing plants that produce hot dogs and deli meats21 in june 2003 fsis announced the publication of an interim final rule to reduce listeria in readyto eat meats rather than set performance standards as the february 2001 proposed rule would have the new regulation requires plants that process rte foods to add control measures specific to listeria to their haccp and sanitation plans and to verify their effectiveness by testing and disclosing the results to fsis the rule directs fsis inspectors to conduct random tests to verify establishments programs plants are subject to different degrees of fsis verification testing depending upon what type of control steps they adopt in their haccp and sanitation plans 22 on january 4 2005 the consumer federation of america cfa issued report sharply criticizing usdas listeria rulemaking cfa asserted that the department essentially adopted meat industry positions in weakening the final rule such as by deleting proposed plant testing requirements and by not explicitly requiring that haccp plans include listeria controls in 2003 listeria illnesses increased by 22 cfa contended citing cdc data 23 usda and meat industry officials countered that the number of product recalls related to listeria had declined from 40 in 2002 to 14 in 2003 that the rise in listeriosis cases was quite small in 2003 after four years of declines and that the interim rule provides more incentives for plants to improve safety the cdcs 2006 and 2007 foodnet reports indicated that the incidence of foodborne illness caused by listeria which had reached its lowest level in 2002 compared with 19961998 baseline has not continued to decline significantly in more recent years 24 recalls of fsisregulated products continue in 2005 the largest was december 2005 recall of 28 million pounds of various bologna ham and turkey lunchmeat products by conagra another 28 listeria related recalls were announced during 2005 involving approximately 649000 pounds of processed meat and poultry products

ordered halt to fsiss work on what the agency was calling more robust riskbased inspection system rbis aimed at enabling the agency to rebalance existing inspection resources26 the objective of this initiative was to improve public health by placing greater inspection and verification emphasis on federally inspected meat and poultry establishments that pose greater risks in more robust rbis each establishments risk could be categorized and the type and intensity of inspection could be based primarily on that risk27 more specifically the initiative was to enable fsis to shift some processing inspection resources from lowerrisk products and plants to relatively higherrisk products for example ground poultry and to plants with relatively poor safety records usda in february 2007 had announced timetable for introducing rbis beginning in april 2007 at 30 locations representing about 254 processing but not yet slaughter establishments about fourth of these plants would come under closer scrutiny about fourth less scrutiny and about half would receive approximately the same level of attention as currently usda official said he added that all plants will still be under daily inspection and fulltime employees would not be reduced under rbis 28 public comments to fsis on rbis and hearings by house appropriations subcommittee indicated that many agreed in concept with riskbased inspection but were concerned that the agency had provided too few specifics on how it would be implemented lacked the data it needed to implement it and should consider doing it through formal rulemaking few warned that it could undermine rather than strengthen safety oversight and wondered whether the agency has the statutory authority to change inspection frequency 29 several interest groups reiterated their concerns following the earlier february 22 2007 usda announcement the american meat institute representing major meat packers said in statement that it was concerned that the hasty launch of the initiative could jeopardize consumer confidence in meat and poultry and that details of exactly how the program would work still were unclear several consumer groups

testified in favor of obtaining these new enforcement tools to improve food safety in general and to strengthen usdas enforcement of the new haccp system in particular these groups have asserted that civil fines would serve as an effective deterrent and could be imposed more quickly than criminal penalties or the withdrawal of inspection they also have argued that the authority to assess civil penalties would permit usda to take strongerand more rapidaction against bad actorsor those processors who persistently violate food safety standards food safety advocates argue that fsis should have the authority to mandate product recalls as backup guarantee in case voluntary recalls moved too slowly or were not comprehensive enough meat and poultry industry trade associations have testified in opposition to granting usda new enforcement powers both producers and processors argue that current authorities are sufficient and that only once has plant refused to comply with usdas recommendation to recall suspected contaminated product industry representatives have testified that usda s current authority to withdraw inspection thereby shutting down plant is strong enough economic penalty to deter potential violators and punish socalled bad actors furthermore they say new enforcement powers would increase the potential for plants to suffer drastic financial losses from suspected contamination incidents that could ultimately be proven false some observers argue that much still needs to be done to educate consumers and restaurateurs about safe meat and poultry handling and cooking practices in august 2004 the consumer group center for science in the public interest cspi began national campaign to urge usda to publicize the names of retail outlets where recalled meat has been distributed so that consumers can learn more quickly whether they have purchased potentially contaminated products usda and industry leaders have contended that distribution records are proprietary and exempt from provisi ons of the federal freedom of information act such information they argue should be limited ma inly to public officials so that they can monitor recalls however in the march 7 2006 federal register fsis proposed posting on its website the names of retailers who have products subject to voluntary recall fsis announced on july 11 2008 that it would begin to post

disease the traceability issue has also been debated in connection with protecting against agroterrorism verifying the us origin of live cattle and meat products for export and facilitating recalls to prevent or contain foodborne illness outbreaks among other things supporters of animal id and meat traceability poi nt out that most major meatexporting countries already have domestic animal id systems the us meat industry argued in the past that such system would not be based on sound science an d would be technically unworkable however since the domestic bse case the industry usda and other professionals have been attempting to implement universal although not mandatory national animal id but not meat traceability system focused on animal disease control rather than food safety per

sufficiently staffing its service obligations to the meat and poultry industries usually combination of factors causes these shortages including new technologies that increase plant production speeds and volume insufficient appropriated funds to hire additional inspectors at times of unexpected increases in demand for inspections and problems in finding qualified people to work in dangerous or unpleasant environments or at remote locatio ns these staffing problems were complicated somewhat by the addition of haccp requirements on top of the traditional inspection duties to ease funding pressures most administrations over the past 20 years have proposed to charge the meatpacking industry new user fees sufficient to cover the entire cost or at least portion of federal inspection services fsis has been authorized since 1919 to charge user fees for holiday and overtime inspections and does so the primary rationale for more extensive user fees has been that resources would then be adequate to hire new inspectors as necessary usda economists estimate that the cost passed on to consumers from such fee would be more than one cent per pound meat industry and consumer groups have consistently opposed increased fees arguing that food safety is public health concern that merits taxpayer support as part of its fy2009 budget submitted to congress in february 2008 the bush

section 11015 of the enacted farm bill pl 110246 amends the fmia and the ppia to authorize new optin program for stateinspected plants this program is to supplement rather than replace the existing federalstate cooperative inspection program in states that choose to participate federally employed coordinator would supervise state employees in plants that want to ship across state lines eligible plants are limited to those with 25 or fewer employeesexcept that plants with between 25 and 35 employees can apply for coverage within the first three years of enactment the law sets federal reimbursement for state costs under the new program at 60 the current federalstate cooperative inspection program provides reimbursement at 50 of costs products inspected under the new program are to carry the federal mark of inspection other provisions prohibit federally inspected establishments from participation establish new technical assistance division to assist the states and require periodic audits by usda among other things the new program which reflects language in the senate version of the farm bill reportedly was developed as compromise by those on both sides of the issue it appears to be based in concept on the talmadgeaiken program see page 4 some proponents of ending the interstate ban on stateinspected meat have contended that the new language is overly restrictive while those who support the change have countered that it provides appropriate safeguards the farm bill requires final rules to implement the new state program by december 2009

operating under variety of statutes this complex system is supplemented by many state food safety programs gao which has looked at the matter several times noted in one report that the federal food safety system emerged piecemeal over many decades typically in response to particular health threats or economic crises the result is fragmented legal and organizational structure that gives responsibility for specific food commodities to different agencies and provides them with significantly different authorities to enforce food safety laws 37 in its january 2007 annual report gao newly designated food safety oversight as one of 29 high risk federal program areas the report among other things recommended that congress consider fundamental reexamination of the system and other improvements to help ensure the rapid detection of and response to any accidental or deliberate contamination of food before public health and safety is compromised 38 besides gao the national academy

g343g351g561g11g151g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 in the 110th congress single food agency bills were introduced in february 2007 as hr 1148 by representative delauro and s 654 by senator durbin the measures would have combined federal food safety programs including meat and poultry inspection under new independent food safety administration to be headed by an administrator appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate the new administrator would have been required to conduct comprehensive analysis of food safety hazards and to adopt and implement national program that among other things requires registration of all domestic and foreign food establishments doing business in the united states the bills would have required the formulation of food safety performance standards set out inspection procedures for establishments provided for research and education programs and included enforcement and penalty provisions 40 the omnibus farm bill hr 2419 that cleared the senate included provision establishing bipartisan congressional food safety commission to study the federal food safety system and recommend needed changes another provision in the same measure would have required the president to consider these changes and report to congress on legislation needed to effect them the provision was removed by farm bill conferees interest in reorganizing the agencies andor enhancing their resources and authorities particularly those of fda was the topic of numerous 2007 and 2008 congressional hearings including hearings before representative delauros house appropriations subcommittee and several subcommittees of the house energy and commerce committee panels on both sides of congress held hearings on the safety of imported food products including meat and poultry where agency organization and resources were at issue as well if as is possible lawmakers in the 111th congress are asked to consider new proposals that would either reorganize or consolidate the federal food sa fety organization range of policy options are likely to be debated including whether the current regulatory approaches and their authorizing statutes remain appropriate given the diversity of food types health risks methods of production and sources of supply the continuously evolving science on foodborne illness and how to prevent future outbreaks the impacts on industry competitiveness particularly in global economy and funding constraints another uncertainty is whether food safety reform efforts would be limited to fda authorities and programs alone or would be extended further to those of fsis and other agencies one factor mitigating against the latter approach is that jurisdiction over fda and fsis is split between separate committees in both the house and senate g10g152g155g156g142g561g21g149g138g158g144g145g157g142g155g561 nearly 105000 horses were slaughtered in the united states in 2006 for human food mainly for european and asian consumers such slaughter was conducted under federal inspection at two foreignowned plants in texas and another foreignowned plant in illinois debate has focused on the acceptability of using horses for human food and the costs of longterm care for such horses or of disposing of their carcasses if they longer went for human food 40 more recent bill hr 7143 introduced by representative delauro on september 26 2008 also seeks to reorganize food safety but it focuses on elevating the food safety functions of fda by creating new agency within the hhs department

g344g342g561although legislation has been debated in congress to curtail such slaughter see below the plants activities became constrained in 2007 by the courts and state law federal lawsuit filed by the owners of the two texas slaughter plants beltex corporation and dallas crown inc sought to clarify that texas state law first passed in 1949 to prevent the use of horsemeat for human food was not enforceable and that they should not be prosecuted the us district court for the northern district of texas in fort worth had earlier agreed with the plants owners that the law had been repealed was preempted by the fm ia and violated the dormant commerce clause of the us constitution however on january 19 2007 panel of the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit rejected all three arguments in the lower courts ruling declaring the texas law to be in force and clearing the way for the state attorney general to prosecute the plant owners if they continued to operate elsewhere the illinois legislature passed law banning horse slaughter for food the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit by fall 2007 ruled against the argument of the plant owned by cavel international that the illinois law violates the interstate and foreign commerce clauses of the us constitution bringing cavels operations there to close the us supreme court in 2008 declined to hear the case g11g151g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 the 109th congress had debated whether to ban horse slaughter and in the fy2006 appropriation had banned the use of federal funds for antemortem inspection of horses at meat processing plants although supporters of the ban had hoped that the lack of federal funds for such inspection would force an end to horse slaughter the practice continued with the three plants paying user fees for the federal service until legal and statelevel developments challenged the plants see above also in the 109th congress the full house approved bill hr 503 to ban horse slaughter but action occurred on senate version s 1915 bills in the 110th congress to ban the movement or possession of horses for slaughter included hr 503 and s 311 the senate commerce science and transportation committee approved s 311 without amendments on april 25 2007 but the measure did not advance another bill hr 6598 introduced later in the 110th congress would have amended the criminal portion title 18 of the us code to make it illegal to knowingly possess ship transport purchase sell deliver or receive any horse horseflesh or carcass intended for human consumption the judiciary committee favorably reported hr 6598 on september 23 2008 but it too was not enacted meanwhile the omnibus appropriation for fy2008 pl 110161 in division section 741 had both continued the ban on using appropriated funds for inspecting horses and also prohibited the usdafsis rule that enabled the collection of user fees for such purposes the continuing resolution for fy2009 also appears to continue the ban see crs report rs21842 horse slaughter prevention bills and issues by geoffrey s becker g4g21g7g561 g16g152g155g157g145g561g3g150g142g155g146g140g138g151g561g5g138g156g142g156g561
