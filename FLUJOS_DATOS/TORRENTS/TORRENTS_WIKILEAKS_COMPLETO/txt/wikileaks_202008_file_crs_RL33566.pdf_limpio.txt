foreign policy issues in the middle east ranging from the continued instability arising from the lack of comprehensive settlement to the arabisraeli peace process to the preservation of banons sovereignty nd independence which remains hampered by the inability to disarm hezbollah though the primary combatants were part of triangular dynamic in which israel was and still is at war with hezbollah in lebanon nd with palestinia n militants including hamas in the gaza strip there were secondary players who added additional yers of complexity to the conflict namely iran and syria3 both countries have played significant roles in arming training and financing hezbolla h and to lesser exte nt hamas and have used the lebanese shiite organization as proxy to further their own goals in the region iran may have aspirations to beco the dominant power in the middle east and many in the international community are closely focused on its potential weapons of mass destruction capability in this lig ht the fighting in southern lebanon was viewed by some as contest between two of the middle easts most bitter rivals and most powerful actors israel and iran via hezbollah by proxy and it could be harbinger of future indirect confront ations between two possibly nucleararmed nations the root causes of the conflict hezbollahs july 2006 attack inside is raeli territory and repeated

lost to israel in the june 1967 six day war and finds nonstate groups like hezbollah and other palestinian terrorist or ganizations based in damascus as useful proxies most analysts believe the

the immediate cessation by hezbolla h of all attacks and the immediate cessation by israel of all offensive military operations the resolution provides expansion of the existing interim force in

with the deployment of u n and lebanese forces to the south ban on delivery of weapons to any entity or individual in lebanon except the lebanese army the resolution requested the secretary general to develop proposals within 30 days for delin eation of lebanons in ternational borders including the disputed shiba farms enclave located near the lebanesesyrianisraeli triborder area the resolutions

welcomes decision by the lebanese government to deploy 15000 personnel from th lebanese armed forces to southern lebanon as the israeli forces withdraw there are questions however about the likely effectiveness of banese troops in maintaining stab ility the 70000member lebanese armed forces have limited capab ilities and largely obsolescent equipment moreover they ar divided along religious sectarian lines although lebanons leaders have tried in recent years to build professional and more integrated force although the g overnment does not release figures on the sectarian composition of the lebanese armed forces according to former lebanese army general elias hanna the armys officer corps is predominantly christian and sunni muslim while the rank nd file is about 70 shiite7

think there is an expectation that this force is going to physically disarm hezbollah i think its little bit of misreading about how you di sarm militia you have to have plan first of all for the disarmament of the militia and then the hope is that some people lay down their arms voluntarily while israel has demanded that peacekeepers be deployed along the lebanese syrian border to prevent hezbollahs rea rmament by syria and iran lebanese prime minister fouad siniora stated on august 28 2006 that the lebanese armed forces have already been deployed along the border and that there is need for an international presence there syrias presid ent bashar alasad had threatened earlier to close the border should peacekeepers ta ke up positions close to syria in an interview with dubai

prevent the smuggling of arms to hezbollah release of prisoners8 international mediators ve been working through diplomatic channels to free the israeli corporal kidnapped by the hamas military wing and two other groups on june 25 almo st from that date the kidnappers and their supporters have insisted that the isr aeli soldier be exchanged for some of the thousands of palestinian pr isoners being held by isr ael although the kidnappers initially and specifically demanded the release of women and minors in israeli custody their subsequent mands have been less precise the mediators efforts have been hampered by hamass dema nd specifically damascusbased hamas political bureau chief khalid almishals demand for simultaneous prisoner swap and by israels reluctance to agree to any ac tions that would appear to be an exchange or concession to the blackmail of kidna pings egyptian officials are said to be mediating and there are unconfirmed reports that prisoner exchange is in the works

5 that israel and hezbollah had agreed to have him mediate an exchange of prisoners for the release of the two israeli soldiers kidnapped on the northern borde r of israel by hezbollah on july 12 and that he would appoint an envoy to conduct secret negotiations israeli officials immediately reacted by saying that they would not negotiate prisoner release but they have taken actions which contradict their statements and indicate that they expect an exchange in addition to holding several lebanese prisoners one of whom has been in jail as convicted murderer since 1979 israeli forces reportedly captured about dozen he zbollah fighters and brought the corpses of others to israel during the recent war specifically in order to exchange them for the captured soldiers after the war10 israel has exchanged many hezbollah prisoners for few israeli captives and corpses via third party mediators on past occasions while the current israeli government would prefer not to follow that precedent and apparently launched the recen t war partly to end it the captives families and much of the israeli public demand th return of the abductees which appears to require an exchange continued fighting in gaza11 while fighting continues in the gaza strip it has abated somewhat in lebanon since au gust as rockets have been launched less frequently the israeli defense forces have taken over some former settlements in gaza and deployed just beyond the gaza bor der in order to make sporadic incursions into palestinian areas to attack terrorists rocket launching sites and tunnels used to smuggle arms into gaza however their use of air and artillery strikes appears to have been curtailed somewhat this may have been due to shifting of regular israeli forces and resources to the northern front against lebanon and their replacement by reservists it is not yet cl ear if hostilities will ree scalate in gaza with the cessation of hostilities in banon some 200 palestinians have been killed since these operations began after the june 25 kidna ping of an israeli soldier prisoner exchange might continue to constrain the fighting much of the fighting in gaza is in tramural ie between supporters and opponents of the hamasled government the wellarmed palestinian security forces manned largely by fatah opponents of the g overnment have repeatedly confronted the hamas military wing and ot her armed groups loyal to government crime rates also reportedly have risen12 violence also may be attributed to the dire economic straits into which gaza has fallen since the international community and israel cut the transfer of funds to the pa lestinian authority pa af ter hamas assumed leadership of the pa government in march palestin ian security forces and other government employees hold the hamasled government responsible for the resulting nonpayment of salaries israel also has sealed off the gaza strip only allowing in sufficient humanitarian aid shipments to stave

enclave near the lebanonsyriaisrael triborder area know n as the shiba farms continues to exacerbate tensions in southern lebanon and complicate implementation of ceasefire terms earlier the withdrawal of isr aeli forces from southern lebanon in may 2000 left several small but sensitive border issues unresolved including the shiba farms israel did not evacuate this enclave arguing that it is not lebanese territory but rather is part of the syrian golan heights which israel occupied in 1967 lebanon supported by syria asserted that this territory is part of lebanon and should have been evacuated by israel when the latter abandoned its selfdeclared security zone in southern lebanon in 2000 on june 16 2000 the secretary general informed the security council that the requirement for israel to withdraw from southern lebanon had been met thereby implying th at the shiba farms are not part of lebanon14 the secretary general did point out however that the determination does not prejudice the rights of syria nd lebanon to agree on an international boundary in the future leaders of hezbollah immediately ized upon the shiba farms issue as justifying hezbollahs refusal to relinqui sh its weapons arguing that the weapons were needed to confront israel while the latter continued to occupy the shiba farms hizbollah also argued that it was justified in continuing to launch periodic rocket attacks on israeli military units in or near the shiba farms area to c ounter alleged threats posed by israeli forces in the area for the next halfdecade this area remained focal point for violence and border violations among the more serious incidents was the seizure by hezbollah gu errillas in october 2000 of three israeli soldiers whose bodies were handed over to is rael in return for the release of group of hezbollah prisoners in january 2004 th is incident which anticipated the july 2006 kidnaping that triggered the recent is raelihezbollah figh ting was followed by

carried by dubai tv on august 23 2006the situation is made more complex by the fact that syria and lebanon have never demarcated common border nor estab lished formal diplomatic relations the two countries which were twin protectorat under french m andate trusteeship between world wars i and ii never estab lished diplomatic structures or agreed boundaries u pon graining inde pendence in 1943 this was due in part to the influence of some factions in both syria and lebanon who regarded the two as properly constituting single country advo cates of greater syria in particular were reluctant to establish diplomatic relations and boundaries fearing that such steps would imply formal recognition of th separate status of the two states the shiba farms emerged into the limelight once again after political upheavals in lebanon in 2005 and the fighting that erupted in july 2006 as government leaders and diplomats sought to find ways to end the fighting and pursue more lasting peace efforts it became obvious that the status of the shiba farms territory would likely arise at an inc onclusive internationa l conference on lebanon held in rome on july 26 banese prime minister foua d siniora presented seven point proposal which called among other th ings for placing the shiba farms and some adjacent areas under jurisdic tion until border delin eation and lebanese sovereignty over them are fu lly settled the proposal also provided that the shiba farms would be open to property owners during the period of custody security council resolution 1701 of august 11 2006 which brought about cessation of active hostilities did not specifi cally endorse the sevenpoint plan and its proposals for dealing with the shiba farms question however in preambular language the resolution

president bashar alasad informed him that syria is prepared to go ahead with the delineation of its border with lebanon according to the pr ess article that reported the meeting the process of delineation could include the shiba farms area15 at the same time president asad ruled out formal demarcation as distinguished from delineation of the shiba farms boundaries pending israeli withdrawal from the area16 the status of the shiba farms could be an important factor not only in the stability of lebanon but also in any future agreements involving israel lebanon and syria if the shiba farms area forms part of lebanese territory occupied by israel in 1982 it would come under the provisions of resolutions 425 and 426 which addressed israeli withdrawal from lebanon if it forms part of the

in the recent conflict can be credited to variety of factors in the six years since the israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon hezbollah devoted considerable efforts to constructing an extensive defensive infrastructure providing substan tial training to its personnel establishing distributed stockpiles of supplies throug hout the area and preparing operational plans all of these activities are reported to have received very high level of support from iran in the form of funds equipment and personnel18 perhaps the most significant factor in he zbollahs ability to withstand the israeli defense forces idf is an the extensiv network of fortifie d sites and underground facilities these provided protection fo r both personnel and equipment against repeated israeli air attacks forcing th idf to move to ground operations fighting from prepared positions and very well equipped with range of modern weaponry that included antitank and antiship missiles night vision equipment and computer assisted targeting relatively small hezbollah units were able to maintain stiffer resistance than expected hezbollah s stockpiled supplies and local support significantly mitigated the israeli interdiction efforts though isolated by the idf air and ground offensive hezbollah units were often sufficiently provisioned to continue fighting without immediate need for resuppl close familiarity with their area of operations widespread support among th population and effective communication networks enhanced hezbolla hs ability to slow israe li advances often conducting ambushes and rapidly withdrawing in classic guerrilla style warfare though hezbollah units did attempt limited incursions in to israeli territory they were all successfully repulse d nevertheless throughout the conflict hezbollah was able to maintain its campaign of rocket attacks on israeli territory an estimated 40005000 rockets were fired however this represents only third of

most are of rela tively low accuracy by modern standards they remain effective terror w eapons against urban populations though hezbollahs military capabilities may have been substantially reduced and resupply from syria and iran could be mpered by the presence of international peacekeepers in lebanon hezbollahs longt erm potential as guerrilla movement appears to remain intact observers note that hezbollahs leaders have been able to claim level of victory simply by vi rtue of not having decisively lost debate within israel20 israelis overwhelmingly supported the war as legitimate response to an attack on sovereign israeli territory and as long overdue and decisive reaction to six years of hezbollah rocket attacks against nor thern israel as th conflict progressed however the public and media increasingl questioned the governments and the military commanders prosecution of the war after the war critics noted that the kidnapped soldiers had not been freed and th at hezbollah had retained its arms and may have been strengthened politically nd they found fault with government that had produced what they viewed as poor results the charges levied against the government and the military leaders include hesitant decisionmaking excessive reliance on air power delaye d launch of ground offensive which once begun was seen as deficient launching an unnecessary and costly final

for the success of us foreign policy initiatives in the region and for us counterterrorism policy objectives in particular the airing of diverse perspectives towa rd the crisis across the arab and wider islamic worlds brought the competing religious and political priorities of some important figures and groups into contrast and conflict conser vative sunni islamic leaders such as qatarbased cleric and international mu slim brotherhood figure yusuf qaradawi argued that muslims should support the ac tivities of hezbollah and hamas as legitimate r esistance activities based on quranic injunctions to defend muslim territory invaded by outsiders69 similarly egypts grand mufti ali gomaa stated that hezbollah was defendi ng its country and its actions were not terrorism70 saudi sheikh salman awda called for sunnis to set aside their fundamental and deep disagreement w ith hezbollah and shiites in order to confront the criminal jews and zionists71 while many of the strongest statements that were issued appeared to primarily serve rhetorical purposes they may have continuing political implications many religious figures sought to distance themselves from the more nuanced positions of arab political leaders during the crisis some of whom have otherwise been characterized as detached from public opinion and vulnerable to revolt moreove r groups or individuals may utilize religious figures judgments and statements to justify future attacks on the interests or personnel of israel the united states or their own governments should the crisis flare up again disagreements also emerged among violent sunni islamist extremists including qaeda and its affiliates in july 31 internet posting an qaeda in the arabian peninsula representative seemingly rejected any unitarian sentiment between violent sunni groups and hezbollah by characterizing hezbollah as the head of the iranian spear in the arab region and arguing th at any support to hezbollah in lebanon is indirect support for the iranian objectives72 the view of qaeda leadership figures as expressed by ayman zawahiri first in video released on july 27 and again on september 11 remains somewhat ambi guous with regard to sectarian issues on july 27 zawahiri stated that our nation will get together to fight israel and its allies but he refrained from directly urging sunni shiite unity or advocating direct sunni support for hezbollah73 hezbollah official interviewed on jazeera television following the release of zawahi ris july tape stated that zawahirishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33566crs28 74

have been clearer in its reference to the ideological and political dimensions of unity among muslims and th at in the future there should be clear and direct references to hizballah and shiites in positive sense74 in september zawahiri addressed his advice and urgi ngs to muslims ar ound the world and in lebanon rather than addressing the sectar ian questions raised by hezbollah and others he specifically called on the muslim nation to aid its muslim brothers in lebanon and gaza and urged lebanese muslims to reject international resolutions particularly the recent s ecurity council resolution 170175 any resolution of the ongoing sunni jihadist debate regarding the appropriate stan ce toward shiites will likely have broader implications for any potential intervention in future conflict involving shiites by sunni jihadist cells and others who look to qaeda leaders for guidance conclusion there are many divergent interpretations of the julyaugust war in lebanon and its implications for us policy in the ddle east on the one hand some consider this conflict to be just the latest battle in global war on terror pitting the democracies of the west and israel against terrorist organizations backed by radical regimes others view the war less in terms of an overall effort against islamic extremism and more of battle between powerful nati onstates seeing lebanon as the battlegr ound in an opening round of an iranianisraeli struggle for regional preeminence still some observers assert that the war is simply another chapter in long history of localized arabisraeli violen ce spurred by the lack of any discernable progress in peace process in reality ther may be elements of truth within all of these perspectives the conflict has posed its own set of challenges for us policy toward lebanon in broader sense the war has jeopardized not only the longterm stability of lebanon but has presented the bush admin istration with basic dilemma on one hand the administration is sympathetic to israeli military action against terrorist organization president bush has spoken in fa vor of israels right of selfdefense on the other hand the fighting dealt setback to administration efforts to support the rebuilding of democratic in stitutions in lebanon one commentator suggested the two major agendas of his bushs presid ency antiterrorism and the promotion of democracy are in danger of colliding with each other in lebanon76 if lebanon disintegrates through return to communal civil strife or becomes closely aligned with syria or iran us go als could be seriously affected the united states would lose promising example of modernizing pluralist state movinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33566crs29 toward resumption of democratic life nd economic reform and quite possibly face return to the chaos that prevailed in lebanon during the 15year civil war such conditions would be likely to foster terrori sm unrest on israels border and other forms of regional instability moreover the growth of syrian or iranian influence or some combination of the two could stre ngthen regional voices supporting extremist and likely antiwestern views associated with clerical regimes iran totalitarian models syria or militant stance toward israel viable ceasefire on the other hand could be an initial step toward furthe r progress in the long quest for regional peace with hezbollah deeply ingrained in lebanese shiite society the movement has become fixture in the political system though whether or not its militia and terrorist wings can be disarmed remains to be seen many israelis remain deeply skeptical over international efforts to disarm hezbollah as the real work of preventing re armament over land sea and air will take place behind the scenes in the months ahead israeli sources are already reporting the renewal of syrian and iranian shipments to hezbollah though such reports are difficult to confirm key aspect of hezbollahs possible rearmament is the role of syria many questions remain concerning syria the willingness of the united states and israel to bring syria into the diplomatic mix syri as influence over hezbollah in lebanon free of syrias military occupation and what demands syria may make in exchange for its possible cooperation some observe rs suggest variety of theoretical incentives that the west could provide syria including the end of its isolation by the united states and the removal of syria from the state departments terrorism list and the relaxation of economic sanctions the tacit recognition of its influence in lebanese politics the ratification of the eu association agreement with syria that provides it with certain trade benefits diminished international pressure regarding the unled investigation into the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri increased financia l support possibly from arab gulf states and finally though less likely resumption of negotia tions over the israelioccupied golan heights longstanding syrian goal ce its defeat in the june 1967 sixday war others believe that us re fusal to reward syria for its intransigence should continue and that any us engagement would undermine western efforts to strengthen lebanese independence and sove reignty even if the unspoke n reality is one in which syrias special role in lebanese affairs is widely recognized after the recent attack on the us embassy in damascus some obs ervers have asserted that the united states and syria share an interest in co mbating islamic extre mism and should renew limited security cooperation and intelligence sharing finally speculation over the winners and losers of the war will most likely be debated for some time israe li officials believe that their overwhelming response to hezbollahs provocation caught it and iran offguard and that israels subsequent operations have eroded its opponents deterrent cap abilities along the israeli lebanese borders neve rtheless there are many isr aelis both in and out of the government who believe that the war was poorly managed did not achieve its goals or was simply illconceived hezbollah claimed that by merely surviving it gained symbolic victory over the more powerful israeli army and that it continued to threaten israel with rocket attacks after weeks of israeli attempts to destroy its arsenal iran may believe that it achieved an ideological victory against israel seeinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33566crs30 the conflict as producing increased ar ab and muslim support for lebanese sh iites and for overall iranian opposition to israel an alysts caution that increased arab and muslim support for hezbollah may simply be temporary phenomenon in response to solidarity with the lebanese people and sympathy for lebanese civilian casualties others see increasing domestic political pressure in moderate arab states and elsewhere such as egypt jordan saudi arabia and even turkey to condemn israel and hold the united states pa rtially responsible for ci vilian casualties in lebanon as way to deal with popular anger and their own islamists httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33566crs31 77 the following

hamas leaders refusal to accept the quartet principles israel ceased its monthly transfers of approximately 55 million in ta xes and customs revenue co llected monthly on behalf of the pa and two

international mechanism to deliver assistance to the palestinian people without transfers to or through hamas or the elements of the pa under its control the loss of customs revenue and direct foreign aid created crippling budgetary shortfalls for the pa and significant derivative economic hardship for many palestinian citizens president abbas referred to the steps as siege and throughout april may and june 2006 tensions over unpaid salaries and disagreements over command responsib ilities flared between the hamasled government and armed security force pers onnel loyal to fatah palestinian leaders including president abbas engaged in several efforts to end the intrapalestinian violence and bring closure to open questions of official palestinian support for the quartet principles see discussion of the national accord document below however before these efforts could bear fruit fresh violence between israel and hamas erupted in the gaza strip and has escalated israelipalestinian fighting84 for many months prior to the late springsummer 2006 outbreak of fighting violence had been somewhat subdued due to some selfimposed restraint by the major players involved in march 2005 hamas and 12 other palestinian groups agreed to extend an informal truce or calm referred to in arabic as hudna withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33566crs33 israel for one year some call the ag reement ceasefire even though it was unilateral palestinian declaration to which israel was not party palestine islamic jihad pij did not agree to the calm and was responsible for several suicide bombings within israel in the period that followed hamas which had been responsible for many suicide bombings during the second intifadah palestinian uprising against israeli occupation that had begun in september 2000 refrained from such attacks after declaring the hudna it did however continue to fire mortars and rockets against israeli settlements in th gaza strip before israels summer 2005 withdrawal from the region and into southern israel after israels withdrawal israel usually responded with air and artillery strikes but it also carried out what it terms targeted killings of terrorists on june 9 2006 palestinian family was killed on gaza beach the palestinians claimed that the victims had been struck by israeli artillery fire but israel denied responsibility for the deat hs nonetheless the incident provoked hamas to call off its truce and intensify rocket fire into southern israel also in june palestinian factions held an intense national dialogue in the west bank and gaza in which they ultimately agreed on national accord document also known as the prisoners document because hamas and fatah leaders imprisoned by israel had collaborated on th first draft to reconcile their positions and goals hamas leaders in damascus notably political bureau chief khalid mishal reportedly did not agree with the national accord document because it might be seen as suggesting that hamas had moderated its views regarding israel and the peace process on june 25 members of the hamas military wing izz addin qassam brigades and two other groups attacked israeli forces in israel just outside of gaza killing two israeli soldiers wounding four and kidnaping one the perpetrators demanded the release of pa lestinian women and minors from israeli prisons some analysts suggest that misha l was behind the attack in order to assert his power over more moderate hamas offici als in the territories and to undermine the national accord on june 27 after unsu ccessful diplomatic effort s to secure the kidnapped soldiers release israeli forces began major operation which israel explained as an effort to rescue the soldier to deter future hamas attacks including rocket launches from gaza into southern israel and to weaken bring down or change the conduct of the hamasled palestinian authority government israeli officials claimed that hamas had crossed red line with the ki dnaping and attack within pre1967 israel but said that israel did not intend to reoccupy gaza on june 28 hamas officials in the pale stinian authority llied themselves with the kidnappers by adopting their demands israeli officials responded by insisting on the unconditional release of the soldier on june 29 israel forces arrested 64 palestinian hamas cabinet

israel international mediators have tried to calm the recent upsurge in violence the egyptians have reportedly pr oposed resolution in which hamas would release the soldier in exchange for an israeli promise to release prisoners at later date on july 10 however khalid mishal insisted on the mutual release or swap of prisoners on the same day israeli pr ime minister ehud olmert re portedly said that trading prisoners with hamas would cause lot of damage to the future of the state of israel perhaps because it would continue precedent that he seeks to break85 he later observed that negotiating with hamas also would signal that moderates such as palestinian authority pa presid ent mahmud abbas are not needed abbas told visiting team that he wanted to delink the crisis in the palestinian areas from the crisis that developed subsequently between israel and hezbollah in lebanon in order to prevent nonpalestinian extremis ts hezbollah from hijacking the leadership of the palestinian issue86 yet neither president abbas nor the hamasled pa government officials repres ent the kidnappers and can bring about resolution hamas leader misha l appears to be in control of key elements in

for hezbollahs attack nasrallah has publicly espoused an intention to kidnap israelis to effectuate prisoner exchange hezbollah however has the capacity to decide to act on its own and could have done so in the spirit of shi triumphalism spurred by the iraqi shiites ascension to power and irans pursuit of nuclear wea pons it also may have acted in solidarity with the besieged palestinians or with its syrian and iranian supporters another explanation is that hezbollah may have wa nted to prevent resolution of the gaza crisis egyptian president hosni mubarak and palestinian authority president mahmud abbas have claimed that an agr eement for prisoner exchange had almost been reached immediately before the hezbollah attack but hezbollahs action complicated or prevented it89 some observers question hezbollahs autonomy and offer other explanations for the july 12 action much speculation fo cuses on whether hezbollah acted at the behest of or with the appr oval of iran its main sponsor because iran also supports hamas or may have wanted to divert international attention from the impasse over its nuclear program if the latter is the case it gained only limited time when the security council postponed considera tion of the nuclear issue due to the lebanon situation because on july 31 th council approved resolution demanding that iran suspend its uranium enrichment program by august 31 or face sanctions others suggest that syria may be using its hezbollah allies to resurrect its influence in lebanon from which it had been forced to withdraw in 200590 other experts give more nuanced appraisal us centcom commander general john abizaid observed that it is more likely that syria and iran are exploiting the situation created by the kidna ping than that they ordered it91 us state department coordinator fo r counterterrorism henry cr umpton reportedly asserted that syria and iran do not control hezbolla h but added that hezbollah asks iranian permission if its actions
