australia significant issues kg250 left the us yesterday thursday 17 ju l 08 us time expected in australia 21 jul 08 still imagery was accessed from the csd server however due to metadata issues unable to place the annotated nitfs back onto the csd imagery products products collected still imagery from china lake that had been placed on the csd imagery quality ok but metadata issues st op our ability to repopulate the annotated nitfs back onto the csd summary success analysts were able to access st ill imagery from china lake that had been placed on the csd lesson learned better understanding of the socet program to exploit imagery and the limitations in some areas the program has when compared to remoteview where help is needed digo it mr mitch honeysett is looking into the

nodes continue to work on integrating dcgsa v3 0 bal into the jbaiic system at echo significant issue at the start of the day the high speed guards to crossdomain data sharing were not place however late in the day the guards were approved to operate and they were turned on and some of the nodes at china lake started testing this capability imagery products products collected dcgsa continues to federate with external nodes and the number of successful node connections continues to increase expect to be able to connect to all nodes by cob on 18 july 2008 summary successes the number of nodes that dcgsa v30 and v31 can federate with has increased for two reasons ddte is starting to stabilize the external nodes are starting to implement the recommended patch the cgs at china lake published mti data and tracks to the dcgsa at china lake the cgs at ft monmouth received the mti data and published tracks to the dcgsa in the t3 lab this was the first day in which the astor syst em was able to provide significant amount of data additional operational data will be available starting 18 july 2008 additional comments status of dcgsa node connections there are total of 12 external nodes

quickly resolved king air imagery will require downloading from the ac post sortie and manually loaded on ec08 servers summary successes solid scan eagle sortie fame is now connected to cfe and will begin processing imagery streams metadata layers tomorrow fame will also perform an initial connectivity test with the harris radios on echo range further engineering work to lower bit rate and increase image quality will need to be done before the initiative is fully operational fame people say that should be close to completion by early next week the misbjitc team continue to collect data in support of their testingcompliance objectives lesson learned good day for we are still aw aiting successful imagery delivery from the ga king air platform additional comments as note the ogc pilots tigershark uas is collecting but is only in the technical sense more specifically it is pro ducing nitfs still frame imagery standard at rate of 2 hz which falls within the definition of motion imagery because of that the jitc lab will not be testing for compliance but their nitf lab will even though the outcome will be of interest to the pilot also of interest is the cooperation between fa mes initiative to push imagery via the harris radios and vpc and will engage maas as well the hope is that fully processed imagery from vpc can be pushed to the fielded warfighter that is equipped with the new harris radios this type of cooperation is highly encouraged and usually leads to synergistic increases in capabilities with that said we are also aware of proprieta ry datadesign sharing that must be agreed to by all sides overall the sense of cooperation within t he related initiatives is very commendable nsgf teg cohosts dcgsic cips deal location pax river australia reston va

dwayne squires mike ellertbeck personnel 8 personnel with issues to report activities summary of planned activities provide live intelligence reporting to tf lancer for gmti and fmv if data not available conduct bluegrass data scenarios significant issues lack of situational awareness created hardship for analysts spoke to doc burklund and rodney brickell about marking blue force vehicles so we would know which are ours we also had idea how many vehicles were in the convoy or when it sped or when they reached cps that should now be worked out as well imagery products products collected sent two salt reports via chat and when we received the chemical alert from agent logic we relayed that via chat imagery quality initial grid coordinate for the chemical release was wrong the grid was wrong on agent logic due to conversion error when they manually converted the latlong from sensorweb to agent logic summary success this was the actual first day of live analysis for the team so although we did not get gmti data we did work out lot of co mmunications issues between pstb analysts tf lancer and the collection management cell lesson learned think through problems more thoroughly before posting them in daily reports reported yesterday that bandwidth was probabl causing slow constant hawk video playback after good nights sleep realized that could not be the real issue more than likely we have disk io speed i ssues further troubleshooting needed to confirm where help is needed we need reliable gmti data it is the only wide area collection platform available to us additional comments sensorweb could be very beneficial integrating shotspotter into their system would be nice enhancement know the sensorweb personnel are already wo rking hard just to get their system fully operational but i do not think the integration will be too difficult to accomplish shotspotter sends out their information in curs or on target messages which shouldnt be too difficult to parse into sensorweb may be worth some emphasis from ec 08 leadership once sensorweb is up raf 5ac sqn 56r sqn location china lake pocs sqn ldr tony reeves flt lt chris bishop personnel 64 personnel with issues
