from us government sources on transfers of c onventional arms to veloping nations by major suppliers for the period 2000 throug h 2007 it also includes some data on worldwide supplier transactions it updates and revise s crs report rl34187 conventional arms transfers to developing nations 19992006 the data in this report provide means for congress to identify existing supplierpurchaser relationshi ps in conventional weapons acquisitions use of these data can assist congress in its oversight ro of assessing whether the current nature of the international weapons trade affects us national in terests for most of recent american history maintaining regional stability and ensuring the security of us allies and friendly nations th roughout the world have been important elements of us foreign policy knowing the degree to which individual arms suppliers are making arms transfers to individual nations or regions provides congress with context for evaluating policy questions it ma confront such policy questions may include for example whethe r or not to support specific us arms sales to given countries or regions or to support or oppos such arms transfers by other nations the data in this report may also assist congress in evaluating whether multilateral arms control arrangements or other us foreign policy initiatives are being supported or undermined by the actions of arms suppliers the principal focus of this report is the level of arms transf ers by major weapons suppliers to nations in the developing wo rld where most of the potential for the outbreak of regional military conflicts currently exists for decades during the height of the cold war providing conve ntional weapons to friendly states was an instrument of foreign policy utilized by the united states and its allies this was equally true for the soviet union and its allies the underlying rationale for us arms transfer policy then was to help ensure that friendly states were not placed at risk through military disadvantage created by arms transfers by the soviet union or its allies following the cold wars nd us arms transfer policy has been based on assisting friendly and allied nations in developing and maintaining their ability to deal with regional secur ity threats and concerns the data in this report illustrate how global patte rns of conventional arms transfers have changed in the postcold war and postpersian gulf war years relationships between arms s uppliers and recipients conti nue to evolve in response to changing political military and economic circumstances where before the principal motivation for arms sales by fore ign suppliers might have been to supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34723crs2 foreign policy objective today that mo tivation may be base d as much on economic considerations as those of fore ign or national security policy the developing world continues to be th primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional wea pons suppliers during the period of this report 2000 2007 conventional arms transfer agreements which represent orders for future delivery to developing nations comprise d 666 of the value of all international arms transfer agreements the portion of agreements with developing countries constituted 677 of all agreements gl obally from 20042007 in 2007 arms transfer agreements with developing countries accounted for 705 of the value of all such agreements globally deliveries of conventional arms to developing nations from 2004 2007 constituted 647 of all international arms deliveries in 2007 arms deliveries to developing na tions constituted 556 of th value of all such arms deliveries worldwide the data in this new report supersede all data published in previous editions since these new data for 20002007

calendar year data used all arms transfer and arms delivery data in this report are for the calendar year or calendar year period given this applies to us and foreign data alike united states government departments and agencies publish data on us arms transfers and deliveries but ge nerally use the united states fiscal year as the computational time period for these data as consequence there are likely to be distinct differences noted in those publishe d totals using fiscal year basis and those provided in this report wh ich use calendar year basis details on data used are outlined in footnotes at the bottom of tables 1 2 8 and 9 arms transfer values the values of arms transfer agreements or deliveries in this report refer to the total values of conven tional arms orders or deliv eries as the case may be which include all categories of wea pons and ammunition military spare parts military construction military ssistance and training prog rams and all associated services definition of developing nations and regions as used in this report the developi ng nations category includes all countries except the united states russia european nations canada ja pan australia and

throughout this report values of arms tr ansfer agreements and values of arms deliveries for all suppliers are expressed in us dollars values for any given year generally reflect the exchange rates that prevailed during that specific year the report converts these dollar amounts curre nt dollars into constant 2007 dollars although this helps to eliminate the distor ting effects of us inflation to permit more accurate comparison of various dollar levels over time the effects of fluctuating exchange rate s are not neutralized the deflators used for the constant dollar calculations in this report are those provided by the us department of defense and are set out at the bottom of tables 1a 2a 8a and 9a unless otherwise noted in the report all dollar values are stated in constant terms the exceptions to this rule are all regional data tables that are composed of fouryear aggregate do llar totals 20002003 and 20042007 these tables are expressed in current dollar terms and where

dollarshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34723crs4 major findings general trends in arms transfers worldwide the value of all arms transfer agreem ents worldwide to both developed and developing nations in 2007 was nearly 60 billion this was an increase in arms agreements values over 2006 of 92 chart 1 table 8a in 2007 the united states led in arms transfer agreements worldwide making agreements valued at over 248 billion 415 of all such agreements up significantly from 167 billion in 2006 russia ranked second with 104 billion in agreements 173 of these agreements globally down from 143 billion in 2006 the united kingdom ranked third its arms transfer agreements worldwide were 98 billion in 2007 up from 41 billion in 2006 the united states russia and the united kingdom collectively made agreem ents in 2007 valued at over 45 b illion 752 of all international arms transfer agreements made by all suppliers figure 1tables 8a 8b and 8d for the period 20042007 the total value of all internationa l arms transfer agreements 2083 b illion was substantially higher than the worldwide value during 20002003 1476 billion an increase of 292 during the period 20002003 developing world nations accounted for 677 of the va lue of all arms transfer agreements made worldwide duri ng 20042007 developing world nations accounted for 677 of all arms transfer agreements made globally in 2007 developing nations accounted for 705 of all arms transfer agreements made worldwide figure 1 table 8a in 2007 the united states ranked fi rst in the value of all arms deliveries worldwide making nearly 128 billion in such deliveries or 413 this is the eighth year in row that the united states has led in global arms deliveries russia ranked second in worldwide arms deliver ies in 2007 making 47 billion in such deliveries the united kingdom ranked third in 2007 making 26 billion in such deliveries these top three suppliers of arms in 2007 collectively delivered nearly 201 billion 648 of all arms delivered worl dwide by all suppliers in that year figure 2 tables 9a 9b and 9d the value of all interna tional arms deliveries in 2007 was 31 billion this is decrease in the total value of arms deliver ies from the previous year decline from 336 billion the total value of such arms deliveries worldwide in 20042007 1349 billion was lower than the deliveries worldwide from 20002003 1436 billion decline of nearly 10 billion figure 2 tables 9a and 9b charts 7 and 8 developing nations from 20042007 accounted for 647 of the value of all international arms deliver ies in the earlier peri od 20002003 developing nations accounted for 651 of the value of all arms deliveries worldwide in 2007 developing nations collectively accounted fo r 556 of the value of all international arms deliveries figure 2 tables 2a 9a and 9b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34723crs5 worldwide weapons orders increased in 2007 the total of nearly 60 billion was an increase from 549 billion in 2006 or 92 global arms agreement values for the other years covered here ranged from 487 billion in 2005 to 326 b illion in 2003 of the major arms orders secured in 2007 most were made by the traditional major suppliers in some instances these orders represented significant new acquisitions by the purchasing country in others they reflected the continuation or acceleration of longerterm weaponsacquisition program the increase in new weapons sales can also be explained in part by the decision of some purchasing nations to acquire major systems they had deferred buying due to budgetary considerations some nations were completing the integration of major weapons systems they have already purchased into their force structures some of the growth in arms transfer agreements more recently also reflects contracts related to training nd support services as well as upgrades of existing weapons systems individual orders such as these can be expensive and in given instances prove to be nearly as costly as orders for new units of military equipment because the international arms market continues to be intensely competitive several producing countries ve focused sales efforts on prospective clients in nations and regions where individual suppliers have had competitive advantages resulting from wellestablishe d militarysupport relationships arms sales to new nato member nations in europe to s upport their military mode rnization programs have created new business for arms suppliers while allowing these nato states to sell some of their older generation military equipment in refurbished form to other lessdeveloped countries there are inherent limitations on these european sales due to the smaller defense budgets of many of the purchasing countries yet crea tive seller financing options as well as the use of coa ssembly coproduction and countertrade agreements to offset costs to the buyers continue to facilitate new arms agreements it seems likely that the united states nd european countries or consortia will compete vigorously for prospective arms contracts within the european region in the foreseeable future such sales seem partic ularly important to european suppliers as they can potentially compensate in part for lost weapons deals elsewhere in the developing world that result fro m reduced demand for new weapons developed nations tinue their efforts to protect important elements of their national military industrial ba ses by limiting arms purchas from other developed nations however several key arms suppliers have placed additional emphasis on joint production of various weapons systems with other developed nations as more effective way to preserve domestic weapons production capability while sharing the costs of new weapons development th consolidation of certain sectors of the domestic defense industries of key weaponsproducing nations continues in the face of intense foreign competition some suppl ying nations meanwhile have chosen to manufacture items for niche weapons categ ories where their specialized production capabilities give them important advantages in the international arms marketplace despite the recent upward trend in w eapons purchases with the developed world some developing nati ons have limited their weapons purchases primarily duehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34723crs6 to their limited financial resources to pay for such equipment other prospective arms purchasers in the developing world w ith significant financial assets have been cautious in launching new and costly wea ponsprocurement programs increases in the price of oil while an advantage for major oil producing states in funding their arms purchases has simultaneously caused economic difficulties for many oil consuming states contributing to their d ecisions to curtail or defer new weapons acquisitions number of less affluent veloping nations have chosen to upgrade existing weapons systems in their inventorie s while reducing their purchases of new ones this circumstance may curtail sale s of some new weapons systems yet the weapons upgrade market can be very lu crative for some arms producers and partially mitigate the effect of fewer opportunities for th sale of major items of military equipment most recently the nations in the near east and asia regions have resumed large weapons purchases in contrast with arms sa activity in the earliest years of this report these major orders continue to be made by select few developing nations in these regions they have been made pr incipally by india and china in asia and saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in the near east these purchasing tendencies are subject to abrupt change ba sed on the strength of either the threat assessments of individual stat or the strength of their individual economies for the larger group of nations in these regions the strength of the economies of wide range of nations in the developing world continues to be the most significant factor in the timing of many of their arms purchasing decisions latin america and to much lesser extent africa are regions where some nations wish to modernize important sectors of their military forces some large arms orders by regional standards have been placed by few states in these two regions within the last decade yet in tin america and africa many countries are constrained in their weapons purchases by th eir financial resources so long as there is limited availability of llersupplied credit and financ ing for weapons purchases and national budgets for military purchases re main relatively low it seems likely that major arms sales to these two regions of the developing world will be limited to small number of nations there general trends in arms transfers to developing nations the value of all arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2007 was nearly 423 billion an increase from the 381 billion total in 2006 chart 1 figure 1table 1a in 2007 the value of all arms deliveries to developing nations 172 billion was lower than the value of 2006 deliveries over 214 billion and the lowest total for the 20002007 period charts 7 and 8 figure 2 table 2a recently from 20042007 the united states and russia have dominated the arms market in the developing world with both nations either ranking first or second for 3 out of these 4 years in the value of arms transfer agreements from 20042007 russia made nearly 393 billion 279 of all such agreements expressed in constant 2007 dollars during this same pe riod the united states made 347 billion in such agreements 246 of all such agreements collectively the united states and russia made 525 of all arms transf er agreements with developing nations during this four year period the united kingdom the third leading supplier fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34723crs7 20042007 made 213 billion or 151 of all such agreements with developing nations during these years in the earlie r period 20002003 the united states ranked first with 464 billion in arms transfer agreements with developing nations or 483 russia made 256 billion in arms tran sfer agreements during this period or 266 france made nearly 5 billion in agreements or 52 table 1a from 20002007 most arms transfers to veloping nations we re made by two major suppliers in any given year th united states ranked first among these suppliers for five of the last eight year s during this period falling to third place in 2005 russia has been strong competitor fo r the lead in arms transfer agreements with developing nations ranking sec ond every year from 2000 through 2003 and first from 20042006 although russia has lack ed the larger trad itional client base for armaments held by the united states and the major west european suppliers its recent successes in concluding new arms orders suggests that russia is likely to continue to be for some time significant leader in arms agreements with developing nations russias most signifi cant high value arms transfer agreements continue to be with india and china ru ssia has also had some success in concluding arms agreements with clients beyond its pr incipal two russia continues to seek to expand its prospects in north africa the middle east and southeast asia most recently russia has increased sales efforts in latin america despite having essentially ab andoned major arms sale s efforts there after the end of the cold war venezuela has become significant new arms client gained by russia in this region the russian government has adopt ed more flexible payment arrangements for its prospective customers in the developing world including willingness in specific cases to forgive outsta nding debts owed to it by prospective client in order to secure new arms purchases additionally russia continues to seek to enhance the quality of its followon support services to make russian produc ts more attractive and competitive and to assure its potential clients that it can effectively provide timely service and spare parts fo r the weapons systems it exports major west european arms suppliers particularly france and the united kingdom have concluded large orders with developing c ountries over the last eight years based on either longterm supply re lationships or their having specialized weapons systems readily available german has been key source of naval systems for developing nations although it faces increased competition from these other major arms suppliers the united states appears likely to hold its position as the principal supplier to key developing world nations especially those able to afford major new weapons the united states has developed for decades such wide base of arms equipment clients globally that it is able to conclude notable number of agreements annually to provide upgrades ordnance and support services for the large variety of weapons systems it has previously so ld to its clients thus even when the united states does not concl ude major new arms agreements in given year it can still register significant arms agreement values based on transactions in these other categories the principal armssupplying nations conti nue to focus their sales efforts on the wealthier developing countries arms tr ansfers to the less affluent developing nations are still constrained by the scarcity of funds in their defense budgets and the unsettled state of the interna tional economy the overall dec line in the level of armshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34723crs8 agreements with developing nations th at began after 2001 nd continued through 2003 has halted arms transfer agreements with developing countries reached their highest total value in 2007 at nearly 433 billion from 2004 through 2007 there has been steady increase in arms transfer agreements with developing countries aid to an important degree by sales to the more affluent nations in this group those developing nations with notably increased oil revenues have been particularly active in seeking new weaponry most recently china as well as other european and noneuropean suppliers appears to have increased their participation in the arms trade with the developing world in recent years albeit at lower levels and with more uneven results than those of the major suppliers nevertheless th nonmajor arms supplie rs have proven capable on occasion of making arms deals of conseque nce most of their annual arms transfer agreement values during 20002007 have been comparatively low although the values are larger when they are aggregat ed together as group in individual cases they have been successful in selling older generation equipment while they procure newer weapons to upgrade their own military forces these arms suppliers also are more likely to be sources of small arms and light weapons and associated ordnance rather than routine sellers of major military equipment mo st of these arms suppliers have not consistently ra nked with the traditional ma jor suppliers of advanced weaponry in the value of their ar ms agreements and deliveries tables 1a 1f 1g 2a 2f and 2g united states the total value in real terms of united states arms transfer agreements with developing nations rose from 91 billion in 2006 to 122 billion in 2007 the us share of the value of all such agreements was 288 in 2007 up from 24 share in 2006 charts 1 3 and 4 figure 1 tables 1a and 1b in 2007 the total value of us arms transfer agreements with developing nations was attributable to few major deals with clients in the near east and in asia substantial number of smaller valued purchases by wide number of traditional us arms client s throughout the near east and asia contributed notably to the overall us agreements total the arms agreement total of the united states in 2007 illustrates the continuing us adva ntage of having well established defense support arrangements with weapons purch asers worldwide based upon the existing variety of us weapons systems their militari utilize us agreements with all of its clients in 2007 include not only sales of major weapons systems but also the upgrading of systems previously provided the us totals also include agreements for wide variety of spare parts mmunition ordnance training and support services which in the aggregate have significant value among the larger valued arms transfer agreements the united states concluded in 2007 with developing na tions were with the united arab emirates for 26 uh 60m black hawk helicopters for ove r 800 milli on and for 20 high mobility artillery rocket systems himars launc hers and rockets for 595 million other us arms agreements in 2007 were with egypt for coproduction of 125 m1a1 abrams tanks for 771 million with saudi arabia for 152 geprattwhitney jet

transfer agreements with developing nations in 2007 was 97 billion decrease from 144 billion in 2006 placing russia third in such agreements with the developing world russias share of all developing world arms transfer agreem ents increased then fell from 379 in 2006 to 23 in 2007 charts 1 3 and 4 figure 1 tables 1a 1b and 1g russian arms transfer agreement totals with developing nations have been notable during the last four years du ring the 20042007 period russia ranked first among all suppliers to developing countri making 379 billion in agreements in current 2007 dollars table 1f russias status as leading supplier of arms to developing nations stems from successful effort to overcome the significant economic and political problems associated with the dissolution of the former soviet union traditional arms clients of the fo rmer soviet union were generally less wealthy developing countries valued as much for their political support during the cold war as for their desire for soviet weaponry severa l of these sovietera client states received substantial military aid gran ts and significant discounts on their arms purchases after 1991 russia consisten tly placed premium on obtaining hard currency for the weapons it sold faced with stiff competition from western arms suppliers in the postcold war period russia modified and adapted its selling practices in an effort to regain and sustai n an important share of the developingworld arms market in recent years russian leaders have made significant efforts to provide more creative financing and payment options for prospective arms clients they have agreed to engage in countertrade offset s debtswapping and in key cases to make significant licensed production agreements in order to sell russias weapons the

mixed results russias arms sales efforts apart from those with china and i ndia have been focused on southeast asia here russia has secured arms agreements with malaysia vietnam and indonesia most recently russia has concluded major arms deals with venezuela and with algeria elsewhere in the developing world russian military equipment can be competitive because it ranges from the most basic to the highly advanced for less affluent developing nations russias ss expensive armaments are particularly attractive the sale of military aircraft and missiles continues to be significant portion of russias arms exports but the absence of major new research and development efforts in this and other military equipment areas can jeopardize longterm russian foreign arms sales prospects although

potential difficulties russia continues to have important arms development and sales prog rams involving india and china which should provide it with sustained business throughout this decade through agreements concluded in the mid1990s russia has sold major comb at fighter aircraft and main battle tanks to india and has provided other major weapons systems though lease or licensed production it continues to provide support services and items for these various weapons systems sales of advanced weaponry in sout h asia by russia have been matter of ongoing concern to the united states because of longstanding tensions between india and pakistan when india ac quires new weapon system this typically leads pakistan to seek comparable wea pons or those with offsetting capabilities key us policy objective is keeping potentially destabilizing arms race in this region within check1 china has been russias other key arms client in asia especially for advanced aircraft and naval systems since 1996 ru ssia has sold china su27 fighter aircraft and agreed to licensed production of them it has sold the chinese quantities of 30 multirole fighter aircra ft sovremennyclass destro yers equipped with sunburn antiship missiles and kilo class project 636 submarines russia has also sold the chinese variety of other weapons system s and missiles in 2005 russia agreed to sell china 30 il76td military transport aircraft and 8 il78m aerial refueling tanker aircraft for more than 1 billion russia so signed new arms transfer agreements with china for number of al31f milita ry aircraft engines for 1 billion and agreed to sell jet engines for chinas fc1 fighter aircraft at cost in excess of 250 million chinese ar ms acquisitions are apparently aimed at enhancing its military projection capabilities in asia and its ability to influence events throughout the region these acquisitions continue to be monitored by us policymakers the us policy interest is among other things ensuring that it provides appropriate military equipment to us allies and friendly states in asia to help offset any prospective threat china may pose to such nations while keeping the us military aware of any threat it may face in any confrontation with china2 in 2007 there were especially large chinese arms agreements with ru ssia possibly because the chinese military is focused on absorbing and integrating previous arms purchases from russia into its force structure among the most significant arms transf er deals russia made in 2007 were with india these agreements included the sale of 347

iraniraq war in the 1980s provided china with the opportunity to become an important supplier of less ex pensive weapons to certain developing nations during that conflict china demonstrated that it was willing to provide arms to both combatants in the war in quan tity and without conditions since that time chinas arms sales have been more regional and targeted from 20042007 the value of chinas arms transfer agreements with developing nations averaged about 23 billion annually during the period of this report the value of chinas arms transfer agreements with developing na tions were highest in 2007 at 38 billion significant portion of that total can be ttributed to significant contract with pakistan associated with the production of the j17 fighter aircraft generally chinas sales figures reflect several smaller valued w eapons deals in asia africa and the near east rather than one or two especially large agreements for major weapons systems tables 1a 1g and 1h chart 3 there have been few developing nations with significant financial resources that have sought to purchase chinese military equipment during the eightyear period of this report because most chinese wea pons for export are less advanced and sophisticated than weaponry available fro m western suppliers or russia china consequently does not appear likely to be key supplier of major conventional weapons in the international arms market for the foreseeab future chinas likely client base could be states in asia and africa seeking quantities of small arms and light weapons rather than major combat sy stems at the same time china has been an important source of missiles in the developing world arms market china supplied silkworm antiship missiles to iran credible reports persist in various publications that china has sold surfacetosurface missiles to pakistan long standing and important client iran and north korea have also reportedly received chinese missile technology which may ve increased their capabilities to threaten other countries in their respective neig hborhoods the continued reporting of such activities by credible sources raise im portant questions bout china s stated commitment to the restrictions on missile tr ansfers set out in the missile technology control regime mtcr including its pledge not to assist others in building missiles that could deliver nuclear wea pons since china has some military products particularly missiles th at some developing countri would like to acquire it can present an obstacle to efforts to stem proliferation of advanced missile systems to

suppliers france the united kingdom germany and italy are the nations that can supply wide variety of more highly sophisticated weapons to woul dbe purchasers they can serve as alternative sources of armaments that the united states choos not to supply for policy reasons the united kingdom sold major combat fighter ai rcraft to saudi arabia in the mid1980s when the us chose not to sell comparab aircraft for policy reasons these four nato nations have been allies of the unite d states and generally have supported the us position in restricting arms sales to certain nations during the cold war era in the postcold war era their national fense export policies have not been fully coordinated with the united states as likely would have been the case at the cold wars height these leading european arms supplying states particularly france view arms sales foremost as matter for national decision france has also frequently used foreign military sales as an important means for underwriting development and procurement of weapons systems for its ow n military forces so the potential exists for policy differences between the united st ates and major west european supplying states over conventional wea pons transfers to specific countries such conflict resulted from an effort led by france and germany to lift the arms embargo on arms sales to china currently adhe red to by members of the european union the united states viewed this as misguided effort and vigorously opposed it the proposal to lift the embargo was ultimately not dopted but it proved to be source of significant tension between the us nd the european union thus arms sales activities of major european suppliers c ontinue to be of interest to ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34723crs13 5 for detailed

nations the united kingdom was the leading supplier with 98 billion in agreements in 2007 dramatic increase from 41 billion in ag reements in 2006 substantial portion of the united kingdoms 98 billion agreement total in 2007 is attributable to an order valued in excess of 9 billion fro m saudi arabia for 72 typhoon eurofighter aircraft germanys 15 billion in arms agreements in 2007 resulted

with developing nations against both the united states which has tended to sell to several of the same clients and with russia which has sold to nations not traditional customers of either the west

the european defense agencys ea steering board meeting curren tly voluntary the eu hopes it will become mandatory and through its mechanisms foster greater competition within the european defense equipment s ector in the awarding of contracts for defense items the larger hope is that by fostering greater intraeuropean cooperation and collaboration in defense contracting and the resulting programs that the defense industrial bases of i ndividual eu states will be pres erved and the ability of european defense firms to compete for arms sales in the international arms marketplace will be substantially enhanced few european arms suppliers have begun to phase out production of certain types of weapons systems such supplie rs have increasingly engaged in joint production ventures with ot her key european weapons suppliers or even client countries in an effort to sustain major s ectors of their individual defense industrial bases even if substantial portion of the weapons produced are for their own armed forces the eurofighter project is one example the eurocopter is another other european suppliers have also adopted the strategy of c ooperating in defense production ventures with the united states such as the joint strike fighter jsf rather than attempting to compete directly thereby meeting their own requirements for advanced combat aircraft while pos itioning themselves to share in profits resulting from future sales of this new fighter aircraft6 regional arms transfer agreements the markets for arms in regions of the developing world have traditionally been dominated by the near east and by asia nations in the latin america and africa regions by contrast have not been ma jor purchasers of weapons except on rare occasions the regional arms agreement data tables in this report demonstrate this united states policymakers have placed emphasis on helping to maintain stability throughout the regions of the developing world thus the united states has made and supported arms sale s and transfers it s believed would advance that goal while discouraging significant sales by other suppliers to states and regions where military threats to nations in the area are minimal other arms suppliers do not necessarily share the us perspective on what constitutes an appropriate arms sale for in some instances the financial benefit of the sale to the supplier trumps other considerations the regional and country specific armstra nsfer data in this report provide an indication of where various arms suppliers are focusing their attention and who their principal clients are by reviewing these data policymakers can identify potential developments which may be of concern and use this information to assist their review of options they may choose to consider

data within these specific tables aggregate data on weapons categories deliv ered by suppliers do not provide precise indices of the quality andor quantity of the weaponry delivered the history of recent conventional c onflicts suggests that quality ndor sophistication of weapons can offset quantitative advantage further these data do not provide an indication of the relative capabilities of the recipien t nations to use effectively the weapons delivered to them superior training coupled with good equipment tactical and operational proficie ncy and sound logistics may in the last analysis
