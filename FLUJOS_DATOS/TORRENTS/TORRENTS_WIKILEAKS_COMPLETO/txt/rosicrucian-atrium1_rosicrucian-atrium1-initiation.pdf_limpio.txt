rosicrucian initiation rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 initiation brings into the realm of reason the pur pose and into the realm of emotion the spirit of ones introduction into the mysteries 2007 supreme grand lodge of the ancient mystical order ros√¶ crucis 007 published by the grand lodge of the english language jurisdiction amorc inc 07072the story of light all the great avatars gave to humanity spiritual doctrines or moral code enabling men and women to commune with the cosmic and receive its illumination thus they were torchbearers of the great light which lit the world through historys darkest periods without their help it is likely that the human race would not have advanced to its present level of understanding and tolerance even though we must recognize that humanity still has far to go to be model of divine perfection on earth in concurrence with this initiation whose purpose is to awaken your spiritual being we offer this short biography of one of those greater avatars who through time and space transmitted light to humanity akhnaton amenhotep iv according to the archives of our order amenhotep i v was born in the royal palace of thebes on november 24 1378 bce he was the of amenhotep iii and queen tiy in 1367 when he was nly eleven years old he was crowned and thus became the pharaoh of egypt t very young age he married nefertiti whose name means the coming of beauty with whom he had seven daughters from an early age amenhotep iv rejected the supers titious practices of the priests of amon he considered the priests to b only impostors who took advantage of the credulity of the people so as to xert absolute power over them from the time he was vested with the required autho rity amenhotep opposed the priesthood with unprecedented determination fo r he was convinced that the entire universe was the work of one god rather than multitude of gods and goddesses that must be adored by means of many sacrifices thus for the first time in recorded history monotheism supplant ed polytheism which by this time had spread over the entire surface of th earth for centuries after his reign amenhotep iv was represented as an individua l afflicted by madness however historians now agree that this pharaoh ins pired an unprecedented cultural and spiritual revolution the priests of heliopolis as was generally true of priests throughout egypt thought that the sun which they called ra was the god of all the gods and goddesses they worshiped ra most often under t he name of amonra for amenhotep iv the sun was merely the visible sym bol of the invisible god in which he believed and whom he called aton he ch anged his own name continued on inside back cover3rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 initiation dear fratres and sorores we hope that you comprehend the symbolic importance of the rosicrucian sanctum and that you have determined where you will establish your own sanctum this should not be seen as an obligation because according to the traditional rules of our order you remain free to live rosicrucianism as you understand it and perhaps most of all as you exp erience it however the idea of the sanctum is rooted in the history of our myst ical organization and for centuries rosicrucians have given it great importa nce for many of them the sanctum is place they revere because of the symbo lism they have attributed to it and it is in this place that they take pleas ure in studying their monographs and in meditating on the spiritual values of existe nce when the proper time comes we will give you further explanations concer ning the rosicrucian sanctum and we will ask you to consecrate it with special ritual that will make it place whose vibratory nature gives it m ystical dimension

everything necessaryna mely table or shelf mirror and two candlesfor when you conduct your s tudy period however if it is absolutely impossible for you to arrange sa nctum for your weekly work you must of course continue your studies as you ve until the present what matters most of all is working on regular basis nd putting your whole heart into the study and practice of our teachings on th other hand when carrying out rosicrucian initiations it is essential that ou have the benefit of some sort of sanctum whether permanent or temporary if for whatever reason this is not possible we

again emphasize the fact that rosicrucian initiatio ns have connection whatsoever with magical practices for amorc has ne ver taught or approved of such methods moreover it has always opposed ch practices firmly because black magic is founded on principles that r esort to strange and unusual manifestations bordering upon the supernatural r osicrucianism is instead mystical way that exalts the study of cosmic laws such as those manifested in the universe in nature and in human beings it is also philosophy based on the desire to perfect oneself and to express in one s behavior the noblest virtues of the human soul rosicrucian initiations are not religious in charac ter their goal is to enable each member to gain greater awareness of his or her spiritual nature and to establish more intimate dialogue between the obje ctive self and the inner self the key to the mastery of life lies in the ability to create this dialogue because it is what gives the individual that inspiration w ill and power to manifest on earth the grandeur and glory of divine intellige nce which vibrates in the individuals innermost self and in the heart of the most distant galaxies in this regard
