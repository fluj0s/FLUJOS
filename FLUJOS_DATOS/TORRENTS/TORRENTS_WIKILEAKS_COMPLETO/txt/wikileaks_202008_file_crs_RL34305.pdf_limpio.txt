declared that motorcycle fatalities represent the nations greatest highway traffic safety challenge over the past decade the number of passenger vehicle auto deaths has declined slightly even as more drivers have been driving more vehicles more miles but the number of motorcycle fatalities has more than doubled over the past decade to 4810 in 2006representing 14 of all passenger vehicle occupant deaths annual motorcycle fatalities are now more that double the number of annual deaths from aviation rail marine and pipeline accidents combined while part of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the number of motorcyclists the number of fatalities is increasing at greater rate than the overall increase in ridershipthe number of fatalities has increased by 116 in the past decade while the number of registered motorcycles increased by 63 the increase in fatalities has continued in spite of the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsas publication in 2000 of the national agenda for motorcycle safety plan for reducing motorcycle accidents and fatalities the motorcycle industry expects the growth in motorcycle sales to continue so the total number of motorcycle fa talities may continue to increase barring new safety measures clear understanding of the factors involved in motorcycle crashes is needed in order to develop effective safety measures to reduce the rate of motorcycle crashes nhtsa has detailed information about the characteristics of fatal motorcycle crashes but not about causes of the crashes the last major study of the causes of motorcycle crashes in the united states was published in 1981 since that time the motorcycle rider population and the characteristics of both the motorcycle and passenger vehicle fleet have changed congress has authorized another major study of the causes of motorcycle crashes the results of this study are expected in 2010 congress has also authorized motorcycle safety grant program promoting rider education and training and motorist awareness of motorcyclists and established motorcycle advisory commission to advise dot on infrastructure issues of concern to motorcyclists according to nhtsa the single most effective safety measure to reduce motorcycle fatalities is to wear helmet that meets dot standards such helmets are estimated to reduce fatalities by 37 helmets also reduce the severity and cost of injuries received in motorcycle crashes twenty states and the district of columbia currently have universal helmet laws requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets most other states only require minors to wear helmets the national transportation safety board has recommended that all states adopt universal helmet laws universal helmet laws have been controversial congress has twice adopted and then repealed incentives promoting universal helmet laws most recently repealing the incentives in 1995 these incentives were effective in getting states to adopt universal helmet laws and the laws proved effective in promoting helmet use after each repeal the number of states with universal helmet laws declined surveys indicate that 58 of motorcycle riders wore helmet in 2007 up from 51 in 2006 but down from 64 in 1996 this report will be updated as warranted

which is both leisure activity and form of transportation is enjoying renewed popularity motorcycles first peaked in popularity in 1973 when over 15 million were sold1 during the 1970s annual sales of all types of motorcycles averaged over 1 million after 1980 sales declined reaching low point of less than 300000 annually in the early 1990s sales began rising after 1992 sales of onhighway motorcycles rose from 186000 in 1992 to 662000 in 2003 2 the number of motorcycles in use as measured by motorcycle registration data has increased by at least 63 since 1997 from 38 million in 1997 to 62 million in 2005 according to the motorcycle industry factors influencing the increase in motorcycle ownership include affluent baby boomers returning to motorcycling after many years of not riding and rising fuel costs3 this report presents and analyzes crash data which show that motorcycle fatalities are an increasing share of all motor vehicle fatalities in the united states it examines the risk characteristics of motorcycles and motorcyclists and the characteristics of fatal motorcycle crashes the report then examines what the federal government is doing to try to reduce the rate of

2176 in 1996 to 4810 in 2006 part of this increase can be attributed to significant growth in the number of motorcyclists according to the motorcycle industry annual sales of onhighway motorcycles have tripled in the past decade the federal highway administration fhwa reports that the number of registered motorcycles increased by over 2 million 63 during that period but as table 1 shows the rate of increase in fatal motorcycle crashes 116 and rider fatalities 115 is almost double the rate of increase in the number of motorcycles registered 63 4 by contrast 1 data from motorcycle industry

httpwwwntsbgoveventssymp_motorcycle_safety agendahtm 4 to know whether motorcycle fatalities are increasing simply because more motorcycles are in use or whether other factors are involved the number of fatalities needs to be compared to some measure of exposure to risk of crashing the preferred measure of exposure is the number of vehicle miles traveled vmt however there is concern that official data on motorcycle vmt is inaccurate this led nhtsa to switch from using vmt to the number of registrations as the basis of measure of exposure though the accuracy of motorcycle registration data is also uncertain the federal highway administration which collected motorc ycle vmt data from the states began working with the states in 2007 to improve the accuracy of motorcycle vmt data

nger ca rs nd light trucks in 2006 motorcycles represented less than 3 of all passenger vehicles registered and less than 1 of all vmt while motorcyclist fatalities represented 14 of all fatalities suffered by operators or passengers in passenger vehicles5 among the factors that contribute to the higher rate of fatal crashes of motorcycles compared to passenger vehicles are the characteristics of both motorcycles and the motorcycle operator population motorcycles are inherently riskier than passenger vehicles they are more complex to steer and less stable in braking and maneuvering they also tend to be less noticed by other motorists compared to other passenger vehicles in crash motorcycles offer little protection to their occupants compared to passenger vehicle occupant who is enclosed in metal frame is required by law to be wearing seat belt and whose vehicle if manufactured after 1996 is required by law to have airbags to protect the occupants of the front seat virtually the only protection available to motorcyclist in crash is helmet and protective clothing neither of which is required in most states also an timated 90 of motorcycle operators are male compared to the passenger vehicle driver population which is 50 female6 males are involved in motor vehicle accidents at higher rate than females7 as result of both vehicle characteristics and operator characteristics the rate of motorcycle involvement in fatal crashes both by the number of registered vehicles and by vmt is several times that of passenger vehicles see table 2 5 30521 occupants of

motorcycle crashes in 2005 which resulted in the deaths of 4553 motorcyclists over half 53 in 2004 of motorcyclist deaths occur on weekends and about half occur on rural roads fortyfive percent of the motorcyclists killed in crashes in 2004 were not wearing helmet speeding was judged to be contributing factor for 37 of the fatalities in 25 of the crashes the motorcyclist either did not have drivers license or lacked motorcycle endorsement on their license over quarter 27 of the motorcyclists killed in crashes in 2005 were legally intoxicated ie had an amount of alcohol in their blood blood alcohol content or bac at or above 008 10 approximately half 45 of the fatal motorcycle crashes in 2005 were singlevehicle crashes in most of these the motorcyclist ran off the road fortyone percent of the 1878 motorcyclists who died in singlevehicle crashes were legally intoxicated in the 56 of crashes involving two or more vehicles the other vehicles was typically passenger car or light truck of twovehicle crashes involving passenger vehicle 74 of the crashes involved the motorcycle striking the passenger vehicle in more than onethird of the twovehicle crashes the motorist was making left turn across the path of motorcyclist 11 in looking at the characteristics of fatal motorcycle crashes during the decade 1995 to 2004 changing trends can be ascertained the percentage of motorcycle operators in fatal crashes who had been drinking ie had any alcohol in their system declined from 42 to 34 and the percentage who were legally impaired bac of 008 or more declined from 34 to 2812 8 as noted in footnote 4 there is concern that official motorcycle vmt numbers are inaccurate the motorcycle industry on the basis of periodic survey of motorcycle owners estimates motorcycle vmt at roughly twice the official measure which would produce fatality rate per vmt of nearly half this figure but even that rate would still be many times higher than the rates for passenger vehicles 9

declined from 43 to 3713 the percentage of motorcycle operator fatalities who were properly licensed increased from 63 to 75 however while these rates showed improvement the actual number of fatal

essential 56 and necessary 22 the urgent recommendations are that comprehensive indepth studies of critical questions in motorcycle safety should be begun immediately that efforts to discourage impaired motorcycling should continue that efforts should be made to increase the use of dotcompliant helmets and that efforts should be made to educate motorists to be more aware of the presence of motorcyclists 20 nhtsa published an implementation guide for nams in 2006 the guide focuses on the roughly half of the nams recommendations it iden tifies as being directed at the states it presents examples of things states have done to implement those recommendations the ntsb has commended the nams but noted that there is means of tracking the status of the recommendations evaluation of the

are two main approaches to reducing motorcycle crashes and fatalities reduce the number of crashes through rider skills training and reductions in risky behaviors educating motorists to be aware of motorcyclists improvements to road design and improvements to motorcycle stability and reduce the deadliness of motorcycle crashes through improvements in rider protective gear reduction in roadside hazards and improvements in the crashworthiness of motorcycles most of the options available under these strategies are of uncertain value vehicle improvements such as antilock brakes stability control and airbags are costly relative to the price of most motorcycles and are thought likely to have limited safety impacts removal of roadside hazards such as trees signposts and other fixed objects is not feasible one option that is viewed to be of proven value relatively inexpensive and can be quickly implemented is universal helmet law 23 that option is controversial and opponents of universal helmet laws call instead for more and better rider training g23g151g146g159g142g155g156g138g149g561g10g142g149g150g142g157g561g14g138g160g561 head injuries resulting in injury to the brain are the leading cause of death in motorcycle crashes motorcycle helmets that comply with the federal safety standard are designed to protect the rider in two ways the hard outer shell of the helmet protects the head from penetrating injuries and abrasion and the crushable interior padding expanded polystyrene also known as styrofoam by absorbing the force of the head as it comes to rapid stop in crash is intended to allow the head to come to less rapid stop and thus protect against injuries caused by the brain hitting the inside of the skull24 nhtsa has found that motorcycle helmets are the single motorcycle safety measure whose effectiveness has been specifically proven and that requiring riders to wear helmets is relatively low cost measure which can be implemented by state passing law requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets and is relatively easy to enforce 22 ntsb motorcycle safety recomme ndation letters september 11 2007 available at httpwwwntsbgovpublictn

are three times as likely to suffer brain injury as those wearing dotcompliant helmet25 nhtsa estimates that 728 of the 4553 motorcyclists who were fatally injured in 2005 could have survived if all motorcyclists had been wearing helmets26 moreover an older person is more susceptible to incurring brain injury from blow to the head than is younger person so as the overall motorcycle rider population ages the protective value of helmets for motorcyclists increases 27 g15g152g157g152g155g140g162g140g149g142g561g10g142g149g150g142g157g156g561g21g138g159g142g561g15g152g151g142g162g561 the use of motorcycle helmets also has significant economic impact studies of motorcyclists injured in crashes find that the costs of crashes are much lower for motorcyclists wearing helmets one recent study found that the average cost resulting from an unhelmeted rider being injured in crash was 302000 while the average cost resulting from helmeted rider being injured in crash was 7100028 much of the disparity in costs between the helmeted and unhelmeted riders injured in crashes was due to the longterm impacts of the typically more severe head injuries suffered by the unhelmeted riders the researchers concluded that motorcycle helmet laws have benefitcost ratio of nearly 4 to 129 nhtsa estimated that the use of motorcycle helmets saved 13 billion in medical expenses in 2002 and that another 853 million could have been saved if all motorcyclists had worn helmets30 opponents of universal helmet laws portray them as unwarranted limitations on an adults freedom to take risks proponents counter that the costs that can result from not wearing helmet are not borne only by the motorcyclist who chooses to ride without helmet several studies have found that only about half of motorcycle crash victims have private health insurance 31 for those without private coverage majority of their medical costs are paid by the public even for those with private coverage their insurance may not be sufficient to cover all the costs of their treatment for those with serious head injuries the longterm costs of their treatment may be vast and may be borne by the public motorcycle crash

universal helmet law part of the reason given for the repeal was that the penalty was about to be enforced against the three states then lacking ch laws california illinois and utah by 1979 27 states had repealed their mandatory helmet laws in the face of opposition to those laws the nations fatality rate per 10000 motorcycles rose from 67 1976 to 91 1979 in 1991 congress authorized the secretary of transportation to provide grants to states with universal helmet laws beginning in fy1994 if state did not have universal helmet law portion of its federalaid highway funds would be transferred to its federal highway safety program in 1995 congress repealed that provision an amendment was offered to what ultimately became safetea that would have reinstated the transfer of portion of states

opponents of universal helmet laws do not deny the safety value of helmets the american motorcyclist association for example encourages riders to wear helmets and other protective gear and does not oppose laws that require minors to wear helmets believing that many young motorcyclists and passengers may lack the maturity to make an informed decision regarding the use of motorcycle helmets 39 they do oppose laws requiring adult motorcyclists to wear helmets contending that adults are capable of making personal safety decisions for themselves and that society should not mandate personal safety some opponents of universal helmet laws such as the motorcycle riders foundation and various state chapters of abate depending on the state american bikers aimed toward education or american brotherhood against totalitarian enactments contend that the safety benefits of helmets are unproven they contend that helmets actually pose danger to the motorcyclist by restricting the cyclists peripheral vision and hearing and by increasing the risk of neck injury due to the added weight of the helmet in crash40 but common to both groups of opponents is the framing of motorcycle helmet laws as primarily an issue of personal liberty and free choice rather than an issue of safety in 1991 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office reviewed dozens of studies of helmet use and found evidence to support the contentions of helmet opponents that helmets significantly impair motorcyclist vision or hearing or contributed to neck injuries41 subsequent studies have continued to support these findings42 studies of 37 the highway safety act of 1966 pl 89564 38 senate amendment 605 to hr 3 may 11 2005 39 american motorcyclist association ama ama position in

reduce the severity of injuries in nonfatal crashes do not cause additional injuries and save billions of dollars in medical care and lost wages43 proponents of universal helmet laws include nhtsa and numerous groups representing the transportation safety medical law enforcemen t and insurance communities they note that helmets not only save lives they also reduce the severity of injuries motorcyclists experience in crashes they respond to the personal choice argument of helmet law opponentsthat each motorcyclist should be free to decide whether to wear helmet since the motorcyclist is the one who bears the risk of injury and deathby pointing out that the motorcyclists choice imposes burdens on others both financial and emotional 44 moreover they contend that universal helmet laws are necessary because voluntary helmet usage promotion efforts have not proven to be effective conversely universal helmet laws are easy to enforce and result in relatively high rates of helmet usage opponents of universal helmet laws take issue with the social burden argument they contend that motorcyclists have medical insurance at rates similar to the general population and that the share of the nations medical burden that is due to medical costs incurred by motorcycle crashes is insignificant 45 they further contend that the most effective way to reduce motorcyclist fatalities and injuries is to prevent crashes from occurring through education of motorcyclists and motorists and through crackdowns on illegal behavior by motorcyclists such as riding while impaired and riding without proper licensure in response to the framing of universal helmet laws as an infringement on personal rights proponents of universal helmet laws contend th at when personal choices impose costs on society and on survivors personal freedoms must be balanced with protecting individuals from preventable injuries and fatalities they note that when it comes to transportation safety congress has chosen to require adults to take actions to protect themselves for example opponents of seat belt use laws also contended that such laws infringed on their personal freedom to drive without seat belt however congress chose to penalize states that do not have and enforce laws requiring motorists to wear seat belts even though all cars manufactured since 1996 are required continued helmet effect on

involved from the moment of injury society picks the person up off the highway delivers him to municipal hospital and municipal doctors provides him with unemployment compensation if after recovery he cannot repl ace his lost job and if the injury causes permanent disability may assume responsibility for his and his familys subsistence we do not understand state of mind that permits plaintiff to

that over 15000 lives are saved each year as result of people wearing seat belts47 in some cases congress has attempted to protect adults from their inclination to take risks even at the cost of imposing burdens on bystanders for example congress has required that locomotive horns be sounded at all highwayrail grade crossings including those already equipped with warning lights and gates because statistics have shown that collision rates are higher when the horns are not sounded in response to criticism of the regulation dot contended that it was appropriate to protect even the unwise from the consequences of their misdeeds where those consequences are especially severeand where society as whole may bear the burden of those consequences 48 in survey of motor vehicle occupants nhtsa found that 81 favored universal helmet laws support was high even in states without universal helmet laws 75 in states with less than universal requirements 79 in the three states with requirements while support was higher among those who did not ride motorcycles 83 51 of the motorcyclists in the survey favored universal helmet laws49

the preferred means to reduce the incidence of motorcycle fatalities virtually all groups support the provision by some means of motorcyclist training courses the nams report declared that motorcycle rider education and training is the centerpiece of comprehensive motorcycle safety program50 spokesman for the motorcycle riders foundation predicted that once safetea is passed and we can have access to training and improved education of motorcyclists you will see this fatality rate go down 51 the longterm safety benefit of motorcyclist training programs has not been conclusively demonstrated an evaluation of californias training program in the 1990s found that the crash rate for novice riders who had taken the training course was less than half that of novice riders without the training for the first six months after the training after that the difference diminished52 the program appeared to provide significant safety benefit for riders with more than 500 miles of prior riding experience while training programs can improve riders bike 46 the presence of the penalties is so effective that every state except new hampshire has adopted such laws 47 nhtsa traffic safety facts 2005 lives
