divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32881the department of labors new rules for working children and youth february 2005 summary the fair labor standards act flsa is the primary federal statute dealing with minimum wages overtime pay and child labor issues as with other aspects of the act jurisdiction over the work of children and youth is somewhat mixed in part the direct responsibility of the congress but with the approval of congress specific responsibility has been reserved fo r the department of labor dol in fashioning the flsa congress set cer tain standards for children and youth who work depending upon the type of work to be performed and the age of the child for example where youth is under 16 ye ars of age his or her work must not interfere with either his or her education nor with the workers health and well being where it does it is by definition oppressive child labor and precluded under statute however the secretary of labor except in areas in which the congress has chosen to address such issues throug h specific legislation has the authority to determine when work by child is oppressive and when with certain caveats it can be permitted in conformity with this aut hority the secretary has instituted series of hazardous occupations orders that apply to child and youth workers in various work environments for children and yout h engaged in agricultural work separate set of hazardous occupations or ders have been established here we are dealing with children nd youth in the nonagricultural economy in middecember 2004 the department issued new rules governing portions of the workforce first congress in carrying out its legislative responsibilities has adopted new laws governing aspects of wo rk by adolescents each of which has been regarded as hazardous these include industrial paper balers and paper box compactors and b teens who make incidental and occasional use of car while on the job second the secretary of labor in keeping with her congressionally mandated authority has reviewed the hazardous occupations orders for nonagricultural workers and has determined that certain nuances of policy were deficient in this latter case three gro ups of workers have been singled out for attention 14 and 15yearolds w ho cook and the conditions under which such cooking is done b persons under 18 years of age who work with explosives and c persons under 18 years of age who are enga ged in various facets of roofingrelated activities with respect both to paper balers and box compactors and to teen drivers the secretary has proposed implementing re gulations in response to action already taken by the congress in the second cas in keeping with the administrative functions of the flsa she has expanded upon conditions already extant that govern the activities of the three groups of workers this report reviews the issues involved in the several cases since it deals with specific rulemaking it is unlikely that it will be updated

under the act and the industry was alerted to the potential risks that could arise from the employment of minors7 the department according to industry began retroactively enforcing this rule8 in letter of august 6 1992 to karen keesling wage and hour administrator corporate counsel ronald bl ock of the national grocers association nga pointed out that teenage unemploym ent is at an alltime high and urged reassessment of the departme nts policy on paper balers in order to safeguard the health and safety of nors without necessarily re stricting their employment opportunities he further suggested that th departments use of strike forces and the targeting of grocers suggests that there is more at stake here than health and safety though he did not suggest what it might have been9

coast to coast are be ing fined thousands of dollars for conduct that cannot reasonably be expected to result in any harm or injury stating that the operation of ho 12 in its present form is irrational he concl uded that unless the department agreed to modify ho 12 gro cers will continue to eliminate jobs for teenagers and they will pass along their increased operating costs to consumers

on teen em ployment opportunities at time of high youth unemploymentbalance that adequately protects our young workers while assuring the continued availability of job opportunities so important to their future11 the dispute continued on october 7 1994 thomas wenning of nga responding to proposed rulemaking observe d nga recognizes the critical need to create and preserve job opport unities for oung people while nga strongly supports the intent of the child labor laws he observed that many such laws were written in the context of the 1930s when children were frequently employed for long hours in sweatshop cond itions or occupations such as manufacturing and coal mining he stated that hazardous occupation orders were clearly outdated and that their enfo rcement by dol was overly broad and excessive according to wenning the result would be to severely reduce employment opportunities for teenagers unde r age 18 in the grocery industry he called for common sense balance that would permit persons of 16 and 17 years of age with proper training and educa tion to operate paper baling machines12 gradually over series of years the primary arguments opposing ho 12 standards were established first enforcement of ho 12 would leave 16 and 17 yearolds without work second the cost to employers with penalties for any infringement of the regulations would be passed on where possible to consumers debate in congress 19951996 on march 10 1995 representatives thomas w ewing ril and larry combest rtx advised their colleagues that during the week of march 13 grocers from your district may visit our office to discuss labor department regulation ho 12 which is causing many of them to avoid hiri ng teenagers they noted that ho 12 was 40yearold regu lation which prohibits teenagers from loading paper balers even when the machine is turned off under bill introduced by representatives ewin g and combest hr 1114 of the 104th congress employees who are under 18 year s of age would

maintained14 conversely thomas zaucha president and ceo of nga wrote to representative bernard sanders in support of hr 1114 this legislation will end the overzealous enforcement of an unnecessary wage and hour law that resulted in inequita ble citations for innocent retailers and decreased employment opportunities in grocery stores for teenagers the current rules and enforcement policy are unreasonable and result in excessive and unnecessary penalities for grocers and discourage them from employing teenage workers15 the lines seem clearly to have been dr awn but during subsequent hearings they were the subject of dispute on july 11 1995 the house subcommittee on workforce protections and the house subcommittee on employeremployee relations jointly took up the issue teenagers who are looking for summer j obs today are being turned away from grocery stores which have tr aditionally hired lot of teen s to bag groceries and stock shelves representative ewing stated the ewingcombest bill would make it practical for grocery store ow ners to hire teenagers to stock shelves and then throw the empty boxes into the store baler of course some of the older machines might still be in use and so he went on to stre ss that under our bill teenagers would still be prohibited from even loading these older machines16 representative combest argued that fines under ho 12 would seem to contradict commonsense even for washington dc standards the bill he stated strengthens the current standard in many ways including improvements in design training maintenance and insp ection of balers to meet the tougher american national standards institute ansi guidelines it provides business an incentive to retrofit their older balers to meet these more stringent requirements pointing to the age of the regulation he stated maybe we should rename this re gulation the rip van winkle rule he added this sleepy old baler re gulation was promulgated with the best of intentions but it simply is outdated for todays more advanced technology he appealed to congress to do something to reduce the currently high youth unemployment rate which for youth ag ed 16 to 19 was more than 16 percent in 199417httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32881crs6 18 golodner had chaired the us department of labor child labor advisory committee during the late 1980s and subsequently was cochair of the child

see coalition press release feb 15 2005speaking for regulation was linda f golodner president of the national consumers league18 she noted that young persons had very limited understanding of the range of potential hazards in the workplace golodner proceeded through series of questions concerning the paper baler for the most part she said balers are located in isolated areas in basement or an outbuilding one the one hand this may rende r them less likely to be u tilized by casual baler but their isolation may also provide an incentive to just go ahead and get the work done if problem occurs their isolati on might render the balercompactor too far away from authority for quick response further where worker loads balercompactor he may find it necessary to rearrange the boxes or materials in the machine to reach into the machine to readjust the load or to clear jam such worker likely feels an obligation to ensure that materials actually make it into the machine she reminded the members that paper baler is large dangerous machine and one from which pers ons under 18 should remain clear19 as the committee moved for markup labor secretary robert reich wrote to chairman william f goodling rpa reic h explained once more the nature of the problem that hr 1114 would undercut ssential protections now afforded youth as workers he urged the committee not give favorable consideration to the bill he stated commitment to promoting em ployment opportunitiesfor youth but not those that present risk to their health and safety lthough representatives of the grocery industry allege that modern balers are safe for minors to load the risks will be greatly compounded because employers minors parents and enforcement officials will experience confusion over which balers the minors may legally load this bill would pl ace working youth at substantial risk of injury andor death given this risk i would again urge that your committee not report this bill20 the

been both unexpected and retroactive janet ramble speaking for the washington state auto dealers association explained that the department had created something called strike force and had targeted auto dealers the department she stated has changed their policy but they didnt notif anyone that they had reinterpreted incidental and occasional to mean emergency only44 both the national automobile

auto dealers in washington state the new york times reported during the spring of 1998 say it ne ver occurred to them that they could be breaking the law by giving parttime jobs to 16 and 17yearolds and so the times added the auto dealers came to cong ress for law that would supersede the dol regulation darlene adkins of the national consumers league viewed the situation differently what were seeing is this trend of employers industries and associations getting penalized for child labor violations and instead of saying we need to fix this problem and comply with the law theyre putting pressure on legislators to change the law46 on july 31 1997 representative larry combest rtx introduced hr 2327 bill titled the drive for teen employment act it was markedup and reported to the full

of the legislation argued that the departmental requirement significantly restricts the ability of teenagers to gain valuable experience in the workplace and has created confusion for many businesses as result he stated there have been number of employers primarily automob ile dealerships which have been fined thousands of dollars for allowing teens to drive cars from one lot to another or to nearby gas station for refueling he expressed his strong support for the measure47 labor secretary alexis herman opposed the b ill in tter to committee chairman goodling she expressed concern that the result would be an increase in the number of automobilerelated injuries and deaths caused by very young and inexperienced drivers many persons in the targeted group 16 to 17 years of age will have just been licensed to drive nd were the legisla tion adopted would be spending as much as onefifth of their workweek behind the wheel on public roads and highways she pointed out that the measure as written could also cover pizza delivery persons in what some have identified as fastpaced and highly competitive field she concluded that pub lic policy dictates th at any modifications to weaken child labor protections be carefully weighed against the potential harm to the health and safety of these young people48 the congress acts on september 28 1998 re presentative fawell moved to suspend the rules and to bring hr 2327 to the floor as called up the bill in amended form evidenced some concession to departmental views first it provided that persons under 17 years of age may not drive automobiles or trucks on public roadways as part of their employment second occupational driving by 17 year olds was permitted only if cer tain conditions were met mainly safety factors49 representative william ford dmi termed the measure bipartisan and commended the various advocates of protec tion for their insights and persistence which had resulted in legislation addressing many of the legitimate concerns that had been raised50 representative robert andrews dnj viewed the bill as youth employment bill he noted frankly if the young person is not permitted to drive on occasion his

in others it is prepared in separate facilities from the perspective of childyouth worker or of his employer this could pose dilemma and gi ven this evolution some argued that the place of performance in plain view added to the regulatory conf usion in some cases youth workers may perform most cooking jobs b ecause in the nature of the work all cooking is performed in the plain view of the customers in another environment those minors would not be able to perform the identical functions because all cooking is done in closed kitchen away from the customers view further complication has been the advent of quipment such as microwaves automatic cooking machines and systems and co mputerized equipment and systems59 the reagan proposals 1982 in midjuly 1982 the reagan administration proposed revision of empl oyment options for minors of 14 and 15 years of age60 the proposed rule would have permitted employment in occupations involving cooking and baking except thos involving the handling of hot grease at or above 140 degrees fahre nheit such cooking it was explained should not be over an open flame or involve cooking w ith containers under pressure which have safety valves further there would ve been an extended pattern of work from 3 hours to 4 hours day while school was in session and from 7 pm to 9 pm for closing time61 the preface discussed the working pattern s of 14 and 15yearolds and noted while the industry distribution of thes establishments is unknown they are most likely concentrated in the retail and service tr ades it added the interest shown by the fast food and amusement part indus tries in revision of the hours provision of the child labor regulations supports this view62 in the subcommittee on labor standards representative george miller observed that the reagan administration had unveiled its first concrete plan for expanding job opportunities he branded the proposals as profoundly unwise the department has proposed an unconscionable

years of age69 the national restaurant association nra supported allowing 14 and 15 yearolds to perform cooking including immersing foods in grease or tending cooked foods it also suggested that standard of 140 degrees fahrenheit serve as the cutoff point for handling hot greas before or after cooking where such workers were concerned it urged that children and youth workers 14 and 15 years of age be protected against an open flame and that they not be involved with pressure cookers that have safety valve the nra cited the current regulations as product of bygone era and stated that cooking and baking should be permitted regardless of where they are performed70 the national council of chain restaurants also supported allowing 14 and 15yearold minor s to cook and bake it labeled the current regulations as outda ted and stated that the in plain view interpretation does not lend itself to practical and consistent application in the restaurant industry71 diverse comments had been made pro nd regarding equipment deep fat or oil fryers and the carrying of hot grease to and from various receptacles dol however seemed to focus on determinati ons tending toward the industry position the department has preliminarily conclude d that the current regulations should be revised so that 14 and 15yearold s may perform limited number of cooking activities ie only those that are safe and appropriate for their age group the department it noted believes that this regulato ry revision can be done without negatively impacting employment opportun ities for young workers it

provision comment was unanimous in supporting the elimination of the in plain view standard but there was disagreement as to what should replace it73 the department came to the conclusion that yet another system might be useful namely one based on exposure to temperature as practical matter however some expressed doubt that the minors their employers and enforcement officials would be able to determine when and if the equipment oil or grease had c ooled to the permissible temperature of 140 degrees fahrenheit74 however the maximum allowable temperature would be 100 degrees fahrenheit for cleaning up and disposing of grease the department recognizes that comp liance with this standard will require vigilance by employers whose managers and supervisors must assure that equipment and materials have cooled to 100 degrees f or less before young workers are allowed to undertake any cleanup tasks such as washing the machines or removing or filtering the oil or grease but the ban on cleaning grilles that exceed temperature of 100 degrees f would not prohibit 14 and 15yearolds from performing the normal grill maintenance that involves the use of water and sp atula to scrape away and remove food particles and grease from the surface of the grill75 the final rule permits children and yout h 14 and 15yearolds to cook only on electric or gas grills which do not have open flames

the prohibition of roofing work and all work on roof some recommended expansion of the ban to include any phase of roofing work including the construction or repair of roof sheathing in stallation of gutters and dow nspouts or any other related roofing work the single commenter not in support of further ban was the associated builders and contractors abc which commented that ban would jeopardize valuable careeradvancing opportun ities and would prevent the brightest and best of noncollegebound adolescents fro m being recruited into careers in the construction industry88 thus the department has preliminarily concluded that an expansion of the existing ban be institute d to include all work on or about the roof of building89 but nothing was immediately accomplished in middecember 2005 the bush administration issued final rule on the roofing trades after considering comments received through the years the bush administration decided to reverse the early kennedy exemptions and issue an all inclusive ban after considering comments and available experience the department had concluded that the dangers originally cited still persist for youth working not only in roofing occupations but also on or about roofs emphasis added the latter term on or about roofs might be misconstrued to avoid the possibility of confusion as to the scope of this prohibition the proposed definition of the term on or about roof has been modified in the final rule to clarify that the term includes wo rk upon or in close proximity to roof and to clarify that the installation of trusses or joists is included in the construction of the base of roofs w ithin the meaning of this definition90 in addition the ban would extend to the in stallation and servicin g of television and communication equipment such as cable and satellite dishes the installation and servicing of heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment or any similar work that is required to be performed on or about roofs in addition the ban includes all jobs on the ground relate d to roofing operations such as roofing laborer roofing helper materials handler nd tending tarheater91 thus almost all enterprise involving

standards in addition there are 17 hazardous occupations orders for children and youth engaged in nonag ricultural work and an additional 11 hazardous occupations orders for children and youth engaged in agricultural work the regulations are different depending upon the age of the worker the type of work performed and conditi ons under which employment is offered some of these regulations have been in place for many years which might to some suggest need for updating during the past several congresses number of proposals that would have amended the child labor provisions of the ac t have been offered some have focused upon work by children and youth in nonagricultural enterprise others in agricultural employment while these have generally not been acted upon aside from those discussed above the conti nuing concern with employment of children and youth remains an item of interest for some members of congress and could emerge again as public policy issue
