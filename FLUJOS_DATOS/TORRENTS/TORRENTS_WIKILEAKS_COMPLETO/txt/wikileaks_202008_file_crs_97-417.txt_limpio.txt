activities of the us department of agriculture operation and cost jasper womach agricultural policy specialist resources science and industry division summary the us department of agriculture usda has long operated programs that directly assist farmers and others with the production and marketing of numerous crops including tobacco in most cases the crops themselves have not been controversial however where tobacco is involved the use of federal funds has been called into question taken together all of the directly tobaccorelated activities of the usda generated net expenditures of an estimated 308 million in fy2006 and the budget anticipates net expenditures of 295 million for fy2007 over 90 of this spending is related to crop insurance the federally financed tobacco price support program once the major form of tobacco farmer assistance and in some years costly program was terminated at the end of crop year 2004 the usda is prohibited by language in the annual appropriations law from spending funds to help promote tobacco exports and to conduct research relating to production processing or marketing of tobacco and tobacco products other tobaccorelated activities have been subjected to congressional scrutiny the usda does operate numerous programs that are not tobaccospecific but are available to farmers that produce tobacco and other crops these are not examined in this report price support program from the late 1930s through the 2004 crop the usda operated the tobacco price support program it was designed to raise and stabilize farm tobacco prices at higher levels than they otherwise would have reached this was accomplished through combination of farm marketing quotas and federal nonrecourse commodity loans administration was done through the county offices of the farm service agency fsa1 and loan program funding was provided through the commodity credit corporation 1 httpwwwfsausdagovfsawebappareahomesubjecttobatopiclanding congressional research service the library of congress crs2 ccc in 1982 legislation was adopted that applied an assessment on all tobacco marketings to be used to offset price support losses and make the loan operations function at net cost to taxpayers on two occasions legislation relieved the program of its obligations on large inventories these actions cost about 1 billion in addition congress made socalled tobacco loss payments of 852 million during fy2000fy2003 to offset sharp decline in farm sales to domestic and foreign buyers overall from fy1982 through fy2005 tobacco support net expenditures totaled about 157 billion for an annual average cost of 71 million after congress enacted the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of 2004 pl 108357 the tobacco support program came to an end tobacco quota owners and farm operators were compensated for the diminished value of their farms and the loss of future support with payment of 96 billion over 10 years funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers because of this tobacco buyout ccc support program expenditures have been eliminated and it is not anticipated there will be any future ad hoc assistance to tobacco farmers fsa administrative expenditures associated with the buyout are estimated to be 1827 million in fy2006 and the budget for fy2007 is zero for additional information see crs report rs20802 tobacco farmer assistance and crs report rs22046 tobacco quota buyout federal crop insurance the federal crop insurance program administered by usdas risk management agency2 provides farmers with subsidized multiperil insurance on tobacco and other crops the insurance covers unavoidable production losses due to adverse weather insect infestations plant diseases and other natural calamities it does not cover avoidable losses caused by neglect or poor farming practices sales and servicing of policies are done by private companies with some federal reimbursement and most of the net indemnity losses fall upon the government additionally the premiums have been subsidized since 1980 in order to encourage participation and avoid enactment of ad hoc disaster assistance programs experimental crop revenue coverage available for wheat corn and soybeans is not available for tobacco total net federal expenditures for tobacco crop insurance coverage include outlays for crop loss indemnity payments plus the premium subsidies plus sales administrative expenses less the farmerpaid premiums net federal outlays are estimated to be 279 million in fy2006 and are budgeted at 287 million for fy2007 tobacco inspection and grading the usdas agricultural marketing service ams3 carries out voluntary inspection and grading services at tobacco auction markets and import terminals the establishment of uniform standards of quality with grading by unbiased experts helps assure that auction markets perform efficiently and fairly historically federal grading 2 httpwwwrmausdagov 3 httpwwwamsusdagovtob crs3 provided an assurance of quality for tobacco held as collateral for ccc price support loans additionally imported and domestic tobacco is inspected voluntarily to guard against illegal pesticide residues since 1981 the grading and inspection services have been financed through user fees now set at 062 per 100 pounds for grading and 085 per 100 pounds for pesticide testing these fees are sufficient to fully cover the costs of inspection activities as well as the cost of developing and maintaining the standards applied by the inspectors this has dramatically reduced the use of ams inspectors ams inspection work now is done on imported tobacco as nearly all of the domestic crop is contracted for sale rather than auctioned market news services the agricultural marketing service4 provides market news service for sellers and buyers of tobacco daily reports of grades prices and sales volume at the auction markets are distributed throughout the tobacco industry the cost of the tobacco news service in fy2006 is an estimated 190000 and the budget for fy2007 is 194000 similar market news services are provided for all major agricultural commodities market news services are designed to provide farmers and others in the marketing chain with timely accurate and unbiased information on market conditions to help them make better decisions on where and when to sell and buy commodities according to economists such information is necessary for market economy to function efficiently and effectively in the absence of taxpayerfunded market news service the information might be collected and sold by commercial enterprises but questions of bias could arise tobacco research in the past usdafunded research related to tobacco production processing and marketing some of the research was carried out by agriculture research service ars5 scientists and some was done by university scientists funded through the cooperative state research education and extension service csrees6 annual research spending by the usda averaged about 66 million until it was terminated under the fy1995 agricultural appropriations law and subsequent laws the restriction does not apply to research on medical biotechnological food and industrial uses of tobacco special research grant of 329000 was approved for fy2006 to investigate alternative uses of tobacco plant material similar spending is anticipated in fy2007 extension education the jointly funded federalstatecounty extension education and technical assistance program is designed to serve as link between the nations agricultural research institutions and farmers the term extension conveys the concept of extending the work of researchers into the community at the county level extension agents distribute information and expert advice to farmers and others through published materials 4 httpwwwamsusdagovtob 5 httpwwwarsusdagovmainmainhtm 6 httpwwwcsreesusdagov crs4 seminars and direct consultation the state extension staff given their close proximity to researchers continuously trains the county agents and designs and prepares materials for use by the county agents in fy1997 csrees spent 680000 on tobaccorelated extension activities federal funding was eliminated in fy1998 by the administration and remains at zero all state and county extension activity related to tobacco is funded by the states economic analysis the economic research service ers7 is responsible for assembling and analyzing economic data and forecasting market data within the usda as with the other major commodities ers assembles and analyzes supply and demand data on tobacco ers periodically publishes analytical findings in tobacco situation and outlook report economists also conduct studies on related topics such as the structural characteristics of tobacco farming the role of tobacco in local economies and the likely impact of program changes and policy options ers spending on tobacco analysis during fy2006 is estimated at 123000 and the budget for fy2007 is 125000 international data collection and analysis the foreign agriculture service fas8 through its network of agricultural counselors and attaches collects economic intelligence throughout the world this intelligence is used by trade negotiators economists policymakers and the business community tobacco is one in long list of commodities on which the fas staff collects information the usda estimates that the cost of this effort for tobacco will be 200000 in fy2006 and the budget for fy2007 is 205000 domestic crop data collection the national agricultural statistics service nass9 collects fieldlevel data on planting intentions crop conditions harvesting progress yield and production this information helps the business community including farmers develop marketing plans also it serves to alert policy officials of likely shortages or surpluses thereby facilitating plans for any government action that might be taken the information that nass compiles and distributes is considered by economists to be critical to an efficiently functioning market economy it is argued that the absence of nass data would most severely disadvantage farmers and government officials who are least able to obtain information through alternative sources tobacco is one in long list of commodities on which nass staff collects information the estimated cost of this effort for tobacco is 231000 in fy2005 and the budget for fy2007 is 231000 7 httpwwwersusdagovbriefingtobacco 8 httpwwwfasusdagovcotstobaccoasp 9
