havingness routines 1 2 and 3 lecture given on 16 june 1961 thank you all right this is the 17th of something or other sixteenth sixteenth of june thank you i depend on these lectures to find on the time track well you have reached the end of week and i hope that hasnt made you reach the end of your tether you look younger all except reg okay and undoubtedly this week youve accumulated enormous numbers of questions im waiting yes kay female voice when youre running sop goals with the have and confront process as you run do your have and confront processes change yes thank you i should put you straight on this when youre running sop goals using the have and confront processes and actually running routine 2 with have and confront processes the processes change with considerable rapidity they can be expected to change so you have to be very alert now youre not trying to run the tone arm motion out of the confront process youre not trying to but the confront process must move the tone arm you see confront process is very junior process it is very mild process but it has the effect of making people feel sane it is quite good in that you see this fellow hes feeling all confused or something and hes had lot of cognitions all of which are opposite and confront process is really doll it changes the immediate state and actually it has almost longterm benefit you never saw the results of any process fade out as quickly on confront process except maybe have objective havingness and confront are both unlimited processes but if you run them in an unlimited fashion like you would run sop goals or something of this sort your pc would feel absolutely marvelous just feel absolutely wonderful you im sure right in this room there are people who have had this happen to them and they just had seventyfive hours of havingness you know just marvelous you see and they just feel fine and week goes by and they still feel all right and another week goes by and they dont feel that good and then another week goes by and theyre right back where they started same way with confront it has this odd aspect that is why you dont find the word confront on the prehav scale well that isnt the original reason the original reason is another one but you dont find it on the prehav scale because it is of lasting benefit it is just marvelous for making somebody feel good they get unconfused and they come up to present time and so forth and the have process that orients them and actually to know more about these processes to know the answer to your answer im not digressingyou actually have to know really what these processes are and then that alone would give you judgment in when and how to use these processes see and it would answer all sorts of things so i wouldnt have to be telling you well you run eight minutes and seventeen seconds of confront and eighteen seconds point three of have you see because thats silly it can really depend on your judgment exclusively if you understand really what these processes are supposed to do and what they are and when youve accomplished that end with either of these processes you of course have accomplished that end of it that is all the whole criteria is this do you feel better now fellows running hayingness you see well your meter will tell you whether or not he feels better because the needle is looser if the needle loosens up between the front test of the havingness and the end test of the havingness which by the way you always use get your pencil busy you always use this test in every session that you run havingness you always have him squeeze the cans at the beginning of the havingness and squeeze the cans at the end of the havingness and see if the needle has loosened you got that so every time you run havingness you go through that little routine thats part and parcel not of just testing for havingness but that is part and parcel to using it and all you want out of havingness is loosened needle now how loose well its just like the onecommand process if you ask somebody to look around the room and find something thats really real to them and they all of sudden find one object in the room that is really real to them and theyre not pretending about in any way shape or form that is really alive its marvelous process and that is its total effect its onecommand process the other one is think of somebody that believes youre sane or doesnt think youre insane the person thinks of one person and thats it now of course he might think of two or three more and you might be able to kid yourself in believing that and it might even appear that itd be good thing you see to run these processes for ten more commands or twenty more commands or fifteen or twenty hours if theyre this good you see they ought to be that good well theyre not that good and until person is way up and almost clear havingness has lasting benefit the valence eats it up see the valence and consumption circuits eat up the havingness got the idea now its absolutely necessary when he is almost clear to stabilize his whole case and his whole case will stabilize and his stabilization at clear will take place when havingness stays stable once run it stays there and this isnt needed test but happens to be one of the tests well this person is awful close to clear because when he runs havingness it stays with him this orients him in the environment he goes out and looks around the world and it stays that way he gets good reality on the world for instance he remedies his havingness in this room and his havingness is remedied for this universe got it until person is up in that kind of state he remedies his havingness for this room but it is not remedied for the next room see all right as long as the fellow has dominant valence or dominant machinery its going to eat up all the havingness you run on him and you can run the whole bank with havingness you can sit there and the engrams will run by and the case will change and itll just be dandy and boy are we producing an effect but thats all youre doing youre producing effect youre not giving the case any lasting gain the lasting gain of havingness occurs somewhere in the vicinity of eight or ten commands very short very brief and when youve done that youve done it now what youve done then is sort of peg the guy at new level and that havingness that much havingness remains constant thats okay hes got that he can have that but if you run another half an hour of it he cant have any of that you see so its just waste of time lets run the case by music therapy angeles fashion or something youve heard of that i imagine lets give the case some good auditing with some arc straightwire and then lets spend the next rest of the week on music therapy and then of course any benefit he got you see occurs in the first few minutes of arc straightwirewhich by the way is another one of these processes that works dandy for few commands and then the rest of it is just lost see theres use doing it yes itll run the case yes the pictures will change yes the person but look this is hell of way to run case to get his attention on the wall so hell run his bank see what youre doing is run shift of attention after havingness works after about twelve fifteen twenty the zenith i dont know but the zenith certainly wouldnt be more than about thirtytwo commands i mean itd be up in that range after that all youre doing is saying take your attention off your bank thank you take your attention off your bank thank you and of course the bank changes and the engram that he was halfway through mysteriously moves the rest of the way through but in view of the fact that it moves the rest of the way through without the pc inspecting it in any way of course its benefit itll also move through the next day if you want to run an engram perpetually forever why just keep running it with havingness say now youre nicely fixed in that engram good youve got that engram 1601 it was when you murdered the king very good all right thats fine now youre sure youre there thats good all right now were going to run some havingness and we run twenty commands of havingness and then we say well how about that 1601 oh he says that went oh well youll have to get that back lets get that back now and just just how was it that you went about the assassination what kind of weapon what kind of weapon would you most hate to be assassinated with ohhhh oh all right all right thats good now get your idea of that weapon you got that real good all right thats fine now look at that wall thank you look at that wall thank you look at that wall and the engram will reel straight through again and you could actually run it through perpetually i dont think it would ever run out unless those little beginning commands of getting him into it and the little datings that you were doing happened to blow it but the havingness itself will move the engram through move the engram through move like making somebody sit in cinema through the picture time after time and making him look at the usher years later they see the motion picture and they say whats this you see never seen this before so you get the point here that so thats limited sort of process yes itll apparently produce enormous results after run for few commands apparently and this is very inviting back in 55 i was investigating this like mad and i knew there was something there in this havingness process but i couldnt establish exactly what and it was mysterious and actually if you review the old tapes and bulletins and things like this youll find out i said so often that i didnt know what havingness was all about same way with confront because confront is actually subjective havingness now youre going to run the reverse youre going to make him face the wall youre going to make him face the bank i dont care what the havingness command was exterior or what the confront process was subjective all youve said to him is now look at that wall now you got the real universe thats right thats real good got it real good well look at it few more times oh thats fine feel better now all right thats dandy thats it you got it all right now you have him look at the bank and you say bank bank bank bank i dont care what command youre using see for the confront process youre saying bank bank bank bank bank bank bank bank you feel better now the guy says yes oddly enough i do well dont expect him to go on feeling better for the rest of his life you see because its too arduous as process it there they do things odd things will happen doing them therere vagaries the full benefit of the havingness process and the full benefit of the confront process as far as therapeutic value is concerned is realized in something on the order of eight to dozen commands in havingness zenith about thirtytwo commands and confront well its little harder to establish in terms of time but what you want really is wiggle on the tone arm you want the tone arm to wiggle and preferably go lower if you can make the tone arm do that with confront process and you can get it done in ten minutes or fifteen minutes or something why youve done it and if youre not doing it in ten or fifteen minutes youd better say well its just too bad but this pc will have to feel bad till the next session i mean thats it because process is nothing to fool with if it is not producing benefit and if its not producing benefit you wont get tone arm motion got it so therefore the havingness and the confront processes apply all the way from the bottom of routine 2 to the near top of routine 3 routine 2 to routine 3 hm and they are always used exactly the same way you use them exactly the same way but look this case is changing so if you find them too early youre just going to have to shift them every time you run them and if you find them too late all youre using them for is stabilization of clear and in the middle ground its sensible but you keep your eagle eye on the needle for the havingness and you keep your eye on the tone arm for the confront and if all of suddenthis persons been running along fine on the confront process of get the idea of your bank flying by at ninety miles an hour that was his confront process and the hitherto if he was sitting at 40 it would go to 45 and it would then blow down to 35 see some much such evolution as this ive gotten more data on this since ive given anybody any of it by the way im glad you asked the question ive had quite bit of data accumulated on this one way or the other i havent even written bulletin on it and it works just fine get the idea of your bank flying by at ninety miles an hour thank you get the idea of your bank flying by at ninety miles an hour whatever the having confront process is and hitherto it would go up half tone and then it would blow down tone something on that order and as soon as it blew down bit youd come off of it and youd skip it after that ah thats good that criteria by the way used to be used for the havingness process and its not used there use it for the confront now all right and you start him in on the confront process and the tone arm doesnt go up and you run ten commands and the tone arm doesnt go up and you run ten fifteen commands and the tone arm hasnt gone anyplace yet well its too confusing to find another confront process right at that moment you simply come off of it run your havingness process and thats it and the next time you audit the pc say now we are going to find confront process because that confront process is longer functional all right you always do the cansqueeze test you wouldnt have had to have done any of these things you see if we werent traveling at fast rate of speed with our auditing progress it was perfectly all right the finite period of time that they lasted before didnt require all these cautions but they certainly require it now so here you are with your case going along at whizzing bang and you give that cansqueeze test just before you run the thing all right you say squeeze the cans you watch the needle you see squeeze the cans watch the needle dont necessarily set the sensitivity knob who cares and then you say look around here and find something you can agree with thank you look around here and find something you can agree with thank you look around here and find something you can agree with thank you run it about eight times something like this maybe twelve times and you dont count them its not that exact an action counting them is something on the order of the ensign going out and holding the sextant upside down in blearyeyed way and shooting venus when it should have been arcturus and then he comes back down and spends three hours of the most minute mathematical calculations you ever heard of dont you see and he reduces the ship down to pinpoint only hes 150 miles north of the headwaters of the nile you see its very amusing you see to take something that is of gross application and then figure it out minutely and yet the world of mathematics is doing that all the time thatd be something on the order of counting the havingness processes dont you see you run it kind of watching the pc dont watch the needle on the havingness process and the pc says i agree to that i agree to that i agree to that and i agree to that agree to that agree to that agree to that yeah and you say all right thank you very much okay now would you give the electrodes squoze and you look at it wham you say all right thank you very much thats the end of that process bridge out dont bother confront process is run before the havingness process and what you do there is you say now get the idea of your bank flying by at ninety miles an hour with witch on it thank you whatever your confront process is watch that tone arm watch that tone arm and it goes zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzthoom and you say thank you very much thats very good ah thats real nice thats fine how do you feel now he says i feel much better you say good thats it and all they are are stabilizers of the gain now an individual gets idea of what else is going on he is running this horse you see and hes running fail leave on horse and my god he just runs fail leave on horses and fail leave on horses and fail leave on horses and fail leave on horses and fail leave on horses and fail leave on horses and horses failing to leave him and him failing to leave horses and others failing to leave horses and horses failing to leave others and horses failing to leave horses andman hes just been having ball you see and all this time hes been having trouble see thats the way the bank is going on this silly valence and the valence is separating out but hes having trouble this whole time whats happening here this is gets to be very amusing when youre running valence directly because whats happening here you know there are other quadrupeds that failed to leave namely donkeys and hes gone along through the course of auditing obeying the auditing command very nicely except every once in while something in the bank would say heehaw you know or something of this sort and hed say well down get away from here now were supposed to be dealing with horses and during the process of his auditing he will stack up quite few donkeys over here somewhere on his left or somewhere behind him therell be some repressed donkeys get the idea this is inevitable see well now listen lets give him chance to get rid of the donkeys and thats why we run the confront process whatever the confront process is the first thing hes going to confront are the things he kind of restrained himself from confronting because he was running horses the mechanics of the process in other words have prevented him from confronting certain things well so he blows that off you dont hear any more about the donkeys donkeys arent any difficulty for him theyre just an associated terminal see all right lets say we have one case running on terminal that doesnt occur in this lifetime never occurs in this lifetime the terminal doesnt thats it or if it did itd be so slight but the person for various reasons not necessarily this particular case that there arent any in the present lifetime but just the case is the person is incapable of being one in this lifetime by reason of sex so were running this person when and how were running this person out of the present lifetime all the time on the terminal well lets give him chance to catch up lets give him chance to come up to present time and the best way to get him up to present time is confront process confront is the old answer 1950 of how you got pc up to present time you could have confronted any pc that got stuck on the track back up to present time if you moved him out of present time you could have confronted him back up to present time dont you see on such terminal if you do not run the confront process vast catastrophe is going to occur but the pc is going to be perpetually uncomfortable and the fellow will finish the session over here holding down these eight donkeys you see and he will find himself going around until the next session with these damn donkeys you see its not even catastrophic it will not hold up his progress so it is not vital action it simply keeps the case on little more even keel and maybe speeds it up because the case might not get so many arc breaks out of session because theyre in little bit better shape in the physical universe dont you see thats why you use the havingness and confront process now when you use it naturallyyou would certainly be wanting to use them on somebody who kept feeling little spinny if the persons kind of feeling little spinny level by level and you dont have his havingness and confront process you havent got the weapon necessary to set him right little bit of confront does marvels for the fellows spinniness you know guys can get pretty far off beam with this spinniness they can get pretty nyarowrrrow you know anyway where do we have borderline between not running them and running them its just auditors judgment its just the state of case and auditors judgment and they run all the way through from routine 2 right on down through to the bottom of routine 1 and the more the case is progressing the more rapidly the havingness and confront processes will change and you will start somebody out and hell be getting along fine they dont necessarily go up scale or down scale you know just as word of warning person starts out look around here and find something you can have thank you this remedies his havingness beautifully you know look around here and find something you can have wonderful it just remedies his havingness gorgeously and about eight sessions later hes made good case gain see hes had good run on level or something like this and hes got lot of withholds off on joburg and you run look around here and find something you can have look around here eight times squeeze the cans again you know and it just goes clank almost stands up and barks at you see it doesnt move anywhere near like it did on the first can squeeze well this is running his havingness down now well its not temporary condition that will fade out in during the next session something or other he might have gotten an arc break you havent caught or some other things might have caused this but youd catch those on the end rudiments this havingness process has ceased to work and now youre liable to find something corny heres havingness process why look around here and find something that would substitute for something if something wasnt there and you say how in the name of common sense can this havingness process you see which youve picked off the list or any existing list there are lots of them you say how could it remedy anybodys havingness well its doing so because the cansqueeze test before and after shows it loosens up the needle and youll get along and youll suffer with this along with this one and your curiosity and mystery and notknow of how this could remedy anybodys havingness and all of sudden why clank can squeeze it didnt work youre going to have to find another havingness process and this time you find look around here and find something you can have and look around here and find something you would rather not want or whatever it is and that remedies havingness now and then we get another one what scene isnt that wall part of oh that works like breeze you see whats happening here the bank is shifting the valence is going nuts the pc is getting better but the valence is going crazy and you can expect the prehav level on valence to deteriorate and you can expect the level of complexity of the havingness process to deteriorate and you can expect the level of complexity of the confront process to deteriorate as long as theyre being run on valence and hes not rid of the valence yet so therefore youre running on valence got it so therefore they deteriorate and theres only one other thing id like to add on this general subject there apparently is some idea abroad that the only thing that will clear anybody is running valence directly and immediately you look what happens to valences on routine 2 run all kinds of little sidepanel valences start flying off the main valence and you get rid of plenty of extra secondary valences on routine 2 run and when you finally ask the fellow for his goal after youve thoroughly done routine 2 ah it might be 150 or 200 hours later we dont care but if you ask the fellow for his goal and his terminal and so forththeres his goal theres his terminal bang it falls you assess them for level and all of sudden they run out wheres this goal wheres this terminal well you assess them for level and what are you doing now youre just doing sop goals but of course you ye your general runs hit all these valences only they hit them less speedily they separate them out more they do different things with valences but they get rid of valences and cchs routine 1 gets rid of valences like mad they all do the same thing the whole criteria on routine 1 routine 2 routine 3 is not how nutty you are but how fast these things will operate and i will lay you down an operating rule right now for these an operating rule in uncertain terms and that is if case in large quantities of auditing has not had significant change and im talking about past processes or even present processes if he hasnt had significant change over long period of time hes still got his lumbosis his zorch is still out of order you got one answer this is policy it has to be policy because valences protest on it regardless of graph meter read opinion or objections you run routine 1 got that one hcob 17 june 1961 hcob 16 june 1961 cchs and routine 1 i just put it in the mill i might as well tell you what it is dont monkey with this one huh if case hasnt been rapidly changing on auditing the most rapid way to make the case change is the cchs with security check if the case hasnt been changing over long period of time in auditing the most rapid way to make them change is cchs and security check it has nothing to do with their nuttiness we dont care whether theyre nutty or not nutty or anything else its just whats the effective thing to do thats all so if you follow that as policy ill give you an idea wing goes into new york city and theres perfectly nice fellow and he has always been nice fellow and everybody knows hes nice fellow and he is very sane and he has been very helpful and so forth in scientology and wing says to him all right you say you want some auditing all right ill give you some auditing im going to run the cchs on you and the fellow says under circumstances well my god he just did an assessment on the man didnt he do you know all of us have got the cchs unflat on us practically weve had them run little bit its too beefy process to leave unflat itll flatten off of course you get up toward clear itll flatten off in morning but sooner or later youre going to have to collide with them and face up to the fact that they require finishing its more serious than that the reason wing would say im going to run cchs on you is he happens to know that the fellow has had lumbosis ever since 1952 and it hasnt disappeared and the fellow has had bit of auditing quite bit of auditing during that period of time without monkeying around about it and without running into whatever it was or trying to analyze what it was that kept this fellow from cutting free of his lumbosis and spending eighteen hours in the arena bleeding and raw fighting this lion to find out what is this that is so tenacious that is continuing lumbosis on this case and getting very brilliant and brainy about the whole thing just give that hand brother thats all and all of sudden mr lumbosis when you combine give that hand and the rest of them with security checks that lumbosis first it runs up little white flag first you see this helmet being waved over the parapet you see rather meanly you know you cant get you cant get you cant get and then finally you see dirty pocket handkerchief you know being waved and then they finally help you and then they want to beat parley and all kinds of things and then all of sudden why oops there went my lumbosis hey it did you know and thats it what ive done is figure out way that you cant make mistake with case you see there are several things you can know about case you can put them on an emeter and find out how they read thats very reliable you can give them profile you can read the profile thats very reliable theres another way of reading case looking at them you can look at them make up your mind about it and thats another way of figuring out case you see all right theres yet another way this person has been audited for the last four years and hasnt had much gain isnt release yet or something like that well thats complete assessment of the case isnt it otherwise wed have to assume that all auditors are bad auditors which they arent wed have to assume that processes have worked in all these years and they have see and wed have to assume these various things well why sort all this garbage out why spend hours and hours and hours and hours and hours monkeying around with this because look somebody else has already spent hours and hours and hours monkeying around with this one well theres one answer and that is it evidently doesnt surrender to the basic mechanics of formal auditing whatever it is thats wrong with the guy doesnt normally hes alterising the commands or hes auditing through machine or hes going on big via or hes got present time restimulator that is very very rough its this its that it could be ten thousand different things and you can worry yourself to death over it but look out of all those things theres only one common denominator for the whole lot and that is hes been audited quite bit and hasnt had significant case change thats fine thats all thats it so you get up on the pitchers mound lets see whats pitcher in cricket bowler you stand on the bowlers box or you get in on the pitchers mound and you wind up and you pitch cchs man thats all or you bowl them god im international today anyway there you are you ask for simpler tearapart of case than this and theres reason to be upset about it because actually the very reason that person gets upset about the fact that somebody thinks theyre little bit potty is an index in itself you see this because it tells you they must be worried about the worlds opinion of them you see it tells them that pride is entering into processing well i dont know ive been run on the cchs i dont see anything very bad about it i know other people whove been run on the cchs it produced results on everybody i ever saw it run on actually if it was run right so whats the difference here see thats all there is to it i hope i answered your question anyway female voice thank you very much good all right male voice and big one of mine good enough male voice same here good we had an interesting incident by the way going on in course special course thats being run someplace we had boy hes pretty stormy hes quite guy pretty stormy and he walked in on this course and found out that there was kind of lot of yowyowyow going on about oh well this stuff about security checks and so on you know all these cases advance spins and so on and he got down and he told them now look you guys this is your last chance see because if you dont make it in this course im gonna make sure that you just go out and spin forever so you better get serious about these joburg security checks and youd better snap and pop and youd better give up those withholds and get it whizzin and bangin and everybody says well all right you know they got in and started standing and delivering as though we were being attacked by highwaymen then the most interesting thing evolved very important person in that area had been invalidating security checking and most of the students had withholds about that person and that one little speech all by itself cleaned up whole scientology area they had been practically under orders to regard the security checks as just nonsensical idea and ive just heard from another area that wrote special security check for the academy i think thats very nice i like that sooner or later well get out one for the academy and the only difference between that and standard joburg will be in every third question what unkind thought have you thought about your instructors and so forth get the idea itll be scientology personnel about every third question you see thats the only difference itll have but this was nice sweet security check it consisted of something on the order of about twentyfive thirty questions and it all says in high generality have you ever been paid agent working in moscow directly and immediately for khruschev thats good well weve taken care of communism now have you ever been homosexual thank you very much or i dont think its that general have you ever been homosexual in this organization or something real cute probably says something on the order i didnt read it all but probably said something on the order have you paid your bill or something and that was security check that ranks with this other one have you had an arc break with that was another doll that was real wowie one so it just comes down to the fact there must be special security checks there must be standard security checks and thats it and is it happens at this moment that its hco w form 3 when we say security check we mean hco w form 3 we dont mean the special academy edited check because you see its very rapid to give it you see its very rapid to give it and the other takes too much time and because people still will walk around their withholds thats all somebody writes security check independently in some vast different part of the world that is in objection to the joburg security check you can just be sure that it has nothing whatsoever to do with joburg taking too much time in the academy in the first place certainly in an academy for gods sakes these people must learn how to do complete joburgs not be given little twentyfivequestion short form and not ever be permitted to have joburg anywhere near them which is what this adjudication amounted to you know it must not be given in the academy only this one is given in the academy interesting isnt it youve got to watch that one wherever you are you see somebody all of sudden saying well i think its perfectly all right ill give you the pat answer to this because were not stopping anybody putting together joburgs and security checks it works like this unless we lay down blanket rule that the security check given shall be an official hco ww form with number for certain purpose unless we lay that down then although we have opened the door for anybody who is inventive to write himself lot of security checks and actually contribute to scientology we have also opened the door wide for isolated areas of the world to carefully omit their own overts from the particular list and issue it as another check and that is what happened in this area i am sure this is too nonsensical this other arc break one that came out that came out before the joburg that came out before there was any real importance being put on security checking i just use it as an example of how mild security check can be but if you want to put together joburg if you think there are lot of questions missing and there certainly must be ill tell you how to put together one ive got special category going right now did you ever know anybody that had about thirty or forty baskets sitting in the same space did you know that thirty or forty baskets could occupy the same location in space that would have driven hayakawa mad wouldnt it or even korzybski but ive got one on the corner of my desk itd be absolutely impossible to rack up enough basket systems and enough filing systems to take care of all categories of my immediate projects so i put them all in the same space over here at the side of the desk but oddly enough although they get up to towering i let the projects accumulate and i know id better not let them go to files you see if they go to files i have now put the rest of the office staff to work and im going to put them to work but not this senseless filing when i get stack this high and its all questionnaires to ds of ps that ive put out and i finally see that the stack is high enough to justify my believing they have all replied like send all the profiles you have on all new academy graduates nothing of this sort that too silly project but if thered be such project id just let them stack see stack and i dont send them to file and then my basic system that i have newly been putting into effect is simply pick up the whole lot on donkey cart someday and turn it over to somebody and say sort them out and they sort them out and they bring them back but i know if i you see the answers of these projects are addressed to we have so many things going i dont have time to advise everybody what every project is so the easiest thing to do is collect them and i do collect them and i do sort them out and i do all of sudden fire one of these things when its all accumulated because we are now in zone and area of accumulating information from organizations and people and auditors you see and that sort of thing and when i ask them for some information because were so far flung it takes an awful unconscionably long time to get something all the way down the congo out through the various pirates in the congo now such as the united nations and kennedys special emissaries and so on and it takes long time to get here but it gets here and then i accumulate them and i put it together so dont think that something you send on project of this character is just waylaid and neglected because it very often isnt verner when he was over here looking over the organization one thing stuck thoroughly in his mind they showed him all the files and papers and routes and it all looked very fantastically interesting to him and amongst these oddities was the fact my initials appear on everything or my routings appear on everything and he had the idea that i sat in an ivory tower somewhere you know and never saw anything and you couldnt communicate with and all that sort of thing and he looked this over and he saw this vast ocean of accumulated detail papers dispatches all this kind of thing yeah i see them i dont always answer them i try to get them answered but i dont always answer them sometimes there is answer i think well later on ill have an answer to something like this and ill put it out in bulletin sometimes your dispatch gets answered very on very odd via but not too often and im saying this giving you this preamble of the thing if youve got questions that do not appear on these security checks or you think should appear on these security checks just address them to on an ordinary piece of dispatch paper and this file system where the twenty or thirty or forty projects all sit in exactly the same area of space eventually accumulate these things and one day why ill get some time some 230 in the morning sometime and sort them all out and stack them all up and give them to somebody and say type them up and there we are and then well sort them out well find the questions repeated very often and we can sort them out and we will have new security check now jan right now is doing very nice rundown and dick with whole track security check one question that they originated stuck in my mind on the thing is have you ever wantonly viciously and villainously destroyed hostages given to you to hold under your sacred trust or something like this so various questions on the line like this and theyre good questions this is bearcat and its the result of saying that one of these days why we need security check that when person got up about halfway to clear and his whole track keeps opening up and hes got withholds on the whole track and we keep trying to check him in this lifetime and the withholds are longer in this lifetime he goes practically potty if somebody would just ask him some of these questions why itd all turn up and work out you see all right so theres project whole track questions theres another project what peculiar questions should be asked in an academy thats another project for another security check and what peculiar questions should be asked on repetitivetype security check which while covering the whole joburg yet covers it page at time well theres got to be certain repetitive questions occur you see every time that page is asked certain other questions have got to be asked with it so that you could get in the cchs onepage administering of the joburg at time you got the idea and the fellow would always be getting new security checks which yet wouldnt neglect his old security checks you see its an interesting problem the whole track security check there actually is basically the improvement of the existing johannesburg form 3 and the more minds we get to work on what horrible things people should have done to people why the more broad and effective that security check can be and it could even be something wild or as far approached have you ever done any illicit diamond buying and nevertheless would catch some case remember that security question or withholdtype question remember that it doesnt produce any bad result it really doesnt waste enough auditing time to worry about now that youre doing instant read and yet will catch some offbase case and you yourself as the auditor sitting there reading one of these checks down will say what on earth how could anybody possibly have ever done anything like this thats very unlikely question and then all of sudden one day you ask this thing have you ever put any cats in slingshots you see and fired them over walls and the thing falls off the pin and we get somebody who has devoted his whole lifetime to doing nothing else there it is brother bang and then of course there have been other codes of justice than the south african code of justice that was the original derivation of the original joburg south african code of justice is very precise you can do more things wrong in south africa than in most other countries but in south africa they have more problems and all of these things are wrong in other countries except they arent forward enough to say so its just franker code of laws you see they dont have so many of these catchbasket laws you know have you ever done anything the government doesnt like you know like thats us law now us executive branches in their law after theyve gotten congress to write up their laws they always add this catchall law have you ever been non persona grata with any official in this particular and peculiar department and refused to bribe him or something like that and they add this catch law you see on top of all the other laws and then you never know where youre going you never know what youre doing you never know what the law is you see you dont know whether youre breaking the law or not big notknow enters into the scene as societies tend to deteriorate notknowingness enters into their laws but there have been many other law codes theres been code of hammurabi thereve been persian law codes there have been egyptian law codes greek law codes there are spanish law codes right at the present moment theres french law codes and all of these things announce crimes of one kind or another that are rather unlikely you see to the anglosaxon for instance our own law codes in england and the united states have gotten little bit sloppy in various ways theres tremendous numbers of laws on the books that dont get enforced and there are tremendous number of things that get enforced that arent on the books you know its getting slopped up this way well the joburg actually has to follow through two legal systems because its basically jurisprudence because it deals basically with the third dynamic you see and the best area to find the misdemeanors of the third dynamic of course is the justice codes of the third dynamic what have these things included as being withholdy because somewhere on the track people were made to withhold things by justice code you see and they were taught to believe these things were bad and then they deteriorated these things and then they got inventive about what they did wrong with them and then law finally got passed to tell them not to do these things the polynesian legal code for instance if you were to run security check on polynesian under his old taboo system your joburg wouldnt apply that is at least 50 percent of the joburg is perfectly legal in polynesia but there must be something on the order of thousand other things that you would consider perfectly ordinary that would be absolute sudden death throw him into the volcano you see that kind of thing he has walked under kapok tree hmmhmmhmmhmmhmm hang him so the more the more minds we get operating on this sort of thing why the better off we are and i i believe well probably be evolving security checks up here in the next ten years easily i can see it now maybe someday somebodyll even find peters crimes he wasnt looking for that thats bad thing to pick on him this way okay now i think youre the basics that i know about at the present time that i think youre grappling with one way or the other might be pretty well answered at the present moment are they do you feel youre adrift do you feel youre seriously adrift anyplace hm all right i have fault whatsoever with anything you are doing you might possibly put too much emphasis on picking up data here and too little emphasis on practicing there is data available here which isnt available generally and most of that data is well mary sue myself instructors that sort of thing they can give you this data but the perfection of practice is what were terribly interested in because you will dream up questions as you try to apply it which will become burning questions to you which wont be included in any bulletins anyplace merely because nobody ever dreamed youd ask these questions you got the idea nobody would be able to foretell exactly what you would become confused about and not being able to tell this of course you cant write bulletin itd take bulletin for everybodys blind spot dont you see and theres nothing wrong with having blind spot but the way to handle blind spot is to not worry about feeling silly about it and not jump on ken one in answering it the way i did one day he startled sometimes you get startled the criteria is that i am more interested in what you find out is zone that is unknown to you in the process of application and that you get that zone cleared up because frankly there are unknown zones in scientology at this particular time the only thing that is unknown is question i always leave up at the top of the scale are we all one or are we separate individuals thats an unknown zone but its an unknown zone in theory only you see you get reality on it if its true its true whichevers true is true you see and when you lay down facts and say now listen you we is all one we is all we is all nirvanese and thats why we is weuns is so nervous and when the great pearly gates of nirvana open up and we all merge with the infinite well you start laying down stuff like that and youve obscured truth with your inevitably certain zones that remain unknown but they are not in the zones of how do you clear somebody they are not in the zones of how do you apply process they are not in the zones of what is the basic rationale back of why you do this why for heavens sakes do you do this well believe theres probably darn good reason and you might get to wondering about this why does cch 1 why dont you run it with both hands well youve gotten the idea youre trying to clear hands you see that isnt your purpose of cch 1 cch 1 isnt trying to clear peoples hands if you wanted to flatten cch 1 for its own sake and just for itself youd have to of course bodywise flatten it on the right hand flatten it on the left hand flatten it on both hands flatten it on the right foot flatten it on the left foot flatten it on both feet flatten it on the right ear flatten it on the left ear flatten it on you have to call halt on this sort of thing so you might as well call it right up at the front of the parades its very easy to go into superdeveloped evolving systems of this particular character its like the gardener today our boy out here that handles stone masonry and bricks and that sort of thing he came up to rather worriedly he had been trying to see and the gardener wanted him to start brick wall which goes from the exit at the back gate there on up the road in front of the garage see and he intimated to he didnt think this was too good an idea and he didnt really have any good reason why he thought that was bad idea but it just seemed to him somehow that that was poor idea actually it was poor idea where do you stop see you start in running small brick ledge where do you stop because if youre going to run it up there ten feet youve only made it obvious that you had better run it twenty feet and if youve run it twenty feet you had better make it up there because it wont match the front of the garage now you see so youd better run it the distance of the garage but that doesnt go up to the gate up there at the top there at the top of the side road so youd better run it to the side road to make it neat yeah but then this doesnt take in the field there that field there that better be bricked up too the next thing you know were in manchester now we didnt intend to go to manchester at all we were you can get strung out this way very easily in research of application it gets very ridiculous okay all right well now i hope you have nice weekend and i hope everything goes well in any other activities youre taking up and those that are doing lot of the auditing here and so forth hope you get in some sessions on one another over the weekend and i havent looked over your case reports yet for this week because ive got all day and all tomorrow to do it but apparently youre doing all right how do you like by the way just as general question any one of you whos on routine 1 and security check how do you like it how do you think its going female voice very good its going very good good you notice how those new things keep coming up on do new things keep coming up on security checks or huh female voice i spent twentyfive hours on one oh coo thats rough man id say id say that doesnt just stop the security check id say that must have stopped an awful lot of thinkingness someplace or another all right very good well thats coming along okay female voice yes do you get new material on it all the time female voice well what i got i certainly shouldnt have thought was the answer to the question but it seemed to answer it you what female voice the things that came up didnt seem analytically to answer the question but it seemed to lift the charge off it pretty much though kidding weird weird something like thatll blow out at the other end of the roof thats very unusual for something like this to happen all right those of you who are on routine 2 how do you think routine 2 is going male voice great good good we havent got quite as many goals being searched for here at the moment or terminals and so forth being searched for and i dont want to put stop to that by long ways in addition to doing security checks i guess start looking for goals i mean i dont care what interesting combo itd be perfectly all right to look for goals while youre being run on routine 2 by somebody else because you do it all the time anyhow youre every day and night youre walking around youre wondering i wonder what my goal in life is and so forth and everybodys always walking up to you you know sort of saying inferring that they ought to be informed of what your beingness is you know what is your name what is your name rank and serial number who are you youre answering this question all the time you know every time youve put up the bodyis every time you walk in down the hall and walk into room that somebody else is in youre answering the question who am i you got the idea i mean you run this one perpetually in this universe you see identification of self which is terminal finding and people are always asking you well what do you really want to do here you see what are you really trying to do or how can i help you out or what dont you understand well youre actually announcing to them my goal is you could look for goals and run routine 2 but i dont think and joburg you could probably run routine 1 joburg and look for goals you could probably run routine 2 in its entirety and look for goals you could probably do s routine 3 and also get some cchs run you probably could combine these things in the most infinite and scrambled fashion you possibly could and the only danger youd get into would be being run by two auditors at the same time on let us say routine 2 you see and theyre both looking for levels and doing general runs on you irrespective of what the other one is doing but oddly enough two people could be looking for goals on you and you wouldnt get mixed up all right weve even run two people on one person on the cchs and not gotten too upset by it and certainly we already are doing two people on security checks on the same person and nobodys getting mixed up in it in other words youve got variety of combinations here which are occurring and you can keep routine 1 routine 2 and routine 3 in very tight compartments and do just those and they are themselves but also realize that theyre sufficiently related that most of them could be done concurrent with the others okay so have good weekend and thank you audience thank you
