congress ronald orourke specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22559 the navy has stated that it would like to use the design of its new ddg1000 destroyer as the basis for its planned cgx cruiser ships based on other hull designs are possible nuclear propulsion is an option being studied for the cgx for more general discussion of both the cgx and ddg1000 see crs report rl32109 navy ddg1000 ddx and cgx ship acquisition programs oversight issues and options for congress by ronald orourke this report on basic cgx design options will be updated as events warrant background cgx cruiser program the cgx cruiser is the navys planned replacement for its 22 existing ticonderoga cg47 class aegisequipped cruisers which are projected to reach retirement age between 2021 and 2029 the cg47s are multimission ships with an emphasis on air defense the navy wants the cgx to be multimission ship with an emphasis on air defense and ballistic missile defense bmd1 the navy plans to equip the cgx with large and powerful new radar capable of supporting bmd operations the cgx may also have more missilelaunch tubes than are on the ddg1000 and one 155mm advanced gun system ags or none as opposed to two agss on the ddg1000 the navys planned 313ship fleet calls for total of 19 cgxs2 the fy2008fy2013 future years defense plan fydp

alternatives aoa the navy is currently assessing cgx design options in study called the cgx analysis of alternatives aoa known more formally as the maritime air and missile defense of joint forces mamdjf aoa the navy initiated this aoa in the second quarter of fy2006 and plans to complete it by mid september 2007 navy plans call for milestone review of the cgx program in the first quarter of fy2008 preliminary design review pdr in the third quarter of fy2010 critical design review cdr in the third quarter of fy2011 and milestone b review in the fourth quarter of fy2011 navy preference for design based on ddg1000 hull although the cgx aoa is examining wide range of design options for the cgx the navy has publicly stated on several occasions that would like to use the design of its new ddg1000 destroyer as the basis for the cgx the potential for using the ddg1000 design for the cgx was one of the navys arguments for moving ahead with the ddg1000 program at an april 5 2006 hearing for example navy admiral then in charge of shipbuilding programs when asked what percentage of the cgx design would be common to that of the ddg1000 previously called the ddx stated the following httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22559 we havent defined cgx in way to give you crisp answer to that question because there are variations in weapons systems and sensors to go with that but were operating under the belief that the hull will fundamentally be the hull mechanical and electrical piece of cgx will be the same identical as ddx so the infrastructure that supports radar and communications gear into the integrated deckhouse would be the same fundamental structure and layout i believe to accommodate the kinds of technologies cgx is thinking about arraying youd probably get 60 to 70 percent of the ddx hull and integrated inaudible common between ddx and cgx with the variation being in that last 35 percent for weapons and that sort of thing the big difference between cgx and ddg1000 will likely be the size of the arrays for the radars the numbers of communication apertures in the integrated deckhouse little bit of variation in the cic combat information center in other words the command and control center and likely some variation in how many launchers of missiles you have versus the guns3 prospective affordability of cgx in numbers desired if the cgx is based on the ddg1000 design its unit procurement cost might be comparable to that of the ddg1000 the fy2008fy2013 fydp includes notional placeholder figures of about 32 billion in fy2011 to procure the first cgx and about 31 billion in fy2013 to procure the second cgx this compares with about 32 billion to procure each of the first two ddg1000s in fy2007fy2008 early navy plans called for procuring two ddg1000s per year and total of 16 24 or 32 ships in large part for affordability considerations planned ddg1000 procurement was reduced to one ship per year and 3 source transcript of spoken testimony of rear admiral charles hamilton ii program executive officer for ships naval sea systems command before the projection forces subcommittee of house armed services committee april 5 2006 the inaudible comment may have been reference to the ddg1000s integrated electricdrive propulsion system between the two paragraphs quoted above the questioner representative gene taylor asked so the big difference between cgx and ddg1000 will be what crs3 total of 7 ships if affordability considerations similarly limit cgx procurement to one ship per year total cgx procurement might be reduced from 19 ships to perhaps more than 12 ships and possibly as few as eight4 some observers including the congressional budget office cbo have expressed concern about the prospective affordability and executibility of the navys longrange shipbuilding plan5 congressional interest in nuclear propulsion some members of congress particularly representatives gene taylor and roscoe bartlett the chairman and ranking member respectively of the seapower and expeditionary forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee strongly support expanding the use of nuclear propulsion to wider array of navy surface ships beginning with the cgx6 nuclear propulsion is an option being studied in the cgx aoa potential cgx design options if the cgx is to be multimission ship for replacing the cg47s basic design options for the cgx include but are not limited to the following conventionally powered ship based on the hull design of the 9200ton arleigh burke ddg51 class aegis destroyer or on variation of that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22559 hull design conventionally powered ship based on newdesign hull that is smaller than the ddg1000 hull conventionally powered ship based on the ddg1000 hull design or on variation of that hull design the navys stated preferred approach conventionally powered ship based on newdesign hull that is larger than the ddg1000 hull and nuclearpowered versions of each of these four ships ship based on ddg51 hull or variation of that hull basing the cgx on the current ddg51 hull could produce cgx design displacing roughly 9000 tons lengthening the ddg51 hull with midhull plug might produce cgx design displacing roughly 11000 tons which would be about 24 smaller than the 14500ton ddg1000 and roughly as large as the six california cgn36 and virginia cgn38 class nuclearpowered cruisers that were procured for the navy in the 1960s and 1970s the deck house and lower decks of the ddg51 hull would need to be redesigned to accommodate radar capable of supporting bmd operations an integrated electricdrive 4 twelve ships would result from getting one cgx in each of the 12 years fy2011fy2023 except fy2012 that the navy currently plans to procure at least one cgx if ddg1000 procurement is stopped after procurement of the fourth ship in fy2010 so as to make room in the navys shipbuilding budget for cgxs in fy2011 and subsequent years then eight cgxs combined with four ddg1000s would make for combined ddg1000cgx force of 12 ships although the navy does not base its ship force structure planning on standard cookie cutter naval formations 12ship cgx force or combined 12ship ddg1000cgx force might nevertheless be rationalized as enough to provide one ship for each of the navys planned eventual total of 12 carrier strike groups 5 for discussion see crs report rl32665 op cit and congressional budget office options for the navys future fleet may 2006 6 for additional discussion see crs report rl33946 navy nuclearpowered surface ships background issues and options for congress by ronald orourke crs4 propulsion system other new technologies from the ddg1000 and if desired missile launch tubes large enough to accommodate bmd interceptor now in development called the kinetic energy interceptor bmd since the ddg51 hull design was originally developed in the 1980s it may include hardtochange features that prevent it from fully accommodating certain ddg1000 new technologies such as perhaps those permitting the ship to be operated by substantially smaller crew for ships of similar type and level of complexity relative size can be rough proxy for relative unit procurement cost 9000 to 11000ton cgx would be 62 to 76 as large as 14500ton ddg1000based cgx however some shipbuilding costs such as shipyard fixed overhead costs do not go down proportionately with ship size ddg51based cgx consequently might cost more than 62 to 76 of what 14500 ton cgx would cost to procure perhaps something more like 72 to 86 production of ddg51based cgx might benefit from residual learningcurve effects of prior production of ddg51s the last of which was procured in fy2005 any limitations in incorporating ddg1000 technologies for reducing crew size could result in ship with larger crew than that of the ddg1000 and thus higher crewrelated life cycle costs than ddg1000based cgx httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22559 the ddg51 hull is conventional flared hull that slopes outward as it rises up from the waterline cgx based on the ddg51 hull consequently would be more detectible by radar than ship using tumblehome inwardly sloping hull like that of the ddg1000 in addition as ship size grows so does the size of the ships weapon and sensor payload consequently larger ships generally have more capability than smaller ones indeed due to certain economies of scale that occur in naval architecture larger ships can have proportionately larger payloads than smaller ones thus ddg51 based cgx might be less than 62 to 76 as capable as 14500ton cgx due to the space weight and energy requirements of the large and powerful bmdcapable radar to be carried by the cgx accommodating such radar in ddg51based cgx design might require steep reductions in other ship capabilities ship based on newdesign hull smaller than ddg1000 hull ship using newdesign hull smaller than the ddg1000 hull might similarly displace roughly 9000 to 11000 tons newdesign hull larger than about 11000 tons might be too close in size to the ddg1000 hull to produce savings that are worthwhile compared to the option of simply reusing the ddg1000 hull the unit procurement cost of such ship might be about equal to that of ddg51based design or perhaps somewhat less if the newdesign hull incorporates producibility features ie features for ease of manufacturing such as straighterrunning pipeline arrangements that are more advanced than those of the ddg51 hull newdesign hull might be able to take more complete advantage of ddg1000 technologies than ddg51based design possibly giving the ship smaller crew and thus lower personnelrelated costs the newdesign hull could be conventional flared hull like that of the ddg51 or reducedsize version of the ddg1000s tumblehome hull the latter option could produce ship as stealthy as or perhaps slightly stealthier than the ddg1000 due to the potential greater ability to take advantage of ddg1000 technologies or other new technologies 9000 to 11000ton ship based on newdesign hull might be somewhat more capable than ddg51based design 9000 to 11000ton design would still however be substantially less capable than ddg1000based design and perhaps proportionately less capable as with the previous option due to the space weight and energy crs5 requirements of the large and powerful bmdcapable radar to be carried by the cgx accommodating such radar in 9000 to 11000ton cgx based on newdesign hull design might require steep reductions in other ship capabilities ship based on ddg1000 hull or variation of that hull this option which is the navys stated preferred approach could produce ship about as large as the 14500 ton ddg1000 or if the ddg1000s hull is expanded somewhat larger than the ddg 1000 ie upwards of 20000 tons the unit procurement cost of this option would be substantially greater than those of the previous two options but perhaps less so than simple size comparison would suggest due to shipbuilding costs that are fixed or relatively insensitive to ship size production of the ship would benefit from learning curve effects of producing ddg1000s hulldesign and systemintegration costs would be minimized through reuse of the ddg1000 hull and elements of the ddg1000 combat system and could be substantially lower than those of the previous two options the ship would be substantially more capable than the previous two options and perhaps proportionately more capable due to economies of scale in naval architecture thus although this ship would be substantially more expensive to procure it would likely offer more capability per dollar than the previous two designs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22559 ship based on newdesign hull larger than ddg1000 hull this option could produce ship of more than 20000 tons in at least some respects this option would be more capable than the previous option and perhaps proportionately more capable the unit procurement cost of this option would be greater than that of the previous option but perhaps less so than simple size comparison would suggest production might benefit less than would the previous option from the ddg1000 learning curve and hulldesign and systemintegration costs might be higher than those of the previous option due to less reuse of ddg1000 hull design features and the ddg 1000 combat system nuclearpowered versions of these four ships navy report submitted to congress in january 2007 suggests that adding nuclear propulsion plant to to any of the above four options would likely increase its unit procurement cost by 600 million to 700 million in constant fy2007 dollars if oil prices in coming years are high much or all of the increase in unit procurement cost could be offset over the ships service life by avoided fossilfuel costs due to its larger size the fourth option above would most easily accommodate modified version of onehalf of the new nuclear propulsion plant that has been developed and designed for the navys new gerald r ford cvn78 class aircraft carriers7 the third option above might also accommodate modified version of onehalf of fordclass propulsion plant but perhaps less easily and with more modifications the first two options above would likely require the design of new nuclear propulsion plant designing new nuclear propulsion plant would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars modifying the fordclass plant would cost substantially less 7 for more on the cvn78 program see crs report rs20643 navy ford cvn78 class cvn21 aircraft carrier program background and issues for congress by ronald orourke crs6 nuclearpowered ship would be more capable than corresponding conventionally powered version because of the mobility advantages of nuclear propulsion which include for example the ability to make longdistance transits at high speeds in response to distant contingencies without need for refueling building the cgx as nuclearpowered ship might mean that at least part of the ship would not be built at two shipyards that have built the navys cruisers and destroyers in recent years because neither of these yards are certified to build nuclearpowered ships8 assessing these options the basic cgx design options presented above can be assessed in terms of development cost and risk unit procurement cost annual cost and unit capability all in the context of operational requirements or desires the potential operational risks of not fulfilling those requirements or desires due to insufficient unit capability or insufficient ship quantities and potential implications for the shipbuilding industrial base the question of whether to procure potentially smaller number of individually more expensive and more capable ships or potentially larger number of individually less expensive and less capable ships is classic shipdesign and forceplanning issue that the navy the department of defense and congress have faced many times in the past the advantage that larger ships have in terms of unit capability httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22559 and capability per dollar is one reason why the navy has often preferred larger and more capable designs in recent decades this advantage has been counterbalanced by the issue of unit procurement affordability because procuring an insufficient quantity raises the risk of not having ship in service in the right location when it is needed potential oversight issues for congress potential oversight questions for congress include the following how much consideration is the navy giving in the cgx aoa to design options other than those based on the ddg1000 are other basic options being treated in the aoa simply as straw men what are the relative costs and capabilities of the options discussed above what is the potential tradeoff between unit capability and unit procurement cost on the one hand and potential numbers procured on the other in assessing basic cgx design options is the navy assigning too much value not enough value or about the right amount of value to the sunk costs of designing the ddg1000 hull and to cgx production economies that can result from the ddg1000 learning curve legislative activity for fy2008 section 1012 of the housereported version of the fy2008 defense authorization bill hr 1585 would make it us policy to build cruisers and certain other large navy ships with nuclear power unless the secretary of defense notifies congress that nuclear power for given class of ship would not be in the national interest the provision is discussed on page 387 of the house armed services committees report on hr 1585 hrept 110146 of may 11 2007 8 for discussion of this issue see crs report rl33946 op cit
