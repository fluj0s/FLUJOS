carol migdalovitz specialist in middle east politics foreign affairs defense and trade summary the april 18 1999 election in turkey reflected growing nationalism weakening of the political center and desire for more honest leadership prime minister bulent ecevit of the democraticleft party dsp is continuing in office joined by the nationalist action party mhp and motherland party anap ecevit and anap leader mesut yilmaz have prior government experience mhps devlet bahceli does not and his purported success in moderating the ultraright mhp is being tested dsp and anap control ministries of foreign and macroeconomic policy significance while mhp holds portfolios important for its ideology and constituents in turkeys anatolian heartland all agree on overall economic policies needed to reach an agreement with the international monetary fund the government may last longer than its immediate predecessors given its hefty majority but multiparty coalitions are inherently unstable and the historic distrust between dsp and mhp could dim its prospects there are many issues to engage us and turkish officials democratization human rights greece cyprus pipelines the european union iraq

be updated background1 turkey has experienced unprecedented governmental instability in the 1990s on june 9 1999 parliament gave vote of confidence to the fifth government in less than four years fragmentation of political parties stemming more from personality than policy differences has produced the frequent changeovers moreover because the constitution mandates that the powerful military guarantee the political system politicians 1 information in this report is derived from foreign broadcast information service daily reports online primarily translations of turkish newspaper articles

act out of unalloyed selfinterest nonetheless as in many other countries national consensus on the need for economic liberalization and privatization has developed in recent years rendering stillused labels of left and right increasingly unhelpful if not meaningless comparable consensus exists on nationalism which has been strengthened by the european unions rejection of turkey for membership candidacy balkans conflicts in areas that were part of the turkishruled ottoman empire in the past2 the emergence of independent turkic states from the ruins of the soviet union and the 15year kurdish insurgency within turkey nationalists gained momentum in recent months from europes failure to understand or accept turkeys view of the kurdish conflict and its lack of cooperation during kurdistan

declines that had begun in early nineties the fp successor to the welfare party rp whose leadership of government in 199697 had provoked the secularist military to intervene in politics also suffered setback reversing the islamists growth on the national stage however the islamists retained mayoral posts in istanbul ankara and other municipalities the nationalist dsp came in first and the even more nationalistic mhp that had not even been represented in the previous parliament shocked itself and observers with second place showing the chp the party of mustafa kemal ataturk founder of the turkish republic failed to enter parliament for the first time ever the pro kurdish hadep while also not making mark nationally unprecedentedly won six mayoral races in the southeast including the regional capital of diyarbakir 2 see crs report rs20149 kosovo greek and turkish perspective crs3 there are many reasons for the changes the turkish public may have had surfeit of the dyp and anap leaders rivalry and alleged corruption of the political machinations of the now former centerleft chp leader deniz baykal and of the equally manipulative behavior of the banned rp leader necmettin erbakan in other words voters punished those whom they felt put themselves and their quest for power before the good of the country voters rewarded dsp and mhp leaders who have reputations for honesty and are fiercely nationalistic in the emotional climate following the capture of ocalan an ensuing surge in domestic terrorism largely attributed to kurdish terrorists and the kosovo conflict dsp leader ecevit benefitted from his strong stand against the pkk and simply from being prime minister when ocalan was caught mhp leader bahceli profited from his efforts to redefine his ultraright party as centristmoderate since taking its helm in 1997 and from the publics nationalist tilt in addition mhps strong grass roots work especially among 5 million first time young voters and the central anatolian petit bourgeoisie paid off as did its antipkk stand and reputation for supporting families of soldiers who had been killed fighting the pkk the victors also may have drawn support from protest voters of 1995 who had then supported islamists but now decided not to waste their votes on party that the military would not allow to participate in government again remaining political distinctions in the new parliament focus mostly on political islam and memories of street battles between left and right in the 1970s new government after the election prime minister bulent ecevit replaced his prior singleparty minority government with one of three parties which together have 352 out of 550 seats in parliament once they agreed to form government dsp mhp and anap appeared to divide 36 ministerial portfolios easily this may be attributed to dspanaps successful prior governmental collaboration in 199798 and to mhps preference for seemingly lesspowerful noncontroversial patronageladen portfolios the coalition partners agreed to request parliament to authorize third deputy prime minister for anap in addition to those from dsp and mhp and did so promptly yilmaz opted not to participate for the time being in order to appeal corruption charges to the supreme court among other portfolios dsp retained the foreign and education ministries as well as the state ministry responsible for cyprus mhp received the defense ministry which ensures it seat on the national security council but is inconsequential given the militarys dominance in that field mhp also holds portfolios that will enable it to serve its constituencies and ideology the ministries of agriculture industry and trade public works and transportation the state ministry responsible for the turkic republics and the turkish cooperation and development agency the equivalent of the us agency for international development which is vital to relations with the former soviet republics anap holds the interior ministry the lucrative ministry of energy and the state ministry responsible for relations with the european union primary actors prime minister bulent ecevit was born in istanbul in 1925 he became member of parliament as republican peoples party chp deputy in 1959 and served as minister of labor for while in 1966 he was elected secretary general and in 1972 general chairman of the party ecevit was prime minister at the time of turkeys crs4 invasionintervention in cyprus in 1974 and again briefly in 1977 and 1978 banned from politics after the 1980 coup ecevit reentered the arena in 1987 when he took over as general chairman of the dsp from his wife rahsan who had founded the party and remains its deputy chairman ecevit served as deputy prime minister from mid1997 through 1998 in january 1999 he became prime minister of dsp minority government that took the country to national elections intermittent reports suggest that the 74year old ecevit has health problems one possible successor is deputy prime minister husamettin ozkan who conducted much of the coalition negotiations ecevit had been considered reflexively leftist antiamerican in recent years however his appreciation for turkeys friendship with the remaining superpower has grown he supported the united states and nato during the kosovo conflict and has allowed us use of turkish bases for operation northern watch over iraq deputy prime minister devlet bahceli was born in 1948 in osmaniye east of adana he is turkoman3 bahceli was founder of and activist in the ultranationalist idealist youth organizations in 1987 mhp founder and leader alparslan turkes appointed bahceli secretary general of the party in the mid1990s the party began to adopt the appearance of moderation in 1994 bahceli was named deputy party chairman turkes died in 1997 bahceli won an ensuing power struggle with turkes tugrul reportedly because of his organizational skills and party activism he has worked to moderate the partys extremist image from that of the grey wolves thugs idealist militias to political player which strives for harmony some extremists were purged and others reportedly left the party with tugrul after he lost the leadership bahceli leads the party collegially with coterie of professors mhps nationalism traditionally looks toward the turkic world seeking closer ties with central asia and with turks in bulgaria russia and china mhp views foreign policy through nationalist prism supporting ties with israel and the united states because they strengthen turks it is suspicious of ties with the eu that could harm turkeys sovereignty mesut yilmaz was born in 1947 in istanbul into family from the black sea region of rize in 1983 he was one of the founders of anap and was elected to parliament yilmaz headed ministries in anap governments led by the late turgut ozal in 1991 he was elected party chairman and served as prime minister until losing national election later that year in 1996 he briefly served as prime minister in failed coalition with his political archrival tansu ciller of the dyp in mid1997 yilmaz again became prime minister in november 1998 he resigned after vote of confidence prompted by corruption charges yilmaz who has reputation for being better at intraparty politics than at governing may need to participate in this government to dampen internal party dissent generated by anaps declining share of the vote and perhaps to position the party for merger with dyp after the possible political demise of ciller program turkey faces many economic challenges after strong 83 annual growth rate in 1997 its economy was harmed in 1998 by the global financial crisis particularly in russia key trading partner when growth slowed to 38 growth projections for 1999 have been revised downward 05 and the budget deficit estimate upward to 2233 3 tribe that speaks turkic dialect and has resided in eastern turkey for centuries crs5 billion or about 7 of gross national product securing financing from the international monetary fund imf has become more urgent the government is set to continue the economic policies of its two immediate predecessors led by dsp and anap to fight inflation which has come down from triple digits to about 5055 annually privatize state enterprises and reform the banking and social security systems parliament already has passed law to create semiindependent supervisory panel for banks and budget for the remainder of the year priority may then be given to legislation to reform social security which pays pensions at very young age adding egregiously to budget deficits and national debt and to permit international arbitration of business disputes in order to attract foreign investors especially for turkeys many energy projects the coalition partners have agreed not to revisit 1997 law requiring 8 years of compulsory secular education or prohibitions on women wearing head scarves in public institutions these agreements are viewed as mhp concessions to secularism because it has religious constituency however mhp probably would prefer to avoid changes which might anger the military the coalition protocol calls for repentance law to allow pkk guerrillas to gain some form of immunity by regretting their actions but dsp and mhp disagree about its urgency and substance mhp seeks transparency in privatizations and limits on parliamentary immunity to fight corruption given the publics concern about corruption and the imfs with transparency dsp and anap probably will agree prospects multiparty coalitions are inherently unstable and turkish governments rarely serve out their terms with over 350 seats in parliament the dspmhpanap government could last longer than its recent predecessors turkey needs political stability in order to implement economic reforms and the patriotism of dsp and mhp or their desire to stay in office may allow the government to survive yet historic differences and political ambitions could overtake their good intentions dsp and mhp adherents fought each other in the streets in the 1970s during coalition negotiations in may rahsan ecevit publicly dredged up her memories of those years underlining the continuing distrust for mhp if dspanap connivance had deprived mhp of more powerful portfolios it might be resentful moreover after period of governing mhp may wish to try for first place in early elections should dyp change leaders however it could be viewed as possible substitute for mhp in government reconfigured without elections limiting mhps room for maneuver dyp will not be potential governing partner as long as ciller is party leader given yilmazs antipathy her ineradicable reputation for corruption and probable enduring military opposition due to her role in bringing the islamists to power in 1996 moreover some political advisers recommend against relegating both mhp and fp to the opposition simultaneously fearing collaboration of extremists parliament will select new president in may 2000 the coalition partners may engage in serious horsetrading before that date yilmaz is presumed to have presidential ambitions while the intellectual ecevit ironically does not meet constitutional requirements for the office because of his lack of university degree he may propose another candidate mhps views on the presidential race are unknown crs6 usturkish relations president clinton has invited prime minister ecevit to visit the united states in september there is long agenda of issues to engage the two leaders the administration would like to see turkey make substantive progress in democratization and human rights particularly since turkey has not fulfilled prior promises the administration is likely to express appreciation for turkeys role in nato air strikes during the kosovo conflict its aid to kosovar albanian refugees and its participation in kosovo peacekeeping as well as for hosting operation northern watch usbritish enforced nofly zone over northern iraq the administration was heartened by turkeys cooperation with greece on humanitarian issues during the kosovo crisis and may try to use it as foundation for improving strained bilateral relations between the two nato members in the aegean sea and on cyprus4 ecevit however is more likely to make demands than concessions turkey recognizes the turkish republic of northern cyprus as an independent state and favors confederal solution for the island rather than the federal solution stipulated in resolutions it also insists that greece end its alleged support for the pkk accept dialogue on aegean issues and end obstruction of turkeys european union ambitions greece favors cyprus federation denies supporting the pkk wants turkey to take aegean disputes to the international court of justice and may not concede much on the eu until turkey complies the administration seems certain to express continuing support for several of turkeys more elusive goals eu candidacy construction of an oil pipeline from baku azerbaijan to the port of ceyhan in turkey and transcaspian gas pipeline from turkmenistan to turkey turkey has labeled the two energy projects its highest priorities despite the administrations backing because it views the pipelines as good for turkey and for enhancing the independence of the former soviet republics energy companies regard the pipelines as the most expensive routes for central asian energy exports and some doubt that they are commercially feasible furthermore turkey has been unable to attain eu candidacy partly because it has resisted eu demands to change its cyprus policy improve relations with greece and redress human right abuses should ocalan be executed turkisheu ties could worsen eu members condemn capital punishment and sympathize with turkeys kurds moreover us support for eu candidacy may mean less to ecevit who appears to regard eu membership as lower priority than former governments for his part ecevit may express concern over the us determination to replace saddam hussein he is not convinced that us policy toward iraq is realistic and is worried about the possibility of precedentsetting kurdish state in northern iraq ecevit may convey similar thoughts to members of congress to whom he also may emphasize the cost turkey has incurred by maintaining sanctions on iraq since the gulf war and the detrimental effects that sanctions have had on iraqi civilians ecevit also may complain about what he considers congressional interference in arms purchases and deliveries from the united states which arise from congressional concerns about turkishgreek relations and turkeys violations of the human rights of kurdish civilians he may object to what turks consider interference in usturkish relations by ethnic lobbies 4 see crs report 97799 greece and turkey aegean issues background and recent developments and crs issue brief 89140 cyprus status of negotiations
