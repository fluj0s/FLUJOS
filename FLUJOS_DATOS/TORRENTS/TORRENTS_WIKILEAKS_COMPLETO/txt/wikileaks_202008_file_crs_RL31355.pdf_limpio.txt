divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31355afghanistans path to reconstruction obstacles challenges and issues for congress summary for the past 22 years afghanistan has been embroiled in conflict humanitarian assistance programs have been key part of the overall multilateral effort to relieve human suffering and assist refugees and in ternally displaced persons idps since september 11 2001 while actions are still be ing taken to eliminate taliban and qaeda forces and others supporting terro rism the needs have only become more urgent the case of afghanistan may present special category of crisis in which the united states and others play significant role in the war on terrorism while simultaneously providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire moreove r the conditions in afghanistan represent challenging mix of infrastructure dest ruction ongoing security concerns and humanitarian needs requiring an immediate response so far the international community has recognized that large amount s of aid and resour ces will be required in the reconstruction effort in add ition longterm commitment will be necessary to ensure stable democratic afghanistan emerges and will not fall prey to the twin evils of drugs and terrorism while continuing to hunt down qaeda forces within afghanistan transitional and reconstruction assistance has also moved ahead an examination of the progress of reconstruction efforts and aid priorities in the last year reveals the complexity of the tasks ahead and raises questions about the the longterm role to be played by the united states congress may continue to look at the contributions by and responsibilities of key llies partnering in the efforts within afghanistan the current operating environment demonstrates ongoing challenges for the government and people of afghanistan and for the international community such as security issues population movements food security envir onment and infrastructure health and education while the inte rnational donors conference in january 2001 indicated strong willingness on the part of the international community to assist in the restoration of afghanistan it also revealed the cost could amount to more than 15 billion over the next decade total of 18 billion was pledged for 2002 although some pledges have not yet been fulfilled the many moving parts of the war on rrorism coupled with the uncertainty of developments within afghanistan make longterm planning and exit strategies impossible at this stage still of potential immediate interest to congress are security concerns support of the tran sitional administration oversight and coordination of aid projects and the plight of women and

the situation before september 11 2001 even before the current crisis afghanistan had suffered twentytwo years of war which included long soviet occ upation followed by civil war and beginning in 1996 harsh taliban rule in most of the country1 with devastated infrastructure and minimal government and social services even basic health care and education were almost nonexistent the taliban lead ership focused available resources largely on maintaining internal security and seeking to eliminate the last pockets of ethnic minority opposition in the north and northeast during this internal conflict the taliban placed restrictions on women working outside the home further aggravating levels of poverty these factors in comb ination with severe drought over the last three years produced enormous human suffering in afghanistan as of september 10 2001 according to unhcr nearly four million afghans out of total population of about 26 million were refugees two million in pakistan one and half million in iran as well as others in russia india the central asian republics europe and elsewhere in addition as of september 10th nearly one million other afghans were internally displaced

continui ng vast numbers of refugees and idps the variations among the regions in which they are located and the political and security situation throughout the country the collapsed infrastructure rugged terrain and extreme weather are significan t factors with regard to access food aid logistics and plans for reconstruction w ith another winter approaching the current operating environment is complex with numbe r of urgent challenges at meeting in august unhcr commissioner lubbers and president karzai both recognized the need now for stronger links between human itarian and reconstruc tion projects so that afghans can begin to move beyond initia l reintegration to more permanent resettlement included in th next section are brief references to some recent initiatives under way security situation armed factions are continuing to feud in different parts of the country the goals of these warlords and other elements are to try to seize local power and territory and maintain profits from drugs and smuggling8 lack of security is huge problem throughout the country in kabul despite the protection of isaf there have been recent incidents of violence which only highlight the precarious atmosphere at this stage of the recovery idps and refugees caught in th is situation particularly minor ities face dire choices if they decide to leave they become vulnerable and homeless if they stay they risk harassment and violence reports of human rights abuses rape assault and theft come from different areas there is great concern about the security of aid workers delivering food and emergency care outside kabul simila r reports of theft and beatings have made dr ivers wary and highlighted the fragile environment under which humanitarian assistance is operatin g stolen food has reportedly been distributed to local residents and military units httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31355crs6 the security of the central government has become of critical concern on july 6 2002 assassins killed haji

of us special forces since the death of haji abdul quadir in july the central government clearly related to security are questions concerning the effectiveness of the itga in administering the government facilitating the implementation of recovery initiatives and addressing br oader concerns of secur ity and terrorism throughout afghanistan the itga faces threats to security from three potential directions first the countrys lack of resources have encouraged thriving drug trade before the taliban afghanistans major ex port was opium it produced 75 of the world supply under the taliban whic h enforced ban on opium cultivation in 1999 according to some estimates opium poppy cultivation dr opped from 3000 tons to 200 tons however these numbers are deceiving it is believed that drugs continued to be lucrative source of in come both for the taliban and their opponents because large stockpiles built up under taliban rule which may well have been intended for the world market were held back as supply exceeded demand and caused depression in price indeed th is spring may see the largest poppy crop in recent years controlling the drug trade is huge challenge in country with few other resources and the potential for profits from heroin on the world market while the karzailed interim government has ordered ban on the production use and trafficking of all drugs the governme nt has little or power of enforcement sources report recent increase in cultiva tion linked to lawle ssness and banditry on the one hand and the great need among fa rmers for some form of livelihood on the other second former combatants can have direct impact on humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts if local struggles fo r power prevent delay or interrupt refugee and idp returns this will severely hamper any recovery efforts third afghanistans neighbors pakistan iran nd uzbekistan can also play key roles depending on whether or not they provide support to these local contenders for power population movements population movements conti nue in and out of and w ithin afghanistan it is estimated that there are still 3 million refugees mostly in iran and pakistan the approximate number of idps remaining to date is r oughly 750000 the total number of people requiring relocation assistance is therefore still considerable in coordination with governme nt initiatives unhcr set up voluntary return programs for refugees tripartite agreements on repatriation between unhcr afghanistan and the governments of pakistan and iran respectively outline the framework for the voluntary return of afghan refugees unh cr reports that since march 1 more than 18 million afghan refugees have repatria ted mainly from pakistan with some refugees 185000 returning from ira n approximately 10000 refugees from tajikistan and turkmenistan have also been assisted in their return this is doublehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31355crs7 9 security council monthly report on the operations of isaf august 16 2002the number expected by unhcr and expected to climb to 2 million by years end another 230000 idps have returned to th eir homes with the assistance of the international organization for migration iom the numbers of remaining refugees and idps is approximate because there is formal registration process until they seek assistance for their return some date back to previous wars others are part of the latest wave there is some recycling of refugeesthose who repeatedly cross borders for economic and family reasons flee because of crime and fighting or mig rate because of lack of food with sustainable livelihood many of these refug ees are forced to s eek assistance either within afghanistan or outsi its borders there is some concern that the budget constraints unhcr is facing already it has had to reduce its welcome home package may mean inadequate levels of assistance followed by an increase in refugees crossing back into pakistan and iran repeat migration of former idps or an increase in urban refugees there is par ticular concern about the conditions within kabul for recent arrivals choosing to re settle there and the impact on overall stability and security9 although the rate of return is much hi gher than expected it will probably take several years for rese ttlement to be completed secu rity permitting depending upon what takes place in afghanistan the organizations coordinating aid to afghanistan and the international commun ity may be forced to furt her accelerate the timetable for repatriation of refugees and return of idps or face reduced return rate longer term care in refugee camps and other measur may be required to allow for recovery to take hold while providing lifesaving measures in the form of food security shelter and basic medical care winter preparation according to usaid the itga afgh an assistance coordination authority aaca and the itga ministry for ru ral reconstruction and development mrrd in coordination with the joint

terrain is varied and harsh and creates pockets of need which are difficult to reach by relief agencies food insecurity is likely to continue in many parts of afghanistan this in turn may contribute to existing ethnic tens ions and encourage further population movements within afghanis tan or across its borders the us strategy is to move as mu ch food as possible into villages where people reside in order to avoid diversion and theft of commodities most food has been stored in bordering countries and moved into afghanistan by various means including trucks pack animals and aird rops free distribution and foodforwork programs direct the efforts of ablebodied recipients into community development projects the wfp has conducted rapid he licopter deliveries in highly inaccessible areas over six million people will continue to require targeted food assistance the wfp says it is expecting breaks in its cereal pipeline this autumn and based on the current level of donor contributions cer eals may be unavailable after december prepositioning food stocks is critical part of preparing for winter usaid reports that there is enough imp roved wheat seed for the fall planting season lack of water is the most for midable obstacle to food production lack of fertilizer is also contributing factor the fao and wfp report that 2002 crop yields were increased by 82 percent over st year the impact of drought and loss of productive assets combined with huge debt and source of livelihood continue to make food security high priority environment and infrastructure afghanistans environment has also been severely compromised by the war and drought which has had direct bearing not only on the planting season livestock production and agricultural rec overy but more shortterm concerns as

has an environmental component that will continue to be important for the fo reseeable future and will require careful planning in the transition to reconstruction for example the re storation of electric power either could involve re building conventional dirty diesel and oil power plants or constructing distributed clean micro turb ines to provide electricity and heat and the development of wind and solar energy the provision of clean water could be improved with the reconstr uction of wells developmen t of efficient irrigation systems and monitoring of water quality innovative sanitati

us government sources say that demining over seven years will cost approximately 670 million there have been some reports that afgh anistan officials have complained about the slow pace at which pledged funds were being paid in similar vein the united states has been critical of some its allies in particular the europeans for not meeting their fair share of the cost of recove ry and for not doing enough on multilateral level on the one hand dete rmining the fair share of the costs of reconstruction for any one country or group of countries vari from conflict to c onflict and depends in part on the resources being sp ent on conflicts elsewhere on the other hand the way in which funds are distributed be it multilaterally through agencies or bilaterally with funds supporting interna tional organizations and ngos directly appears to be at issue in afghanistan one argument is that since greater protection is given to refugees and idps under th mandate of the unhcr as opposed to

to us pe rsonnel involvement in poppy cultivation in afghanistan issues and questions for congress security if reconstruction is to be success most observers believe it must occur in secure environment without threat to the new government and initiatives on the ground as us troops make headway on fi nishing the afghan phase of the war there are many questions about ensuring secure environment for reconstruction extending past kabul for reasons of secu rity aid distribution and reconstruction initiatives and the credibility of the itga is critical can peace occur without us involvement in the peacekeeping effort how involved will the us troops be in assembling and training an afghan army what role should the united states play in drug enforcement and the war on terrorism inside afghanistan many believe peacekeeping force is essential and the united states must be part of such force until recently the bush administration has been adamant that it will not take part in peacekeeping for ce in afghanistan however the has called for more foreign troops to disarm various groups and control warlords the recent upsurge in conflict suggests the possibility that the us decision may be reconsidered under the current mandate peacekeepers are in kabul and have impact outside the capital some argue that the isaf is too small and too limited to be effective amid discussion about th type of peacekeeping force required has been the question of how long peacekeepers will be required to stay there remain the twin evils of drugs and terrorism inextricably linked but requiring different forms of intervention nd enforcement moreover in addition to cracking down on the problem itself altern ative forms of livelihood are critical such as crop substitution community projects and other programs to benefit those directly involved in these activities central government critical to afghanistans recovery in the short term and stability in the long term is the credibility and effective functioning of its government moreover the itga is facing the critical need for econo mic revitalization accounting and banking mechanisms and debt relief for the average afghan it must be able to pay regularly the salaries of its police army officers and public employees it is crucial that it be able to extend its governmental institutions outside kabul what role will the united states continue to play in helping to build administrative capacity in the form of national government and institutional development what is the united states currently doing to help the afghan gove rnment function and prepare for its next phasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31355crs17 oversight and coordination of aid projects in order to keep the support of the international commun ity reconstruction efforts need to demonstrate the effective use of funds and their distribution what is the united states doing to make sure aid is being spent wisely what role is the united states playing to facilitate international collaboration on oversight and coordination of aid projects how is the united states coordinating its various agencies participating in reconstruction efforts from coordination mechanisms to system of accountability future donations in afghanistan depend on the way in which current funds are used and whether they reach those for whom they are intende d although the work of the international organizations ngos and governments will be critical the sheer number of actors on the ground create some concerns about aid assistance and how projects will be managed and coordinated few rules exist about how donor money is to be spent moreover the lack of experience by the itga coupled with its many competing priorities not least of which is that financial infrastructure is not yet in place mean that assistance and guidance on monetary matters including ag reements with lenders and contributions by donors by the internationa l community remain critical recently new structure to manage the international assistance effort was put in place the program secretariat structur pss is designed to replace the lead agency approach seen in other complex humanitarian emergencies it is meant to hold agencies and international orga nizations accountable within their sectors of responsibility it is also part of br oader effort to include afghan organizations in the recovery and reconstruction effort which will be important for the transfer of responsibilities and capabilities in the future number of us agencies are involved in the relief and recovery effort in afghanistan important to th overall understanding of the us role in afghanistan are the coordination mechanisms in place for this wide range of agencies in its day today activities on the ground and in wash ington and the ability to track overall spending by the usg evaluating aid priorities as nine months have passed since many of the taliban stongholds collapsed and the international community began the relief and recovery effort in earnest what does report card on afghanistan reveal what are the most critical obstacles to furthering the goals of assistance and reconstruction has the international communitys assessment of what it will take for afghanistans recovery changed in terms of time and funding required so far there is little deve lopmenttype aid in the us pledge although some is focused on quick impact programs longt erm agriculture women and children and education is it any clearer where the ited states should concentrate its aid priorities and efforts with what level and mix of assistance httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31355crs18 burdensharing there have been reports that the united st ates is providing more than its share of the multilateral relief and reconstruction effort the european allies in particular have been sited as not providing enough support and even then spending their money directly through european ngos th organizations are usually outside the protection regime available through multilateral agencies such as the high commissioner for refugees why have fo reign donors been slow to come up with the necessary funds is the problem relate d to bureaucracy in europe or are there impediments in afghanistan itself that ma ke donors reluctant to give immediately women and children the taliban treatment of women and re strictions it imposed not only severely curtailed the work force but reduced wo mens basic rights education and access to health on december 12 2001 congress pa ssed the afghan women and children relief act of 2001 s 1573 pl 10781 to address some of these concerns ministry of womens affairs has been established within the itga schools reopened in afghanistan in march 2002 and girls returned to the classroom for the first time since the taliban came to power how much impact will this legislation have on reconstruction initiatives specifically focused on women and children to what extent will their needs be primary point of focus in aid distribution and the recovery effort what are the barriers to the implementation of womens projects collateral damage extensive press coverage from the bombi ng campaign in afghanistan revealed that there have been number of innocent victims of erroneous us bombings while the hunt for the taliban and q aeda continues the potential for mistaken targets remains risk in recent months claims of erroneous bombing targets have raised the question of victim compen sation and us responsibility and also highlighted the difficulty of intelligence gathering and security problems on the ground although statutes and legislation exis t to protect victims of war these are typically worked out on casebycase basis the issue is blurred by the recognition that the end result may not be matter of simple human error but rather complex combination of factors for which it is more difficult to determine responsibility collateral damage includes ci vilian losses considered to be byproduct of war despite efforts to minimize innocent civ ilian casualties language in the fy2003 senate foreign operations bill refers to afghan civilians suffering injury from military operations and recomme nds assistance that is av ailable under the patrick leahy war victims fund be used to provi rehabilitation and related assistance should legislation be
