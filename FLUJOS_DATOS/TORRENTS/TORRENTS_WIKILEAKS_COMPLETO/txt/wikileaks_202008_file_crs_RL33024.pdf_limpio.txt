considered to derive from several constitutional clauses the us supreme court has noted that the constitution grants congress the power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization art i 8 cl 4 drawing upon this power upon its plenary authority with respect to foreign relations and international commerce and upon the inherent power of sovereign to close its borders congress has developed complex scheme governing admission to our nation and status within our borders 1 further the fourteenth amendment defines citizens as all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof amend xiv 1 cl 1 although some legal scholars have argued that the phrase uniform rule of naturalization precludes congress from enacting legislation granting relief to specific individual2 the courts have interpreted the phrase as simply requiring geographic uniformity throughout the states meaning that congress cannot enact legislation applying different rules to different states3 the constitutional basis for private immigration bills generally is found in the first amendment prohibition against congressional enactments abridging the right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances amend i cl 3 and in the power of congress to pay the debts of the united states art i 8 cl 1 4 regardless of academic concerns about the clarity of authority for private immigration legi slation clearly congress has long history of such enactments5 when the public laws relating to immigration operate to prevent someone from entering or remaining in the united states or obtaining some other benefit such as citizenship private immigration bills provide for exceptions for named individuals or small groups of individuals whose circumstances merit special consideration private bills are intended to be last resort for relief after all administrative and judicial remedies are exhausted 6 aside from the individual 1 plyler v doe 457 us 202 225 1982 under art i 8 cl3 of the us constitution congress has the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes which has been the basis for us supreme court decisions that state laws regulating the migration of persons between states and from foreign countries into states are unconstitutional in addition to this clause the federal governments authority over foreign relations emanates from the congressional power to declare war under art i 8 cl 11 and the executive power to conclude treaties and appoint us ambassadors with the advice and consent of the senate under art ii 2 cl 2 and to receive foreign ambassadors under art ii 3 cl 1 see charles gordon stanley mailman stephen yaleloehr i mmigration law and procedure 902 2005

private laws enacted often revealed flaws in the public laws which led to amendments to resolve such problems7 conversely expansion of immigration restrictions and elimination of relief in the public

constitute the lowest percentage of private laws because of the serious ramifications of conferring citizenship and its rights and obligations and of the united states undertaking the protection of its new citizens10 the majority of private immigration bills confer lawful permanent resident lpr status by waiving general law provision which prevents the granting or maintenance of such status whether that provision concerns grounds of inadmissibility or deportation numerical allocation limits definitions of eligible immigrant categories etc

immigration border security and citizenship and the house subcommittee on immigration border security and claims private bill shall be considered or acted upon by the subcommittee until all avenues for administrative and judicial relief have been exhausted 11 if the beneficiary is subject to removaldeportation the mere introduction of bill does not stay such removaldeportation stay will

the number of private laws enacted dropped to 3 in the 107 th congress and 4 in the 108th congress 9 maguire supra footnote 4 at 3 87 maguire counts 7266 private laws enacted during the first 100

courtesy by the agency to the congressional subcommittee and thus is purely discretionary not legally mandated13 under the senate subcommittee rules requests for reports on private bills will be made by the subcommittee chairman only upon written request addressed to the chairman by the author of the bill14 the senate subcommittee will not request report or make other communications to defer deportation of beneficiaries who entered the united states as nonimmigrants stowaways in transit deserting crewmen or without inspection through the land or sea borders the subcommittee may make an exemption from this rule where the bill is intended to prevent unusual hardship to the beneficiary or to us citizens related to the beneficiary and the author of the bill has submitted complete documentary evidence to the subcommittee in support of request to make an exception to the rule15 under the house subcommittee rules th subcommittee will not intervene in removaldeportation proceedings or request stay by requesting report from ice unless the bill is designed to prevent extreme hardship to the beneficiary or us citizen spouse parent or child16 the distinction between the senate and house subcommittee rules is that the senate subcommittee will generally request report upon the request of the author of bill without an initial consideration of the merits of the case and only requires showing of hardship for certain disfavored categories whereas the house subcommittee will not request report in any case unless motion to request report has been made at formal meeting of the subcommittee and consideration of whether the extreme hardship requirement has been met 17 when ice has received request for report on private bill beneficiary and granted stay of removaldeportation the date established for removaldeportation or voluntary departure under any final order shall be february 1 of the next oddnumbered year or in other words of the first session of the next congress following the one in which the bill was introduced 18 however if the beneficiarys continued presence in the united states would be or becomes contrary to the best interests of the united states removaldeportation may be carried out after consultation with the author of the private bill and the judiciary committee that requested report19 if adverse action is taken on private bill for which stay of removaldeportation has been granted ice will establish date by which removaldeportation or voluntary departure must be effected ice may extend the deadline at its discretion exactly what constitutes an adverse action or disposition is not defined in the laws regulations or operations instructions concerning immigration it appears that such actions would include decision by the subcommittees to not recommend private bill for action by the full committee 12 operations instructions oi 1071c senate subcomm rules 1 and house subcomm rules 5 13 maguire supra footnote 4 at

entire chamber negative vote by either chamber or veto by the president presumably adverse dispositions may also include decision at formal meeting under the house subcommittee rules to not request report because the extreme hardship requirement has not been met or decision in the subcommittee or full committee to table private bill20 if adverse action or final positive action has been taken on bill by the end of congress the february 1 deadline affords the author of privat bill time to reintroduce bill in the following congress ice may extend the deadline at its discretion21 ice notifies the beneficiary if bill has had an adverse disposition or is not reintroduced and informs them of the new date set for execution of any outstanding order of removaldeportation or deadline for any voluntary departure granted22 complete report on the beneficiary of private bill is transmitted by ice to the requesting subcommittee23 if classified or confidential information ex ists with regard to the beneficiary that ice is not authorized to transmit ice will refe r the subcommittee to the pertinent agency for further information24 after the submission of report if further material information is received or any material action is taken concerning beneficiary which may affect congressional consideration of private bill supplementary report shall be submitted to the committee or subcommittee25 ice may advise the committee or subcommittee informally if the new information concerns the granting of administrative relief or is particularly adverse if private bill for which report was made is reintroduce d in the following congress in the same chamber whose subcommittee requested the report any additi onal material developed from review of the file and any new background checks or interviews shall be in transmitted to the subcommittee in supplemental letter26 if the previous report was made to different chamber in the immediately preceding congress or to the same chamber in previous congress not immediately preceding the one in which the bill has been reintroduced new full report shall be submitted to the requesting subcommittee if adverse action was taken on private bill at any time and new bill is subsequently introduced for the same purpose for the same beneficiary in either chamber ice will not honor request for report concerning the new bill unless the adverse action on the previous similar bill is reconsidered and ice is notified of such reconsideration 27 if private bill beneficiary holds nonimmigr ant visa status the introduction of private immigration bill to confer permanent resident status raises presumption of termination of such 20 house subcomm rule 9 provides that the subcommittee shall take further action on private bill that has been tabled by the full judiciary committee the house subcomm rules statement of policy further provides that the subcommittee is reluctant to reconsider bills tabled by the full committee in previous congresses absent new evidence or information not available at the time of initial consider ation senate subcomm rule 6 provides that bills previously tabled shall not be reconsidered unless new evidence is introduced showing material change of facts known to the committee 21 oi 1071f2iii 22 oi 1071f2v 23 see the special agents field manual ch 23 private bill investigations for detailed

historically the majority of private immigration laws have granted lawful permanent resident lpr status to persons who needed expedited status under the quota system which existed from 1921 until 1965 or waivers from certain requirements of the immigration family or employmentoccupational preference system32 such as those for foreign orphans adopted or in the process of being adopted by us citizen parents but who did not meet the requirements under the law33 and to war brides and children of us citizen servicemen and displaced personsrefugees after world war ii prior to public legislation addressing gaps in the law34 the other major category concerning conferral of lpr status was the waiver of certain grounds of exclusioninadmissibility35 minority of private immigration laws provided for citizenship36 generally it appears that most of these laws did not grant citizenship outright bu t instead they waived the application of certain requirements which would either have barred th naturalization of certain individual or would have presented hardship to the individual by prolonging the naturalization process such as residence requirements cases where it appears citizenship may have been granted outright 32 maguire supra footnote 4 at 7383 according to maguire 65 of the private laws enacted during the first 100 congresses related to quotapreference relief at 8788 these

through marriage to foreigner and move abroad under now obsolete laws and who sought to regain their citizenship upon being widowed or divorced and moving back to the united states 2 children born

years in the united states including military service37 or 3 persons who while born us citizens had lost citizenship because of retention requirements under nowobsolete laws and sought to regain citizenship38 in the 1970s series of corruption scandals such as abscam involving payoffs for the sponsorship of private immigration laws culminated in the expulsion of one member of the house of representatives and led to decline in private immigration laws which were perceived as tainted in general by the scandals in the past decade the trend reached low point with only 2 private immigration laws enacted in the 104 th congress the late 1990s after the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira saw brief increase in the number of private laws with decline in the wake of 911 four private immigration laws were enacted in the 108th congress none have yet been enacted in the 109th congress although 72 private immigration bills have been introduced as of the date of this report g20g142g140g142g151g157g561g18g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g561 during the past decade beneficiaries of private immigration laws are persons who generally were unable to receive permanent resident status through fault of their own39 despite the efforts of relatives petitioning for them errors or delays on the part of the agencies responsible for processing petitions rendered the beneficiaries ineligible for an immigrant visa or adjustment to permanent resident status the two most common circumstances that can be generalized into categories appear to be errors or delays that result 1 in an orphan adoptee aging out before the adoption and the immigrant petition or permanent resident adjustment can be completed and 2 in conditional permanent resident petition for an alien spouse not being approved before the untimely death of us citizen spouse in the orphan adoption cases frequent circumstance appears to be the efforts of us citizens to adopt older children whose deceased parents or guardians were friends or extended family of the petitioners historically the precedents regarding juveniles generally concern the natural or adopted children of us citizen parents who for various reasons fell in the gaps in the public law and thus needed special dispensation to emigrate immediately to rejoin the us citizen parents or legal guardians 40 the justification for such expeditious treatment would be family reunification one of the fundamental policies behind us immigration and nationality laws in certain cases beneficiaries came to the united states as very young children but reached adulthood without obtaining lpr stat us because of the errors or deaths of their parents or guardians often minor siblings dependent on the beneficiary are either us citizens or are still eligible for administrative or judicial relief and family unification again is factor in granting private law relief 37 maguire supra footnote 4 at 195196 199200 38

combined with other hardships or sympathy resulting from the death of an immediate relative who was us citizen or lpr seem to be the most common factors generally the relative had pending petition for an immigrant visaadjustment of status for the beneficiary of the private bill but the petition expired due to the death of the petitioning relative typically the beneficiary had other avenue for immigration or adjustment of status has strong ties to other family members in the united states and remaining familial ties to hisher native country despite having other close relatives in the united states those relatives may be minor us citizen children who are not yet old enough to petition for the beneficiary or may be relatives who do not have degree of relation close enough to petition for the beneficiary such as the parents of deceased spouse in certain cases special circumstances raise case out of the ordinary such as the death arising out of hate crime in the wake of the 911 attacks of person petitioning for family members or the death of foreign national employed abroad by the us government whose dedication to his job could have cost his family the opportunity to emigrate to the united states certain cases appear to have had unique circumstances of particular national foreignpolicy interest these include the highprofile human rights activist wei jingsheng his case is particularly notable because he had pending employmentbased immigration petition and was visiting university scholar at the time the private law was enacted so he had not exhausted other avenues for permanent lawful resident status pursuant to subcommittee rules thus enactment of the private law appears to have been an act of support for the activist and the human rights and democracy movements he represented more than relief for someone with other recourse other laws benefitted persian gulf war evacuees with us ties persons technically ineligible for nazi reparations and swiss bank employee who exposed an attempt to unlawfully destroy the bank account records of holocaust victims the house and senate subcommittee rules both favor cases of extreme or unusual hardship which would appear to be the operative factor in cases generally disfavored according to the house subcommittee rules discussed above the senate subcommittee rules require the author of private bill to set forth the equities of case and why other remedies are not available in written statement to the subcommittee as noted above the senate subcommittee rules do not discuss specific precedents it would appear that these rules provide greater latitude in permitting the equities of particular case to overcome any negative precedent

revell and ms reagan could assure that rita remained part of their family in the united states was through private bill the combination of ugandas adoption restrictions early in their relationship with rita and ms reagans subsequent cancers had made it virtually impossible for rita to be adopted under the adoption laws of uganda and in accordance with us immigration law but for those factors

private laws for immigration relief were enacted in the 109th congress this provision enacted as part of public law was intended for the relief of couple of awardwinning athletes tanith belbin and maxim zavozin who wished to represent the united states with their respective partners in the figure skating events of the 2006 winter olympics under the olympics rules both partners in the ice dancing or pairs events must be citizens of the country they are representing by the deadline for submitting the final list of competitors representing country the athletes involved had not been lawful permanent residents for the five years required to become naturalized us citizens they could not benefit from changes in the processing of employmentbased immigrant visas and adjustment of status to permanent residence that would have enabled them to naturalize by the deadline if the new rules had been in effect when they had applied for visas 45 the relief provision reduced the period of time required from five years to three years which the athletes could satisfy and was limited to aliens of extraordinary ability who requested expedited naturalization as necessary to represent the united states at an international event and who paid premium processing fee of 1000 the provision although of general application was widely known to be intended for the relief of these athletes and sunsetted on january 1 2006 having been signed into law by the president on december 30 2005 zavozin and belbin completed the naturalization process and were sworn in as citizens respectively on december 30 and 31 2005 as noted above the house subcommittee rules disfavor the naturalization of an athlete for international competition purposes which may have been the reason for accomplishing
