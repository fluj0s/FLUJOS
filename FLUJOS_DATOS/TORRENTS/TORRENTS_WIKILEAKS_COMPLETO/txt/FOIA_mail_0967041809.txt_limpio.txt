deasterlncdcnoaagov great tom i think we are converging to much clearer meanings across various cultures here please get the inconclusive out by the way possible still has some logical issues as it is true for very large or very small probabilities in principle but if you define it clearly it is probably okbut quite possible conveys medium confidence betterbut then why not use medium confidence as the 3 rounds of review over the guidance paper concluded after going through exactly the kinds of disucssions were having now thanks steve on wed 23 aug 2000 tkarlncdcnoaagov wrote steve i agree with your assesement of inconclusive quite possible is much better and we use possible in the us national assessment surveys has shown that the term possible is interpreted in this range by the public tom

mhulmeueaacuk peterwhettondarcsiroau giorgiictptriesteit tom karlncdc cubaschdkrzde ckfollandmetogovuk hewitsonegsuctacza stouffer ron rjsgfdlgov subject re thc collapse hello all i appreciate the improvement in the table from wg 1 particularly the inclusion of symmetrical confidence levelsbut please get rid of the ridiculous inconclusive for the 34 to 66 subjective probability range it will convey completely differnt meaning to lay personsread decisionmakerssince that probability range represents medium levels of confidence not rare events phrase like quite possible is closer to popular lexicon but inconclusive applies as well to very likely or very unlikely events and is undoubtedly going to be misinterpreted on the outside i also appreciate the addition of increasing huricane intensities with warming moving out of the catch all less than 66 category it was in the sod i do have some concerns with the thc issue as dealt with hereechoing the comments of tim carter and thomas stocker i fully agree that the likelihood of complete collapse in the thc by 2100 is very remote but to leave it at that is very misleading to policymakers given than there is both empirical and modeling evidence that such events can be triggered by phenomena in one century but the occurrence of the event may be delayed century or two more given also that the likelihood of collapse depends on several uncertain parametersco2 stabilization level co2 buildup rate climate sensitivity hydrological sensitivity and initial thc overturning rates it is inconceivable to that we could be 99 sure of anythingimplied by the exceptionally unlikely labelgiven the plausibility of an unhappy combo of climate sensitivity slower than current aogcms initial thc strength and more rapid co2 increase scenarios also if 21st century actions could trigger 22nd century irreversible consequences it would be irresponsible of us to not mention this possibility in footnote at least and not to simply let the matter rest with very low likelihood of collapse wholly within the 21st century so my view is to add footnote to this effect and be sure to convey the many paramenters that are uncertain which determine the likelihood of this event thanks again for the good work on this improtant table cheers steve on wed 23 aug 2000 thomas stocker wrote dear jerry tim and ron et i agree that an abrupt collapse abrupt meaning within less than decade say has not been simulated by any climate model 3d and intermediate complexity in response to increasing co2 some models do show for longer integrations complete collapse that occurs within about 100150 years if you put that into context of the apparent stability of thc during the last 10000 years or so this is pretty abrupt following up on the discussion regarding thc collapse i think the statement ron apparently added to ch9 needs to be made more specific in order to keep ch7 and ch9 consistent i propose to ron the following revision it seems that the likelihood of collapse of the thc by year 2100 is less than previously thought in the sar based on the aogcm results to date there is really model basis to extend this statement beyond 2100 as evidenced by the figures that we show in tar there are many models that now run up to 2060 some up to 2100 but very few longer also i should add for your information that we add to ch7 sentence models with reduced thc appear to be more susceptible for shutdown models indicate that the thc becomes more susceptible to collapse if previously reduced gfdl results by tziperman science 97 and jpo 99 this is important as collapse unlikely by 2100 should not tempt people to conclude that thc collapse is hence not an issue the contrary is true reduction means destabilisation best regards
