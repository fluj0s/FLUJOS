information for the various organizations in its possession csi however does not have detailed financial information with respect to most of these entities and therefore the dollar figures are approximations and not every source of receipts or recipient of disbursements can be identified nonetheless csi believes these tables present an accurate picture of the flow of funds the dollar amounts set forth herein do not correspond precisely to the percentages set out in the tables submitted as exhibit 19 because any category of receipt or disbursement that made up less than one percent of the total was omitted from exhibit 19 moreover disbursements as used in these tables illustrate only the flow of funds and exclude noncash charges to income like depreciation 3 an accurate picture of the total amount of new funds received by any church organization can be obtained only by analyzing the money flows to and among scientology organizations as virtually every church organization derives at least some of its receipts from other scientology organizations for example as set forth in exhibit 19 rtc and csi derive virtually all of their receipts from other scientology organizations page 1 ex 117 csi prod 11493 151664
