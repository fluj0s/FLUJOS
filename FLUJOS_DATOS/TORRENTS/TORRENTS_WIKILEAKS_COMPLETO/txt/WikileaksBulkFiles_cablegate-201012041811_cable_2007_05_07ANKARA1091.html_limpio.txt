behindthescenes master ref ankara 1006 b ankara 1083 and previous classified by polcouns janice g weiner reasons 14 b d 1c in contrast to rumors that turkish fm abdullah gul is depressed after having had to withdraw his presidential bid journalist xxxxx described his demeanor as relaxed confident and determined xxxxx it was clear that both gul and hayrunissa had long lobbied for him to be the ruling justice and development partys akp presidential candidate and they still retain ambitions xxxxx dismissed earlier press speculation that parliamentary speaker bulent arinc had forced the issue it was instead gul who went to arinc to press his own case and ask for support he reportedly told arinc that he gul did not want to see bureaucrat defmin gonul in cankaya 2 c the way guls candidacy ultimately played out was reflection of the longrunning partnership and rivalry between pm recep tayyip erdogan and gul according to our contact from the outset the biggest hurdle was erdogan who until the last minute proved unwilling to renounce his personal presidential ambitions the pm waited so long that there was time to cushion gul candidacy via the media whose initial reactions to guls candidacy had been positive the pm squandered an opportunity better to prepare both the military and the public at that point the opposition peoples republican party chp could have savored its anyone but erdogan victory and gul who enjoyed good relations both with chp and with the military could have helped smooth the way comment its not clear that gul candidacy would ever have been acceptable to the military though they certainly do not like surprises end comment 3c once the turkish general staff released its ememo late on april 27 it was allegedly gul not the pm who persuaded akp to take the democratic high road and hard line reflected in got spokesman cemil ciceks april 28 statement ref which gul reportedly penned in the interview gul also reflected confidence in akps prospects for doing well in the upcoming general election 4c one frequent tgs accusation has been that akp has hidden agenda gul had rebutted it consistently pointing to the raft of political and economic reforms the akp government has passed and asking rhetorically if they would be working hard to harmonize turkish law with eu law if gots agenda were sharia xxxxx 5c according to xxxxx gul was not member of milli gorus the old necmettin erbakan cabal of pious antisemitic anatolians who have little subtlety guls initial political activity was with serious student movement just prior to the 1980 coup to which erdogan also belonged the milli turk talebe birligi national turkish student union mttb formerly leftist student group turned conservativeislamist then disbanded in 1980 as result of the coup after 1997 it was guls thinktank politik arastirma merkezi political research center pam that planned akps split from erbakans fazilet and mapped out the strategy that brought akp to power in 2002 gul is per the journalist the only one in the party whom erdogan truly respects in the turkish sense of admiration friendship and fear 6c comment this picture of gul is one persons view who has known the gul family for long time and stands in contrast to how others including some in akp have described gul xxxxx for example told us the fm was devastated and had never wanted to run whatever the truth about his mood it is hard to believe that gul seasoned ankara 00001091 002 of 002 politician and operator would let himself be pushed into something he didnt want to do even for the greater good for his party end comment visit ankaras classified web site at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurankara wilson
