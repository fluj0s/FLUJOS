production the introductory section provides brief overview of wto domestic policy commitments as well as background information on wto member requirements for reporting on domestic subsidy outlays in the second section wto member outlays made to support agricultural production as reported in member notiﬁcations to the wtos committee on agriculture are discussed following the wto reporting format domestic spending is disaggregated according to those outlays that count against spending limits ie amber box and those outlays that are exempted from spending limits ie green box blue box minimis or special and diﬀerential treatment sdt exemptions special attention is paid to the spending levels and exemptions for the three major wto members the united states the 15member european union eu15 and japan together these three entities account for over 90 of all domestic agricultural subsidies reported by wto members the third and ﬁnal section describes in more detail us agricultural support

wto on fe bruary 16 2005 35 had made specific commitments to reduce domestic spending based on review of the 19952001 period for which wto member data are available wto policy commitments appear to have either reduced or redirected domestic subsidies away from marketdistorting policies and towards programs of the exempt categories in addition amber box spending generally has declined relative to spending limits notable exception to these trends is the united states where domestic support has tr ended higher both in total value and as share of wto spending limits during 19952001 three wto members the 15member european union eu15 the united states and japan dominated every wto category of domestic support spending together th ey accounted for over 90 of amber box spending by wto members

support by wto mbers have been assembled from available notifications and are presented in series of appendix tables appendix tables 19 at the end of this report deta iled data on us domestic support as notified to the wto are presented in appendix tables 1013 these tables are referenced throughout this report domestic support commitments domestic support broadly refe rs to those agricultural policies that operate within country so as to influence internal farm and rural incomes resource use production and consumption of agricultural products or the environmental impacts of farming the agreement on agriculture aa recognizes that individual wto member countries reserve the right and may be oblig ated by their elector ates to use domestic support policies to pursue various national policy objectives as result the aa distinguishes between support programs that have direct effect on agricultural production and those that are deemed min imally trade or production distorting the aa commits countries to discipline th eir domestic farm subsidies primarily by establishing an annual dollar limit on t hose policies determin ed to have the greatest potential to distort markets while allowing exemptions for less distortive policies negotiators not the agreement itself used colorcoded analogy based on traffic light for these program categories as described below for detailed description of domestic support criteria in accordance with wto commitments see crs report rs20840 agriculture in the wto limits on domestic support amber box policies those policies deemed most likely to cause producers to divert resources into or out of the production of various commodities thus affecting supplies and world prices are cat egorized as amber box policies by the wto in the traffic light analogy amber signifies proceed with caution subject to rules and commitments each wto country with such policie s has its own dollar limitation termed its aggregate measurement of support ams annex 3 of the aa specifies the methods countries must use to calculate th eir ams for example an ams must be calculated on productspecific basis for each agricultural product supported supports that are not product specific for exampl irrigation subsidies must be aggregated into one nonproduct specific ams national and subnational eg state support must be counted levies or fees on producers are subtracted from the ams calculation examples of such policies or progra ms include price supports where the government ensures that the farm price of particular commodity will not fall beneath prescribed level direct payments tied to each unit of commodity currently produced subsidies on such inputs as fe rtilizer seed irrigation or feed and subsidized crop loans each wto member agreed that total nnual subsidies for its amber box policies its ams would not exceed base period level generally 1986 1988 in addition 35 of these countries including the united states and most other major agricultural traders agreed to gradually reduce the maximum permitted levels ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30612crs3 2 each wto members schedule of concessions is available at httpwwwwtoorg

settlement in the world continuedamber box support each year using the am s calculation to determine this support the rates of spending reduc tion and the length of the implementation period varied according to countrys status as either developed deve loping or leastdeveloped in general the developed countries agr eed to reduce their total ams by 20 from their base period over sixyear period of implementation 19952000 developing countries agreed to 13 reduction over 10year period 19952004 least developed countries agreed to not increas support beyond the ba period level each members ams for the final year of implementation is the bound level applying to each succeeding year until new trade agreement is negotiated reductions do not have to be made equally across commodities or on commodity bycommodity basis each country can d ecide which programs to reduce and how in order to meet its obligation individual country negotiations resulted in some variation from these general rules the list of specific commitments ong with their implementation period are spelled out for each member country in its schedule of concessions also referred to as its country schedule2 new members that join the wto must negotiate their specific policy commitments also detailed in country schedule during their accession negotiations commitments made by wto members could potentially constrain their flexibility and spending choices when they consider ways to assist their agricultural producers at home in other words wt member might not be able to undertake or expand domestic farm program if that action would cause the member to exceed the annual support limit it agreed to as wto member nation these constraints also apply to the united states which was leading voice for agricultural trade reforms including reductions in tr adedistorting domestic subsidies exemptions from ams reduction commitments the aa defines four categories of domestic support that are ligible for exemption from ams reduction commitments green box blue box minimis and special and differential treatment sdt exemptions the aa descri bes the general conditions that policy must meet to qualify for one of these four exemptions however each country may have its own interpretation of the wto conditions as result country notifications3 are the primary means for determining 1 how country has chosen to categorize its domestic subsidies and 2 whether c ountry is fully meeting its ams reduction commitments disagreements between or among wto members over whether certain subsidies have been correctly categ orized ie as exempt from or subject to ams reduction commitments often give rise to wto dispute settlement cases where the issue is ruled on by wto dispute settlement panel4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30612crs4 4 continued trade organization 5 the types of green box policies are identified in annex 2 of the agreement on agriculture aa at httpwwwwtoorgenglishdocs_elegal_e14agpdf 6 for more details see article 62 of the aagreen box certain types of domestic subsid ies that do not distort trade or at most cause minimal distortion while achieving various domestic policy goals are exempted from domestic support disciplines5 complying policies include outlays for activities such as agricultural res earch and extension conservation and the environment rural development food secu rity stocks domestic food aid eg food stamps farm disaster payments and struct ural adjustment programs also exempted are decoupled payments that is pa yments not linked to current production decisions such as commodity direct pa yments these specific exemptions are referred to as green in the trafficlight sense since countries can go ahead with these policies without limit blue box direct payments may qualify fo r exemption in the blue box from ams reduction commitments if they are made under producti onlimiting programs for crops this includes those payment pr ograms based on fixed area and yield or based on more than 85 of base production for livestock production this includes those payments tied to fixed number of livestock there are limits on blue box spending minimis exemptions the idea behind the minimis exemption is that small levels of domestic support matter what their nature are deemed sufficiently benign ie not likely to dist ort trade that they do not have to be included in the ams calculation the minimis exemption may be applied to domestic subsidies at two levels product specific ie support that applies to specific product such as wheat sugar etc and nonproduct specific eg irrigation if total nonproduct specific subsidies are be low 5 10 for developing countries of the value of developed countrys to tal agricultural production then they do not have to be included in the ams calculation in order to evaluate productspecific subsidy first total all forms of nonexem pt support for that particular commodity then apply the 5 rule to the value of production for that specific commodity for countries that have ams re duction commitment in their schedules domestic support is limited to their minimis values on both productspecific and nonproductspecific basis for any given year special and differential tr eatment sdt exemptions certain types of government assistance in developing countries and ldcs are exempt from support reduction commitments6 these include both direct nd indirect domestic investment in agriculture and rural development as well as agricultural input subsidies generally available to lowincome or resourcepoor producers in veloping countries also included are investments intended to enc ourage diversification away from growing illicit narcotic cropshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30612crs5 7 for more information see crs report rl32916 agriculture in the wto policy commitments made under the agreement on agriculture the wto source document is notification requirements nd formats gag2 june 30 1995monitoring implementation of commitments to provide for monitoring and compliance of wto policy commitments the uruguay round established committee on ag riculture and assigned it the duty of reviewing progress in the implementation of individual member commitments notification of domestic support each wto member country is expected to routinely submit reports called notifications on the implementation of its domestic support co mmitments for monitoring and review by the wto committee on agriculture these notifications serve as the primary source of information about each countrys domestic agricultural subsidy outlays and on how such subsidies have been classified as exempt from or as subject to reduction commitments although the aa has firm deadlines for notifications the committee on agriculture has adopted explicit notifica tion requirements and formats that member countries are expect ed to follow see appendix table 1 in this report for details7 in general members w ith base and annual domes tic support commitments should submit notifications on domestic support implementation later than 120 days following the end of the marketing year choosing marketing year wto members are given considerable flexibility in defining the 12month marketing year most relevant to their situation countries may c hoose between calendar fiscal or marketing year as their implementation year as result the marketing year reporting period and notification duedate vary widely across countries some countries including the united states report their ams data using mixture of different commodity marketing years for example the 2001 marketing year for us wheat began in june 2001 nd ended in may 2002 the corn marketing year began in september 2001 and ended in august 2002 most us livestock activities are reported on calendar year basis usda analysts who prepare the notifications must wait until after the end of each commoditys marketing year when all spending and program details become available then more time typically is needed to review and calculate expenditures and organize them into wto formats and categories overdue notifications although all wto members agreed to abide by their commitments and to provide notifications of their implementation status the wto has formal method for enforcing such pro mises as result delays in submitting notifications have become nearly routine for most wto members and substantial number of notifications has fallen overdue the wto committee on agriculture releas occasional reports detailing the status of members implementation of policy commitments see appendix table 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30612crs6 8 wto document gagnusa51 march 17 2005 available at httpdocsonlinewto orgaccording to wto data through june 1 2005 1995 was the sole year for which all members with domestic s upport reduction commitments for that year had submitted notification for 2000 out of 30 count ries with commitments 25 or 83 had notified for 2003 of the 35 countries w ith commitments 8 or 23 had notified and 27 were overdue including the united states the most recent us notification was for 2001 which was not submitted until march 17 20048 some particularly egregious examples of overdue notifica tions include brazil mexico switzerlandliechtenstein and venezuela whose most recent notifications of domestic support are for 1998 their 1999 notifications of domestic support are now approximately five years late with respect to compliance the wto again has enforcement mechanism instead individual members may bring case against another member in the event of apparent noncompliance with policy commitments how ever the burden of proof is upon the accuser whose case is made all the more difficult if the accused member has failed to keep up w ith annual notifications issues with subsidy cate gorization and reporting w t t r d negotiators and countries that rely heavily on them consider domestic support subsidies made under the four exemption cat egories to be more virtuous ie cause less market distortion than amber box sp ending however some market analysts and wto members argue that these exemption categories as well as the entire notification process have two principal faults first categorizing and reporting exempted subsidies are largely selfpoliced that is each member country has some di scretion in determining whether subsidy is green or amber and if it is the latter in calculating its value for wto reporting purposes second critics maintain that the various exemption categories have been used by few countries primarily the eu15 and the united states to shield some large subsidies from any required cutbacks cr eation of the blue box is cited as an example of an exemption designed strictly to protect the eu15s compensatory payments similarly the united states heavy use of the minimis exclusion is often characterized as dodge of subsidy commitments defenders of the language in the wt aa argue that criteria for defining ams outlays as exempt or nonexempt are sufficiently explicit to prevent wto members from undermining the basic objec tives of the uruguay round agreement furthermore they contend that the ag ricultural policy commitme nts made under the uruguay round and the aa represent the fi rst meaningful attempt to bring the agricultural sector under any significant disc ipline therefore since consensus was paramount it could have been unhelpful from the pointofview of reaching final agreement if the trade negotiators had tried to overreach on the extent of disciplines to be imposed on domestic supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30612crs7 domestic support comparisons among wto members total ams spending as notified by all wto members has been broken into exempt and nonexempt categ ories for comparison in figure 1 total domestic support declined from 2949 billion in 1995 to 1893 b illion in 2001 36 decline this period encompasses all of the implementati on period 19952000 for developed countries the decline in dom estic support spending was expected to continue albeit slower th rough 2004 the final implement ation year for developing countries since 18 of the 35 current wto members with ams reduction commitments are developing countries appendix table 2 shows the status of wto member notifications on domestic support as of january 14 2005 because so few wto members have notified their domestic support activity for the 20022004 pe riod the following discussion focuses on the 19952001 period where data are suffi cient to permit valid comparisons most of the ams decline 58 occurred in amber box outlays which fell by over onehalf from an aggregate of 1192 billion in 1995 to 584 billion in 2001 total spending on exempt policy categories so exhibited decline but by smaller amount 25 from 1757 billion to 1309 billion as result of this uneven rate of decline total exempt spending increased steadily as share of total ams spending rising from 58 share in 1995 to 69 share by 2001 it is likely that significant portion of the decline in amber box spending resulted from shifting of domestic subsidies from the marketdistorting policies of the amber box category to more virtuous programs that qualify for one of the wto exemption categories 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001050100150200250300 amber box

submitted 10 this is purely an artifact of exchange rate fluctuations and does not represent loosening of in either the eu15s or japans true ams ceiling since both countries undertake all of their domestic policy subsidies in euros and yen respectivelythe pattern of rapidly declining amber box spending relative to exempt ams spending holds for all major wto members with the exception of the united states in contrast to the rest of the world both amber box spending as well as exempt spending by the united states trended higher through this initial sevenyear period of review with amber box spending increasing at generally faster rate than exempt spending see the third section of this report implications for us agriculture for discussion of us domestic support data on ams spending by

successive annual steps to 191 billion in 2000 in any year after that or until new negotiating round is conc luded us amber box outlays cannot exceed 191 billion this compares with the amber box ceiling of 598 billion 672 billion euro for the eu15 and 359 billion 3973 billion yen for japan in 2000 strengthening of the euro and yen against the us dollar resulted in rising dollar value for both the eu15s and ja pans amber box ceiling in 2004 to 833 billion and 363 billion respectively10 in 2000 the eu15 the united states nd japan accounted for over 80 of the aggregate wto amber box ceiling

http wwwersusdagovpub licationswrs0407 together the eu15 the united states and japan have accounted for over 90 of all actual amber box spending by wto members the eu15s actual amber box spending has declined steadily from 644 billion in 1995 to 352 billion in 2001 figure 2 this decline has been in lock step with the eu15s declining amber box ceiling and has resulted in fairly steady outlayto ceiling average share of 64 figure 3 large gap between the amber box ceiling and actual outlays is significant because it represents real negotiating power for future cuts in wto amber box ceiling vels without sacrif icing domestic policy flexibility the eu15s ability to easily absorb further ceiling cuts has been enhanced since 2000 by series of intern agricultural policy reforms which are expected to dramatically reduce its amber box spending both in total value and as share of its amber box ceiling11 key element of recent eu policy reforms has been reorientation of subsidy paymen ts away from coupled payments ie subsidies that are linked directly to producer behavior and are therefore subject to amber box reduction commitments to decoupled payments ie minimally distortive subsidies that are linked only i ndirectly to producer behavior and are therefore eligible for exemption from reduction commitments these reforms are thus expected to give the eu15 much greater

rcs030301 march 2003since the mid1990s japan has been gr adually reforming its domestic policy including the removal of government c ontrols over its wholesale and retail rice markets12 as result market prices for rice traditionally japans largest crop have been declining however produ cer prices remain substantially above international market prices due to st ringent import barriers in 1998 japan abandoned its program of admin istered producer prices in favor of rice producers income stabilization program whose payments are notified as blue box stronger use of rice land diversion program whose pa yments are notified as green box and continued reliance of import controls w hich are dealt with under market access commitments to support domestic prices as result of these changes japan stopped notifying rice as receiving any productspecific ams price support despite domestic prices that were still 10 or more times higher than prices in other japonica ricegrowing countries japans notification of productspecific rice price support dropped from 2315 billion yen 188 billion in 1997 to only 419 billion ye n 327 million in 1998 and this latter amount was exempted under the productspec ific minimis exemption none of these notification changes were challenged by other wto members these changes resulted in substantially lower annua l amber box outlays during 19982001 for

grains cotton and oilseeds ccp payments occur when the national average market price falls below the target price after adjusting for per unit direct payments with the ccp payment making up the difference between the adjusted target price and the market price thus ccp payments tend to rise when market prices decline and to decrease as market prices rise as with the fixed direct payments each eligible producers ccp is based on an historical not current peri od of production in other words unlike the old target price program in place before the 1996 farm bill the new payments are decoupled

however unde r the current doha round of wto trade negotiations the united states has been negotiating to have blue box criteria be redefined to include ccp payments20 some other wto members have argued that because ccp payments are directly tied to market prices and acreage limitations are required they should be notified in th amber box further it is also unknown whether such payments would be cons idered noncommodity specific on the argument that producers do not have to plan t particular crop in the year payment might be triggered or commodityspecific on the argument that they are in fact based on the production of specific crop even if it was in the past if ccp payments ultimately are count ed toward the 191 billion ams limit it is unclear whether this would force cuts in other program spending to keep the us within the ams spending ceiling future market prices are difficult to predict in turn making future s ubsidy levels uncertain wto circuit breaker the 2002 farm act pl 107171 contains provision sec 1601e1 in the commodity title title i aimed at ensuring that future farm program benefits do not exceed the united states annual wto limit th is has been termed informally as the circuit breaker more specifically if usda determines that total spending for commodity support will exceed the limit in any year the secretary shall to the maximum extent practicable make program adjustments to ensure that such expenditures do not exceed such allowable limits despite the high levels of support since 1998 the united states so far has rema ined within its prescribed wto annual support limits and therefore use of the wto circuit breaker has never been tested critics have questi oned the feasibility of implementing the circuit breaker besides the political difficulties of propos ing farm program cutbacks usda would face administrative problems as already noted projections of both private market conditions and government fa rm spending are notoriously imprecise that is one reason the usda analysts who prepare the wto notifications must wait until after the end of the marketing year when ll spending and prog ram details become available more time typically is needed to review and calculate expenditures and organize them into wto formats and categories if such calculations were made in advance and usda found that farm support might exceed the allowable ams would it have to withhold from farmers some or all of the years expected subsidy which commodities andor supports would be affected some of them or would usda make an acrosstheboard reduction how would that affect farmers planting decisions and their access to loans what if usda wrongly predicted that spending would not exceed the allowable ams but it ultimately did defenders of the provision counter that the provision would not be as complicated as critics contend sugge sting that relatively modest adjustments in programs and payment vels could be made easily on an asneeded

question however because the ams calculation for given notifica tion year may involve the summation of commodity subsidies for different 12month periods there is some flexibility in how exchange rates may be reported or applied to the notification data an obvious exchangerate influence is as follows because member countries initially agreed to freeze their ams at base levels then reduce it
