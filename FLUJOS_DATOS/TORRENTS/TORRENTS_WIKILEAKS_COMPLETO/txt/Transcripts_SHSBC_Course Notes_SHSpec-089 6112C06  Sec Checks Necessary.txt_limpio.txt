6112c06 shspec89 sec checks necessary the more aberrated person is the more onlyone he is he moves in towards clearing from his lonely vigil on cloud 69 where he has been keeping watch against all comers and where he learned never to take any orders then you step up with your emeter and give him an order you get response the symptom of extreme aberration is total unwillingness to receive any help you can be fooled by the fact that people or countries who are very lowtoned will beg for help you are fooled if you dont notice what is done with the help when it is received it is wasted andor used to make the helper wrong they use help as trap to show you how ineffectual you are india is in that condition now you will also find this in insane asylums you will see person on post somewhere who has to do everything himself he is proving that he must not be helped when you are auditing pc who can be helped things go pretty smoothly when you are auditing someone who is being an onlyone he is out of communication very suspicious and possibly unwilling to be helped even if hes ok on help you still have the communication barrier until that is knocked apart you wont find your meter reading on the pc he will be hard to assess if his communication level is going in and out during the assessment the average wog is highly suspicious he is highly alert his ability to be hurt is so enormous that he thinks he has to protect himself with all sorts of barricades and amongst these is help the more aberrated person is the more onlyone he is take someone who is not even vaguely in comm we are going to assess him to discover something about him if he feels that anything about him will be used against him you will get only total defense so your first effort in clearing anyone is to get that person into communication not only willing to talk to you but when you talk to him it means little something so that when you talk to him he can receive it you could sec check person whose help factor was way down if you got the exact right questions but you couldnt assess him remember theres charge on assessment hes not trying to withhold anything from you hes not trying to give you anything hes just meat the only place meter has hole in it is with arc breaks and you can repair that with an arc break process but that isnt good enough for assessment the person has to be in good communication with the auditor to get an accurate rapid assessment or the auditor has to have fantastic altitude in which case hell get reads the rudiments can be found to be in for one auditor yet hed be unable to get reads on assessment that just means the meter isnt registering for that person another auditor could find ruds out and be able to assess the pc so the meter is registering for him this is not spooky the onlyone pc who is not part of the human race wont let anyone have command value over him the first barrier you have to cross with him is getting him into communication speed of assessment depends on degree on willingness to communicate with the auditor altitude is the command value you have over the pc an auditor has to have confidence in his tools and what he is doing if he lacks it the pc can tell and assigns him lower altitude accordingly an inexpert auditor who is not in comm with the emeter and hostile pc who is not in comm with the human race will give you debacle it is much more economical to sec check someone for seventyfive hours and put them in communication with the human race than to assess them for seventyfive hours the assessment will go nowhere but the sec check will make him feel better details on goals running and assessments unburdening is the mechanism of the way we are handling the gpm were taking the solutions off the top of it and it deintensified as problem because these terminals are as much problem as they have been solved the trick is to solve it without solving it again in way that pulls it in on the person you do it by taking off the solutions which is how it should have been solved in the first place the other barrier in your road is that the pc at the outset is uncertain that anything can be solved find out what in life he is having most trouble with find out who had that trouble briefly sec check that terminal hell feel different and gain awareness that change is possible you can even q and with his feeling that nothing works find someone else who felt that way and run ow on the person you can always count on whatever the pcs complaining about being present in another person keyed in by his ow on the person its also always on his own goals line so you are unburdening him with it try to handle something for the pc it will make your meter read better you can always find something the person will remember that will key out that was the procedure in 1950 the only trouble was that it only worked for 20 30 of cases and people tended to key it right back in because ow was run on the person who had it you can always run terminal for little while you could find eventually that you were the pcs opposition terminal sitting right there going in the teeth of his worst aberration auditing will nevertheless work over the top of this your job in handling pc is to get the pc to sit down and have some confidence and read on meter it could take up to seventyfive hours to get the pc into that state of mind but it is necessary to do so dont be in such hurry he has been crazy for the past 100 trillion years as far as auditor training is concerned its obviously better for the auditor to have degree of confidence and expertness and to know what he has been doing because the pcs confidence will go up at once so you will get something like 3d it all works itself out for us the pc is being run on security checks and the auditor is gaining confidence in his metering at the same time we trust the auditor wont miss too many sec check questions if the auditor isnt too familiar with the meter have him spend half an hour on end ruds so he can get what sec check question has been missed cleaned up well this keeps pcs from being upset pcs will also be upset by not being asked for the withhold behind the critical thought asking for critical thoughts is just trap for the pc to get in on the overt slippily
