nomination of major general robert t clark may 13 2003 since the early 1990s the senate has beco increasingly vigilant in examining senior military officer misconduct and ensuring that the nominees they confirm meet the highest standard of accountability during the mid1990s numerous hearings and debates ensued about the suitability for promotion of many senior military officers heightening of senate scrutiny can be traced to notable confirmation cases which included the following in 1992 the senate arme d services committee sasc vote to not award thomas j hickey the retirement rank of air force lieutenant gene ral due to his failure to implement key directives to solidify the in tegrity of the air force promotion selection process3 in 1994 the debate over the retirement gr ade of air force lieutenant general buster c glosson who was accused of impr operly attempting to prejudice promotion board4 and in 1994 the controversy over the re tirement rank of navy admiral frank b kelso ii because of his alleged respons ibility for the tailhook convention scandal5 in 1991 and perceived lack of effort to integrate women into the navy6 today senate scrutiny of the leadersh ip accountability of senior military officers remains vigorous during the march 2003 hear ings regarding the sexual assault scandal at the us air force academy senator john w warner noted that the situation demands deliberate critical examina tion and appropriate measure of accountability when command fails in some key aspect of its mission particularly when personnel charged to commanders care have been harmed7 this comment and other similar statements made by senators may be signal that ne w standard of accountability may continue to take shape in the senate in the coming years the key to this new standard may be the striking of balance between congressional oversight the senate role to advise and consent and dod transparency in disclosing senior military officer adverse information during the confirmation process dod policy and terms during the confirmation process it is dod policy to inform the president and the sasc of adverse information concerning the nominated senior military officers personnel actions involving gene ral and flag officers that require senate confirmation include nominations appointments rea ppointments extensions assignments reassignments promotions and retirem ents dod instruction 13204 describes the procedures used to process these personnel actions to comprehend these procedures it may help to understand two term s defined by the

investigation or inquiry into possible conflict of interest or failure to adhere to standards of conduct or misconduct it is also helpful to understand the diffe rence between promoti ons and appointments in general military officers are selected for promotion to one or twostar rank by centralized ad hoc selection boa rd of generalflag officers candidates for three and four star appointments are not considered by cen tralized board but instead nominated by service secretary through the s ecretary of defense for r eappointments to another three or fourstar position the senate is required to reconfirm th personnel action even if promotion is involved according to title 10 section 1370 of the united states code gfo retirements must also be indi vidually confirmed by the senate consideration of adverse information dod instruction 13204 identifies how adverse information is considered by board members during one and twost ar centralized promotion boa rds section 615 title 10 us code armed forces closely governs the procedures used by the military to consider adverse information during the promotion pro cess by giving specific guidance on the type of information that may be furnished to boa rd members specifically information about particular officer may be furnished to selection board only if the information exists in official military records personnel folders i nvestigative records etc additionally it must be determined by service secretary to be substantiated relevant information that could reasonably and mate rially affect the deliberations of the selection board the law also mandates that before adve rse information about an officer is furnished to board the information must be made available to the officer and that the officer must be given reasonable opportunity to submit comments to the board the dod instruction also dir ects that for all gfo promo tions and appointments the service secretary review ll official dod investigation records to confirm that each candidate meets prescribed sta ndards of conduct this intern review is usually led by the general counsel of the respective military department records reviewed by each service include files from the inspector general military criminal investigation units and equal employment opportunity eeo organi zations for promotions to onestar service secretary directs review of all adverse information covering the last 10 years of an officers career to identify negative tre nds for two three and fourstar personnel actions the review includes any new adverse information since the individuals last senate confirmation once the review is completed the serv ice secretary considers the adverse information if any and decides if he or she will support the nomination if so the secretary will forward nomination pack age identifying the proposed promotion or appointment to the secretary of defense through the assistan t secretary of defenseforce management policy asdfmp

records to include eeo fi and the public disclosure report for onestar nominations only maintained in the dod that pertain to this officer have been examined the files contain advers information about this officer since his last senate confirmation further to the best of my knowledge there is planned or ongoing investigation or inquiry into matters that constitute alleged adverse information on the part of this officer if the secretary of defense supports the mination but adverse information exists the secretary identifies the information in separate summary included with the nomination package submitted to the president the summary outlines the adverse information identifies the investigative agency discloses findings describes corrective actions taken and explains why dod leaders continue to support the nomination reporting adverse information to the senate fortyeight hours after the president signs nomination list the white house clerk will forward the list to the senate clerk dod public affairs will announce presidential nomination as soon as possible af ter presidential signature and military department coordination after nomination reaches the senate asdfmp is the primary dod conduit to discuss adverse information or alleged adverse in formation with sasc members or staff but this does not prohibit the military services from communicating directly with the sasc or ot her senators or staff about nomination if nomination package signed by the president contains adverse information asdfmp will send letter to the chairman of the sasc advisi ng him of the information normally dod will not report alleged adverse information or other unsubstantiated allegations to the senate however in extraordinary cases involving an allegation which is receiving significant media attention or when the sasc brings an allegation to the attention of dod summary of the unsubstan tiated allegati on is provided asdfmp also monitors the names on nomination list to determine if new adverse information exists asdfmp initiates monthly checks with each service and dod ig on all nominations that have been received by the senate but have not yet been confirmed if after nomination reaches the senate and adverse information or alleged adverse information is identified by dod the cognizant military partment will notify asdfmp within 5 business days asdfmp will advise the sasc of the information and will request that the nomination be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved when the investigation or inquiry is comple ted on an officer whose nomination is on hold at the sasc and the allegation is substantiated the respective service secretary and the secretary of defense will decide if they s till support the nomination if support continues then the nomination package will be resubmitted for reapproval by the president if the president also continues to support the mination then asdfmp will advise the sasc to proceed with the confirmation pro cess if on the other hand based on the new adverse information the dod administra tion does not support the nomination the secretary of defense will submit new nomination package through asdfmp requesting that the president withdraw the nomination from the sasc in instanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21714crs5 8 department of defens instruction number 13204 military officer actions requiring approval of the

investigations of criminal misconduct are conducted by law enforcement agencies within each service inspector general office criminal misconduct includes but is not limited to procurement fraud

relationships abuse of authority favoritism and misuse of government property according to the dod ig semiannual report to congress april september 2003 on ptember 30 2003 there were 275 ongoing dod senior officer investigations included civ ilian leaders during that sixmonth period dod reported that it closed 221 senior fficial cases of which 32 14 identified misconduct to include misuse of government property nd resources 35 abuse of authority and favoritism 35 improper pe rsonnel action 16 sexual harassment and improper relationship 7 and other misconduct 7 future direction of senior military officer confirmations some analysts believe senior military officer confirmations will likely continue to receive increased scrutiny by some memb ers of congress recent hearings and statements suggest concern in the sena about the accountab ility of senior military officers who failed to promote proper leadership climate in the organizations they commanded an example is the scrutiny by nators of the controversial circumstances surrounding the nomination of ma jor general robert clark to threestar army position in 1991 he came under criticism because soldie r thought to be homosexual was killed at fort campbell kentucky during clark s command although an army investigation cleared clark of tolerating antigay attitudes on the post critics alleged that while he was in charge of fort campbell he permitted an atmosphere of harassment in press release referencing this case senator edward m kennedy stated we need to hold senior commanders accountable if they allow climate of bigotry intimidation and fear to existhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21714crs6 10 statement release from the office of senator edward m kennedy on the nomination of major general robert clark october 23 2003 contract david smith 202 2242633 11 air force manual 37139 records disposition schedule march 1 1996 table 901 p 680 12 it is import to note that all ig investigativ reports are at some point destroyed in accordance with the schedules approved by the national ar chives and records administration however the general details of the adverse information contai ned in those records will likely be reflected in the affected officers permanent performance re cord and thus available for consideration by promotion boards when considering the individua l for promotion in this manner an officer remains accountable for misconduct throughout his entire careeron our nations military bases10 other recent misconduct cases including the 2003 air force academy sexual assault investigations also hint that the nate may be poised to increase the scrutiny of senior military fficer accountability during confirmation the transparency of dod investigations may c ontinue to be key in this process dod asserts that its investigative mech anism is objective independent and promotes confidence in its ability to poli ce its own in the september 2003 semiannual report to congress joseph schmitz inspector general of the department of defense states the trust of the american public in their government requires confidence that the institutions of their government are acting in their interestfor 25 years inspectors general have sought to prom ote integrity efficiency and effectiveness in the programs and operations of government this anal ysis has identified that the dod disclosure process appears mostly transparent and we ll defined if improve ments are required or desired they are administrative in nature for example the dod 10year lookback may require refinement since the scope of the policy may actually be shorter than intended as previously discu ssed the disclosure of advers information related to one star nominations involves review of f iles ten years back problem may stem from current dod records disposition schedules in which some services purge ig investigation reports dealin g with administrative misconduc t after two years excludes criminal investigation files11 the investigation reports involving the administrative misconduct are held for ten year s only if it involves senior military officer as result complete tenyear record of past investigations may not be available when compiling disclosure for the senate12 another weakness may exist in th dod practice of disclosing only new adverse information since the last senate confirmati on of senior military officer this practice may make it difficult for the senate to identify misconduct tre nds or note command climate issues additionally dod generally does not disclose unsubstantiated allegations unless the secretary of defense deems it relevant to the deliberations this practice may prevent the senate from getting full disclosure of multiple unsubstantiated allegations and hinder members from identif ying possible negative trends if the disclosure of adverse trends in the organizational climate of military bases and posts becomes more critical during the senate confirmation process the dod ig semiannual report to the congress is one possible tool that may facilitate transparency into any developing trends the repor t currently provides meaningful statistical information concerning senior official i nquiries but may need to presen t more rigorous analysis of any developing trends in command climate investigations the addition of such an analysis to the report may allow members to conduct confirmation and oversight functions more effectively
