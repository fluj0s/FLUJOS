and jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt would ban all nuclear explosions president clinton signed it in 1996 and transmitted it to the senate in 1997 the senate rejected it in 1999 to enter into force 44 named nations including the united states must ratify the treaty the bush administration opposes ratification but has maintained moratorium on nuclear testing begun in 1992 this report presents pros and cons of key arguments the treatys implications for nuclear nonproliferation for maintaining and developing nuclear weapons for the value of nuclear weapons and for maintaining us nuclear advantage monitoring issues and potential consequences of resuming testing this report will be updated periodically see also crs issue brief ib92099 nuclear weapons comprehensive test ban treaty and crs report 971007 f nuclear testing and comprehensive test ban chronology starting september 1992 status following the treatys defeat in 1999 and pursuant to senate rule xxx paragraph 2 the treaty moved to the senate foreign relations committee calendar at the end of the 106th congress where it currently resides in 2001 some in the administration expressed interest in withdrawing the treaty from the senate to mark formal us rejection pursuant to senate rule xxx paragraph 1d senate motion to return the treaty to the president would require simple majority vote but that motion would be debatable and cloture would require 60 votes such motion has been made as of june 28 2005 175 nations had signed the treaty and 121 had ratified it the ctbt and nuclear nonproliferation protreaty case many see halting nuclear proliferation as critical some link the ctbt and nonproliferation as follows 1 the treaty will make it harder for nations to develop advanced nuclear weapons 2 the parties to the 1970 nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt including the united states pledged in article vi to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament when the parties decided in 1995 to extend the congressional research service the library of congress crs2 treaty indefinitely they agreed to complete ctbt negotiations by 1996 these steps were quid pro quo proponents stress nuclear weapon states agreed to work to halt testing nonnuclear weapon states agreed to forgo nuclear weapons 3 the administration views international cooperation as crucial to us efforts to combat weapons of mass destruction wmd ctbt supporters believe this nation could more readily secure such cooperation by ratifying the ctbt at the may 2005 npt review conference ambassador ronaldo sardenberg of brazil said brazil has consistently called for the universalization of the ctbt which we consider to be an essential element of the disarmament and non proliferation regime1 supporters fear that us decision to resume testing to produce new nuclear weapons would dramatically undermine the npt2 antitreaty case others hold that the ctbt and npt will not halt proliferation the npt inspection regime they assert is of little value in stopping npt parties from developing nuclear weapons as shown by iraq in the early 1990s and apparently by north korea nations that want to develop nuclear weapons could simply not sign the npt and ctbt and test as india and pakistan did in 1998 in this view nations will decide whether to go nuclear based on their security goals not us rejection of the ctbt some argue that us ctbt ratification would increase the risk of proliferation potential foes believing the us arsenal was becoming less reliable would feel less deterred by it us friends and allies would feel pressed to develop nuclear weapons if their foes went nuclear nuclear north korea for example might lead japan and south korea to go nuclear hence in this view reliable us nuclear deterrent is the most effective barrier against nuclear proliferation and reliability requires testing maintaining us nuclear weapons under the ctbt protreaty case the national nuclear security administration nnsa has stockpile stewardship program ssp for which 6630 billion was requested for fy2006 that seeks to maintain weapons without testing ssp draws on nuclear test data computer codes supercomputers experiments on large scientific facilities and nuclear weapons experts to better understand the science underlying weapon behavior so as to solve weapon problems ctbt supporters believe this effort is working despite the test moratorium the secretaries of defense and energy certified nine times beginning in 1997 that the nuclear stockpile safe secure and reliable and that testing is not needed3 lack of such certification could lead the president in consultation with congress to withdraw from the treaty and conduct any needed tests in july 2002 national academy of sciences nas panel judged that the united states has the technical capabilities to maintain confidence in the safety and reliability of its existing nuclearweapon stockpile 1 statement by ambassador rolando mota sardenberg

underway if rrw works as anticipated it would replace existing warheads with warheads of modified simpler design that would reduce the need to conduct nuclear tests5 antitreaty case the presidents national security strategy of the united states of america of september 2002 discusses the possible need for preemption to counter wmd threats his national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction of december 2002 reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force including through resort to all of our options to the use of wmd it is argued that possibility of using nuclear weapons demands certainty that they will work yet this certainty is missing without testing nnsa head linton brooks said while there is reason to doubt the ability of stockpile stewardship program to ensure the safety security and reliability of the deterrent we believe the nation must be prepared to carry out an underground nuclear test in the event of unforeseen problems that cant be resolved by other means6 chemical interactions and radioactive decay cause nuclear weapons to deteriorate if the united states continues to maintain warheads through refurbishment ctbt critics fear that current warheads which were designed tested and produced during the cold war are so sophisticated that small changes may make them fail rrw which would replace current warheads with ones designed to be easier to manufacture and certify could also introduce problems many weapons scientists who gained expertise through testing will retire soon return to testing would develop expertise of the next generation of weapon scientists thus the ctbt in this view would reduce confidence in weapons and the people who maintain them the ctbt and the value of nuclear weapons protreaty case many supporters believe that the ctbt would help to delegitimize nuclear weapons and strengthen the norm against their use this norm has been in place since 1945 even though there have been many conflicts in which nations might have sought military advantage by using nuclear weapons preserving this norm puts greater emphasis on us conventional forces by far the strongest in the world while allowing the united states to maintain its nuclear deterrent antitreaty case others see us nuclear weapons as central to world security they kept the peace in the cold war arguably kept iraq from using chemical weapons in the 1991 gulf war and are part of the administrations plan of december 2002 to deter use of wmd rogue states that obtained nuclear weapons when confidence in us 4 national academy of sciences committee on

security administration before house armed services committee strategic forces subcommittee march 2 2005 crs4 weapons had weakened might deter us response to regional threats maintaining high confidence in us weapons preserves the deterrent function of these weapons and makes it unlikely that they would be used in this view maintaining weapons requires testing the treaty and the us advantage in nuclear weapons protreaty case proponents contend that the ctbt would permit the united states to widen its immense lead in nuclear weapons technology this nation has conducted more tests than all others combined and ssp is improving us weapons knowledge china has conducted 45 nuclear tests vs 1030 for the united states the ctbt would prevent china from testing new warheads based on technical advances without testing it could not have the confidence needed to build such warheads or rely on them militarily russia spends much less on nuclear weapons and its weapons labs have fallen on hard times making its ability to maintain weapons increasingly questionable without testing it is argued rogue nations and perhaps terrorist groups could develop simple but not advanced nuclear weapons antitreaty case some critics fear ssp will lock the united states into stockpile so sophisticated that confidence will decline without testing alternatively if the united states proceeds with rrw confidence in replacement warheads may be questionable without testing some assert that russia avoids these problems because its warheads are simpler and less sensitive to minor changes it maintains its stockpile by an ongoing production program that manufactures new warheads to replace aged ones7 china conducted tests through 1996 of what are apparently newdesign warheads clandestine tests would let both nations improve their military capability while the ctbt would keep the united states from doing the same through testing even though us weapons are more advanced than those of rogue states critics believe crude weapons which might be developed without testing might suffice to deter us involvement in regional conflicts monitoring and verification protreaty case scientists recognize that below threshold nuclear explosions cannot be distinguished from earthquakes or industrial explosions and that improved monitoring ability lowers the threshold ctbt supporters expect technical progress to lower the threshold further they expect evasion technology will not progress as fast because wouldbe nuclear states lack the data on weapon yield and explosion containment required for an evasion attempt key treaty provisions aid monitoring the treaty would provide central point for data acquisition and distribution would allow onsite inspections to investigate suspicious events and would establish worldwide network of seismic and other sensors that greatly increases capabilities the international monitoring system ims set up by the preparatory commission for the comprehensive nuclear testban treaty organization is to contain 321 monitoring stations as of december 2004 119 stations had been certified and 204 had been completed or fully upgraded to specifications the nas report of july 2002 judges that ims when done will prevent 1 or 2 kiloton nuclear test from being confidently hidden even with evasion techniques 7 see national academy of sciences technical issues related to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty washington national academy press 2002 p 70 crs5 ctbt advocates hold that tiny explosions will not be militarily significant and point to support of the treaty by several former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff as evidence antitreaty case critics point to many ways to hide tests test in large underground cavity would muffle the explosions seismic signals test during an earthquake would make the seismic signals from the explosion hard to ferret out nation could test anonymously in remote ocean areas very low yield tests are hard to distinguish from the large number of industrial explosions eg for mining or excavation or small earthquakes reportedly for reasons such as these the central intelligence agency has concluded that it cannot monitor lowlevel nuclear tests by russia precisely enough to ensure compliance with the comprehensive test ban treaty 8 treaty opponents fear that clandestine tests would offer military advantage to cheaters rogue state could obtain confidence in more advanced weapons china might be able to conduct sophisticated lowyield tests that would help it advance its weapons according to one intelligence assessment russia reportedly used clandestine tests in the late 1990s to develop lowyield tactical nuclear weapon that is the linchpin of new military doctrine to counter us superiority in precision guided munitions9 thus the ctbt would deny us ability to maintain and improve its weaponry while ceding that capability to others the treaty and the development of new weapons some in the administration in congress and elsewhere have expressed interest in new types of nuclear weapons such as 1 robust nuclear earth penetrator rnep that would burrow few meters into the ground before detonating thereby coupling much larger fraction of its energy to the ground than would surfaceburst weapon and 2 lowyield nuclear weapons that might be used to incinerate biological agents10 protreaty case in this view the united states does not need new weapons its current weapons suffice for almost any conceivable military mission earth penetrators would create much fallout and blast damage buried targets at shallow depth are vulnerable to conventional penetrators others are so deep as to be protected against higheryield nuclear penetrators and some could be defeated by destroying exits etc with conventional weapons national academy of sciences nas report finds nuclear weapons are of limited use against chemical or biological weapons in buried chambers11 redesigning warheads through rrw would incur risks it takes an extraordinary flight of imagination to postulate modern new arsenal composed of such untested designs that would be more reliable safe and effective than the current us arsenal based on more 8 roberto suro cia unable to precisely track testing washington post oct 3 1999 1 9 ibid p 19 10 see crs report rl32130 nuclear

earthpenetrator and other weapons washington national academies press 2005 prepublication copy p 92 93 crs6 than 1000 tests since 194512 new weapons would imply us interest in making weapons more usable and in retaining its nuclear stockpile indefinitely contrary to npt article vi new weapons could require testing with harmful international repercussions antitreaty case in this view credible deterrence of current threats may require new nuclear weapons as linton brooks said it is unwise for there to be anything thats beyond the reach of us power13 rnep supporters see this weapon as of value for destroying buried facilities and point to the nas report on penetrators which states that many important buried targets can be held at risk of destruction only with nuclear weapons14 ctbt opponents suspect this nation might be selfdeterred from using high yield weapons because of the massive fallout they could cause accordingly in this view the united states needs to study its nuclear options and must reserve the right to test consequences of us resumption of testing protreaty case the treatys supporters fear that resumed us testing could lead to worldwide push for testing and new weapons us testing could compel russia to test giving that nation confidence in weapons it has not tested for many years and allowing it to develop new weapons us and russian testing could in this view lead china to test china could develop warheads that posed greater threat to the united states and others chinese testing could lead india to test forcing pakistan to test north korea might test enabling it to sell readytouse nuclear weapons of proven performance to eagertobuy clients and perhaps leading south korea and japan to go nuclear proliferation would increase the risk of nuclear attacks on regional adversaries and the united states ratifying the ctbt in this view would forestall that chain of events antitreaty case the treatys critics assert that testing if needed would make the world more secure by showing that this nation would do whatever is needed to maintain its military strength all nations would know that us weapons would remain reliable and the united states could confidently develop new weapons they assert that ssp by itself is inadequate but when coupled with testing would enable great strides in us weapons science engineering and manufacture testing would help train scientists showing for example the many ways that computer models may not capture in which design can fail further critics believe testing would help attract top scientists to the weapons laboratories as they would be doing real science rather than science without experiments improved recruitment and training would further assure us ability to maintain weapons gains from testing would in this view boost the credibility of us efforts to deter or defeat use of wmd by others thereby promoting us security 12 sidney drell and james goodby what are nuclear weapons for washington arms
