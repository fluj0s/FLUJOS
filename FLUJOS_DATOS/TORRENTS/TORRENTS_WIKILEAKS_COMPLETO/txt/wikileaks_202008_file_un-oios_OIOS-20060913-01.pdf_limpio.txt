uploading of fuel in cairo egypt in cairo unmis purchased fuel and other services including ground transportation crew accommodations and airport handling fees unmis aviation staff charged these items to uwas account relying on the november 2004 contract as basis to do so 58 60 upon completion of the deployment on 4 september 2005 unmis had already accrued more than us1 million in fees amounts which were due and owing to uwa59 some of the invoices which were transmitted in instalments were past due and uwa contacted unmis at that time demanding payment 60 1 ex post facto 61 the investigation has revealed that th subject learned of the outstanding balance owed to uwa on 19 october 2005 the subject reportedly furious summoned his staff and learned for the first time that the uwa contract had been abused and that cargo aircraft had been utilized to transport the egyptian contingent relying upon the uwa agreemen t as basis to obtain the necessary fuel services during the meeting mr goodwin chief of aviation services publicly accepted responsibility for the use of the uwa contract for this purpose further substantive inves tigation appears to have been pursued by the subject to determine the circumstan ces of the use of the agreement and whether and to what extent other individuals may ve been involved the subject said he was unable to direct an investigation such as an oios investigation and expected the lcc would be able to determine what happened 61 the ptf noted that the lcc was not an investigative body and that the appropriate course of action would have been for the cao to refer the matter to the oios auditors and inve stigators present in the mission however the subject made such referral however oios auditors and investigators were present in the mission 62 the subject then directed the local procurement service to prepare presentation for the lcc on an ex post facto basis 62 however pursuant to the delegation as well as rule 12183 of the

the proc urement service made its first presentation to the lcc on the matte r the oic of procurement mr pornchai kanjanakantron and mr g oodwin presented recommendation for the award of the contract on an ex post facto basis claiming an exigency65 at the meeting two explained that these services were required for the egyptian deployment they further asserted that the movement order requesting unmis assistance in the deployment did not arrive until two days before the first round of scheduled departures since unm is had only 48 hour window to get things done they asserted that th aviation s ection utilized the purchase order 5mis143 with universal weather aviation to arrange for these services 66 65 as cao the subject was required to review the lccs recommendation and upon approval forward the presenta tion to the hcc through the cps on 27 october 2005 upon revi ew of the minutes howev er the subject voiced his dissatisfaction with the minutes and asserted that critical information was omitted he declined to forward the presentation67 the subject claimed the presentation failed to expl ain the basis for exceedi ng the missions authority and the financial limitation imposed by the uwa contract he further explained that he felt the presentation appeared to reflect disagreement with unmis and headquarters regarding fina ncial responsibility the subject noted at the time that when unmis agr eed to move the egyptian contingent it assumed the responsi bility for arranging th rough regular procurement action for all associated goods and services68 63 john noisette

the minutes and did not authorize referral of the matter to the hcc74 on this occasion the subject asserted that the basis for his rejection of the minutes was that the presentation failed to fully address the initial contractual arrangement with uwa75 most troublesome is that the subject failed to notify the chief of ps at headquarters and alert him to the incursi on of the expense nd the

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 192 the subjects explanation 69 the subject acknowledged that the primary purpose of the uwa agreement was to provide the necessary services for the srsgs travels outside sudan and asserted that his staff abused the agreement when it was used to support the egyptian deployment 77 70 nevertheless the subject defended his decision to authorize payment to uwa of the outstanding balance prior to lcc and hcc approval asserting that these committees were merely advi sory bodies he later described the hcc chair as handmaiden to the controller78 71 the subject argued that the procuremen t rules were not applicable because the debt owed to uwa was not the pr oduct of contract the subject asserted that he simply approved pa yment of debt rightfully due and owing for services satisfactorily re ndered and emphatically claimed that immediate payment was the correct th ing to do morally managerially and ethically79and necessary to protect the uns reputation and prevent the accumulation of any further arrears80 therefore the subject argued that he acted within the confines of his aut hority and therefore did not violate his duties81 72 addressing the fact that the us of the uwa agreement without procurement exercise in the first instance gave rise to an ex post facto circumstance the subject blamed this result upon the requisitioners mental lapse 82 he admitted the ball had been dr opped and that one utilized the appropriate procurement process whic h had been established for such situation83 d ptf investigation and evaluation 1 the abuse of the uwa contract 73 it is undisputed that unmis staff charged fuel and services incurred during the egyptian deployment to uw and that the organisation paid uwa approximately us1376 million for these goods and services84 see attachment c 74 it is also clear that the primary purpose of the uwa agreement was to provide services to acco mmodate the travels of th srsg equally without 77 the subject interview 26 june 2006 78 the subject interview 17 august 2006 79 the subject interview 26 june 2006 80 the

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 20disagreement is the fact that the rrangement with uwa was never intended to cover costs associated with the tr ansport of the egyptian contingent and that the mission exceeded the nte amount of us45000 when it charged over us1 million in services under the agreement proper procurement exercise should have occurred absent an urgent need justifying an exception to the procurement process under the exigency situations as outlined in section 952 of the procurement manual 2 the failure to follow the necessary procurement process 75 the subject recognized that lthough procurement procedures and procurement staff were in place in th mission at the tim one followed the procedure in this circumstance clearly the subject should have been alerted to the fact that unmis needed in excess of us1million for fuel and air flight services before the missi on actually accrued these charges he certainly should have lear ned about this before th deployment not several weeks after the services were obtained 76 the procurement manual outlines th process required before the requisition of goods and servi ces which exceed certai n financial threshold proper procedure dictates that the avia tion section in the mission should have notified ps that it needed to secure cont ract for fuel and flight services for movement of the egyptian contingent recommendation would have then followed to seek competitive bidding process to identify vendor or in the alternative an amendment to the original contract with uwa to cover these services could have been explored furt her to the extent that there was an exigency ps would have been alerted early in the process and an evaluation of the claim could have occurred and the necessary procedural steps could have been followed 77 officials in unmis were aware by th end of may that the mission would be responsible for deployi ng the egyptian contingent 85 the first deployment did not occur until midjuly almost si x weeks later therefore there was time to conduct procurement exercise moreover the second deployment did not commence until the end of august almost three months later the mission therefore had several weeks if not months to make the necessary arrangements and engage in the proper procedures 78 proposed award would have in the normal course been presented to the subject as cao after the lcc made its recommendations as the amount at issue exceeded us75000 if signed and accepted the subject would have been required to forward the proposal to hcc because the value exceeded us200000 accordingly the hcc would have made the determination whether contract with uwa for th services could be pursued 85 see supra fn 54 oios procurement task force investigation report on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 2179 in this case neither the aviation section nor ps followed the proper procedure for the requisition of flight services instead unmis staff simply arranged with uwa to provide th services without commencing competitive bidding process and without obtaining the requisite approvals 3 presentation to the subject 80 although the ptf did not identify ny evidence that the subject was aware or was in any way involved in the misuse of this contract these charges were incurred by employees of the aviation section which was under his ultimate control and authority 81 the subject reasoned that controls broke down and that the expenditures incurred were not properly monitored albeit the subject cannot be faulted for each and every error committed by staff in the mission he nevertheless was responsible for confirming that cont rols were in place to prevent such occurrences while certainly there is guarantee such transgressions could be fully prevented however in light of th other issues which occurred at this time and are discussed in this report it appears that such failure was not limited to just this circumstance 4 the subjects author ity to approve payment 82 uwa was paid in excess of us1 million for the flight services provided for the egyptian troop deployment accordingly both lcc and hcc approval was required for an award of this financial magnitude as stated in the delegation of authority provided to the subject as well as financial rule10513c final action on an award was not pe rmissible without hcc approval the subject conceded th at authorization was beyond his or anybodys price signature authority86 83 nevertheless the subject unilaterally authorized payment to uwa before he received lcc and hcc approval this action is final in as much as it led to the awardamendment of cont ract with uwa the subject was aware or certainly should have been aw are that the uwa services had been obtained in violation of the financ ial and procurement rules and yet approved payment prior to the requis ite authorization from the hcc regardless of any merit to his pos ition that the amounts owed uwa were accurate and proper the subjects ilateral action exceed ed his delegated authority at the time he made the decision 86 the subject interview 26 june 2006 oios procurement task force investigation report on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 225 ex post facto present ation of the procurement failure to meet definition 84 while the need to provide fuel serv ices to support the troop deployment may certainly constitute an exigency it is difficult to conclude that the payment to uwa for the debts incurred from the use of the services also met this definition the ex post facto rules define these cases where services have already been furnished to the mission irrespective of written contract the rules do not permit payment for such services rather they address the procedure to be followed when an em ergency prevented the mission from employing formal solicitation process 85 while the rapid movement of the egyptian contingent and thus fuel and services acquired in cairo in order to deploy the troops and equipment may in fact have been truly urgent need payment to uwa was not especially in light of the organisations history of untimeliness 87 moreover any exigency was due to the aviation sections poor planning and mismanagement unmis knew as early as 25 may 2005 th at it would be responsible for the deployment as stated in the pr ocurement manual section 9522a and reiterated in the asgs september 2005 memorandum the general assembly exempted those cases that were the result of delay or omission on the part of the requisitioning office under this definition unmis may not have been able to justify the ex post facto presentation consequent ly there is reason why payment to uwa was not delayed until after the matter was properly presented to both the lcc and hcc b committee approval 86 the subject did not personally notify the chief of ps or hcc of the matter he said he never considered c ontacting hcc rather he asserted that he was more concerned with other pre ssing matters and did not consider this situation to be one of them88 87 the subjects delegation of authorit however specifically required that he or delegate promptly notify ms lute and chief of ps of any contract over us200000 even for core requirement89 written notification was required to be submitted later th an 30 days after the procurement90 certainly the subject cannot be faulted for failure to file the report within 30 days of the deployment since he did not learn of the situation until october however upon learning of the amount of the expenditure and that procurement exercise had b een initiated or otherwis contemplated he should have considered it pressing accordi ngly the subject should have promptly 87 the subject interview 17 august 2006 referring to payment of bills in the mission in angola 88 the subject interview 17 august 2006 89 delegation p 2 90 delegation p 2 oios procurement

outstanding balance and make payment to uwa the subject also declined to accept the lcc minutes wh ile such an action may have been entirely appropriate if the minutes fa iled to contain necessary information similarly consistent effort should have been pursued to ensu re that the minutes were promptly and properly correcte d and expeditiously delivered to the hcc 89 it is significant that subsequent presentation to the lcc was not made for several weeks and there is evidence that there was an effort to expedite the matter in fact at the time he was placed on special leave in january 2006 the subject still had not advanced the presentation to headquarters or more importantly notified the chief of ps vii kadugli runway lights 90 the ptfs investigation has revealed number of troubling procurement exercises during the subjects tenure as cao of unmis including the requisition for goods which were later claimed to be unnecessary some procurement exercises for air flight

interview with ptf investigators defended the requisition asserting that solar lights ma sense and would be beneficial to the mission114 he based his decision on pr esentations by his subordinates such as mr goodwin115 he believed that since kadugli was not an international airport the lights need only comply with sudanese civil regulations116 b ptf investigation 1 authority to reclassif procurement and approve contract 107 under the subjects delegation of authority as cao he needed hcc approval before unmis procured noncore items over us200000 see supra paragraph 45 et seq in order to achieve exemption from hcc approval the requisition had to be classi fied as core requirement as explained above one of the enumerated core requireme nts included building materials and refurbishment services 108 although staff member classifi ed the runway lights as refurbishment the subject as cao ga ve final approval for this action the subject admitted to ptf investigators that he did in fact authorize this reclassification and argued in his defence that the refurbishment applied to the airport in general in hi s opinion the runway lights we re merely part of this overall upgrade 117 109 the validity of reclassify ing runway lights as r efurbishment to meet the core requirement definition is dubi ous these were new lights and not an alteration to existing ones unde r this theory any and all acquisitions repairs and services of attendant goods would fall under this definition the letter and spirit of the rules do not seem to support this broad definition if the lights were not properly characteri zed as core requirements their procurement actually fell outside th subjects delegated authority consequently his unilater approval of 589000 c ontract violated the frr and delegation of authority 110 even assuming arguendo that the lights were core requirements the subject failed to comply with his dele gation of authority since the award was over us200000 the

cost 112 according to the dpko manual all runway lights must follow all icao standards solar lights for runways do not meet these standards indeed the aviation transport section at hea dquarters advised unmis on numerous occasions that solar lights were not dp ko or icao compliant the subject claimed he did not learn of the ats objections until after the fact in 2006 however new york notified unmis aviation as early as the beginning of august 2005 113 when ptf asked the subject about ic ao approval he initially asserted that it was up to the individual country to decide whether or not it would comply with the convention 118 after the ptf pointed out that sudan is signatory to the convention and therefore bound by its requirements he changed his answer he then conceded sudan would have been obligated to comply but said the sudanese do what they want 119 3 the subjects alleged lack of knowledge 114 despite his experience as an aviator the subject further professed he was not aware of the dpko or icao regulati ons this argument is untenable certainly the subject should have had constructive if not actual knowledge of these rules 4 unmis need for runway lights 115 the decision to purchase the capability for night flights is confounding in light of the fact that at the time only the sudanese military was permitted to fly from dusk to dawn all airports other than the international airport of khartoum were officially closed during th is time fact the subject conceded the sudanese government enforced this order and permission was required to be sought for an emergency inbound or outbound flights 116 in response to the fact that the danese military had not yet approved such flights the subjec t reasoned that unmis expected to use kadugli as centre hub and

the procurement was made beyond his c ontrol the witness did in fact express reservations about the use of such large and expensive aircraft but said he supported the proj ect if costeffectiveness was not an issue he added that he was never pressured by fald to obtain the mi26 any pressure for the aircraft came from the military 128 the ptf examined extensive documentation concerning the missions need for such aircraft the subject said that in 1999 dpkos logistics and communications services planning t eam identified need for heavy lift capacity the documents confirm that the military initially indicated that four mi26 helicopters were needed the military also made repeated requests for such aircraft later reduc ing its request from four to two and finally one 132 fald officials asked the mission on num erous occasions to justify the use of such costly asset133 these requests were made both prior to and during the procurement process untaet prov ided the requested justification134 129 the subject told ptf investigators th at the mission was aware of the high costs of procuring heavy lift airc raft he explained that untaet considered dropping the requirement fo r an mi26 altogether and using alternatives such as mi8 helicopters headquarters howev er stressed that mi8 aircrafts would not be able to perf orm all the specified heavy lift tasks fald clarified that under the loa with peru untaet paid only for the hours actually used as result untaet reaffirmed its view that it needed just one mi26 to accomplish its goals 130 there is doubt that the helicopter performed important albeit limited functions after it arrived in the fiel d untaet continued to use an mi26 well after the peruvian helicopter was depositioned and until the time the mission was downsized 135 the mission remained costc onscious it is evident that untaet attempted to minimize the number of flights to save money 2 the commercial bids 131 the audit review concluded there was need for an loa because commercial options were available the review found untaets bidding process flawed in as much as it showed indications that bidrigging may have occurred 132 liuga

in february 2000139 this time five bids were received again only one bid wa s ruled technically acceptable140 accordingly to the subject the second itb was comparator bid issued solely for cost comparison he said th companies in the market were likely aware of falds negotiations for an loa fald hoped vendors would reduce their prices in the second itb unfortunately this did not happen when the second round of proposals came back excessively high however fald continued to pursue the loa consequently co mmercial contract was awarded and fald entered into an loa with peru 134 the ptf does not suspect any improprie ty in the technical evaluations performed by fald staff under the subjects supervision nor has the ptf found any evidence of complicity by fald officials or the subject in any bid collusion falds arguments as to th costeffectiveness of an loa option as opposed to commercial lease ca n be viewed as justifiable 135 nevertheless the ptf concurs with the audit review that there are significant concerns of the commercial bi dding process further review is ongoing 3 the loa with peru 136 the audit review suggested number of irregularities in the negotiation process for the loa first the proce ss did not commence with an invitation from the to peru rather it orig inated when mr andrew toh chief of procurement who referred peruvian fficials to fald staff second the subject and other fald officials t with the peruvian generals and representatives of gan but did not k eep notes of their conversations the auditors believed there was high like lihood of conflict of

of meetings 138 the ptf found that the staff including the subject indeed communicated with officials from gan and peru141 for example telephone records indicate that from midfebruary forward air transport unit staff was in direct contact with the peruvian generals142 there are existing notes of these conversations the subject acknow ledged meeting with representatives from peru and gan but said he only pa rticipated in tech nical discussions he told the ptf he never discussed fi nances which he left to his direct subordinates staff member 7 chief of atu and another atu desk officer in general the subject said he relied on staff member 7 who had more experience in these matters the subject did recall discussing costs with the chief of atu as they were out of th ordinary he believed that atu was responsible for all financial negotiations at the same time the chief of atu believed that financial negotiations were being handled by senior management 143 it is not clear who if anyone took responsibility for the negotiations nevertheless the ptf di d not find evidence that supported finding that failure to keep records of conversations necessarily indicated fraud c knowledge of presidential decreealleged fraudulent scheme 139 in late 2000 peruvian newspaper ar ticles reported that the peruvian authorities alleged fraudul ent scheme on the part of the peruvian generals to

peruvian generals involved sent vi facsimile copy of the decree to fald145 this version however was re dacted and there was price information included the first confirmed date that the subject saw copy of the unredacted presidential decree which included the us24 million price was in late 2000 when it was reprinted in peruvian newspaper articles the subject said the price of us24 million in his view an unrealistic amount was never the part of formal offer to the the subject believes it was part of secret agreement among the peruvian generals 146 4 payment arrangem ents under the loa 142 the subject told ptf investigators that atu staff informed him during the negotiations that the peruvian ge nerals requested payment be made directly to gan the subject said he ma it very clear to atu staff that the could only make payment to the government of peru and not to thirdparty 143 when the first invoices arrived reques ting payment be made directly to swiss bank account owned by gan offi cials in dpkofmss noted this anomaly and refused to pay into this account the or ganisation properly insisted on paying the government of peru and issued the cheque accordingly 5 links between gan and skylink 144 the ptf has found evidence to suggest that fald officials made any effort to verify gans bona fides or its ability to provide the services described by the peruvians when stioned the subject explained that fald saw perus use of gan as stati on manager to be an internal matter for peru and not an issue for the orga nisation yet he acknowledged that neither the organisation nor fald st aff were familiar with gan or its employees 145 the ptf has established that for all intents and purposes gan was in fact an existing vendor namely skylink for example during the relevant time period gan used the same office address and facsimile number as skylink similarly certain senior officers directed both companies 147 skylink represented or acted on behalf of at least two of the

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 37146 the subject told ptf that he was not aware of an connection between the two at the time they were negotia ting the loa or the memorandum of understanding he asserted the firs t time he learned of possible link between gan and skylink was in ugust 2000 at that time oios investigators had been examining the positioning costs of the project they informed the subject and fald offici als that gan representative had worked previously for skylink the connection was confirmed in february 2001 when the subject attended meeting with skylink one of its representatives complained about the oios investigation into positioning costs for the helicopter 147 moreover records reflect that in the summer of 2000 fald staff sent facsimiles to skylinks main number 148 this is particularly troublesome in light of the fact that the organisation did not have an exis ting contract with skylink such evidence though circumstan tial is highly suspicious at least by early april 2000 these commonalitie s should have alerted someone in fald that there may be connection between these two companies 148 fald staff was under instru ctions to avoid the ppearance of prejudice against skylink following previous ar bitration ruling resulting in an award in skylinks favour nonetheless the s ubject said if he or fald had known about the relationship between these comp anies they would have been more cautious fald staff apparently was very sensitive to any involvement of skylink because of its history of contr oversial dealings this fact alone may not have prevented dpko from entering into the loa but staff would have been more alert and doubly careful 149 6 waste of funds 149 in sum the audit review concluded that dpko squandered us59 million in funds the full amount the paid for the mi26 its conclusion appears to be based on prior determina tion that the mission did not need the helicopter 150 the ptf does not agree with the audit reviews conclusion as explained above untaet identified justif iable in this regard need for the helicopter this need was properly documented and appears to have been made in good faith 151 similarly the evidence appears to support falds decision to use an loa in light of the overall savings thr ough an loa the peruvian generals quoted us19 million for positioning and depositioning costs 150 while the initial estimated positioning costs r ecorded in the atu requisition was us450000 the seven commercial bids received quoted

this issue with lt general salazarmonroe at the mission and he confirmed the costs were indeed as reflected in the invoices154 154 when asked about the high positioni ngdepositioning costs for the loa the subject said that the commercial market had been behaving unpredictably at this time for example he reas oned that two commer cial bidders who responded to both itbs quoted entirely di fferent positioning costs in each of its submissions the subject said they ultimately decided to pursue the loa despite the high positioning costs because overall it was the best value since the mission paid only for the hours the mi26 flew and not set figure each month the loa provided the most costeffective means to procure the aircraft the ptf does not ta ke issue with this view ix sudan mission

vendor to the organisation and began supplying air transport services to missions in 1989 during the 1990s skylink was suspended twice from the vendor list following various allegations that it had manipulated the bidding process and acted improperly in the execution of various contract s this suspension in 1993 led ultimately to an arbitration pr oceeding between the organisation and skylink 159 in early 2000 skylink retu rned to the vendor rost er in good standing in more recent years the company dive rsified its offering and responded to solicitations from the organisation for wi

160 in the autumn of 2003 subsequent to promising developments in the negotiations for the propos ed mission ps and dpko be gan preparations for peacekeeping mission in sudan158 crucial component in establishing the mission was to organize the supply and distribution of fuel for military operations and the civilian administrati on significant quanti ties of fuel were required to operate aircraft and vehi cles and provide electricity for the generators the supply section at dpko handled the requisition of the contract while ps at unhq handled the pr ocurement exercise this complex logistics contract was one of the largest for the mission in sudan and the missions entire operation depended on an efficient and comprehensive supply chain 161 in december 2003 mr philip taylorson of dpkos supply section produced fuel report which contained basic fuel management plan for the proposed mission mr taylorson had visi ted sudan in the preceding weeks to assess the fuel and relevant logistical infrastructure after the visit mr taylorson estimated that the initial requirement for the mission would be approximately 65 million litres of fuel per month 162 as result in january 2004 ps issued an rfp for shortterm fuel contract for seven locations in various regions in sudan excluding darfur the rfp expected the mission would consume 6495445 litres of fuel diesel and jet fuel combined monthly 159 figure taken from mr taylorsons report160 the calculation relied heavily on the logistics routes mapped the type and size of military units envisaged the number and type of vehicles and aircraft and the locations specified in the plan three vendors responded including skylink which ultimately won the award 2 fuel assessment changes during 2004 163 the however did not immediatel execute contract with skylink because the peace process was not proceeding as quickly as the had originally believed until peace agr eement was signed security council resolution and hence deployment could follow thus throughout 2004 there was considerable uncertainty within lsddpko regarding the deployment plans and fuel consumption needs of the mission various plans were considered involvi ng different supply routes 161 but new detailed calculations were completed until at least august 2004 furthermore the 158 security counsel presidentia l statement 10 october 2003 159 rfps 600

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 41advance mission was without fuel expert and hence inhouse capacity to calculate fuel requirements the missi on therefore had to rely on the supply section at unhq and specifically mr taylorson in midaugust 2004 however staff member 8 arrived in khar toum to serve as the fuel officer 164 thereafter the mission sh ared responsibil ity with the supply section at unhq for fuel planning staff member 8 obtained the latest logistics planning data from other units at the mission and calculated fuel consumption estimates162 however according to staff member 8 he did not complete any new calculations until midseptember 2004163 upon completion staff member 8 passed on the revised figur to mr taylorson who made adjustments based on his own research and consultation with units of dpko at unhq 165 between early september 2004 and in the first week of december 2004 various iterations of the fuel consum ption and cost estimates were produced both by staff member 8 and by mr tayl orson until the investigation is complete the ptf cannot form d ecided view on whether the various increases in fuel requirements were gitimate and what role the subject played in those increases it shall be noted that the investigation into these issues concerning fuel contract is ongoing 166 the ptf has ascertained that the s ubject was not vested with primary responsibility for fuel pl anning it was lsdsss that requisitioned the fuel and planned for its consumption however the subjectboth as chief logops and as the cao of the missi ondid participate directly in the logistical planning that impacted direc tly on the scale and scope of the short term fuel contract for sudan furthermor he participated in discussions with dpko concerning whether the procurement action begun in january 2004 should be suspended cancelled or conti nued and was frequently informed of the progress of the procurement action the ptf will defer its determination of the subjects role in this matter til it reaches conclusion as to whether the increases in fuel consumption estimates were justifiable and reasonable one other matter however is more problematic c inflation of nte amount in december 2004 1 nte amount calculatio ns dated 3 december 2004 167 on 15 november 2004 in response

the incr ease from the previous nte amount was due to incorporation of the latest fi gures from sudan arrived over weekend and requesting him to confirm the figures by return fax171 169 in fact ptfs interviews with relevant staff members as well as review of relevant documents show that the substantial increase in fuel cost in the 8th and 9th month of the cont ract ie phase 4 was due to

following threemonth nego tiation and contract drafting period the and skylink signed contract for provision of fuel support services to unmis for us85907554 which was about us225 million higher than it should have been as it erroneously included fuel estimates for the family 172 the review of the updated nte amount authorized by the subject on 7 december 2004 was deficient and cause of the us225 million overinflation of the nte for the shortterm fuel contract as conceded by staff member 8 the increase of fuel consumption in phase 4 was principally the result of the erroneous in clusion of the wfp figures 184 the subjects approval of the two nte amounts contai ning significant pr ice differences occurred within few days of each other the subject should have questioned the substantial difference in the figures 185 it cannot be said that us225 million discrepancy was minor issue similarly the subject was aware that mr najeeb was new staff member at the mission with lack of necessary

on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 45173 it is evident that the contract be tween the and skylink provided that payments were to be made against s kylinks actual invoices and that the organisation did not guarantee paym ent for the entire nte amounts186 however the erroneous inclusion of wfp figures into nte calculations had potentially negative consequences for the organisation as was emphasized in the audit review projected budget in flation created risks one of which was that skylink could claim loss of significant revenue at the expiration of the contract period if such sums had yet to be paid in full irrespective of the incursion of actual costs187 in fact this concern came to fruition in this case as skylink ultimately did claim substantia l financial losses in the amount of us105 million directly relying on the nte amounts188 the ptf continues to examine the potentially negative implications of the overestimation of the nte amount for the shortterm fuel contract 174 the ptf further continues to examine the conduct of at least two staff members who appear to have been awar of the unsubstantiated increase in the fuel assessment as early as janu ary 2005 about three months before the contract was signed whether or not th inclusion of the estimates into final nte calculations was negligent or the product of intentional malfeasance continues to be subject of further examination by the ptf d alleged collusion with skylink 175 the audit review expressed cern that favouritism on behalf of skylink existed in the contract proc urement process concern which the ptf also shares after considerable i ndependent examination while the ptf continues to investigate this matter the ptf has not identified evidence that the subject participated in any such effort 176 the following facts are relevant in reaching this assessment on 20 july 2004 the subject attended an internal meeting to discuss inter alia the fuel requirement contract at this meetin g mr maxwell kerley deputy director dpkolsd served as the chairperson nd the participants discussed the fact that skylink was the sole vendor to have been found technically compliant shortly following this meeting the fuel requirements were raised these events gave rise to

subject acknowledged that such discussion about skylink did occur the information that skylink wa s the sole bidder however had been common knowledge within both dpko nd the mission itself for months therefore this fact was secret as well this information had been transmitted in the course of normal communications between staff most closely responsible for planning the fuel contract the subject told the ptf that he had received memoranda to this effect and that he had engaged in conversations with others about this issu as early as the d of march or the beginning of april 2004189 178 the ptf has not identified evidence th at the subject participated in any effort to purposefully favour skylink in the process nor has any evidence been adduced that the subj ect received tangible or intangible benefit from skylink to the contrary in the mmer of 2004 the subject alone voiced his concerns to dpko colleagues in awarding turnkey contract to skylink190 and initiated an internal debate about seeking alternative means of fuel supply the subject further emphasi zed that he called for cancellation of the bidding exercise when he thought that there had been significant change in the mission fuel requirements an assertion the ptf has confirmed as accurate 179 furthermore the ptf has not iden tified evidence of improper contact between the subject and skylink duri ng the procurement process the review of telephone and other data reco rds do not reflect evidence to the contrary x sudan food rations contract 180 in 2005 eurest support services cypr us international limited ess was selected to provide food rations to unmis ultimately the provision of these services and attendant costs exceeded us201 million191 this section of the report addresses this award in so far as it concerns the subjects role in exercising overall responsibility for managing it the investigation of the provision of goods and rvices by ess to the or ganisation which was provided in the absence of signed and executed contract continues to be matter of ongoing investigation 181 first the interaction between the organisation and ess was complicated by the lack of formal contract with

background at the incep tion of the missions formation the organisation required mechanism to supply food rations and associated services to the troops as result on 31 december 2004 ess was selected to supply food rations to the mission in sudan the proposed contract was for term five years and its va lue with an nte of us20156010480192 t h t same day ps forwarded letter of awa rd to both ess and the mission which authorized ess to begin immediate mobilization and identified the subject as the contact person in the mission 193 although the letter of award had been issued the organisation and ess did not execute written contract while the letter of award advised that draf t contract could be expected by third week of january 2005 such document was never prepared by that time194 in fact contract had yet to be exec uted when ess was suspended from the organisations vendor roster in october 2005195 183 because of the imminent arrival of the troop contingent the mission was placed in position in which it was for ced to utilize ess to provide rations and related services despite the lack of formal contract the mission cannot be faulted for the existence of such circumstance and blame cannot be placed upon them for the use of ess rvices notwithstanding the lack of formal agreement such services were vital and urgent therefore goods and services were provided by ess pursu ant to the letter of award which failed to include precise terms for pricing as well as other important matters the subject offered that he believ ed the letter of award constituted sufficiently binding commercial re lationship between the and ess notwithstanding the lack of formal c ontract nevertheless based on the letter of award ess commenced mobilization with the consent of the organisation and the mission placed co rresponding orders for food rations 196 184 in the period between april and december 2005 number of problems arose in the provision of these rati ons first mr terrence allen the missions food rations officer unilatera lly agreed with ess on pricing list for commodities which fell outside the ra tion scale and was contrary to food management guidelines197 second mr allen ordered rations for contingent of 10000 troops despite the fact that the actual troop strength was only 7000198 further mr allen agreed to accep t and pay for stock that had 192 hcc minutes of special

allen asserted that the contract was not for obedience but only guide and that his actions were justifie d difficult position to understand 200 nonetheless mr allen engaged in these activities in the absence of clear instructions from supervisors 201 185 unmis continued to engage ess services and accept ess goods throughout 2005 notwithstanding the lack of formal contract throughout much of this time the subject failed as cao of the mission to issue directions to his staff regarding th manner in which the mission should conduct its business with ess and the procedure to be followed in effect there was lack of guidance provided concerning the missions interaction with ess the lack of which carried pote ntial financial implications and risks 186 ultimately in december 2005 the subject issued memorandum outlining the scope of work for the c ontracts management unit cmu unit charged with monitoring contract imp lementation in the memorandum the subject finally set forth guidelines fo r the management of the food rations and related responsibilities 202 however this effort was made only upon learning of mr allens actions includi ng his unilateral agreement with ess of pricing list for commodities which fe ll outside the ration scale shortly thereafter mr allen left the organisation203 187 by january 2006 unmis had expended more than us4662223 for food rations in the absen ce of formal contract 188 in the estimation of the ptf the or ganisation faced poten tial risks as result of operating without formal c ontract and suffering from lack of direction the food rations contract represents an additional example of an apparent deficiency of internal controls and resulting circumstance of management and financial risks the issue of whether the organisation suffered any actual loss as result of th actions is subject of continuing examination by the ptf notwithstanding such actual loss the potential was certainly present 199 essunamis mobilization report 16 february 2005 200

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 49xi ptf findings uwa 189 the investigation has dem onstrated that notwithsta nding the fact that the subject was signatory on behalf of the organisation to the uwa agreement to provide fuel to the aircraft utilize d by the srsg the investigation has not identified evidence that the subject was aware of the use of the contract by personnel in the aviation section to obtai n fuel services for the deployment of troops from cairo to sudan until after the services were rendered however the subject should have had an awarene ss of the manner in which the mission was going to secure such services as he was vested with final procurement authority when the subject learned that the organisation had incurred an outstanding balance of just under us1m illion for this service he granted approval to pay the balance and subs equently ordered the matter to be presented to the lcc ultimately the organisation paid in excess of us13 million for these services the authorization of these payments by the subject contravened financial rule 10513 in as much as it exceeded his delegated financial authority and this financial rule 190 further the subjects argument that procurement exercise was not triggered because the outstanding ba lance constituted debt by the organisation to uwa rather than bi nding contract lacks merit had proper procedures been followed requisi tion would have been raised procurement initiated and contract signed or in the alternative an amendment to the ex isting uwa contract could have been sought with the advice and consent of the pr ocurement service in either event procurement exercise was necessary the lack of written contract for the provision of these precise services prior to fuel be ing obtained is of legal or practical moment certainly there was reliance upon and an expectation pursuant to written agreement in the first instance between the organisation and uwa for the provision of distinct fuel servi ces belief by the parties that the subsequent fuel services were obt ained and provided under the existing agreement and constituted in effect an amendment to the contract resulted in the ability of the organisation to acquire fuel services which were ordered by an authorized representative of the or ganisation thus it can reasonably be said that the fuel services were obtained in reliance upon the existing agreement with uwa to provi such services to the organisation albeit for separate and distinct purpose in eff ect the incursion of the debt and the payment of it was affirmation of an oral agreement between the parties 191 further the incursion of the expense prior to the presentation of the matter to the lcc and hcc triggered the ex post facto provisions of the procurement rules under these rules matters of presentation to the hcc after service to the organisation had been provided should occur in only exceptional circumstances and not as result of managerial shortcoming by the oios procurement task force investigation report on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 50subjects own admission the circumstan ce arose because of such mental lapse of the requisitioner such mental lapse is difficult to accept and does not excuse accountability the mission is the requisitioner an entity over which the subject serves as the head of its administration 192 the presentation of the matter to the lcc was delayed several months in part as result of the subjects re fusal to sign and accept the meeting minutes of the lcc because of perceive d corrections which were required to be made the matter was first presen ted on 25 october 2005 and again on 20 november 2005 without formal notifi cation to ps and the hcc that such debt had been incurred and that more than 13million was expended without procurement exercise regardless of any precise requirement to notify the hcc of the incursion of the debt and its payment the spirit of the procurement and financial rules dictat ed that ps and the hcc should have been informed in some manner early in the processa nd certainly after knowledge of the debt wa s identified by senior management when the subject as cao authorized payment of the debt he thereafter assumed even greater responsibility that the process follow the proper procedure and that prompt notifications of the debt be made to ps the hcc and relevant officials at headquarters certainly the need to achieve accuracy of the minutes is of paramount importance however th sluggishness with which the minutes were sought to be correct ed becomes proble matic because it constituted an additional delay in the pr esentation of the matter to the hcc 193 the ptf does not pass upon th issue of whether the need to obtain such fuel services constituted an exigent circ umstance in the first instance it may well have however this fact which is well appreci ated by the ptf is not particularly relevant to the analysis here it is the subseq uent payment of the debt and not the incursion of the debt in the first instance that is at issue therefore while the investigation has not revealed evidence that the subject caused the use of the uwa contract for air transport of troops he failed to properly address the situation notwithst anding his belief that the debt was validly incurred and payment was rightfully due and owing the subject made this determination himself without consultation with the lcc and the hcc such unilateral action is violative of the letter and spir it of the relevant rules certainly the subject may have been ultimately prov accurate that the debt was validly incu rred however this independe nt decision unilaterally deprived the process from taking its prope r course in taking such action the subject deprived the relevant bodies in the organisation including the ps the lcc and the hcc of participating in the proc ess and appropriately passing upon whether the services were adequately rendered the debts validly incurred and payment properly made 194 lastly despite the subjects claims to the contrary it is evident that proper controls were not sufficiently put in place to safeguard against this divergence from appropriate and required procedure full effort should have oios procurement task force investigation report on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 51been made to identify ll those responsible for th requisitioners lapse including those individuals who communicated directly with uwa further there should have been appropriat reinforcement of the need for adherence to the financial and procurement rules and cautioned about potentially severe implications of failure to follow them b kadugli lights 195 the procurement process for the runw ay lights at kadugli airport in khartoum was flawed as result of the ac tivities of an offi cial in the aviation unit and procurement officer the subj ect did not have initial involvement in the procurement exercise and claims he was not aware of such misconduct in the normal course however the subject learned of the procurement when subordinate informed him of the prospective purchase to facilitate flights during evening hours practic at the time forbidden by the local authorities the subject an expert in aviation matters nevertheless approved the purchase notwithstanding the fact that the technology did not meet the approval of the regulatory body reco gnized by the orga nisation icao and that the sudanese government had yet to approve night flights in light of the subjects professed authority in aviati on matters his argument that he was unaware of the icao standard and the fact that the local sudanese civil aviation authority approved temporary use of this technology is unavailing as cao of the mission and staff member the subject certainly should have known of the propriety of the use of such technology and the validity of the purchase unde r existing guidelines of th organisation prior to the expenditure of the funds c mi26 helicopter 196 the ptf has examined the decision ma king process to secu re the use of heavy lift helicopter in untaet evidence was presented that officials believed there was need for such services by the orga nisation and the legitimacy of the need was identified after inquiry by officials of fald however there was some disa greement on this issue and at least one official voiced contrary view the ptf does not reach this issue in this report as it is not dispositive of the issues concerning the subj ect after the decision was made to secure such services the mission in go od faith believed the use of letter of assist loa was in the organisations best interests decision which the investigation has re vealed was made in good faith 197 however the investigati on has identified that scheme existed between peruvian officials and others to obtain monies from the organisation in return for the provision of the helicopter it was then evident that third party global aviation network gan maintain ed role in th transaction and provision of these services and that certain officials purporting to act on behalf of the peruvian government requested that the organisation make oios procurement task force investigation report on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 52payment to swiss bank account c ontrolled by gan in late 2000 press accounts of purported scandal involvi ng the peruvian officials were published in various newspapers the subject acknowledged he was aware of these press reports on its face and in light of these facts the role of gan appeared dubious at the time the natu re and extent of the involvement of gan and skylink in this ma tter should have been more closely scrutinized by fald officials and the subject i nquiry should have been made or caused to have been made of the per uvians andor gan officials about the precise nature of the involvement of the officials of skylink while fald officials cannot be faulted for failing to uncover the scheme identification of the motivating forces behind this trans action during the initial negotiations of this matter may have led to further sc rutiny of the circumstances surrounding the loa and aided any bsequent inquiry further efforts in this regard should have been made 198 the ptf has not identified evidence that the subject or other fald officials were party to the scheme or had any know ledge of it prior to its publication in the press d sudan shortterm fuel contract 199 ptf has initiated broad review of the assessments for the provision of fuel for unmis including the increase in the projected requirements and the corresponding increase in the estimati on of costs associated with such anticipated fuel increases the ptf s investigation of the circumstances surrounding the increase in fuel cons umption and relatedly whether there was any improper concerted effort to purposefully inflate such figures is ongoing the ptf has also examined whet her the subject participated in any effort to favour the vendor skylink in the procurement process 200 the ptfs investigation has not identified evidence that the subject was involved in the initial fuel assessments and calculations or in the technical evaluation of the proposals submitted by vendors thereafter the mission made decision to increase the fuel requirements in 2004 circumstance which continues to be investigated by th ptf the ptf continues to explore whether the decision to elevate these estimates involved any nefarious behaviour of staff 201 the ptf has not identified evidence th at the subject colluded with other staff members at unmis dpko or ps to award the contract for the provision of fuel in unmis to skylink the ptf does not address in this report the broader question whether in fact such collusion existed as it is unnecessary to reach such determination in this report this allegation continues to be matter under investigation by the ptf 202 the ptf finds that the revised nte for the short term fuel contract which increased the fuel costs by approxima tely us225 million approved by the oios procurement task force investigation report on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 53subject was unjustified the increase improperly and inaccurately included estimates for the family which principally consisted of wfp the ptf further finds that the subject was aware of the proposed increase was presented with the figures on 6 cember 2004 and approved the revised calculations without ensuri ng an appropriate review of the figures by the missions staff the subject had been pr esented with two sets of calculations which reflected an unsubstantiated di fference of more than us225 million in fuel costs for phase 4 of the deployment the risk to the organisation from an inflated nte amount was potentially profound for it allowed an opportunity for the vendor to eventually claim loss of revenue at the end of the contract period indeed skylink ultimately claimed losses of more than us10 million relying in part on the nte figure 203 the ptf has not identified any eviden ce of improper contacts between the subject and any representatives of s kylink furthermore the ptf has not identified evidence that the subject r eceived ant tangible or intangible benefit from skylink in connection with the matters it has examined sudan food rations contract 204 the vendor ess supplied food rations to the mission in the absence of written contract throughout 2005 fault fo r the absence of formal agreement does not lie with the mission or the s ubject the mission was placed in circumstance in which it was required to urgently obtain critical goods to feed troops as such th mission utilized ess to obtain such goods notwithstanding the lack of formal ag reement the missions food rations officer mr terry allen maintained prin cipal responsibility to interact with ess without ample supervision the investigation has revealed issues and potential risks flowing from this circumstance in which staff member acted unilaterally with vendor in circumstance where the organisation was spending significant sums of money th is situation provides an additional example of lack of managerial oversight and the failure to ensure that proper controls were in place which in and of itself may be less noteworthy however in light of the totality of the circumstances and the other matters set forth herein such derelict ion becomes more significant xi conclusion 205 the ptf is not unmindful of the challenges faced at the inception of any mission and the difficult environment which was pres ented in sudan in this case in particular while certain failures could reasonably be expected to occur in these circumstan ces this reality does not translate into corresponding lessening of expectations of senior management and most importantly the subject who served as the missions chief administrative official to appropriately re spond to such failures ta ke appropriate corrective action establish prop er controls and engage in best efforts to ensure that all oios procurement task force investigation report on the subject redacted and strictly confidential _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 54staff comply to the greatest extent with the letter and spirit of the relevant procurement and financial rules 206 it is evident that certain transgression s were presented to the subject after they had materialize d and that the subject was forc ed to react to situation in which rules andor policies were already ignored nevertheless as the missions cao it was incumbent upon th subject to establish controls to avoid future reoccurrences create an environment mindful of the need to adhere to the organisations financia l and procurement rules and operate within existing rules himselfsetting an appropriate example in sum there must be cumulative effect when findings intimate similar conduct namely lack of managerial oversight and the lack of proper cont rols to secure adherence to these rules 207 the aviation section in unmis was the unit which presented the most problems and suffered from the greatest number of allegations of violations of the procurement and financial rules the failures identified in this section are of greater concern to the extent th at the subject was experienced in this field and maintained selfprofessed intere st in the activities of this section xii recommendations 208 the ptf recommends that considera tion be given by the organisation whether the failings identified above warrant sanction and in particular whether the lack of application of the financial rules warrant personal accountability oios procurement task force
