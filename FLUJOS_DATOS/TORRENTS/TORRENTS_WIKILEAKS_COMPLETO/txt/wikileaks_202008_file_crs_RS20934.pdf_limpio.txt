august 14 2002 by the partment of health and human services hhs1 issuance of the modified privacy rule by the bush administration is the culmination of decades long debate over access to medical records that has pitted privacy advocates and civil libertarians against employers and much of the health care industry as required by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa privacy rule was issued in december 2000 and modified august 2002 the privacy rule went into effect april 14 2001 with compliance required by april 2003 for most entities2 the hipaa privacy rule establishes set of basic consumer protections and seri of regulatory permissions for uses and disclosures of protected health information s 16 introduced in the 108th congress by senator daschle would reverse some modifications to the rule this report will be updated background in recent years our society has come to rely increasingly on medical information to perform basic functions nd to make decisions about individuals however number of fundament developments have thr eatened the confidentiality of healthcare information and are the cause of great deal of concern the emergence of thirdparty payment plans the use of h ealthcare information for nonhealth care purposes the growing involvement of governme nt agencies in virtually all aspects of health care and the exponential increase in the use of computers and automated information systems for health record information have combined to put substantial pressure on traditional confidentiality protections in addition an increasing number of parties involved in health car treatment payment and ove rsight have routine access to personally identifiable health records gr eater utilization of healthcare informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20934crs2 3 westin computers health records and citizens rights 60 1976 4 see httpwwwhealthprivacyorg infourl_nocat2304infourl_nocathtmcoupled with inadequate c onfidentiality protections has increased the potential for unauthorized uses and disclosu res of medical information the disclosure of personally identifiable healthcare information can pr ofoundly affect peoples lives it affects decisions on whether they are hired or fired whether they can secure business licenses and life insurance whether they are permitted to drive cars whether they are placed under police surveillance or labeled security risk or even whether they can get nominated for and elected to political office3 other secondary uses of healthcare information such as the use of genetic test results for employment and insurance purposes have the potential to result in harm to the healthcare subject if the information is disclosed for unauthorized purposes these factors accentuat the need for strong legal safeguards medical privacy laws the confidentiality of healthcare information is governed by various federal state and cal statutes ordinances regulations and case law also applicable are private accreditation standards such as those of the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organi zations internal policies of particular institutions and ethical guidelines of profe ssional organizations prior to the issuance of the hipaa privacy rule federal laws did not address the confidentiality of healthcare information collected and maintained by the private sector ie doctors hospitals health plans health insurers and other healthcare related entities major impetus for the enactment of hipaas privacy requirement was the absence of comprehensive federal law that protected the confidentiality of patient records in all settings another impetus for the enactment of hipaa was the lack of uniformity among the states in their treatment of the confid entiality of healthcare information there was substantial variation between the states on ma ny aspects of medical records law these differences are becoming much more criti cal in the collection maintenance and disclosure of healthcare information as it is transmitted through interstate commerce amongst patients physicians healthcare facilities employers government agencies and insurers located in different states and subject to different laws to address this disparity hipaa provides that state law except for certa in specified laws concerning public health surveillance and state laws that are more stringent is preempted by the federal privacy rule compendium of state laws issued july 20 1999 and november 2002 by georgetown universitys health privacy project the state of health privacy an uneven terrain identifies medical records privacy provisions from state legislative codes the report covers only state statutes nd divides them by patient access restrictions on disclosure privilege and condition specific requirements4 hipaa several comprehensive medical records confidentiality bills were introduced during the past decade with the end result being passage of the medical privacy requirements as part of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa the health insuran ce portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pub l 104 191
