decades has led to an equally long still unresolved debate over their effect on the labor market outcomes of nativeborn workers economic theory posits that an increase in the supply of labor such as from immigration will reduce the wages and employment of nativeborn workers studies utiliz ing two approaches to test the theory have produced conflicting results with differing implications for public policy the concentration of foreignborn workers in certain cities and skill groups led some economists to posit that immigrations greatest impact would be felt by similarly skilled nativeborn workers living in those areas studies thus have compared differences in labor market outcomes between nativeborn workers who live in high versus wimmigrant areas and who most often compete for jobs with foreignborn workers given the composition of the recent immigrant flow these would be lowskilled us workers most interarea analyses have found scant evidence that foreignborn labor adversely affects the labor market prospects of us workers in general few interarea studies have estimated slight negative impact on lowskilled nativeswho represent small share of total us employment other economists have argued that the interarea approach underestimates immigrations consequences because it assumes that labor capital and goods do not rapidly adjust to the immigrationinduced in crease in the supply of labor if for example nativeborn competitors quickly decide to leav highimmigrant areas their movements would spread any employment and wage effects due to immigration across the nation and thereby make it difficult for spatially based research to detect any impact some analysts therefore have concluded that immigrations labor market effects can best be identified by examining data at the national level the economywide approach is not without its limitations however the relationship between internal labor migration and immigration remains unsettled as well many national studies have estimated that immigration given its composition in recent decades especially hurts the labor market opportunities of lowskilled us workers if policy goal is to improve the prospects of us workers who have not graduated from high school then changing the skill composition of legal immigrants and reducing the flow of unauthorized aliens might be fruitful courses of action according to this research however some of the analyses that have focused on highskilled workers in particular eg those in computer science and engineering fields as well as an economywide study that has examined workers at various education experience levels estimated that an increase in foreign labor adversely affects comparably skilled nativeborn workers thus shifting the immigrant supply toward higher skilled workers might not only harm this nativeborn skill group but also undercut the most oftenrecommended means of ameliorating immigrations impact on lowskilled us workers namely pursuing additional education but unlike these studies another analysis that built upon the economywide approach estimated that immigration has not reduced the wages of nativeborn workers with more education and experience

has been contentious issue since the nations inception during periods of substantial immigration it has not been unusual for the nativeborn population to raise objections on many groundscultural religious ethnic and economic the focus of the latest national debate over high levels of immigration is largely on its economic effects that is whether immigration provides net economic benefits to society the current debate has been concerned with the impact of immigration on the public budget and the private economy in terms of budgetary effects the question is whether immigrants receive more in public services than they pay in taxes immigrants also affect the private economy in their capacity as workers if the admission of foreignborn workers lowers wages which in turn results in more goods being produced at lower prices then us consumers would benefit if immigration results in lower wages then us workers would be harmed the debate over immigration policy has been devoted more to the wellbeing of us workers than to consumer welfare regardless of which private economic effect is of interest the impact of immigration on natives labor market outcomes must be estimated to ascertain whether foreignborn workers confer net economic benefits on society the report opens with discussion of how to analyze the impact of immigrants on the pay and job opportunities of nativeborn workers it then uses this framework to examine and interpret the empirical literature on the subject the report concludes with discussion of policy implications

amount of labor that workers are willing to supply to employers is represented by the curve labeled s 1 in figure 1 the supply curve is upward sloping because workers are willing to offer more labor eg work more hours in response to higher real wages employers demand for labor is represented by the curve labeled d which slopes downward because each worker that is hired contributes less to the firms revenues than the prior worker firm stops hiring workers when the last employee added to the payroll contributes as much to revenues as the wage the employee is willing to accept this is represented by point with total preimmigration employment equal to 1 and natives real wage equal to w 1

the supply of f or eignborn w ork ers the increase in the supply of labor due to the addition of foreignborn workers is represented by s2 at any given wage rate more workers now are willing to offer their services to employers because the contribution of the last worker hired 1 to the firms revenues is greater than his asking wage w which is lower than the preimmigration wage w 1 the firm is willing to expand employment beyond 1 the firm once again continues to add workers to the payroll until the contribution of the last employee hired is just equal to the wage the employee is willing to accept this is represented by point b with total postimmigration employment equal to 2 and the wage rate of native and foreignborn workers equal to w 2 in summary supplyanddemand theory predicts that the real wage rate for all workers will fall from w 1 to w 2 after the entrance of immigrants to the us labor market in the process total us employment expands from 1 to 2 nativeborn employment contracts from 1 to 3 and foreignborn employment increases from zero to 2 minus 3 g6g146g156g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 in this manner immigration is expected to redistribute national employment because the lower postimmigration wage w 2 makes work less rewarding some nativeborn workers will find other activities more attractive as consequence they leave the labor force and employment among the nativeborn population as noted above declines from 1 to 3 the initial employment of foreignborn workers 2 minus 1 expands as they assume portion of the jobs formerly held by nativeborn workers 1 minus 3 the latter has been referred to as the displacement effect the actual size of the displacement as well as the wage effect will depend upon how sensitive labor demand and domestic labor supply are to change in the wage rate1 in addition to reallocating national employment immigration also is expected to redistribute national income by reducing the amount that accrues to nativeborn workers and increasing the 1 this sensitivity is depicted graphically by the steepness of the supply or demand curves slope the steeper more inelastic the slope the less the supply of or demand for labor changes for given change in the wage rate the flatter more elastic the slope the more supply or demand changes for given change in the wage rate

the difference between the pre and postimmigration wages of nativeborn workers is not lost to the economy but is instead reallocated part of the wages that previously went to nativeborn workers w 1acw

homogenous and that immigrants are perfectly interchangeable with all nativeborn workers depending upon the socioeconomic characteristics of foreignborn workers however their effect on different groups of nativeborn workers could vary3 if immigrants are close substitutes for subset of nativeborn workersthe less skilled for examplethen only this groups wages or employment prospects might be depressed in the manner shown in figure 1 alternatively the demand for and returns to those production factors that complement immigrants skills might rise as result of the increase in immigrant employment eg capital and skilled nativeborn labor thus the skill composition of foreignborn visavis nativeborn workers is expected to influence which nativeborn workers labor market outcomes might benefit from or be harmed by an expansion of immigration the model also assumes that in the short run 4 immigration affects labor supply but not labor demand however by doing such things as investing financial capital they might have brought with them using their human capital eg entrepreneurial or innovative abilities or purchasing usproduced goods and services immigrants may well expand aggregate output and increase labor demand beyond their own employment 5 if immigration were to raise the demand for labor in the us economy which would be represented by rightward shift of the demand curve in figure 1 it would mitigate its potentially adverse consequences for nativeborn workers in addition the model does not take into accoun t longrun adjustments that nativeborn workers might make in response to immigration it assumes that the quantity and quality of nativeborn workers do not change after an inflow of immigrants if some nativeborn workers perceive that their labor market prospects have changed for the worse however they might invest in their own 2 george j borjas the economic benefits from immigration working paper 4955 national bureau of economic research cambridge

raise their productivity in their current jobs or it could cause them to change occupations the wage prospects of nativeborn workers who increased their human capital investment would thus tend to risethereby offsetting any initial adverse effects of immigrationand to equalize the net gain for all nativeborn labor force participants nativeborn workers also can make longrun adjustments to immigration by moving across local economies factors of productionboth labor and capitalare geographically mobile and they like goods can flow between areas thereby linkin g seemingly unconnected local markets if for example some nativeborn workers who are close substitutes for immigrants saw their wage or job prospects being eroded they might migrate to areas with fewer competitors and better opportunities nativeborn substitutes who are re siding elsewhere might avoid highimmigrant communities as well similarly firms that rely heavily on lessskilled workers might have an incentive to open plants in highimmigrant communities if their labor costs would be lower and their profits higher than expanding in their current locations thereby suppressing job opportunities in the communities where the existing plants are located7 over some period then these movements of labor capital and goods could spread immigrations labor market impacts from highimmigrant areas to the rest of the country g25g145g138g157g561g6g152g142g156g561g157g145g142g561g7g150g153g146g155g146g140g138g149g561g14g146g157g142g155g138g157g158g155g142g561g10g138g159g142g561g157g152g561g21g138g162g501g561 does the theory sketched in figure 1 translate into fact the model suggests that some native born workers may be made worse off through lowe r wages or diminished job prospects because immigration increases the supply of labor available to the nations employers but theory also suggests that immigration would make consumers including the abovementioned nativeborn workers better off because it holds down wages and thereby holds down prices of goods and services the empirical issue is how best to measure the existence and magnitude of the potential wage and employment effects of immigration that the model describes g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g14g146g157g142g155g138g157g158g155g142g561 despite the greatly increased presence of foreignborn workers since the 1970s the foreignborn make up just 145 of current us labor force participants8 therefore immigration is unlikely to have substantially affected the wage or job prospects of the average nativeborn worker but if immigrants are concentrated in particular geographic areas then nativeborn workers who live in those communities and possess characteristics similar to those of foreignborn workers might be affected such an impact might be detected by comparing the wage and employment opportunities of selected groups of nativeborn workers in areas with high versus low concentrations of 6 carmel u

utilize data for sample of cities or states disaggregated by immigrant share to estimate the relationship between an increase in their immigrant population and the labor market outcomes of us workers thought to compete with foreignborn workers most of the interarea studies have found little if any statistically significant and economically meaningful difference between the wage and employment experiences of nativeborn workersoverall or disaggregated by race gender or skill levelin areas with high versus low concentrations of i mmigrants few studies have estimated slight negative impact on small share of the us labor forcelowskilled natives eg those who did not graduate from high school it has been suggested that interarea research does not provide complete picture of immigrations effects however the spatially based studies correctly tell us that immigrants have measurable effect on particular labor markets but they are not informative about the economywide effects of immigrants9 emphasis added as noted in the section of this report concerni ng the models assumptions mobility of production factors and goods could disperse the local effects of immigration across the nation differences between areas in the supply of labor by skill category would be minimized if for example many lowskilled us workers in highimmigrant cities whose wages had been depressed quickly overcame the monetary psychological and information costs of moving and relocated to cities with better opportunities ie lowimmigrant communities the mobility of labor capital and goods between areas thus could make it difficult for spatially based studies to detect the labor market consequences of immigration 10 this alleged deficiency of the interarea approach has prompted research into immigrations effect on the aggregate ie national labor market the second group of studies discussed below utilize national data to assess the impact of immigration on nativeborn workers by skill level various explanations have been offered for the increase since the 1970s in wage inequality ie workers increased concentration at the lower end of the wage distribution although skillbiased

workers to greater extent than those of other skill groups with whom immigrants compete the economywide studies that have examined the relationship between immigration and changes in the relative proportions of labor by skill category are not without their own drawbacks however initial studies that utilized the factorproportions methodology have been faulted because they did not directly estimate the responsiveness of natives wages to the immigrationinduced increase in the relative supply of lowskilled workers and for this reason might overstate immigrants wage effect on us workers 13 the more recent work of researchers who take national approach has responded to this among ot her criticisms economywide analyses also might overstate the impact of immigration in the long run if for example they do not take into account natives adjustment to the increased presence of immigrants by completing more years of schooling or choosing different fields of study which takes them out of competition with immigrants for jobs in which foreignborn workers have made substantial inroads the assumption by proponents of the national approachthat nativeborn substitutes for and complements of foreignborn workers quickly diffuse the effect of immigration across the countryis suspect as well because other economic shocks typically have been followed by longer adjustment periods 14 in

and an areas immigrant concentration 15 continued influx of workers from mexico and central america with little education and because of decline in the number of nativeborn workers who have not

patterns of natives are due to immigrations impact on the labor market16 based on its review of the inconsistent results provided by interarea and national studies through the mid1990s the national research council concluded that immigration has only small adverse impact on the wage and employment opportunities of competing nativeborn groups this effect appear s not to be concentrat ed in the local areas where immigrants live much of it is probably dispersed across the united states as competing native workers migrate out of the areas to which immigrants move the migration of native labor and native capital across cities to take advantage of whatever differential economic opportunities initially arise from immigration as well as the beneficial effect that immigrant groups have on other native groups suggest the unlikelihood of detecting any sizable negative effect on native workers 17

and taylor estimated the effect of authorized and unauthorized mexican workers on the earnings of nativeborn workers in metropolitan labor markets in the southwestern united states in 1980 regardless of the nativeborn group in question eg black males nonhispanic white males native mexican males and women the numerical impact of mexican male immigrants on natives annual earnings was small 18 using an alternative estimation procedure the researchers found that legal mexican immigrants slightly lowered the earnings of nativeborn women and nativeborn nonhispanic white men while not affecting the earnings of nativeborn minorities in contrast they estimated that unauthorized mexican immigrants slightly raised the earnings of all groups studied except mexicanorigin men the authors explained these results by suggesting that unauthorized mexican immigrants do not compete with nativeborn workers as legal immigrants appear tounauthorized mexican immigrants may take secondary jobs which are lowpaying and unattractive to nativeborn workers while legal mexican immigrants may possess characteristics needed to compete with nativeborn workers for primary jobs nonetheless regardless of the estimation procedure used the impact of authorized and unauthorized mexican workers on the annual earnings of nativeborn workers was small lalonde and topel found evidence that immigrants reduce the annual earnings of young nativeborn black and hispanic males ie the relationship is statistically insignificant because the results were about the same with either weekly or annual earnings as the outcome variable they surmised that immigrants also have an inconsequential impact on the amount of time worked ie number of weeks worked by the two nativeborn groups 19 16 harriet orcutt duleep the

increased immigration for lessskilled nativeborn workers ie those with 12 or less years of schooling when the researchers accounted for the location decisions of immigrants and compared differences over time in inter area wage growth they found that immigration significantly reduced the earnings of the less skilled group20 altonji and card analyzed immigratio ns impact on the employment outcomes of lessskilled natives as well they concluded that on balance inflows of foreignborn labor had neither large nor systematically positive or negative impact on the job opportunities of less skilled nativeborn workers 21 they did find some evidence of displacement among nativeborn workers in highimmigrant cities in those industries that employed relatively large and increasing numbers of immigrants between 1970 and 1980 including lowwage manufacturing industries eg apparel service industries eg private households and agriculture because the employment outcomes of lessskilled natives across all industries were unaffected however the authors suspected that the job losers were able to get new positions in other industries or in other metropolitan areas utilizing data from the 1990 census card subsequently analyzed the employment effects of recent immigrants on nativeborn workers and on earlier immigrants employed in the same occupationbased skill groups he estimated that immigrants admitted to the united states between 1985 and 1990 who were employed in laborer and lowskilled service occupations slightly reduced the employment rates of natives and older immigrants in this lowest paid least educated group only in the few cities in which the inflow of foreignborn lowskilled competitors during the 19851990 period expanded their unskilled labor forces by as much or more than the mariel boatlift affected the miami labor market did immigration substantially lower the employment rates of young lesseducated natives 22 card similarly found that based upon data from the 2000 census an increase in the relative supply of male immigrants who failed to complete high school had only small adverse effect on the relative employment of male nativeborn dropouts23 in contrast he estimated relationship between citys increased supply of lowskilled male immigrants and the wages of their nativeborn competitors cards research led him to suggest that those industries in highimmigrant areas which rely heavily on lowskilled labor eg agriculture textiles apparel and footwear and lowskilled service industries have been able to absorb the increase in immigr ant supply without harming similar nativeborn workers schoeni addressed some of the shortcomings of the spatial approach by examining period of time the 1970s and 1980s rather than one year as is true of most of the other crosssectional studies discussed above 24 he also adjusted for costofliving differences between cities with varying immigrant concentrations and for the influence of immigrants location decisions both of which could bias the results schoeni found evidence that immigration has the largest adverse effect on the earnings and employment outcomes of natives with less than high school

graduates appear depressed as well for example increased immigration during the 1970s might have caused 22 decline over the decade in the real inflationadjusted wage of lowskilled white men and increased immigration during the 1980s might have led to 118 percentage point rise in unemployment over that period among lowskilled black men similarly heightened immigration during the 1970s might have prompted 75 decrease in the real weekly wage of lowskilled black women and heightened immigration during the 1980s might have produced 055 percentage point increase in unemployment among lowskilled white women thus the form of the labor market effect may have changed over time in the 1970s the wage of nativeborn workers bore the brunt of immigrations impact in the 1980s the impact shifted to nativeborn workers employment according to schoenis analysis while his results support the notion that immigration imposes considerable costs on nati veborn workers with 12 or less years of schooling schoeni concluded that its economywide effects are small because in 1990 unaffected workers ie those with more than high school diploma made up more than half of all workers johannsson and weiler similarly covered span of time 19982002 and took the location decisions of lowskilled immigrants into account they estimated that metropolitan areas experiencing an increase in their lowskilled immigrant population have significantly lower rate of labor force participation among similar nativeborn workers the withdrawal of natives from the local labor force may partly explain the markedly reduced unemployment rate among low skilled natives in areas with increased immigration the researchers suggest that lowerskilled older natives with considerable mobility costs may opt to reduce their participation rather than outmigrate in response to adverse local labor market shocks such as an immigrationinduced increase in the supply of labor 25 federman harrington and krynski found evidence of displacement among nativeborn manicurists in california between 1987 and 2002 when areas within the state experienced very large influx of vietnamese manicurists specifically it appears that two native ie non vietnamese manicurists were displaced for every five vietnamese manicurists who entered the labor market the displacement was manifested more through nativeborn workers not becoming manicurists than the exit of nativeborn manicurists from the occupation which the researchers suggest is why economists find little or over all effect of immigration on employment among nativeborn workers the dramatic increase in the number of manicuring jobs following the entry of vietnamese immigrants should dispel the notion that immigrants and natives compete for fixed number of jobs 26 new forms of service eg walkin nail salons could be partly responsible for the increase in demand for manicurists according to the authors

decline in lowskilled mens relative wage27 topel estimated that if it were not for the increased presence of immigrants in the wests labor force the supply of lowskilled compared to highskilled men would have fallen by more than it actually did and the relative wage of lowskilled men consequently would not have fallen by as much as it did he concluded that immigration has played significant role in affecting the supply and welfare of lowskilled men especially in the west where it might have reduced their relative wage by some 10 28 enchautegui examined how much of the decline during the 1980s in the level of real inflation adjusted wages among workers without high school diploma was due to the influx of low skilled foreignborn labor she estimated that at the national level the increased presence in the us labor force of lowskilled foreignborn workers explained just 4 of the 13 decline in real annual earnings of workers with less than 12 years of schooling from national perspective then the increase in the supply of foreignborn workers without high school degree had little impact on the erosion in lowskilled workers earnings during the 1980s but the explanatory power of the heightened presence of lowskilled foreignborn workers appears to increase with an areas immigrant density in areas of low immigration only 2 percent of the wage change can be attributed to increased immigrant representation in the work force in areas of medium immigration 14 percent of the wage drop is due to the larger immigrant share among the low skilled while in areas of high immigration the influx of immigrants accounts for 43 percent of the 7percent decline in wages experienced in these areas in angeles an example of highimmigrant area the change in the proportion of natives and immigrants accounted for more than half of the 9percent decline in real wages of lowskilled workers 29 another study directly examined immigrations labor market impact by relating occupational differences in immigrants share of employment to the wages of natives although it could not address whether foreignborn labor contributed to the decline over time in the wage level of low skilled workers because the research covered just one period the crossoccupation analysis was conducted on nationwide basis so it is not susceptible to the previously discussed drawback of the interarea approach camarota estimated that as the share of foreignborn employment in an occupation rose the earnings of nativeborn workers fell significantly 30 specifically for every 1 increase in immigrant composition in an occupation the weekly wage of the average native born worker in that occupation declined by 05 the data suggest that the largest negative effects were felt by lowskilled labor among all natives with 12 or less years of schooling 1 increase in the employment share of foreignborn workers reduced weekly wages by 066 27 robert h topel regional labor markets and the determinants of wage inequality aea papers and proceedings may 1994 28 ibid p 2122 note part of the relative wage decline coul d have occurred because of changes in composition rather than in labor supply per in

performed by workers with more than high school degree 1 increase in immigrant composition lowered weekly wages by 08 although borjas freeman and katz found that immigration played statistically significant part in the declining relative wage of lowskilled workers they concluded that it had little effect on either the growth in wage inequality or in the wage gap between college and high school graduates the economists estimated that between 1980 and 1995 immigration expanded the relative supply of workers with less than high school degree by some 15 31 if immigration had not been skewed in this manner the relative wage of the scarcer lowskilled natives would have increased assuming unchanged employer demand by becoming major supplier of lowskilled workers and thereby changing the nations skill endowment from what it otherwise would have been immigration may have accounted for some 44 of the decrease over the 15year period in the relative wage of workers with less than 12 years of schooling the economists further estimated that immigration lowered the wage of lowskilled workers by about 5 between 1980 and 1995 borjas in more recent analyses made refinements to the national approach that address some of the previously mentioned criticisms he found that an increase in the supply of immigrant labor by skill group defined by educational attainment and years of work experience over the 19602000 period had significantly adverse impact on the wages of nativeborn men with whom they competed 10 increase in the number of workers in given skill group reduced the absolute weekly wage of similar nativeborn males by some 4 and their employment ie weeks worked by some 3 32 even after allowing for the positive earnings impact that lowskilled highskilled immigrants can have on nativeborn workers in highskilled lowskilled groups borjas estimated that recent 19802000 immigration reduced the wage of nativeborn workers in each skill group young ie less experienced nativeborn males without high school degree appear to have experienced the greatest negative wage effect which seemingly was due to the entrance into the united states between 1980 and 2000 of predominantly lowskilled authorized and unauthorized mexican workers the author found that the overall wage impact of increased immigration was more modest over the long run as the capital stock adjusted to the greater labor supply but he suggested that distributional differences remained in light of the concentration of mexicanborn immigrants in lowskilled groups 33 similarly borjas estimated that natives adjustment to the inflow of immigrants through migration within the united states attenuates the adverse effects of immigration the internal native migration response of native workers accounts for about 40 percent of the gap between the wage effects estimated at the state and at the national level at the metropolitan area level the data indicate that the native internal response may account for as much as 60 percent of the difference 34 31 george j borjas richard b freeman and lawrence f katz how much do immigration and trade affect labor market outcomes brookings

between 1990 and 2004 on native born workers by taking into account both education and experience but reached very different conclusions in part because they found foreignborn workers were imperfect substitutes for nativeborn workers within an educationexperience group ie they worked in different occupations and had different skills the two researchers estimated that in the long run the average real wage of us workers increased significantly by 18 as result of immigration over the 19902004 period 35 the shortrun wage impact as of 2004 before capital had fully adjusted to the increase in immigrants was still positive albeit more modest increase 07 ottaviano and peri further found significantly smaller real wage loss among the least educated us workers11 in the long run and 22 in the short runthan had previously been derived further this small share of the us labor force was the only group found to have been adversely affected they also estimated that immigration had little impact on relative wages it made only small contribution to the widening of the wage gap between college graduates and high school dropouts and helped to reduce wage inequality between college graduates and high school graduates over the 19902004 period 36 borjas grogger and hanson examined the relationship between immigration and black mens wages employment opportunities and incarceration rates they estimated from 19602000 census data that when immigration led to disproportionate increases in the supply of labor to particular skill groups the earnings of black and white men in the skill group declined by about the same percentage but the employment rate of black men fell and the incarceration rate of black men rose to greater extent than the changes experienced by white men the researchers emphasize that although immigration contributed to the large changes in employment and incarceration rates among black men since 1960 much remains unexplained put differently immigration seems to have an effect and this effect seems to be numerically but we would have witnessed sizable decline in black employment and the concurrent increase in black incarceration rates even if there had been immigration in the past few decades 37 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 some policymakers have proposed further strengthening the us border with mexico to

for lowskilled nativeborn workers it also has been suggested that congre ss address the distributional issue some empirical studies have raised by changing the composition of legal immigration if for example individuals permanently admitted to the united states under the employmentbased category are largely high skilled while those admitted under one or more of the other categories ie family preference immediate relatives diversity or refugees and asylees are largely lowskilled then the current numerical limits on the latter might be lowered to mitigate immigrations presumed adverse consequences for lessskilled natives indeed if the skill levels of immigrants do differ by admission category then an acrosstheboard cutback in the number of foreignborn persons allowed into the united states would not be an effective remedy for the poor labor market performance of lowskilled natives in recent decades only if foreignborn workers who enter under each of the categories has roughly the same skill distribution would an untargeted reduction in the overall level of immigration assist lessskilled us workers yet changing the composition of immigration may not be the most effective way to improve the plight of lowskilled nativeborn workers as noted earlier in this report several explanations have been offered for the increase in us wage inequality if other factors eg skillbiased technological change have played greater role than the inflow of lowskilled foreignborn workers then curtailing the immigration of this group may not much affect the wage and employment outcomes of lowskilled us workers 38 moreover policy that shifts the composition of foreignborn persons who legally enter the united statesthrough permanent admissions or temporary worker programstoward the more skilled might have unintended consequences an increase in the supply of foreignborn workers to highskilled occupations might adversely affect the wage and job opportunities of nativeborn workers in those fields despite the considerable debate that preceded amendments to the professional specialty h1b visa guest worker program made by congress to increase the arguably inadequate supply of nativeborn workers qualified to fill information technology jobs 39 little research has been undertaken to assess the effects of the policy changes on nativeborn workers40 perhaps not surprisingly in light of the conflicting results of the previously discussed literature there is consensus among the few studies that have looked specifically at the impact on high skilled nativeborn workers of an increase in the supply of comparable foreignborn workers one researcher tentatively concluded that while allowing into the country h1b workers with information technology it skills may not depress the wages of us workers in computer 38 augustine j kposowa the impact of immigration on employment and earnings among racial minorities in the united states ethnic and racial studies v18 3 july 1995 estimates that although immigration significantly reduced the earnings of nativeborn nonwhite workers in 1980 the low skill levels of minorities were much stronger explanatory factor while findings in this study show evidence of competition between nativeborn nonwhites and immigrants in the labor market the real solution to the disadvantaged position of minorities in the us labour market is to address and redress fundamental problems that may be linked to their skill levels from policy point of view restricting immigration solely because immigrants compete with minorities in the secondary bour market for jobs that are obviously lowpaying and menial is tacit admission that such jobs should exist and that they are there for minorities to fill sounder and fairer strategy would be one that attempted to provide equal opportunities and incentives to minorities so that they too could move to the higher level sectors of the economy p 625 and 626 39 for

groups unemployment rate41 another analysis similarly estimated that an increase in temporary and permanent immigrants does not negatively affect the wages of us workers in professional occupations42 although third study determined that h1b workers in computer programming occupations typically are paid much less than us workers similarly employed in the same state43 perhaps the number of h1b programmers in given state is not sufficiently large to lower the wages of nativeborn programmers in given state in contrast yet another empirical study found that an increase in the supply of labor to particular doctoral field caused by an influx of foreign students reduced the earnings of competing science and engineer ing phd students who graduated at about the same time the economist attributed roughly half of the adverse wage impact of immigration on highskill labor markets to the increased use of lowpay postdoctoral appointments in science and engineering as way of adjusting to the increase in labor supply 44 if the composition of foreignborn workers were shifted toward the highskilled it could make it more difficult to utilize one means commonly suggested to mitigate any adverse distributional effects of immigration students and lowskilled nativeborn workers often have been encouraged to become complements of rather than substitutes for foreignborn workers expressed differently they have been urged to obtain bachelors degree or undertake retraining at community colleges for example to acquire higher order skills expected to remove them from competition with lowskilled immigrants but with the admission of more highskilled foreignborn workers just obtaining higher skill levels may not be sufficient to avoid potential wage suppression and displacement based upon the results of at least some of the abovedescribed empirical literature g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 linda levine
