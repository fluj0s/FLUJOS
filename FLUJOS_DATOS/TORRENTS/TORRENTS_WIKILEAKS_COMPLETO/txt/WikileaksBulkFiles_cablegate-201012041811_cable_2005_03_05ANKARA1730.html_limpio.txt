and foreign policy drift stemming from leadership and structural problems in ruling akp longoverdue healthy debate over turkeys identity and akp including its handling of relations with the us has started but akps policy muddle is leaving vacuum that resurgent nationalism is seeking to fill this period of drift could be extended making eu reforms and bilateral cooperation more difficult the drift may well continue until the next crisis creates new political alternatives in day of reckoning end summary akp government adrift 2 c as the akp government confronts the arduous task of eu harmonization it is manifestly adrift on domestic political and economic reform implementation of reform legislation passed in 20032004 is seriously deficient refs and b the akp government has poor working relationship with the military the presidency and the largelysecular state bureaucracy it is failing to control corruption in the ak party it has been slow to introduce the banking tax administration and social security legislation required by the imf as precondition for new standby program it is neglecting relations with the eu erdogan has delayed appointing chief negotiator for eu accession negotiations both erdogan and fm gul have made statements which have disturbed eu officials and politicians erdogan has still not decided on muchanticipated cabinet reshuffle 3 c ak party officials publicly deny the governments obvious drift and we see sign it has yet begun to undermine erdogans voter base akps ability to get back on track is compromised by its islamistneoottoman reflexes and singlepartystate spoils system we doubt this government will be able to refocus or move our bilateral relationship which remains strong in some areas back to more strategic level 4 c pm erdogan is isolated he has lost touch with his cabinet and parliamentary group we hear mps and ministers alike xxxxx who is close to erdogan complain they longer have comfortable access or feel obliged to kowtow for fear of incurring erdogans wrath business associations strong advocates of akp economic policies tell us they feel they have lost the pms ear erdogan has cut himself off from his closest spiritual advisors in the iskender pasa naksibendi brotherhood in which he grew up as we have heard directly from xxxxx 5 c according to broad range of our contacts erdogan reads minimally mainly the islamistleaning press according to others with broad and deep contacts throughout the establishment erdogan refuses to draw on the analyses of the mfa and the military and national intelligence organization have cut him off from their reports he never had realistic world view but one key touchstone is fear of being outmaneuvered on the islamist side by hoca erbakans saadet party instead he relies on his charisma instincts and the filterings of advisors who pull conspiracy theories off the web or are lost in neoottoman islamist fantasies eg islamist foreign policy advisor and gul ally ahmet davutoglu 6 c inside the akp the more ideological deputy pmfonmin gul continues behindthescenes machinations especially during erdogans foreign junkets gul seems to be trying to undermine erdogan and take on more party control he may hope to reclaim the prime ministership which he was forced to cede to erdogan four months after akp acceded to power with his relatively good english gul works to project an image of being moderate or modern in fact guls peers say he has far more ideologized antiwestern worldview than erdogan gul reflecting his pragmatic streak has made some constructive statements on bilateral relations and on turkeys iraq policy since the iraqi elections however we understand that gul and group of likeminded mps and journalists continue to see fomenting antiamerican attitudes as one way to get at erdogan while also being moved by emotions of islamicsunni solidarity 7 c akps disarray has generated significant internal unease from those who support erdogan but also from some of the other tendencies forming ak xxxxx that erdogan does not know how to proceed either on domestic policy or on rebuilding relations with the us xxxxx bellwether of islamist sentiment has told two of our insider contacts that he is about to resign in disgust at the partys rampant corruption xxxxx one of erdogans closest business and brotherhood friends and advisors from istanbul says he sees future for this government and thinks it is time for more flexible and open leader leading member xxxxx has expressed to us the gulenists sense that erdogan cannot hack it long overdue healthy debate 8 c the ferment is not all bad it is beginning to force some to question the real roots of inertia and stasis in turkey that needs to accelerate its transition we are encouraged by the determination of some to open longoverdue healthy debate on akp and its handling of turkeys relations with the us secretary rices february 6 visit and subsequent us media coverage helped ignite the debate another catalyst was deputy chod basbugs january 26 press briefing in which he coolly analyzed turkish concerns about iraq and repeatedly emphasized that one cannot reduce broad and comprehensive usturkish relations to single issue it was not until late february that erdogan albeit without conviction in his voice expressed anything similar to basbugs assessment of the importance of bilateral relations 9 c the debate has now produced some sustained trenchant criticism of akps domestic and foreign policies from several insightful mainstream commentators however mainstream commentators are seen as too proamerican to be persuasive among akp or its supporters perhaps more important have been the decisions of some proakp islamist columnists to write unusually blunt warnings that the akp government must pull itself together or risk fall the parliamentary opposition has continued its antiamerican 60s leftist rhetoric as it winds its merry way to irrelevance resurgent nationalism 10 c there is more disturbing consequence of akps weakness resurgent nationalism two of the hottest selling books in turkey are metal storm conspiracy novel that feeds the worst instincts of turks with its tale of us invasion of turkey followed by turkish nuclear counterstrike with the help of the russians and mein kampf ref c under instructions from the directorate of religious affairs imams across turkey delivered march 11 sermon against christian missionaries ref d claiming they aim to steal the beliefs of our young people and children we are receiving increased reports of antichristian activity in different regions of turkey eg ref the central bank governor told us that nationalistisolationist forces are behind the problems with the imf ref f an attempt to burn the turkish flag during newroz celebration in mersin has drawn strong nationalistic statements from across the spectrum including statement from the general staff that the turkish nation and the turkish armed forces are ready to sacrifice their blood to protect their country and their flag the decision to memorialize after 47year hiatus the killing by british forces of several ottoman soldiers during the allies wwi occupation of istanbul also bespeaks the national mood 11 u the turkish media have given prominent coverage to what appears to be growth in street crime and to parallel refusal of the police angry at limitations on their operational abilities under the new euinspired criminal code to patrol aggressively in march 18 column ertugrul ozkok managing editor of turkeys leading newspaper hurriyet and one of the most authoritative press voices of the establishment noted that the turkish public is deeply disturbed by what it perceives as breakdown of law and order ozkok in what would appear to be an overstatement closed with warning to erdogan that when democratic forces cannot ensure safety in the streets sic then the public and political space is left to other forces in march 4 column umit ozdag now in the running for chairmanship of the rightwing nationalist mhp cited increased crime as one reason for the current popularity of mein kampf 12 c resurgent nationalist feelings probably also played role in the press and government reactions to comments from eu ambassador kretschmer about the governments loss of momentum and eu accession to the eu troikas worry about the police violence against march 6 istanbul demonstration and the press feeding frenzy over ambassador edelmans innocent remarks on syria comment 13 c having reached one of its primary goals date to begin eu accession negotiations erdogans akp government is out of ideas and energy for now eu and imfrequired reforms will face tougher opposition from reenergized nationalists the government will be tempted to delay difficult decisions in any realm and resistance to change will be the default mode bilateral cooperation will be more difficult more vulnerable to characterization as unreasonable us demands that infringe upon turkish sovereignty 14 c this period of drift could last long time akps parliamentary majority is eroding but only slowly ref g despite the unhappiness inside akp there is currently political alternative and there are risks to anyone who actually forces split erdogan still has nuclear option in hand early elections the danger is that tough decisions and the settling out of the political system will be put off until real new crisis emerges which will either energize the akp or bring new political alternatives waiting bears real cost since turkey needs to be more nimble in pursuing the political economic social and foreign policy agendas many turks the eu and the us have been supporting than this type of static drift will permit deutsch
