suppressives and gaes lecture given on 2 august 1966 thank you thank you thank you whats the date audience voice august the 2nd ad 16 well suzie knows it but the rest of you dont seem to know the date whats the date audience 2nd of august 1966 ad 16 thats correct 2 august ad 16 now we have lots of subjects we can always talk about we have lots of tapes on them but we obviously never have enough for some peculiar reasonfor some peculiar reasonwhy the tech sec and the qual sec and so forth have trouble with scarcity of materials on some of these subjects thats quite obvious because they keep getting committed or omitted now theres two types of crime two types of crime theres the crimes of commission and the crimes of omission and in modern society they pay very little attention to the crimes of omission the penalty is usually awarded to person really for two reasons one is for being there and the other is for communicating now that is the normal penalty in this society if you want to reduce any crime down why it was basically composed of those two elements being there and communicating but there are crimes of not being there and not communicating too the society doesnt pay much attention to these but the auditor not being there and the auditor not carrying out his communications is crime of the highest order because hes now barring the road now it used to be that people wereyou know they expected to prove dianetics and scientology to them and you know sort of carry along the full responsibility for its workability and when it didnt work it was my fault and i should have done it better and so on well you probably expect changes in level 0 i 11111 w and v and all that sort of thing now i got an awful surprise for you you know im not changing one comma in nothin now weve gone from total change you see to total nochange you see just to make proper dichotomy so the materials now are just right there but today today i really speak from considerable strength because we have such thing as clear and when you clip clear on the ear he rings for an hour without stopping theyre that clear and everything that was predicted up to the level of clear has more than been made good now whats very peculiar is the road to clear in its stages from wog to grade wpardon raw meat to grade iv wog is somebody who isnt even tryingthe total jump there is very fast that is very fast jump and that is one of the troubles of the lower grades and the thing that you as an auditor will have the most trouble with it happens too quick now there are some processes which are not in the lineup which would be so quick well i dont dare put them in the lineup you see the auditor is busy adjusting his meter you know and he doesnt notice the guy went release so weve omitted those and 212 is one of them marvelous process the most fascinating process to overrun that anybody ever heard of i mean it wraps person around more telegraph poles in less times when i got that i said this is really it man people said well if thats really it lets really audit it but we havewe have today such fast route that its only by additives goofing it up and particularly the gross gaesthe gaesthe gross auditing errors that can stop somebody from going so in actual fact it becomes real crime now to audit badly because youre barring the road for this fellow for eternity thats quite long time now any thetan wants out even the sp himself personally wants out only he unfortunately is sure that you are simply trying to put him in you see he knows he belongs in and he is very easily described as somebody who is totally surrounded by martians regardless of who you are you see hes stuck in an incident which has personnel that have nothing to do with present time but all that personnel is in present time and you are that personnel so that of course you have to be held down because if you got big and strong and powerful youbeing martian or being an fbi agent or being something elsewould of course do him in so therefore he commits almost continuous crimes in an effort to hold people down now there is tendency on the part of ethics that every time somebody commits lot of gaes and so forth to declare them suppressive now i should make it rather clear that suppressive is special breed of cat he is not hard to identify in actual fact he is somebody with case gain well you say thats very hard youif somebody isdoes not get better with dianetics or scientology auditing then you immediately say that he is good well interpret it that way if you like its okay with im impervious to criticism but anyway suppressive being very particular breed of cat will of course commit nothing butand do nothing butgaes and cannot be pressed into auditing at all they wont audit at all now because somebody makes few gaes that doesnt make him suppressive do you follow but it does happen to be true that suppressive would never audit he would only commit gaes all you would have to do would be describe to him how to make the gross auditing error so as to keep it from working and you instantly and immediately would have on your hands nothing but gaes because he then would be able to mask himself by saying you see i am trying my best to audit these people and they still dont get any better so therefore i am right and hubbard is wrong and the rest of you guys are for the birds do you see and therefore it doesnt work and there isnt any way to make them any stronger and if we can just get rid of this then im safe thats his whole philosophy if he can get rid of any method of making anybody stronger or more powerful then hes got it made so he of course rewards only down statistics you see only down statistic gets rewarded never reward an up statistic and goof up or vilify any effort to help anybody and particularly knife with violence anything calculated to make human beings more powerful or more intelligent now suppressive automatically and immediately will curve then any betterment activity into something evil or bad if you let him have auditing he would then use thea pattern like the gaes to audit you see but once more i tell you that not everybody who makes gaes is suppressive now gaespecial breed of cat case gain i mean case gain now i would coax registrars into being alert to this and theyd save us fantastic amounts of trouble because something on the order of twoanda half persons out of every hundred who walk in the streets are screaming museumpiece institutionbait suppressives theyre the people who put the people in institutions people in institutions are really pts potential trouble sourceswhich are they say the effect of suppressives suppressives are very seldom picked up they know better than to get obvious now suppressive makes case gain and will sit there and brag about it and he cant resist bragging about it and any registrar who had somebody come in and say well ive had threeandahalf thousand hours of processing or one thousand hours of processing or every auditor in seattle and they havent had any results on so far and ive still got this terrible lumbosis and ive come here to find out if you could do anything for and i want sort of guarantee that you can at that moment if i were the registrar knowing my technology i would say you bet now youve had lot of trouble with auditors now before we sign you up you had better go and see the ethics officer let him trot over to the ethics officer and then an ethics officer should be very fully aware of what this is all about hes not complaining anybody has right to complain about one auditor but this guy will complain about them all man he has other characteristics which are quite marked and its really an interesting breed of cat if you ever got him auditing he will only be happy or satisfied if his pre clear gets worse and hes only sad when the pc gets better and that characteristic was what spotted us suppressives years and years and years ago this is very peculiar wed notice here and thereonce in blue moon we would have somebody exhibiting these characteristics and the rest of the characteristics was that he himself got case gain of any kind whatsoever and he committed nothing but gaes and could be educated into nothing else but committing errors and we eventually traced these people as to what they did and how they behaved and the monitoring fact was case gain now there are bunch of ramifications to this but these do not make suppressive the suppressive is in active attack on scientology he commits overts twentyfour hours day you almost never find out about them every auditor in seattle has audited ahh didnt make any case gain yeah they took my money and they did in ah come off of it you couldnt have that many scientologists working on one person without case gain its impossible he would have had some gain at some time or another you know now that that person also privately commits overts secret overts in the society around him it isnt usually nasty habit like strangling babies or something like that but it could be spitting in other peoples beeryou know something just another characteristic another characteristic is attacks wrong targets if the fridge is making great deal of noiseto you americans refridge is english for icebox or fridge anyway if the fridge is making lot of noise and its annoying him hell go over and kick the lamp if the car has flat tire he will fix the motor in addition to that he will not complete cycle of action but if he occasionally does complete cycle of action and finds out about it he will then reverse it you get the idea hes found out that he accidentally completed cycle of action see he delivered the goods or something he will immediately reverse it now those continuous overts wrong target noncompletions of cycles of action are primary manifestations and when accompanied with case gain you pretty well got the boy tagged now at time during this lecture have i said that all existing governments on the planet today reward down statistics choose wrong targets fail to complete cycles of action or commit continuous overts i have not said that and your inference on that subject is your own responsibility well now if you in auditing find yourself up against somebody who cant make any case gain and you are doing your best now dont be fool as an auditor you take this thing on an ethics basis tech is out because it isnt working so your other tool that comes before tech is ethics now you as an auditor can actually be an ethics officerwhich i think is quite interesting but you have to be every now and thenand you should know some of the technology of ethics it isnt just routing somebody to the ethics officer you yourself every now and then are going to find yourself sitting there as cop well much more superior to cop an ethics officer youre going to have to know how to locate overts how to locate overts that are so unreal they dont even show on normal meter youre going to have to be able to locate all kinds of things on meter or in life concerning your pc now where you run up against total blank you obviously cant get tech in huh you see i mean gain gain so therefore your other weapon is ethics and that becomes comes before tech now whats the matter with the planet at this particular time is ethics is out and that is proven by the fact that you are having hard time getting tech in with the technology which you know at this particular moment and the results which you are delivering even at lower levels you have total monopoly of all mental activities all religious activities and all social activities on this planet that is what you are entitled to at this moment do you have them well therefore tech is out obvious so the only thing that puts tech out is if ethics is out the only thing that can get tech in is ethics now ethics is based on the mechanics of the spthe suppressive person the mechanics of the sp now if you were to audit one of these heads of governments whos always choosing wrong targets and not completing cycles of action and committing these little overtslike brush wars or something if you were to put him in the auditing chair you would find that he would not respond to processing matter what you called it matter what reason you had to do it nothing he wouldnt respond to processing hes suppressive now he isnt going to do what you say as an auditor because you of course are martian like everybody else youre his favorite youre his favorite bugbear representative of sitting there youre not trying to help him youre trying to trick him youre trying to trick him into letting down his protective mechanisms long enough so that you can stab him in the back thats his whole opinion of life and that is what you would find in the drivers seat that is what you would find now as long as that sort of bloke is in the drivers seat now nothing in this lecture invites anyone to war civil commotion or rebellion assassination or other political activities but if you were to get ethics in you would just have to get ethics in now ethics isnt gotten in on wide policestate basis its gotten in on very narrow basis its just very occasional individual here and there who is in power now the other part of the ethics picture is called pts who is potential trouble source and if you dont think that potential trouble source doesnt cause trouble you should look along the line because the trouble is great numerous and so on causes much more apparent trouble than the sr so you very often think that you are looking at an sp who is simply causing trouble to find yourself looking in actual fact at potential trouble source now the person is potential trouble source because hes connected to the sr he has not handled or disconnected from the sp and as long as he does not either handle or disconnect he will continue to be potential trouble source matter how thoroughly he explains it otherwise now potential trouble source is interesting to us as far as technology is concerned in that he rolly coasters now roller coaster is something they have on coney island and other places and down in long beach they used to have one called the rabbit eight and so on its these little railways that go up in the sky and have terrific dips in amusement parks you see and the little cars go up and the little cars go down and thats rolly coaster and the pc who goes up and the pc who goes down is rollercoastering and please dont think hes doing anything else he hasnt done anything else at all but rolly coaster when he comes back in after the session and says i felt fine yesterday afternoon but this morning i have terrible stomachache hes rolly coastered now during that period of time when that pc was out of sight an sp was either directly contacted or restimulated now the person didnt have to see the s but only had to see something that reminded him of the sr sp is postman he sees letter box thats enough he goes ptspotential trouble source so he rolly coasters now this person is going to endlessly cause you as an auditor trouble youre going to get them up three inches in the session and they will fall back four in life and it is terrible to audit them were not being extreme actually were auditing over the dead body of some sp valence or person were auditing across something which is going to kill this fellow if he gets any better if for instance your pcwho is pts were to demonstrate an intelligence graph which went from 90 to 131 theres every possibility that hed wake up the next morning very dead from arsenic i mean youre actually putting his life at risk thats why you mustnt audit them not because theyre trouble to you youre going to kill them theyre going to get sicker and sicker more and more extraordinary effort is going to be applied to making this person ill sad but true now therefore you are very interested in this thing called potential trouble source because potential trouble source will give you trouble will rolly coaster wont get better and its terrible liability to audit them liability to yourself personally and liability to them if all of sudden they made sweeping gain theyre liable to be met with 45caliber pistol im not joking now as fast as auditing is today it really isnt fast enough to make the total grade against the s because theres that better part of year to clear now you could make the lower grades you got the person for week you can make all the lower grades in week see you work real hard and you do real good job and the person is responding okay and theyre out of restimulative environment and thats why you see so many grade vs and vi cave in youre not making it fast enough to keep them away from the suppressive environment so they get up to v and theyre going to have long time to go before theyre vi and whewww so you see vs collapse do you see theyre pts and that was because an undetected suppressive is in this persons environment and the person is moved out of his common environment and you audited this person and in the process of auditing this person you got themwhssttgrade iv release great day fine oh yes theyre not going to have this much trouble yes during that period of release they might even get wise to their environment all kinds of things might be okay but they walk out of thatand remember this person is only release this person is still very mortal terrific shape better than any activity was everactually grade 0 is better than any activity in the past ever got to they can still be hit headon by the truck and dont think they arent if they have real live sp in their vicinity boy that guy gets right into the general sherman tank and throws all all fuel on the firebarn and so you get more grade v troublesee grade iv they went away got restimulated now you come back theyre all set now youve got to rehabilitate them and so forth and it takes while to get through grade v and you start to run into your trouble if theres an sp in this persons vicinity grade vi youll run into more trouble and possibly anybody whos lagging on the clearing course is simply very pts and so forth but actually the clearing course if person isfollows procedure and does grit his teeth and try to handle or disconnect his environment he can make it through i have im making it through rightvery nicely well im connected with some sps known as governments and so on they have long since made up their minds that we should be shot and pilloried and that sort of thing im justsee wrong target so im just hoping that they will get very mad at somebody else but the point im making is that its at about grade vi which is the makebreak point you could somehow or other start persevering through if you were very superior thetan at about grade vi you know so theres sps so im ptsrrrr rrrr rrrr rrrr ill make it somehow but i dont think it would be possible at grade v now the answer to that is what we call an sd search and discovery and when youre running an sd youre doing an ethics job and you know assessment isnt auditing and an sd is an assessment this fellow who saysthis fellow who says he doesnt do assessments well because he has gaes during assessment and so forth how could you have gae during an assessment its gross auditing error you cant have gaes during assessment unless you were auditing which is against the law you see assessing comes much closer to being an ethics action than technical action because its finding the suppressives finding the pts its patching up the arc breaks caused by life and the environment you see actually those people have impinged on the individual so therefore the auditor had better realize that these techniques there are some techniques such as the search and discovery sdsearch and discovery for the suppressive and arc break are not auditing actions at all but ethics actions so therefore you have to be bit of an ethics officer dont you well lets continue it out just little bit further and lets let you recognize when you are not getting any case gains while doing your best and dont keep cutting your throat start taking an ethics action now the ethics action thatd be taken against potential trouble source or ptssomebody connected with suppressivethe ethics action that can be taken with regard to that person is to do search and discovery you sometimes will have trouble with your search and discovery because you havent handled the arc break before you did it you say the guy looks like he has suppressive around well suppressives also arc break people and you mustnt even do an assessment on an arc broken person you must get the arc break first anybody who looks little bit sad has had an arc break for long time hes going into the sad effect now where your auditing will break down in the lower grades is on rock known as the sr and what can you do about him hes got case gain he has potential of case gain you are sitting there martian you audit him he tells you that you have made his finger better he runs immediately next door and says that youre gyp and fraud and ought to be killed he spreads wild tales about you around the neighborhood hes perfectly nice to your face chops you up behind your back do you get the idea that is not characteristic of an sr its because youve tried to help him that has made him mad at you other people also talk behind other peoples back because were not all brave but what can you do for this fellow what can you do for this fellow well now the only known actionand there is onethat can be taken with an sp is the last power process and that will handle an sp if you can get him to sit still and answer the auditing questions but you mustnt run it until some other processes have been seen to fail do you follow now where can you get that done well you can get that done in an organization which is qualified to run power processing and where i trust they have an auditor who can do it very well and where i also trust they have registrar who as soon as the person sits down and says everybody in seattle has audited and theyve gotten results at all will promptly call for the ethics officer and chuck the fellow out onto the street well you say thatshey wait minute you just saidyou just said that this power process would handle the guy and youre saying that he really couldnt get in to register well until such time as you run the mental hospitals throw him out in the street because hes the maddest hatter of them all hes the real psycho you actually have to put him in something like padded cell youd say well you answer the next auditing command and you can have your dinner three days later you give him his dinner but youre not equipped to handle this guy but im saying that person who gets case gain could in wellhandled hgc whose auditors know their business on power processing could in actual fact be audited up the line and out and squared around now when youve audited them on that remember you havent made grade v release this condition by the way is often mistaken you audit grade v processes but the person hasnt been bridged up to those processes and when youve audited the grade v processes youve got somebody who is prepared to do lowergrade release you havent got grade v release youve got somebody who can now be audited to grade 0 so therefore dont be so surprised sometime when you run into somebody who has been audited on grade v processes and who doesnt seem to be able to talk do you see do you see that power processes are circular but until such time as youve got very legal control of your environment and until such time as youve got available padded cells and you can handle everything that goes wrong and so forth youd be terribly wise to have registrar who the second somebody says well ive been out in california and ive been audited by everybody in california and the organization out there charged eighteen thousand dollars and i got place and ive never had any case gains and that sort of thingif you had smart registrar the smart registrar would instantly say well you just go over and tell ethics about it because im very sure they would like to hear all these complaints about these auditors and then if youve got clever ethics officer the ethics officer listens to all this and sorts it out and finds out whether or not this is an actual complaint if there arent just one or two auditors that made goof or whether this guy really hasnt beenhas been audited well and didnt make any case gains thats what the ethics officer has got to decide and if the ethics officer decides that this is an s youre taking your life in your hands to put that person into the hgc but now you say well thats pretty cruel line to take and we are very helpful persons well someday when you havent anything better to do go down in the jungle and find wounded water buffalo who is stuck in hole and go over barehandedly to help him out and if you go through that elementary exercise you will i think understand what i am talking about because thats whats going to happen youre going to get gored now these people can be broken up pretty quickly the only mistake they ever make in an hgc is running the preliminary power processes you dont you just saw right inblambo now all of this preamble is to give you taste of what ethics is all about ethics is not our effort to make ourselves right and the rest of the world wrong that is not that activity its not our service facsimile its how were gettingits how were getting in tech now we do organizationally we have tendency to be snappy and choppy with ethics and do this and that but the reason for that is is were slightly introverted because were bit pts against the environment around us we cannot depend on the governments or societies in which we exist to have any caliber or quality of justice or anything like that on the one hand the ethics officer is trying to protect the organization from the consequences of sps and ptses and on the other hand is trying also to bring about the justice which we so liberally pay for with income tax and nobody gives us there isnt any legal protection out there if its jungle its because ethics are out not because man is bad it might interest you how an sp comes about hes already got enough overts to deserve more motivators than you can shake stick at see he has done something to dish one and all in hes been bad boy now the reason he got to be bad boy was by switching valences he had bad boy over there and he then in some peculiar way got into that bad boys valence now he knows what he is hes bad boy see man is basically good but he mocks up evil valences and then gets into them you see he says the other fellow is bad the other fellow is bad the other fellow is bad see and eventually hes got this pasted up other fellow and one day he becomes the other fellow see in valence shift or personalitywhole complete package of personality and there he is and so hes now an evil fellow he knows how hes supposed to act hes supposed to act like the other fellow thats the switcheroo thats how evil comes into being the religionists have been veryhaving hard time trying to solve what evil was and that is what evil is its the declaration or postulate that evil can exist in the absence of postulates and the declaration of such man is good isnt that interesting when you take all of the furniture polish off and all the cast iron and old garbage and so forth out you find good person thats very lucky because were making very powerful persons and its very fortunate that theyre good persons quite interesting as mechanism it would not be safe to embark upon such an activity as scientology at all youd wreck the whole universe if that truth wasnt truth and it is truth it is the false mockedup valence which is the evil valence do you follow all right well this fellow has been assigning great evilness to another personality or type of personality and then one day he got into it and then when he was in this basically evil personality he started doing other people in and then other people got very tired of him or something of the sort and he got himself into an incident after which time never advanced now this is not the type of incident of which the r6 bank is composed this is another type of incident this is battle incident or some kind of an incident he is being attacked hes being actively attacked by other beings and he is stuck on the track now that portion of the time track or that point in time is more real than present time now every once in while you will be sliding around in dianetic auditing and once in blue moon you will suddenly have the incidentwell youall the time running one with just your interest on it the incident is more real than the environment in which you are and so on but you once in while will run into an incident which is far far far more real than any reality you ever experienced thuhh there it is boy now anybodys got few of these he isnt permanently stuck in them i remember the first time it ever happened to there was line of redcoats and the guns had never gone off it was very light little incident and it went flick and that was the end of that but just for that instant that line of redcoats was about the realest line of people i ever saw in my life there they were you see all ready for volley fire with their flintlocks you know it was an action back in the days you know when you tipped your hat and you said your first shot gentlemen and for some reason or other due to various complications why the volley had never arrived in fact the flintlock hammers were just about halfway down on the priming pan you know there they were they had to go the rest of that way and the guns had to fire andthats many many years ago and i said thats an interesting mechanism because i just saw it as mechanism since it wasnt very affecting to i wasnt worried about redcoats and i looked afterwards i looked for it to see if i couldnt find find it many many many years later i found it man i found it man and it isyou see anybody has got one or two or three of these things you see when they start in from scratch you know before they get up in the grades theyll have point there and theyre flicking around and all of sudden why there is fighter plane or there is the ground you know or there they are on the edge of the cliff and the arrow hasnt quite arrived and for just split instant as you see the thing boy that arrow is really real man that has made an impression well to that degree time has been stopped and when you run back into it youll find stopped picture but remember you and i are running back into it do you get the difference the sp never went on from there he never advanced from that moment hes there in totally absorbed attention and these walls to the s are phony and thin he knows where the real walls are the real walls are in that incident and that incident is more real to him than present time with every tick of the clock and that incident contains something it contains other personalities other vengeances but you moving around outside of this personyou moving around outside of this personare part of the dramatis personae of his incident and you are threat because all life is this incident there he is driven against the cliff and being butchered by man monsters hes next in the line of captives and in the trillions which followed hes always been next in the line of captives this person is living nightmare that was once very real it isnt as the psychiatrist said something which didnt exist i would never take the opinion of suppressive person on what the track was all about anyway hes always been the next one to be killed see maybe the other personnel out there are roman legionnaires or some pasttrack rome but whatever it is his bank got stackedstackedstacked stackedstacked till he longer had fluidity he longer could move on this track and then he got the business well you could only get the business that solidly if you yourself had enough overts to stretch from here to halifax and back but there he is and hes never been anyplace else not from that moment on you are the roman legionnaire you are part of the game now that is all there is to an sr there arent warped brain cells or numerous other things there arent thousands of answers to this it is that answer and you in practicing dianetic auditing run into mental image picture all right now person has lot of these mental image pictures now dont blame if persons mental image pictures perfectly accurate go back further than man likes to think he has lived dont blame for it because anybody you audit in dianetics will run into just that you audit them long enough and there they go man is an immortal being and he did not get born in at the beginning of this lifetime by the way if you want to argue with that get somebody to run you on some engrams so you fall through and see for yourself anyway the point is here that this is something that has happened to the fellow like hes being beat up by bunch of cops and there he is and he has never been out of being beat up by bunch of cops hes just stuck in time being beat up by the cops you see now that makes everyone he runs into copmale or female peculiarly enough his power of differentiation is zero everything equals everything in the incident and that is the boy and it makes him choose wrong targets he cant complete cycle of action because hes stuck in time it makes him perform little overts because hes defending himself continuously defending himself against the police now this is the character this is the character called an sp and he isnt anyplace else now of course with power processing he could be blasted loose and being blasted loose he is able to function again on the track and now he will respond to processing its as simple as that but how can cop or roman legionnaire audit him do you get the difference thats the only problem to be solved in handling an sp it isnt an auditing problem its problem of the identity of the auditor now you would just be amazed how many cases resolve in an institution i know ive put my collar on backwards many day and audited psychos in institutions in many yesteryear its amazing absolutely amazing some of the results ive had with this make sometimes little bit ashamed of myself that i dont push in that direction harder because institutions contain very few sps theyre ptses the sps are those in charge ive seen girl actually getting better and had psychiatrist run up to absolutely screaming you must get the familyyou must get the family of this person to consent to electric shock whats the matter well weve got to electric shock her whats the matter with the patient weve got to do it is the patient getting worse you dont understand well throw her out of here talking to nut complete nut person was getting better so they had to electric shock them the same person told that i didnt keep good records i should keep records that had the time and place connected with every single action as the predominant action and so forth and they kept good records and i saidits sort of like shooting at tame dogs to talk to these fellows i mean its cruel they miss all the obvious things like you know yes but what do you learn from your records you know question like that never occurs to them see what do you learn from your records well what do we learn then complete non sequituryou know ding dingding here comes the wagon complete non sequitur oh we learned if we didnt electric shock them they would get out of here six weeks earlier in each case yet he has to electric shock everybody see he even knows it doesnt help anybody hes gotten that brave see hes gotten that blatant now my only quarrel with psychiatry in actual sober fact is that its not cleaned up its profession its got dirty hands its not cleaned up its profession because if it cleaned up its profession it would be able to view the fact that some of the things they do get results and 90 percent of the things they do dont and that the cruelty and brutality which they levy against the insane or wage against the insane is not getting results if they knew about the mind they would know how to handle their own people so my only quarrel with psychiatry is their ethics are out do you follow now frieda frommreichmannthis is not my own opinion frieda fromm reichmann wrote book on it someday youll want to look it up its frieda frommreichmann and she was one of the greatest of greati think shes still aliveand she wrote book in which she begged throughout the book for the psychiatrist and his profession to get in his own ethics on his own practitioners that book is availablelibrary of congress and other places and she is probably the dean of all american psychiatry she was making feeble effort to get it in but thats the trouble now my only complaint against government is being bodies charged with the responsibility of getting in law and order never having isolated what puts lawlessness and disorder into the society never having made any effort to understand it but just shoots everybody so my quarrel with them is their ethics are out my only quarrel with politics and political theories and political practices just sum up to the same thing they do not produce an orderly society any system of politics which lets madman rise to supreme power is an evil system now you as an auditor are only able to push ethics in or blame sp or pts for your lack of results if you yourself have clean hands with your gaes if you yourself do not commit gross auditing errors then you are perfectly at liberty to handle ethics but as long as you yourself have any question then you will never quite know and this is the difference between confident auditor and an unconfident auditor and is the primary difference is it my auditing or is it the case im auditing that is the unresolved question is it my auditing which is getting gain or is it not possible to get gain on this case and that is why i started this lecture by telling you i dont have to make any apologies now were taking them all the way to clear and theres nothing going to be changed of any kind whatsoever in the lowergrade processing because the only time were flumping and flubbing is when ethics go out or technology is not followed it is omitted or added to you omit pieces of technology or you add to technology it will cease to work right now theyve got one going theyve got one going now which im sure is ended as of this afternoon theyve had one going about below 20 if the tone arm goes below 20 then horrible things will happen because person who is lowtonearm case will never experience any gain except on power processing that is the wildest misinterpretation i just wish theyd just forget about it i dont care anything about it anymore i dont want to hear about it anymore if the tone arm goes to 10 and stays there i dont wanteven want an instructor to say that is peculiar and particular and interesting phenomenon i dont want nobody to do nothing because apparently this is very dangerous cat and it will suddenly run and get all over and scratch everybody up like mad you see in actual fact this tone arm quite often in processing will go through 70 theres 70 and you go down there and you have to come back up over here or it goes all the way up through here and comes back on the dial there and this quite commonly happens in power processing and itll happen in lowergrade processing too this guys bank going upup upupupupup upupupupupupup and all of sudden you cant go any upupup well dont dont be dont despair because youll catch it over here you see bring it back over here to below 10 and all of sudden youll find its going upupup upupup cases are circular and the actual remark on this is that chronic lowta casethat is symptom of rather chronic apathy hes not dangerous case hes simply apathetic chronic lowtonearm case which is somebody whos chronically below 20 wont really get over it until hes on power processing and that is the total substance of the remark that started this whole thing so if i had very low tone arm case and i wanted to be very kind i would run the power process on him which would bring his tone arm up and then start him into auditing you see if i wanted to be very kind but if i had any doubts about its success or anything like that i would just audit him any old way hes going to get some gains in an apathetic way thats an additive thats an additive people are trying to get interpretations about below 20if the tone arm goes below 20 you do this or you do that or if the tone arm goes below 20 you cant get on the clearing course or you know its wild so tone arm goes below 20 it also goes to 70 ive seen an auditor practically faint when hes seen tone arm how the hell do you audit anybody at 70 you cant get the meter to go through actually there is way to do it you throw your trim knob you just flip your trim knob and youll come back on the dial of course its totally inaccurate read but you can make the meter go through 70 without catching it overup to 60 and then over to 10 and up throw your trim knob and youll throw him back on the dial then dont forget to compensate your meter before you say the next guy is released so theres an additive theres an additive i dont know how many people this additive has shot down in flames up to this moment its several several you know there are some fat folders around and so forth and fortunately it isnt i finding all this and so forth it is i that found this below 20 thing but it was already been stated to by somebody in the qual division thatthis there was common denominator in those folders they each one had below 20 trouble and so im getting shakedown of the relationship of fat folder to below 20 phenomena just as peculiarity thats going on at the moment thats an additive thats an additive now you get an omission and an omission can be very very deadly we cease to have sessions that start and end you know we dont start any sessions anymore and we dont end any sessions anymore we just sit down and start auditing you know pretty wild because it never completes cycle of action for the pc and has tendency to make him obsessively go on thats how bad an omission could be but your little omissions can cause you equal amounts of trouble your little omissions you see how about the omission of acknowledging supposing you never acknowledged anything you just omitted that totally youd destroy the entire technology do you see it could be very serious but your problem to get right back down to it again is how can you be sureyou see it used to be that we had three problems here ron could be wrong you see and it could be the auditor and it could be the pc see well now because of all the clears we have to drop the first one out nowso therefore it leaves an auditor with this problem and i dont give it to you as light thing i give it to you as something thats probably worried quite few of you from time to time is it the way youre applying the technology or is it the pc you are auditing and i have seen that auditorsbless themalways err on the side that its their own auditing i have tried to reason with an auditor who was trying desperately to audit pts who just kept on blaming her own auditingcouldnt even hear the technology of pts because she was blaming her own auditing so hard yet her own auditing wasnt that bad she was auditing pts and it was very very hard to convince this auditor that pts was the only reason somebody rollercoastered unless the auditing was very omitted or committed along various lines do you follow very hard to convince this person there could be something wrong with the pc because this person was too fixated on the idea that she really didnt know quite how to audit do you see that now therefore youve got to be satisfied that you dont commit gaes and after that your judgment on an ethics problem will be sound but until you are able to know completely yourself that your auditing is smooth and your technology is correct you will not with any certainty be able to spot an ethics problem makes sense huh audience voices yes now thats the primary bugaboo of the auditor youre trying to help people now is it something wrong with the person youre trying to help or is it something wrong with the way youre helping and theres very easy way to decide thisvery very very easy way to decide thisand that is to know what are the five gaes now we say gae and we mean gross auditing error there it is gross auditing error and there are only five of them you cant commit 105 because there arent 105 you can only commit five thats good thing because they can be spotted and isolated and they are very very elementary anybody could spot them you could make tape of yourself auditing some pc and then listen to the tape back and knewknow whether or not you committed gaes its that elementary first gae particularly would surrender to that test auditing cycle out do you give an auditing command have the pc answer it and then acknowledge it elementary do you do that or do you give an auditing command not let the pc answer it and acknowledge do you let the pc talk for half an hour before you finally wake up that you should acknowledge do you see or do you have this smoothly down can you do this thing boy its an elementary thing there isnt it well not to do it is gross auditing error its one of the reasons scientology works is because of its communication drill communication is basicso fundamental that when you use the communication cycle of action known in scientology man didnt know it you can just use cycle of action and cure things up its the most remarkable thing you can sit down with the training drills which just handle cycle of action and with bunch of people that have just dropped into the org or something of the sort and two or three of them will get rid of some somatics and upsets and feel better whats doing that its just the exercise of the drill itself so woven through auditing are all kinds of little side benefits but this is not little side benefit when you omit this one man youve had it so do you handle your comm cycle well or do you give an auditing command not let it be answered or make it be answered exhaustively before you finally acknowledge or do you hit it on the button do you err over or under because if you err in not acknowledging your pc will go into an obsessive outflow wherever i see pc whos just talking on and on and on and on and on and on and on the auditor giving commandsonly four commands issued in twoandahalfhour session see when i see this i know whats wrong its gae the auditing cycle is out the pc is trying to find that last step cant find that last step and hes gotten so accustomed to this now some pcs are this way obsessively in life but you oddly enough by precise auditing cycle snap them right out of it proper auditing command cycle and so forth will straighten them right up now youll notice people out in the societyyou should listen to their auditing cycles just for gag does your auditing cycle sound anything like that you should listen to few of them you know lean up against lamppost with your back to the two that are discussing it all or sit in the lobby of hotel for while just listen to those auditing cycles theyre not auditing cycles listen to comm cycles youll be fascinated man youve got treat in store if youve never done this you say how could anybody call that communication now thats the first gae now the second gae is the repetitive auditing cycle is out now the repetitive auditing cycle is quite something else than the auditing cycle its being able to do it again and people who arent able to do it again cannot give repetitive auditing command on and on they cant do it so they do what we call q and they change the pc makes remark so they change the process every time the pc gives something offbeat then the auditor changes the process do you see they qanda heres an example of q and orwell just the inability to do birds fly do birds fly do birds fly and acknowledge it each time and so forth its do birds fly are the jolly little sparrows awing are birds flopping about are birds have you ever been an ornithologist do you swim whered he go see the q and is simply thethe shift with the pc it leaves the pc in control of the session the auditor starts out do birds fly and the pc says yes yes i had canary once and the auditor says where was that pc says in des moines and the auditor says were you there when you were child and the pc says in about if you ever listen to this as gag going on i mean itllreally happens and when you listen to this going on you will begin to detect note of exasperation in the pcs voice bit of asperity will enter at this point well yes i lived there when i was four qanda qanda qanda drift you ask an auditoran auditor who does thisyou ask this auditor and you say to him now get the overt and he comes back with the life story of the fellows brother well thatll be compounded of q and but also this another one he just wouldnt do what you said you see he wouldnt audit it at all he didnt even come near it now the next gae is just bad meter reading and you would just be amazedyou would just be amazeduntil you have stood around teaching people to meter read youd just be amazed how in that group two or three of them wont even vaguely come near reading that meter if you ever want to find out whats wrong with some auditing session sometime and youve got an hgc auditor and youre d of or something like that and youre tearing your hair out about this pc remember these gaes man you get suspicious about things like how about the meter well the auditor has been auditing the pc with his meter uncharged well that would be understandable error but how about the fellow auditing the pc without the meter turned on could happen how about the auditor auditing the pc without the cans plugged in now thats what we mean when we say gae and you in trying to examine auditing will always err in the favor of being too reasonable about the thing you argue and argue and you argue and argue you talk and talk and talk with this auditor about the pc and then you find out that the auditor doesnt believe in meters and so doesnt use them in his session or something like this see i mean its gross and thats why we have gross you seeits gross error its always something big you see youre blowing your brains out trying to find this little thing do you have the trim knob set exactly right and all that sort of thing trim knob set right why the meters been out of repair for the last two months hasnt been functioning at all auditor rocks the meter to get his reads now an old experienced director of processing like mary sue could tell you some wild ones shes tried to run down and tried to run down andyou know the mysterious nonrecovery of somebody you see and shes finally run it down to something like well they never turned on their meter you know i mean its incredible here shes beating her brains out trying to help the pc you see but gross auditing error sitting right there now the fourth one impinges bit on the second one you told him to run one process and he ran something else it goes worse than that hes not able to read understand and follow procedure thats simple test thats simple test can you read and understand an hcob see that is simple test you would just be surprised when that gets to be gross auditing error the person didnt even read the hcobs related to the processes they were supposed to be auditing and to our shame it once happened here at saint hill there was checkouts required for short period of time many many months ago there were checkouts required nobody in tech or qual is there now not because of that totally but before they audited the hottest processes in the world nobody was requiring checkout on them boy thats gross auditing error man now one of the reasons tech was having hard time in 1965 in organizations is there apparently wasnt d of p anywhere in any organization in the world outside of saint hill that was requiring star rated checkouts on the lowergrade processes his auditors were supposed to be running on the pcs tsk interesting huh oh i get on to these things and i follow them up and dont think were all bad but that accounted for lack of releases of course they werent making any releases they werent running any of the processes that released anybody see thats gross auditing error is not being able to read and comprehend what theyre supposed to do or not reading it at all see how gross this is you say you dont you just seem to be an awful long time mr jones on the subject of making yourthat pcyou just making that pc grade 0 this isseems to have been onthis is going on to the third month seems to be just little bit long long so whats wrong what are you doing well actually the way youd find out what hes doing is his auditing cycle out his repetitive auditing cycle out is he reading the meter badly and what youre liable to find is something like number four he has never run to date any of the processes that make grade 0 release hes never run any of them its thatits that which you normally find at the bottom of results in auditing or its an ethics problem and the fifth one is unable to handle and keep pc insession well youd say well that automatically is covered in one two three four oh it is not who does that well ron does it of course he does everything else thats something that you do that is up to the auditor it is sometimes necessary to be quite forceful its sometimes necessary to be quite persuasive its sometimes necessary to do most extraordinary things to handle and keep pc insession for instance youve got somebody whos very blowy youre trying to pull some overts of one kind or another itsthis session is going rough man and you finally have to back up your back to the door turn the lock put the key in your pocket the guy finally gives you the overts see now this pc doesnt seem to be running well and you just never take out moment to find out why or examine the pc or talk about anything or have any twoway comm you see that the pc is disinterested you dont make it your business to find out why is the pc disinterested pc cant seem to answer the question for the last four hours of auditing doesnt seem to have had any answer to the auditing question is sitting in the chair crying why four hours ago didnt you wonder why this pc was unhappy do you see now thats actually matter of quick perception i used to say that it used to take about an houri could find from fortyfive minutes to an hour and half before the auditors in the org would notice that an arc break was coming or blow was going to occur it was fortyfive minutes to an hour and half i used to do this with squawk box you know patrol we used to listen in on the sessions and so forth i could find it on an average of fortyfive minutes to an hour and half before the auditor noticed it that pc is going to blow that pc is arc broken its coming right over the hilljust from tone of voice well the auditor in this particular instance had the advantage of sitting across from the pc having meter in his hands actually being able to observe what the pc was doing do you see and didnt notice it for another fortyfive minutes or an hour and half until it became terribly obvious so you want to pick up your perception and that is place where nearly all auditors fall down bit pick up the perception of whats going on with the pc be little bit interested in whats going on with the pc and do something about it and dont do so much that you completely destroy all effects of processing but do enough to keep the pc insession now what is insession well hes willing to sit there and answer the auditing question hes fairly cheerful and so on it has some precision definitions but crudely pc ought to be fairly happy about being audited even when he is running through sadness so that would be ability to look at the pc and see what was going on with the pc and that comes under the heading of willingness to confront pc doesnt it well those are the gross auditing errors auditing cycle out repetitive auditing cycle out bad meter reading not able to read understand and follow procedures or bulletins or auditing directions and five unable to handle and keep pc in session and those are the five gross auditing errors you can verify then your own auditing and if you look over the whole thingand you look over the thing and you say to yourself well i do those things pretty well now you know whether the pc is or is not an ethics case because if you do those things well and the pc doesnt run well that pc is an ethics case every time do you see now theres how you disentangle the myskery the whole problem of ethics is universal problem it is problem in mental troubles ethics would never get in on discipline alone never it would only get worse justice can never occur in the absence of an understanding of the human mind never you get nothing but goofs now that doesnt necessarily make somebody who is an expert on the human mind such as scientologist the only person who should have anything to do with justice on the planet or does it but i would not for moment guide you over into realm of high specialization in the field of justice because ethics simply exists to get tech in once youve got tech in you longer need justice we are the only road which leaves artificial measures of law and order behind us and its only the fact that we are handling aberration itself that makes it necessary for us to be in the zone of ethics now the amount of ethics action necessary in actual ots would be practically zero big difference and we notice that were not having any trouble with clears i noticed earlier that the divisional statistics exactly matched the case state of each divisional secretaryhow far he had goneor he or she had gone toward clear it was very interesting so therefore the problem of justice and the problem of ethics is involved with the problem of humanhuman aberration unless youve solved the latter the former can never be solved not all the gunpowder in the world could blow people into being good because theyre good naturally and they resent gunpowder so there also is how you can solve the problem of whether or not youre good auditor or not and why you should solve the problem and i hope this has been of some assistance to you thank you
