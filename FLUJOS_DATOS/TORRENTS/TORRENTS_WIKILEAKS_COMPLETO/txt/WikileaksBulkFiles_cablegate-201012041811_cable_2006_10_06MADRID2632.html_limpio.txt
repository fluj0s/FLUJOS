the ambassador hosted former president jose maria aznar for private lunch at his residence on october 16 president aznar offered his opinions on the domestic political situation as well as the outlook in latin america he also told ambassador of his satisfaction at seeing improved united statesspain relations despite the difficulties this presents to his party in opposition he told the ambassador that he fears the current government is presiding over the balkanization of spain end summary 2 c during their october 16 luncheon former president aznar told the ambassador that he views with satisfaction the improving gos relationship with the us over the past year aznar said that as spaniard he accepts this as positive development although it presents difficulties for his opposition partido popular pp comment maintaining the transatlantic relationship has long been one of the pps key platforms and pp leaders have hammered zapatero for upsetting ties with washington the pp has also criticized the zapatero government for steps it has taken that are important to the us such as the spanish deployment to afghanistan and lebanon while efforts to improve the bilateral relationship have eased the sting of this pp criticism pp leaders apparently have viewed usspain tensions as favorable to their interests aznars comments may reflect new approach on this subject we have told both the pp and the socialist party now in power to avoid using the us in their political football as this benefits neither spanish nor us interests end comment argentina chile peru colombia mexico 3 c aznar told the ambassador about his recent speaking tour in latin america he found that argentina is increasingly turning inward and that internal politics will be the dominant force in argentina for several years in chile he told the ambassador that president bachelet is strongly influenced by her fathers murder and her own torture during the pinochet regime aznar said that these experiences are more profoundly shaping her executive decisions than he had previously believed on peru aznar expressed his belief that alan garcia is new man who has cast aside the legacy of his previous administration and who is deeply committed to creating stability and economic opportunity he also said that president uribe appears very secure and established in colombia aznar saw deep internal divisions in mexico but he noted that the us border fence project is unifying force of antiamerican sentiment to the detriment of us relations with mexico eta basque country and catalonia 4 c aznar said he fears that the gos is presiding over the balkanization of spain by allowing the autonomous communities greater independence the pp feels that by allowing the 2006 catalonia referendum on autonomy the gos has opened the floodgates to demands for greater local control worse by entering into negotiations with eta the gos has nearly legitimized the basque selfdetermination movement aznar expressed his belief that the ongoing eta negotiations will fail he said that the only way to deal with eta is as criminal organization the negotiations never had chance for success he said because neither side ever had any room to maneuver or flexibility in their positions according to aznar eta will never abandon its demand for basque selfdetermination and the gos can never agree to that demand 5 c adhering to the party line aznar expressed confidence that the pp would win slim plurality in the approaching catalonia regional election note polling indicates that the catalan middle of the road ciu party is likely to win the regional election though it may have to form tripartite coalition to govern reftel the pp is not even assured place in that coalition as it currently is polling at around 10 percent in the region end note visit embassy madrids classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurmadrid madrid 00002632 0022 of 002 aguirre
