1105 of the copy right act provided special exception only for the communication of transmission em bodying performance or display of work by the public reception of the transmission on single receiving apparatus of kind commonly used in private homes7 essentially this exemption was limited to small businesses that turned on home radio or tele vision so that customers could hear or view the broadcast8 there was exemption for small businesses which originated the performance eg by playing compact discs on homestyle stereo the sonny bono act expanded the reach of the 1105 exception through two tiered exception 1 any establishment with less than 2000 gross square feet and any food service or drinking establishment with less than 3750 square feet may broadcast nondramatic musical work s without any apparent limit on the equipment uses9 2 any business establishment with great er than 2000 square feet and any food service or drinking establishment with greater than 3750 square feet provided that the establishment comply with additional requirements with respect to equipment use10 these exemptions however do not authorize an establishment to originate its own broadcasts of copyrighted mate rial that is an establishm ent may play the radio or show television broadcast without vi olating copyright law but the act still does not shield the same business when it plays for example cds protected by the copyright laws on the other hand for businesses with greater than 2000 square feet and food service or drinking establishments with great er than 3750 gross square feet the statutory exemption will only apply if 1 the performance of the radio trans mission incorporating nondramatic musical compositions is communicated by means of total of not more than 6

any audio portion of the performance or display is communicated by means of total of not more than 6 loudspeakers of which not more than 4 loudspeakers are located in any 1 room or adjoining space 12 for example under these conditions an extrem ely large restaurant with three seating areas may place two professional quality speaker s in each area and play radio programing through them without incurring an obligation to pay performance royalties to the composers in addition to the hardware restrictions the statute requires that the small business not directly charge customers to hear the transmission or retransmission13 furthermore the statutes requires that the transmission or retransmission is not further transmitted beyond the establishment where it is received14 and that the transmission or retransmission be licensed by the copyrigh t owner of the work so publically performed or displayed15 presuming that all of the statutory requirements are satisfied small business should be able to qualify under the newly amended exemption conclusion while small businesses are exempt from copyright infringement when they play radio and television programs they still need to obtain performance licenses to host live music performances of copyrighted material or publically play tapes or cds to their customers research does not uncover any other provisions of the copyright act which would definitively immuni ze public performances of audio tapes and musical cds in small business establishments from possible liability for copyright infringement
