report initial report that concluded that requiring cable and satellite operators to offer cable networks in an carte fashion either as replacement for the current expanded basic service tier or as an

caused some confusion neither report is based on model deve loped by the fcc itself rather each made relatively minor modifications to model and study performed by booz allen hamilton inc for the national cable telecommunications associati on yet as booz allen explicitly recognizes there is significant uncertainty involved in building an economic model for carte partly because of the large number of potential interactions and responses by c onsumers program networks and cable and satellite operators that must be modeled and partly because of the lack of empirical data especially on the response of househol ds to different carte prices per channel given the lack of data booz allen was not able to use standard economic methodology rather it had to employ an indirect approach and rely on number of potentially challengeable assumptions about how households cable and satellite operators and program networks would behave this indirect approach could not be avoided but given their reliance on host of assumptions that were of necessity formed in the absence of comprehensive em pirical data neither the booz allen study nor the two fcc reports should be viewed as providing definitive results it appears however that most of the criticisms of the initial report that are presented in the further report either are not supported by av ailable market data or cannot be proven one way or the other large tiers generally benefit those house holds that prefer wide variety of programming andor niche programming carte pricing generally benefits those households that watch only small number of networks and pref er general interest programming but could have serious implications for diversity requiring operators to offer all options might not meet the n eeds of all households however because the migration of some threshold number of households to carte pricing could undermine the economic feas ibility of large tiers technological change and the mandatory transition to digital television in 2009 are likely to precipitate new market dynamics and ultimately the current tiered business model may well give way to video on demand approach that is akin to carte pricing

satellite operator currently virtually all cable system operators make cable networks available to customers only in limited number of large tiers although many cable and satellite operators that are not heavily vertically integrated backward into program networks or program production would like the discretion to offer networks in an carte fashion or in small tiers as well as in large tiers they claim that the pricing imposed by the major programmers demanding much higher per subscriber fees if the network is not provided to high percentage of an operators subscribers makes it financially prohi bitive to offer their subscribers carte or small tier options see for example the testimony of james robbins president cox communications inc before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation march 25 2004 and the statemen t of matt polka president american cable association before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation january 31 2006 as result virtually all subscribers have the following choices the basic service tier typically consisting of package of local stations local broadcast stations and public educational and govern mental peg access programming plus few advertisersupported cable networks the expanded basic service tier consisting on average of 36 advertisersupported cable networks this tier typically includes many of the most popular cable networks ranging from nickelodeon and the discovery channel to mtv since approximately 90 of subscribers purchase the expanded basic servi ce tier most customers have this enhanced basic service tier in mind when they talk of basic service various premium tiers typically consisting of small package of premium program networks such as hbo and showtime usua lly offered without commercial advertising payperview channels with programming firstrun movies live concerts boxing matches sexuallyexplicit programming that subscribers pay for on programbyprogram basis in addition responding to congressional pressure most cable operators have begun offering family tier that is smaller and lowerpriced than the expanded basic service tier and consists of networks with programming targeted to families with children cable operators require subscribers to purchase the basic service tier in order to purchase any other tiers or channels most tiers are available in either analog or digital format but digital tiers tend to offer additiona l purchasing options as well as high definition video the direct broadcast satellite dbs distributors of multichannel television also offer the bulk of advertisersupported networks on single tier analogous to cables expanded basic service tier with additional premium tiers and payperchannel programming availablethe fccs carte reports overview

9 2006 current fcc chairman kevin martin released further report that appears to contradict the first one concluding that for the 40 of cable households and 100 of satellite households that already receive digital service carte purchasing is likely to lower the monthly bill3 neither of these reports was supported by the full commission and each was released as an unofficial report these inconsistent findings by the expert agency have caused some confusion about whether imposing an carte regulatory requirement would benefit consumers the purpose of this report is to explain how these two reports reached differing conclusions and to analyze the different assumptions and calculations used in each neither report is based on model developed by the commission itself rather the initial report made relatively minor modifications to some i nput values in model and study performed by booz allen hamilton inc booz allen for the national cable telecommunications association ncta which submitted the study as an attachment to its filing in the commissions proceeding on carte pricing4 the results presented in the initial report were prepared by rerunning the booz allen study with the changed parame ter values the further report challenged some of the calculations and assumptions used in the initial report and reran part of the model to show the impact on the model results of changing several of those parameter values as result both the initial report and the further report are affected by the limitations of the booz allen study yet as booz allen explicitly recognizes there is significant uncertainty involved in building an economic model for carte partly because of the large number of potential interactions and responses by consumers program networ ks and cable and satellite operators that must be modeled and partly because of the lack of empirical data esp ecially on the response of households to different carte prices per channel5 given the lack of data booz allen was not able to use standard economic methodology rather it had to employ an indirect approach and rely on numbe r of potentially challengeable assumptions about how households cable and satellite operators and program networks would behave this indirect approach could not be avoided but given their reliance on host of assumptions that were of necessity formed in the absence of comprehensive empirical data neither the booz allen study nor the two fcc reports which present results generated by rerunning the b ooz allen study with minor calculationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs3 6 on may 18 2004 house commerce committee chairman joe barton ranking member john dingell telecommunications subcommittee chairman fred upton telecommunications subcommittee ranking member edward markey and representative nathan deal sent detailed letter to thenf cc chairman powell asking the fcc to perform study within six months that would provid information needed to make an informed decision on the potential merits and drawbacks of proposals to allow cable and satellite operators to offer programming to their subscr ibers on an carte or themedtier basis they asked the fcc to determine the extent to which cable and satellite operators had the option of purchasing individual cable networks and of offering them to subscribers on an carte basis to study the likely impact of carte and themedtier offerings on retail rates to investigate the likely impact of carte and themedtier offerings on advertising continuedcorrections and parame ter values tweaked should be viewed as providing definitive results also neither the booz allen study nor the two fcc reports attempt to perform quantitative analysis of alternative policy options that might affect the availability and pricing of cable ne tworks these include requiring program networks to ma ke their networks available to cable and satellite system operators on an carte basis but continuing to give those operators the discretion to offer service as they see fit ie in large tiers only or with carte or small tier options prohibiting broadcasters that also own cable networks from requiring cable and satellite operators to carry those cable networks in order to receive retransmission consent to carry the broadcast programming prohibiting the current program network practice of contractually imposing strict nondisclosure requirements on cab and satellite operators concerning the subscriber fees they are charged this practice denies operators access to information on the prices paid by other operators and therefore places them at negotiating disadvantage visavis the networks despite the limitations in the booz allen study it is possible to compare the two fcc reports as will be discussed below it appears that most of the criticisms of the initial report that are presented in the further report either are not supported by available market data or cannot be proven one way or the other conclusions of the initial report in may 2004 leaders in both the house and senate commerce comm ittees asked the federal communications commissi on to collect

public co mment on factual questions regarding the provision of carte and th emetiered services on cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems7 substantive comments were filed by more than 70 interested parties 12 economic analyses were attached to these comments8 the initial report summarized the comments and analysis submitted it also incorporated statements made by expert witnesses at an carte symposium sponsored by the fccs media bureau9 the fcc did not undertake an empirical study of its own rather it performed analysis by modifyin g some of the assump tions and parameter values in the booz allen study and reporte d how those changes affected the results it did not however give full explanation of all the changes it made to the booz allen study to reach its own empirical conclusions the major conclusions of the initial report at pp 67 were an carte requirement likely would increase operational expenses for multichannel video program distributors mvpds in three main areas 1 equipment and infrastructure 2 customer service operations and 3 billing and back office support unless constrained by regulation many of these increased costs would likely be passed on to subscribers resulting in higher subscriber fees under an carte mandate networks formerly sold in tiers would need to significantly increase their marketing expenses to induce consumers to affirmativ ely select the networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs5 any type of carte requirement would have significant negative effect on program networks adve rtising revenues and license fee structure this may cause many program networks to fail thus adversely affecting diversity the most likely to feel the brunt of such mandate would be networks serving small niche interests such as religious programming programming aimed at minority interests arts programming and independently owned networks the impact on program networks seems likely under either mandatory or voluntar carte regime under mandatory carte purch asing requirement only those house holds that would purchase fewer than 9 advertisersupported cable networks might see reducti on in their monthly cable bill households that purchase at least 9 such networks would likely face an increase in their monthly bills today the average cable household watches pproximately 11 adve rtisersupported cable networks plus 6 broadcast channels carried by their cable operator in week if the average household purchased each of the 11 advertisersupported cable networks under an carte regime it likely would face an increase in its monthly bill under carte purchasing of between 14 and 30 public policy should focus on creating incentives for more mvpd competition in the marketplace nd for fostering video on demand digital video recorders and video ove r internet protocol that give the public more control over their video choices broadcasters that also are producers of cable programming in their retransmission consent negotiations with cable and satellite operators sometimes tie access to their popular broadcasting programming to the purchase and carriage of less attractive or less desired cable network which may be anticompetitive and harm consumers but the antitrust authorities not the fcc are best positioned to remedy this situation conclusions of the further report on february 9 2006 current chairman martin released the further report which challenged many of the assump tions underlying the initial report and identified an alleged methodological error in the initial report the further report like the initial report was not adopted by the full commission the further report presented results from rerunning the orig inal model but using parameter values reflecting different underlying assump tions and correcting for the alleged methodological error in the initial report with these changes the further report found at pp 45 that under carte the 40 of cable households and 100 of satellite households that already get digita l service and thus do not have tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs6 10 further report at p 6make an additional payment for settop box could receive as many as 20 channels 14 advertisersuppor ted cable networks plus 6 local broadcast stations without seeing an increase in their monthly bills this is 3 more than the 17 channels that the average household watches in week if household already gets digital service under carte pricing it could purchase 11 advertisersupporte d cable networks plus 6 local broadcast stations and face change in its bill ranging from 13 decrease to 4 increase with decrease in 3 out of 4 cases carte pricing may be even more favorable to consumers than the model results suggest because the booz allen study incorrectly assumes that shift to carte pricing would cause households to watch 2 hours less tele vision per day which would represent an almost 25 decrease in viewing under the more appropriate assumption that viewing would not decrease substantially advertising revenues are unlikely to fall substantially licensing fees are unlikely to increase substantia lly and therefore households could purchase additional carte ch annels without paying more than under the current expanded basic tier regime bundling may drive up retail prices making video programming less affordable and causing some consumers not to purchase mvpd services carte and increased themed tiers could give consumers the opportunity to lower their cable bills by purchasing fewer channels or smaller packages carte pricing could make it easier for some new networks to enter the market because advertisers and cable distributors might find it easier to judge the value of smaller networks if consumers were able to express their in terests through subscriptions carte pricing might provide programming that households value more than tiered programming because it might result in more programming that is highly valued by niche audience andor more general interest programming that is widely valued the further report specifically concludes that mixed bundling alternative in which households that receive digital servi ce could purchase on an carte or tiered basis while the households that get analog service continue to purchase on tiered basis is likely to benefit consumers10 while today approx imately 40 of cable households and all sate llite households subscribe to dig ital service that penetration level will increase over time as households migrate to the new digital technology andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs7 11 the mandate is in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 12 economic rents are payments made to f actor that are in excess of what is required to elicit the supply of that factor 13 according to the initial report however commission staff reran the booz allen model with the modified assumption that the cash flow of program networks was limited to 10 of revenues and the results still showed the need to substantially increase subscriber fees see the initial report at p 91 this might sugg est that the efficiency losses from an carte regime might overwhelm any reduction in economic rents but as discussed below this result may be the consequence of the im plicit assumption in the booz allen study that any reduction in compensation to programmers would reduce program qualitywill reach 100 when the digital television transition is completed in 2009 as mandated by law11 points of contention what are the implications of the assumptions in the booz allen study that the program networks and cable and satellite operators could raise prices as needed to main tain their cash flow and that current levels of compensation are needed to maintain program quality two key assumptions in the booz allen study are that both the program networks and the cablesate llite operators would take an pricing actions necessary to maintain their current cash flow if they were required to offer carte pricing or small tiers in the model to the extent that mandatory carte or small tier offerings would cause decrease in advertis ing revenues andor an increase in costs for program networks those networks w ould be made whole by commensurate increase in the subscriber fees charged to operators in turn operators would be made whole for any decrease in advertising revenues and increase in subscriber fees and other costs by commensurate increases in the prices subscribers pay for both carte and tiered options these constant cash flow ssumptions appear to preclude one of the potential benefits of carte pricing creating market forces that might place downward pressure on program pricing at both the wholesale and retail level this is significant because it is widely r ecognized that while large tiers represent potentially efficient way to distribute programming and may well result in consumer benefits they also provide way for networks to price discriminate which is often an effective way for most of the benefits to flow to programmers as what economists call producer surplus rather than to c onsumers consumer surplus that is although the large tiers appear to provide an efficient marketing and distribution platform they also may increase the ability of producers of must have television programming to squeeze dditional economic rents12 from consumers13 the booz allen model further assumes that any decrease in network revenues would reduce program quality which appears to be based on the implicit presumption that the talent creating the programming must continue to earn current levels of compensation or program quality would fall but that talent athletes actors directors producers today earns economic rents that mig ht be eroded withouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs8 14 for example in the march 25 2004 senate commerce committee hearing on escalating cable rates causes and solutions james r obbins of cox communica tions stated that he opposed any requirement that cable operators be required to offer networks on an carte basis but that cox would consider offering separate sports tier in that hearing mark goldstein director of physi cal infrastructure at the government accountability office indicated that sports programming represents the best choice of programming for separate tier 15 interestingly although programming of major sports is viewed by cable and satellite operators as must have programming the sports programmers report financial losses from winning the rights to these major sports fo r example news corp reported on february 12 2002 that it took 909 million operating charge in the second quarter because of its three major professional sports television contracts according to steve sternberg senior vice president and broadcast research director at tn media theres cachet to having sports especially major sports theyre like loss l eader sports promote the networks primetime lineups and sports are one of the things that drive people to their internet sites sports programmers apparently have made the strate gic business decision to get into competitive bidding environment to attain the rights to popular sports events even with the knowledge that if they win the bid they would be unlikely to recoup those costs directly from the sports programming shown rather sports pr ogrammers may expect to benefit indirectly by exploiting the sports events to market their other programming to the highly desirable teenage and young adult male audience both by crossmarketing their other programs and by branding their networks those programme rs of course seek to recover as much of the costs as possible from progra m distributors through the ve ry high per subscriber fee imposed on cable operators and for those sports programmers that own broadcast networks through attempts to get their local sta tions affiliates to share the cost burdenharming program quality such erosion would be beneficial to consumers for example if market forces imposed limits on how much cable and broadcast networks could bid for the rights to baseball bask etball and football ga mes club owners might not be able to maintain the current salary structure for athletes but one might expect that virtually all of those athletes are likely to continue to play their sport at say half of their current salary because that leve l would still far exceed what they could earn in any alternative occupation the booz allen study chose not to addr ess another potential impact of carte pricing on economic rents the study combines sports networks and general entertainment networks into single network category because some general entertainment networks offer some sports programming but the subscriber fees charged for sports networks are many multiples of those for any other networks including general entertainment networks when the sports network fees are imposed on all subscribers to the expande d basic tier those households that do not view the sports networks are almost certain ly subsidizing sports viewers even some critics of mandatory carte pricing have conceded that separate sports tier or carte pricing of spor ts networks might well benefit cons umers overall14 since the two fcc reports rely on the booz allen st udy they were not able to address the impact of requiring separate s ports tiers or carte pr icing of sports networks on overall costs to households or on program diversity ie whether the inclusion of sports programming on large tier increases revenues that are used to support diverse programming or simply genera tes revenues that flow b ack to talent as economic rents15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs9 16 booz allen study at pp 2627 and 30 17 according to the booz allen study at p 27 cable networks with lower distribution historically have generated less advertising revenues per rating point than those that have coverage of 50 to 70 of households 18 booz allen study at p 49 19 booz allen study at p 51 20 see the further report at p 24do the booz allen study and initial report overstate the extent to which an carte requirement would reduce advertising revenues as th further report alleges the booz allen study and hence also the initial report assume that an carte requirement would s ubstantially reduce the adve rtising revenues of both program networks and cablesatellite operators for several reasons16 overall television viewing would fall because carte viewers would have more limited options for channel surfing advertisers value potential audience reach as well as actual audience size and with carte network would have as much potential reach since some households would longer receive the network signal17 with smaller average audience viewing each cable spot advertisement advertisers would need to increase the number of cable spots purchased to reach the same audience but this increases the risk of viewer wear out when viewer sees too many repetitions of an advertisement overall cable advertising would be less effective medium based on these arguments the booz alle n study assumes that program networks would suffer 10 to 20 decrease in adve rtising revenues per rating point that coupled with significant decrease in ratin g points as viewership falls would result in 20 to 30 decrease in advertising re venues under the assumptions of the model this revenue loss woul d have to be countered by dollar for dollar increase in subscription fees18 similarly it assumes carte pricing would result in 13 to 23 reduction in local advertising revenues generated by the cablesatellite operators19 the model assumes that the operators would have to increase the carte prices charged to households and to lesser extent the tiered prices charged to households to compensate for the in creased costs associated with higher subscription fees and lower local adve rtising revenues thus the models assumptions about the impact of carte pricing on advertis ing revenues have significant impact on the carte prices charged and on the number of carte channels household could purchase wit hout paying more than under the current tiered system while there is merit to the booz allen analysis as far as it goes it fails to recognize possible countervailing impacts of carte pricing on the advertising market that have been identified by others carte pricin g provides advertisers with more readily measurable data on the number and demographics of those households that value networks programming sufficiently to purchase it20 especially given that nielsen market research does not currently collect ratings data for the vast majority of small cable netw orks the data provided by list of actualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs10 21 further report at p 4purchasers could foster advertising on so of those networks also under carte networks might have an opportunity to raise advertis ing rates to advertisers of specialty products related to niche programming who seek select audience with high intensity of demand for the niche programming and for the specialty products advertised thus it may well be that the booz allen study and initial report overstate the negative impact that carte pricing may have on both program networks and operators and hence the exte nt to which that effect might raise carte prices it is not possible to estimate how significant this possible overstatement might be but it suggests that the breakev number of carte networks might be greater than indicated by the booz allen study or initial report do the booz allen study and the initial report overstate the extent to which carte pricing would decrease average television viewing per household as the further report alleges the further notice claims that the booz allen study and initial report assume without any basis that shift to carte would cause consumers to watch more than 2 hours less television per day that is the study assumes consumers would watch nearly 25 less television21 this claim misinterprets the initial report the initial report assumes that overall viewing of adver tisersupported networks would decrease by 23 because under an carte option fewer households would receive each of these networks so casual viewing would be eliminated at the same time it ssumes that households would increase their hours of viewing of those advertisersuppor ted networks they purchase on an carte basis of the local broadcast networks carried by their cable or satellite operator and of premium networks payperview networks and video on demand although the booz allen study does not measure what those additional hours would be it is assumed that total viewing would decrease but by significantly less than 23 thus while one could ch allenge the assumption that viewing of advertisersupported networks would fall 23 the gene ral thrust of this criticism of the further report does not appear to be accuratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs11 22 booz allen study at pp 2728 23 further report at pp 2627do the booz allen study and the initial report overstate the additional marketing costs imposed by an carte requirement as the further report alleges the booz allen study assumes that unde r mandatory carte pricing on average advertisersupported cab networks would have to increase their marketing expenditures from the 26 of total net re venues they are today to 1525 of total net revenues22 the study claims that marketing expenditures are relatively small today because the networks can focus th eir marketing activities on reaching operators and can partner with those operators to mark et to viewers once network is carried by cable or satellite operator on the expanded basic tier marketing to viewers is relatively limited because cha nnel surfing is costless to the networks and cross network marketing within the tier is relatively low cost activity under carte however the marketing focus would have to shift to marketing directly to consumers reaching nonsubscribers and convincing th em to pay for network poses more significant challenge than most networks face today networks cannot gain viewers from among nonsubscribers from channel rfing and crossne twork marketing is not efficient if the subscriber does not have immediate access to the second network as it would have on the tier thus the ma rketing task booz allen argues is more akin to the marketing challenges of premium channels such as hbo and of consumer packaged goods companies those companies spend approximately 15 27 of their product revenues on marketing the further report challenges this assump tion it cites study by the cable and telecommunications associa tion for marketing that found that less than half of viewers find new channels th rough channel surfing and thus argues that networks are already confronting the problem of marketing themselves to nonsurfers even with bundling23 this criticism is also open to challenge networks today do lot of cross network marketing the efficiencies from ch marketing is one of the market forces fostering the creation of brand identities and families of networks espn discovery fox etc independent networks focus their marketing efforts on getting onto expanded basic tiers not on consumer hous eholds virtually all the independent networks that filed comments in the fcc proceeding stated they would face very difficult marketing burdens in an carte environment in addition to the costs of initially capturing paying viewers cable networks would have to spend money to retain customers there is general agreement that customer churn is lower for bundle of services than for individuallysol d services all of these factors suggest that the booz allen study and the initia l report made reasona ble assumptions about the increase in marketing expenses if carte pricing were mandatory httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs12 24 further report at p 4 25 letter from john frelinghuysen vice president booz allen hamilton inc to dr leslie marx chief economist federal communi cations commission dated december 16 2005 available in electronic filing comment syst em on the fcc website wwwfccgov under mb docket 04207is the methodological correction to the booz allen study proposed and calculated in the further report the appropriate correction there are two key calculations in the booz allen study first the price that the cablesatellite operator would charge for each carte adver tisersupported network is calculated this is done by increas ing current average video revenues per household 55 by the percentage n eeded to recover the new programming customer service and other costs associated with carte pricing then subtracting from that amount those revenues that are not generated by advertisersupported networks ie revenues gene rated from set top box rental s premium networks pay perview and video on demand rvices and the broadcast channels offered over the basic tier this figure is then divide d by 11 the average number of advertiser supported networks viewed pe r household in week to obtain the carte price per network that the operator would charge to maintain its cash flow level the second calculation attempts to determine the breakeven number of advertiser supported networks that household would purchase to keep its total spending at 55 this is calcu lated by subtracting from 55 all of the revenues that are not generated by advertis ersupported networks and then divi ding that figure by the carte price generated in the first calculation in 2005 more than year after the initia l report had been released the fcc staff noticed that the booz allen study had incorporated methodological error by failing to exclude the revenues generated from the broadcast channels premium channels and payperview and video on demand services from the first calculation the further report claims that upon correctin g for this error the model shows that on average those households th at already have digital serv ice would have lower costs under an carte regime because the carte price would be lower and thus households could purchase more than 11 carte networks without paying more than 5524 but in letter that booz allen sent to the fcc after being informed of the methodological error but before th further report had been released25 booz allen explained that it had made the same met hodological error failing to exclude the revenues generated from the broadcast ch annels premium cha nnels and payper view and video on demand services in th second calculation and that therefore the same correction had to be made to the s econd calculation as well it further stated that when the corrections were made in both calculations the results were almost identical to those in its original study when both these adjustments are made the estimated number of cable channels that consumer would be able to purch ase on an carte basis does not differ significantly from the results in our 2004 report the 2004 report estimated thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs13 26 see further report at p 10 4 and footnote 20 27 booz allen at pp 3538 28 initial report at p 6 29 further report at pp 3036digital customers would be able to purchase 7 to 9 carte cable channels while analog customers would be able to purchase 6 to 7 making the two offsetting adjustments results in range of 8 to 10 channels for digital customers and 6 to 8 channels for analog customers the further report does not ma ke any mention of this second methodological error and it appears that it did not correct for this error26 booz allen is correct that the correction must be made in both calculations thus this criticism in the further report does not appear to have merit do the booz allen study and the initial report overstate the extent to which carte pricing would decrease program diversity as the further report alleges the booz allen study claims that mandating carte pricing would lead to less diverse programming than today and that the reduction would be larger the greater the number of households that migrate to carte27 it assumes that the program networks substantial reductions in advertising revenues and increases in marketing costs would force them to significantly rais subscriber fees charged to operators and that the operators in turn would have to charge carte customers between 4 and 5 per network they conclude that emergi ng networks in par ticular would not be able to attract sufficiently large audiences in this environment to survive projecting that half to threequarters of emerging networks would fail unde r carte and that new network launches would be extremely rare based on this analysis the initial report concludes that many program networks may fail thus adversely affecting diversity the most likely to feel the br unt of such mandate would be networks serving small niche interests such as religious programming programming aimed at minority interests arts programming and independently owned networks28 the further report questions these conclusions29 claiming that carte could be preferable to bundling in providing diverse programming responsive to consumer demand for two reasons first it agues th at because their goal is to maximize the price and sales of the bundle cable and satellite ope rators in many circumstances will have an incentive not to provide networks that have programs similar to existing programming even if that programming would be valued by many customers for example some mainstream networks might not be carried because they might not increase total subscribership as much as unique niche network might second bundling can obscure signals regarding consum er valuations of individual networks the first argument would seem relevant if the public policy goal were to best meet consumer demand even if to do so would expand general interest progra mming at the expense of diverse programming but diversity of voices is fundamental goal of us media policy and the further repor t does not refute the fact that niche networks could be significan tly harmed by carte pr icing the second argumenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs14 30 the further report criticizes the booz allen study and initial report for making the simplifying assumption that the carte pric for all advertisersupported networks would be the same further report at p 8 10 this assumption excludes the scenario of household purchasing larger number of lowpriced channels and still not increasing its total spending but the assumption has an equa l impact in the other direction it excludes the scenario of household purchasing fewer highpriced channels before increasing its total spending therefore this assumption appears to have neutral impact 31 on the other hand very low carte pr ices for some networks would place downward pressure on the per subscriber fees those networks charge operators and thus could undermine the viability of those networks 32 as long as networks have been prov ided to consumers on tiered basis without individual prices such data are not available 33 in their contracts with operators the pr ogram networks insist on strict nondisclosure clauses and the fcc has not required partie s to provide such data even under strict confidentiality agreementshas merit to the extent that certain niche programming with small audiences that have high intensity of demand an d demographics favorable to advertisers might benefit from an carte approach but overall due to the scale economies associated with program networks niche networks tend to be placed at disadvantage in an carte market at the same time the conclusions in the booz allen study appear to be overstated those conclusions are based on assumed car prices of 4 to 5 per network generated by that study although the subsequent corrections to the booz allen study continued to show that under carte pricing most households would receive fewer networks for the same price they also yielded significantly lower carte prices in the range of 254 to 337 the prices for niche networks and new networks would certainly be well below those averages30 thus booz allens pessimistic projection that half to three quarters of emerging networks would fail which is based in part on inflated 4 to 5 carte prices appears to be an overstatement31 nonetheless it is true that requiri ng households to commit to 250 per month or more for new network sight unsee n is likely to impede demand for new networks and make it especi ally difficult for independent networks that do not have any opportunity to introduce some of their progra mming on an existing sibling network as new discovery or espn or fox networ k would be able to do can specific conclusions be reached from the two fcc reports in the absence of key empirical info rmation on households elasticity and intensity of demand fo r particular types of program networks32 program networks license fees for providing networks on an carte vs tiered basis33 and cable and satellite operators retail charges for providing networks in an carte vs tieredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs15 34 as long as networks have been prov ided to consumers on tiered basis without individual prices such data are not available 35 for example during the question and answer portion of the march 25 2004 senate commerce committee hearing cox communications president james robbins stated that once digital cable has been fully deployed th cable business plan will become video on demand model with most programming provided on an carte basis but he stated that was future business model that could not be implemented until the industry undertook an additional 30 billion in needed capital investment 36 subscribers to digital cable and satellite typically have access to many more tiers than do analog subscribers and increasingly have access to video on demand services but operators generally charge monthly fees fo r these capabilities for example echostar charges 500 monthly service access fee to all accounts that do not subscribe to one of its basic programming packages and also charges 500 transaction fee for removing programming or for changing from one likepriced package to another fashion34 none of the studies or reports issu ed to date can be deemed definitive though an carte approach could have serious implications for diversity large tiers generally benefit thos households that prefer wide variety of programming andor niche programming while carte pricing generally benefits those households that watch only small number of networks and pref er general interest programming requiring operators to offer all options might not meet the needs of all households however because the mig ration of some threshold number of households to carte pricing could undermine the economic feasibility of large tiers are market forces likely to affect the program networks current tiered business model most observers agree that technological change is likely to precipitate new market dynamics and that ultimately the tiered business model currently employed by the large programmers will give way to video on demand approach that is akin to carte pricing35 but that change will not take place immediately and indeed there remain questions about how programmers will be ab to construct viable video on demand business plan for ex ample how will the literally hundreds of thousands of programming options be marketed and priced and what tools will consumers have to efficiently track down their choices among the huge available inventory in the interim the entry of competing distribution avenues through telephone company broadband rvices or even internet video streaming may strengthen the negotiating position of prog rammers visavis distributors and may allow programmers to retain tiering for the foreseeable future multiple tiers and carte pricing impose higher transactional costs to restrict access to those networks the hous ehold chooses to purchase and to bill households for their selections that dete r demand those subscribers that already purchase digital service or payperview serv ice have settop boxes that could readily accommodate these transactional tasks36 but more than half of all cable subscribershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs16 37 according to the fccs 12th annual report to congress on video competition at 52 and table 8 the five largest cable operators digital subscriber counts equal 41 to 58 of their total basic cable subscribers 38 all satellite service is digital and thus can accommodate multiple tiers or carte pricing today 39 the mandate is in the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 40 according to data in the 2005 tv sourcebook attached to the december 19 2005 edition of broadcasting cable and in kagan world media economics of basic cable networks continuedcontinue to receive analog cable service37 and these customers would require settop boxes which rent for approximately 450 pe r television set in multipletier or carte environment38 twotelevision households that would have to pay an additional 900 monthly for settop boxes ar unlikely to see savings from multiple tier or carte pricing but the migration of households from an alog to digital customer premises equipment is likely to be sped up with the statutorily mandated february 17 2009 deadline for the conversion from analog to digital broadcast television39 in addition there are number of technolog ical changes that are likely to foster multiple tiers and carte pricing from both supplyside and demandside perspective most prominently the development and deployment of internet protocol television iptv already being deployed by some telephone companies and likely to be deployed in the future by both telephone companies nd cable companies will allow broadband providers to offer subscribers access to i ndividual programs or blocks of programs on an ondemand basis through settop boxes that call up particular program rather than requiring the broadband provider to broadcast all the programming to the household moreover new technologies such as di gital video recorders dvrs such as tivo which allow consumers to better control the timing and choice of their programming viewing are creating demand for programming more closely attuned to individual customer tastes which tends to be consistent with an carte or video on demand approach also recent deals be tween various programmers and internet applications and equipment providers wh ich allow customers to download individual firstrun programs for fixed charge is creating demand for cartelike program access and pricing key market development is the try of both large and small telephone companies into the video market some times using iptv technology these new entrants intend to compete with the cable companies for the triple play provision of voice video and data services given the firstintomarket advantages of the cable and satellite video providers the telephone companies may seek to compete by using different business model with multiple smaller tiers or carte options and even video on demand made possible by the new technologies they are deploying unlike many of the large cable and satellite companies that are vertically integrated into program networks and even program production40 however thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33338crs17 40 continued 2003 table entitled cable networks owned by number owned may 2004 time warner has total or significant ownership interest in 13
