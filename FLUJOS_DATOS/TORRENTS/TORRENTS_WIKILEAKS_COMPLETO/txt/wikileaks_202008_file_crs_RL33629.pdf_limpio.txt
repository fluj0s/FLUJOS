pipeline safety regulators have acknowledg ed that lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines like bps north slope pipelines should be under stricter federal oversight the federal office of pipeline safety ops must promulga new regulations covering such pipelines by december 31 2007 in the meantime the agency has responded to bps problems under its curre nt regulations the opss corrective action orders since march 2006 have revealed the extensive corrosion problems in bps north slope pipelines have likely prevented additional oil spills and have facilitated bps restoration efforts as bps activities continue congress ma consider ensuring that prudhoe bay area pipeline restoration and ops rulemaki ng remain on schedul congress may review the specific requirements of the opss proposed lowstress pipeline regulations to ensure they appropriately balance safety benefits and implementation costs congress may also act to ensure that the ops strictly enforces all its pipeline safety regulations so that incremental problems in particular systems do not accumulate and lead to major supply disruptions in addition to these issues congress may opt to assess how us pipeline safety regulation fits within the nations overall strategy to ensure the reliability of critical energy infrastructure most observers would argue that federal efforts to protect pipelines either from accidents or security risks should be consis tent in their consideration of pipeline criticality to the nations energy supplies reviewing how the federal government industry and private groups work togeth er to achieve

cfr 1952 according to the ps federal pipeline safety regulations originally did not apply to lowstress pipelines because they operated at low pressures were not prone to accidents and were thought to pose little risk to the public in 1990 however major heating oil spill from an underwater lowstress pipeline in new york prompted ops to begi n developing safety regulations for such pipelines11 the pipeline safety act of 1992 s ubsequently prohibited the exemption of pipeline facilities from ops sa fety regulation solely b ecause they operate at low stress 49 usc 60102k ops analysis of data the agency received under its lowstress pipeline rule making showed that regulation of all such pipelines would not be costeffective the agency therefore chose to focus on lowstress pipelines posing higher public and nvironmental risk based on their location and the commodities they carried in 1994 ops extended its hazardous liquid pipeline regulations under 49 cfr 195 to include lowstress

the prudhoe bay west operating area pbwoa on the north slope of alaska the company isolated and shut down the affected section of pipeline and began cleaning up approximately 5000 ba rrels of oil spread over two acres of adjacent land the shutdown initially caused north slope oil pr oduction to fall by approximately 100000 barre ls per day although bp restored most of that volume by midapril using other pipelines17 subsequent investigation by bp revealed at least six additional areas of corrosion along the pipeline which had last been inspected internally in 1998 at the time of the sp ill bp did not have program for regular inspection or cleaning of its north slope pipelines internally using pigs devices that travel inside pipelines and named for the sounds they make during operation18

pbeoa and lisburne pipelines finding that they met the definition of hazardous pipeline facility under 49 usc 60112a which grants general authority under the statute19 these operating areas are indicated in figure 1 the cao also concluded however that the sp ecific federal pipeline safety regulations under 49 cfr 195 did not apply to the pbwoa pipeline under the exception in 49 cfr 1951 for

corrective actions at its rth slope pipelines ba sed on findings after the initial cao23 among other findings in the amendment the ops determined that bps predecessor arco had suspended cleaning of the pbeoa pipeline in 1992 when solid deposits clogged strainers on the trans alaska pipeline system taps in may 2006 bp performed external gamma ray scans to determine the volume of accumulated sludge inside the pbeoa and pbwoa pipelines since 1992 bp cleaned and internally inspected the lisbur ne pipeline with pig devices in june 2006 although the inspection results were still pending bp had also initiated but not completed cleaning of the pbeoa pipeline with pig devices in july 2006 the ops also found that bp did not have its own large volume tanks to store solids displaced by cleaning pigs and had not made agreem ents to use nonbp tanks available on the taps system finally the ops found th at the approximate ly threemile long segment of the pbwoa pipeline originally cl osed after the march 2 leak had not yet been drained still contained approximately 17000 barrels of oil and posed an ongoing threat of additional leaks24 based on the findings above and its ear lier

discovery of unexpectedly severe corrosion and small spill at its prudhoe bay pipeline fac ilities following inspections mandated by the ops in its cao to address these problems bp announced its decision to completely replace the main north slope pipelines including pbwoa and pbeoa but not lisburne approximately 16 miles out of total 22 miles of pipeline the urgent and comprehensive nature of the pipeline repair initially was expected to require the complete shutdown of the prudhoe bay oil field27 such shutdown would cut us oil supplies by approximately 380000 barrels per day bpd appr oximately 75 of us dom estic production and 26 of total us supplies including imports28 on august 12 2006 after reviewing new inspection data with the ops and state regu lators bp concluded that it did not need to immediately shut down production from the pbwoa which accounts for approximately 200000 bpd of supplies29 subsequent actions by bp have sought to maintain additional supplies from pbeoa as stated earlier in this report bp restored production from prudhoe bay to n early 100 of preshutdown levels by december 2006 while conducting longterm pipeline repairs and replacement bp did not release specific schedule for repa iring its north slope pipelines which have yet to be completed oil companies began production from the prudhoe bay field in 1977 it is the largest and

ndment to its cao of march 15 200631 among other findings in the amendment the ops stated that bps inspections under the cao had identified 16 pipelin anomalies where the pipeline material had lost at least 70 percent of its thickness and at least 6 actual leaks at different locations in the companys prudhoe pipeline system the ame ndment also stated that bp had not yet completed cleaning or

pipeline still in place from the march incident32 based on these and additional findings the ops further amended its cao to impose on bp additional monitoring testing and information requirements and

phmsadotgovcommreportse nforceenforcementhtmlin response to congressional concer ns in 2000 the ops has been steadily intensifying its enforcement activities 2004 government accountability office gao report reexamining ops enforcement stated that the agency had made number of changes in its enforcement strategy with the potential to improve pipeline safety the report concluded however that the effectiveness of the strategy could not yet be determined because opss prog ram had not incorporated clear program goals welldefined strategy for achieving those goals and performance measures linked to the program goals47 acknowledging the gaos findings the ops stated that it would better define its enforcement strategy including the assessment of civil penalties and identify new measures of enforcement performance before the end of 200548 in march 2006 testimony before c ongress the gao reported that the ops had adopted measures that appeared to be responsive to the agencys earlier concerns although the gao had not reviewed the stra tegy nor its impleme ntation in depth49 in april 2006 phmsa testifie d before congress that th ops had institutionalized toughbutfair approach to enforcement imposing and collecting larger penalties while guiding pipeline operators to enhance higher performance50 according to the agency 4 million in proposed civil penalties in 2005 was threetimes greater than penalties proposed in 2003 the first year higher penalties could be imposed under pl 107355 sec 8a 51 proposed penaltie s in 2006 totaled 2 million52 notwithstanding the agencys efforts to change its pipeline safety enforcement strategy some analysts have held that the opss enforcement actions have not been sufficiently transparent to the public ot her government agencies or industry53 pl 109468 requires the agency to issue monthly summaries of ops enforcement actions including violation and penalty info rmation for each action and provide mechanism for pipeline operators to make response information available to the public sec 6 to meet these requirements the ops has established an internet portal with pipeline safety enforcement

tionship between pipeline safety and the reliability of us energy supplies pipeline safety regulations administered by the ops not only protect the public and the environmental from pipeline hazardsthey may also help to ensure the availability of critical pipeline infrastructure55 this latter benefit however while potentially an important consideration in the opss regulatory activities is not an explicit part of the agencys mission the opss authorizing legislation states that its purpose is to provide adequate protection against risks to life and property posed by pipeline transportation and pipeline facilities 49 usc 61012a accordingly the opss regulations identifying for example high consequence areas 49 cfr 195450 do not take into account the criticality of pipeline asset itself to the extent that critical us pipe lines already fall under the opss safety regulations the dual objectives of pipeline safety and pipeline supply reliability may already be met however the unexpected shutdown of bps north slope pipelines due to inadequate maintenance and regu latory exemption raises the question of whether the ops should explicitly consid er pipeline criticality as part of its regulatory oversight and potentially hold critical pipelines to an even higher regulatory standard than other pipelines based on their importance to the us economy the transportation security ad ministration tsa w ithin the department of homeland security dhs has authority to regulate critical pipeline infrastructure for purposes of security under the homela nd security act of 2002 pl 107296 and other laws but the agencys activities have focused on physical and operational security rather than operational reliability56 although homeland security presidential directive 7 hspd7 instructs the dot to collaborate in regulating the transportation of hazardous materials by all modes inc luding pipelines par 22h with dhs collaboration between the departments on pipelines has been limited in practice and the directive otherwise doe s not change ops regulatory authority57 in the 109th congress the house energy and commerce committees version of hr 5782 would have require d the department of energy in consultation with the dot to perform study identifying reliability concerns among critical pipelines sec 2j also in the 109th congress provisions in s 1052 sec 407b and s

determine whether these pipeline facilities are adequate ly regulated to prevent s upply disruptions sec 8a given the continuing uncertainty among industry and policy makers about what constitutes critical asset how federal agencies could develop list of key or constrained pipeline facilities under pl 109468 is unclear introducing criticality explic itly or implicitly as c onsideration in federal pipeline safety regulation as pl 109468 implies would be major change to the opss traditional mission among other issu criticality assessments would require complex analysis and assessment of pipeline commodity flows fundamentally different from high consequence ssessments under the agencys current regulations criticality assessments by ops would also be complicated by the inherent conflicts between public rule making process and securitysensitive pipeline information this specific problem has hampered the siting approval of new liquefied natural gas lng facilities and associated pipelines by the federal energy regulatory commission58 the ops could potentially rely on pipeline criticality assessments from the dhs and indeed might need to do so to avoid inconsistent assessments but dhss criticality assessments have been controversial and might not be rigorous enough to support ops regulations59 given these challenges incorporating critical asset reliability into the opss safety mission may be questioned whether or not ops considers the criticality of the pipeline it regulates the agencys knowledge of pipeline operations and longstanding relationships with pipeline companies enables it to play vital role in the restoration of pipeline service in the event of an accident natural disaster or deliberate attack after hurricanes rita and katrina for example ops deployed inspection staff to the field participated in emergency planning c oordinated restorati on resources and took administrative actions to facilitate restoration of pipelines in the gulf of mexico60 the agencys recent actions with respect to bps pipelines on the north slope are similarly intended not only to address environmental hazards but also to restore critical oil supplies as quickly as possible conclusions the 2006 shutdowns of bps north slope pipelines came as shock to the general public and polic makers alike due to the extent of the pipelines corrosion problems and their impact on us oil supplies legitimate questions may be askedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33629crs15 61 marshall s president bp exploration alaska inc comments to the joint alaska senate and house

circumstances which led to thes catastrophic and preventable failures bp has admitted unequivocally the flaws in its maintenance models and in retrospect the inadequacy of its overall maintenan ce program for its north slope operations6162 likewise federal po licy makers and pipe line safety regulato rs have acknowledged that lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines like bps north slope pipelines should be under stricter federal oversight the ps is in the final stages of promulgating new regulations covering such lowstress pipelines in the meantime the agency has responded to bps problems under its current regulations the opss investigations and corrective action orders since march 2006 have brought to light the extensive corrosion problems throughout bps north slope operations have likely prevented significant environmental damage from additional oil spills and have facilitated bps restoration efforts given bps ongoing response to the nort h slope pipeline failu res and the opss enforcement and rulemaking initiatives many observers maintain that key congressional concerns regard ing federal oversight of wstress pipeline safety are being addressed as these activities continue congress may take action to ensure that both the north slope pipeline restora tion and opss related rule making remain on schedule although ops must put in pl ace new lowstress pipeline regulations in 2007 it is possible that findings from bps ongoing restor ation activities may unexpectedly complicate this regulatory process congress may continue to oversee this process to ensure it achieves an appropriate balance between safety benefits and implementation costs pipeline operators need clear and logical guidance on which additional pipelines will be regulated and why directing limited pipeline resources to lowstress pipelines may reduce their sp ecific risk but not overall pipeline system risk if highstress safety programs become less effective as result finally congress may ensure that the ops strictly enforces all its pipeline safety regulations so that incremental operating problems in particular pipeline systems do not accumulate and lead to major disruptions in addition to these issues congress ma opt to assess how us pipeline safety regulation fits together with the nations overall strategy to ensure the reliability of critical energy infrastructure for example some assert that the overall social benefit of new pipeline safety regulations may be limited if certain critical pipeline assets remain exempt from regulation likewi most observers would argue that protection of the pipeline assets from accide nts or security risks should consistently reflect their criticality to the nations energy supplies coordinating pipeline operation regulation and prot ection necessarily involve s many groups federal agencies oil and gas pipeline associations pipeline operators and local communities reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for congress
