social policy division july 28 2008 abstract approximately 41 million adults between the ages of 55 and 64 were estimated to be without health insurance in 2006 according to the us census bureaus current population survey cps this amounts to approximately one out of eight 127 of these near elderly adults excluding the elderly nearly all of whom are enrolled in medicare the near elderly have the lowest percentage of uninsurance of any adult age group yet uninsurance can have more severe consequences for the near elderly considering their increased needs for health care and asset protection to explore these and other issues this report describes the health insurance health and health care spending of the near elderly particularly as compared with other nonelderly under age 65 adults unless speciÔ¨Åed otherwise all comparisons in this report are among nonelderly adults aged 25 to 64httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34596 order code rl34596 health insurance coverage of people aged 55

approximately 41 million adu lts between the ages of 55 and 64 were estimated to be without health insurance in 2006 according to the us census bureaus current population survey cps this am ounts to approximately one out of eight 127 of these adults ofte n called the near elderly the near elderly have the lowest uninsur ed rate among adults aged 19 to 64 this may be driven at least in part by wher this group is in their life cycle at this point in their lives many of the near elderly may be in their peak earning years and be able to access employersponsored cove rage at the same time however many may be facing important and personally unprecedented h ealth and work decisions some of which could undermine their access to employersponsored coverage these decisions may be affected by some new ch allenges this age group faces at this point in their lives 1 greater prevalence of chronic cond itions 2 greater likelihood of certain acute conditions such as heart attack and stroke and 3 more assets to protect from catastrophic health care costs this report s hows that the near elderly are significantly more likely than other nonage d adults to be in fair or poor health and to have had heart attack or stroke at least twoth irds of the near elderly have one of six chronic conditions significantly higher percentage than even the next highest age group 45 to 54yearolds 50 the near elderly ar also more likely to have assets compared with all other nonaged adult age groups average per capita health care spending among the near elderly in 2004 7787 was 50 more than among 45 to 54y earolds 5210 and more than double that of 19 to 44yearolds 3370 these spe nding levels carry over into their health insurance costs in the nongroup market average annual premiums for the near elderly were nearly 1200 more than for 45 to 54yearolds and triple that for 25 to 34yearolds the near elderly were more likely than their younger adult counterparts to spend more than 10 of their aftertax income on health care and health insurance premiums in fact fo r those with private nongroup coverage 69 of the near elderly were in families that spent more than 10 of their aftertax income on health care and health insurance premiums compared with uninsured 25 to 54 yearolds the 41 million near elderly uninsured are more likely to be female na tiveborn or in poor or fair health this is true even after accounting for underlyi ng population differences between the near elderly and 25 to 54yearolds the near elderly uninsured are also more likely to have household income below 25000 uninsurance can have more severe consequences for the near elderly considering their increased needs for health care and asset protection yet even the near elderly who have health insurance face much greater financial burdens from these costs than younger adultshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34596contents s u r c s f h l t h i n s u r n c f t h n r l d r l y1 changes over time in coverage of the near elderly 3

minimum for adults in this analysis primarily because adults aged 19 to 24 are so dissimilar to other adults especially the near elderly with respect to their health health insurance and health care spending that their inclusion would not be useful 2 those with endstage renal disease esrd are also eligible for medicare coverage for these individuals generally begins in the fourth month of dialysis treatments or the month of kidney transplant persons under age 65 who receive cash disability benefits from social security or the railroad retirement sy stems for at least 24 months are also entitled to medicare because there is fivemonth waiting period for cash payments the medicare waiting period is effectively 29 months the 24month waiting period is waived for persons with amyotrophic

uninsurance can have more severe consequences for the near elderly considering their increased needs for health care and asset protection to explore these and other issues this repor t describes the health insurance health and health care spending of the near elderly particularly as compared with other nonelderly under age 65 adults unless speci fied otherwise all comparisons in this report are among nonelderly adults aged 25 to 641 sources of health insurance of the near elderly approximately twothirds of the near elderly 68 have jobbased coverage similar rate as the entire adult popul ation between 25 and 64 years of age however the near elderly are much more likely to have nonworkrelated private coverage 102 as shown in figure 1 for those under age 65 medicare eligibility is mostly restricted to the disabled who have received cash disability payments for at least two years2 the rate of medicare enrollment among the near elderly 92 is more than double the ne xt highest age group 40 among 45 to 54yearolds the near elderly also have much higher rates of militaryveterans coverage however the percentage of near elderly covered through medicaid the state childrens health insurance program schip or other meanstested public health insurance programs is the same as the nonelderly adult population overallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34596crs2 source crs analysis of data from the march 2007 current population survey cps notes jobbased coverage includes coverage from spouse near elderly men have significantly higher rates of jobbased and militaryveterans coverage than near elderly women while near elderly women have significantly higher rates of private nonwork and medicaid coverage combined there is statistically significant difference between the uninsurance rates of near elderly men and women the percentages by age sum to more than 100 because people may have more than one source of coverage during the year most analysts treat the cps as providing estimates of the percentage of uninsured at point in time during the year although the survey question is intended to capture the number uninsured for the entire year other federal data sources produce different estimates of individuals sources of health insurance for example the medical expenditure panel survey meps estimates that among the near elderly only 6 had nonwork coverage 4 had militaryveterans coverage and 16 nearly one in six or 50 million were uninsured in this case the meps definition of uninsurance is being uninsured for the entirety of three to fivemonth period the cps is currently the most cited source for health insurance statistics primarily because of its timeliness and because it is the only source of health insurance estimates for all 50 states notwithstanding the differences in the absolute level of the estimates between meps and cps for example the differences by age in sources of health insurance illustrated in this figure are very similar in both surveys figure 2 shows the percentage of large fi rms 500 or more employees offering health insurance that also offer retiree coverage to individuals before they become eligible for medicare that is before they turn 65 in 1993 the percentage was 46 dropping to 28 in 2003 but rising to 31 in 2007 the increase between 2005 and 2007 was surprise uptick driven by firms with 500 to 999 employees in the other large firmsize

smaller firms changes over time in coverage of the near elderly despite declining rates over the past decade of employers ffering pre65 retiree coverage or health insurance generally the near elderly were able to maintain similar levels of private and public coverage between 1996 nd 2006 according to estimates from the medical expenditure pa nel survey meps4 there were significant declines between 1996 and 2006 in the percentage cove red by private coverage for 25 to 34 yearolds 35 to 45yearolds and 45 to 54yearolds however private coverage rates were not significantly different fo r the near elderly in 2006 than in 1996 in addition there were significant increas between 1996 and 2006 in the uninsured percentage among 25 to 34yearolds 35 to 45yearolds and 45 to 54yearolds however the uninsured rate for the near elderly was not significantly different in 2006 from what it was in 1996httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34596crs4 5 table 2 crs report rl30629 older workers employme nt and

income is based on only the income of the near elderly their spouse and continueddeclining pre65 retiree offers may have been offset for the near elderly by other factors for example the near elderly may now be more likely to seek employment in firms with pre65 retiree coverage andor to accept that coverage when offered the near elderly are also more likely to work than they were decade ago5 perhaps focused in firms that offer coverage even going back 20 years jobbased coverage among the working near elderly has not changed significantly in 1987 78 of near elderly workers had jobbased coverage which was the same percentage in 2006 the statistically significant changes in health insurance among n ear elderly workers between 1987 and 2006 appear to be the decline in nonwork c overage from 11 in 1987 to 5 in 2006 and the increase in the uninsured from 9 in 1987 to 14 in 2006 but most of those changes occurred in the 19871996 period rather than the 19962006 period6 characteristics of the uninsured near elderly table 1 shows the characteristics of the 41 million uninsured near elderly comparing those characteristics to the insured near elderly as well as to 25 to 54 yearolds both insured and uninsured characteristics of the uninsured near elderly compared with uninsured aged 25 to 54 as group compared with uninsured 25 to 54year olds the uninsured near derly are more likely to be female white nativeborn or to be in fair or poor health the near elderly uninsured are less likely than their younger uninsured counterparts to be workin g or to have worked full time all year the near elderly uninsured are so more likely to have annual household income7 below 25000 compared with the uninsured between 25 and 54 years of age characteristics of the uninsured near elderly compared with insured near elderly compared with the near elderly who are insured the uninsured near elderly are less likely to be white or nativeborn the near elderly uninsured are also less likely to be working or to have worked full time all year compared with their insured peers the n ear elderly uninsured are also more likely than their insured peers to be in fair or poor health they are also more likely to have annual income below 25000 compared with the insured near elderly approximately 55 of the uninsur ed near elderly have annual family income below 25000 compared with 25 of their insured peers8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34596crs5 8 continued dependent children in the home this definiti on is more precisely referred to as the income of health insurance units hiu this rm distinguishes it from how the cps defines family which treats everyone in the household who is related as single family under the hiu definition more than 90 of the unins ured near elderly are adults living without dependent children the hiu definition of fam ily income is often considered more useful for healthpolicy analyses because it tends to mirror eligibility for fam ily coverage in the private market as well as the definition of fa mily income for some meanstested programs 9 this portion of the report is based on method referred to as differenceindifferences for the sake of simplicity these results and the corresponding significance testing are not displayed in the tableseffect of being uninsured and n ear elderly beyond the underlying population differences between the n ear elderly and 25 to 54year olds9 as previously discussed table 1 shows comparisons of the uninsured near elderly and uninsured 25 to 54yearolds although it may not be surprising to find these two uninsured groups differ significan tly in many of their characteristics how much of these differences are simply attributable to the fact that the near elderly differ from younger adults generally in ot her words are there certain characteristics that the uninsured near elderly ve beyond what one might expect after taking into account the underlying population differences between the near elderly and 25 to 54 yearold populations the answer is sometimes yes sometimes instances where the uninsured near elderly are significantly different from uninsured 25 to 54yearolds even afte r accounting for differences in the underlying populations are that the uninsured near derly are still more lik ely to be female nativeborn citizens or in fa ir or poor health after acc ounting for differences in the underlying populations the uninsured near elderly are still less likely than their 25 to 54yearold uninsured c ounterparts to be hispanic however certain other ge neral population differences between the near elderly and younger adults wash away differences between their uninsured populations for example the initial comparison showed that the near elderly uninsured were more likely to be white or to not work compared with their younger uninsured counterparts but after adjusting for th underlying population differences between the two age groups the proportion of near derly uninsured who were white or did not work was not significantly different than uninsured 25 to 54yearolds in other words the reason the uninsured near elde rly were more likely to be white or not work compared with younger uninsured dults was related to the characteristics of their respective age groups rather than their insurance status interestingly adjusting for the unde rlying population differences actually reverses some of the comparative results for example table 1 shows the uninsured near elderly were significantly less likely than uninsured 25 to 54yearolds to have worked full time for the entire year 457 compared with 612 respectively however 25 to 54yearolds work full time all year in much larger proportion overall compared with the near elderly adjusting for these population differences reveals that the uninsured n ear elderly actually have greater likelihood of working full time all year compared with uninsured 25 to 54yearoldshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34596crs6 table 1

results from meps in didem bernard et wealth assets and the affordability of health insurance ag ency for healthcare research and quality ahrq working paper june 18 2007health health care spending and health insurance for the near elderly among the reasons people seek health insurance are the following 1 to pay for and provide access to health care in the case of an unexpected health event 2 to pay for and provide access to health care for expected andor chronic health care needs and 3 to protect ones financial assets from being drained by health care expenses all three of these reasons ar potentially more important for the near elderly than other nonelderly age groups becau of the near elderlys greater use of health care higher health care spending and greater assets table 2 which shows characteristics of i ndividuals regardless of their health insurance status demonstrates how selfreported health stat us worsens with age the prevalence of most chronic conditions in creases with age except for asthma as shown in table 2 the near elderly are also significantly more likely to ever have had stroke or heart attack co mpared with younger individuals10 as result the near elderly had aver age health care spending of 7787 in 2004 this is 50 more than 45 to 54yearo lds percapita spe nding 5210 and more than double the spending for 19 to 44yearolds 337011 table 3 shows as expected the near elderly are more likely to have assets and when they have them to have more th is is true across all sources of health insurance table 3 also shows that the near elderly who have private health insurance are significantly more likely to have assets than those with public coverage or without coverage in fact this is tr ue for all the age groups it is difficult to determine how much of the motivation to purchase private coverage was due to the desire to protect assets versus the desi re to ensure that necessary care would be received and paid for12 in every age group those with public coverage were least likely to have assets even less than the uninsured most of the near elderly enrolled in medicaid are subject to limitati ons on their countable assets those in medicare are mostly disabled and will not have worked for at least two years potentially depleting some of their assets before obt aining coverage the findings above broken down by age ar consistent with the notion that the need and desire for health insurance increases with age resulting in relatively greater coverage although often at much higher price as discussed

ttpcontenthealthaffairsorgcgireprint271188 pdf the following descriptions mmarize the relevant portions of the methodology described in the health affairs article the dollar amounts for income after ta xes and for outofpocket health care spending and premiums are all measured at the family level family income defined this way is more precisely referred to as the income of health insurance units hiu which generally consists of the income of the individual spouse and dependent children the hiu definition of family income is often considered more useful for healthpolicy analyses because it tends to mirror elig ibility and available resources for family coverage in the private market it also reflects the definition of family income for some m eanstested public programs ultimately the resulting population estimates are reporte d at the person level each person in the analysis is assigned the familylevel measures15 everyone in the analysis was classified into single category for their health insurance status first if they were wit hout coverage all year they were considered uninsured coverage was then assigned based on the number of months individuals had that type of coverage premiums amounts were pror ated as necessary to account for the duration of coverage during the year although medians are often used for an alyses of income and expenditures banthin et use averages instead for number of reasons primarily so that the individual outofpocket amounts add to the total in each category for additional detail on the methodology one may refer to the health
