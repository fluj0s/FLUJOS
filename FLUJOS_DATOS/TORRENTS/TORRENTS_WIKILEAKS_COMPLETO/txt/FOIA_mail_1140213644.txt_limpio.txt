from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedukeith briffa kbriffaueaacuk eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno subject re figures urgent date fri 17 feb 2006 170044 0000 xflowed hi peck and eystein just working on this mwp box fig update just trying to clarify what is wanted the old mwp box fig had 8 series on it 7 of these were straight from our recent science paper anyway and the 8th was the average of 2 more from the science paper the other 5 in the paper making total of 725 14 series were not used in the old mwp box fig as they are too short to cover the mwp period 1 are you asking to use exactly the 14 series from the science paper overlaid like in the old mwp fig or if space permits plotted like fig 1 in our science paper and then add below the exact fig 3b of our paper you say 3blike which implied maybe some changes 2 or do you want to stick with the original 8 series and then have the exact fig 3b from our paper which wouldnt correspond exactly to the 8 series above because it would be based on the 14 3 or do you want to stick with the original 8 series and then show panel similar to our fig 3b but recalculated using just the 8 series shown so many questions i attached the original mwp fig 8 series plus new one from option 1 above 14 series looks bit of mess also i removed the composite mean which might have been agreed in new zealand cheers tim at 0528 02022006 jonathan overpeck wrote hi tim and keith i have some feedback on the mwp box fig but would to first ask that you update us and eystein about the status of your other figs we have particularly urgent need to see those that are likely to be elevated to the ts tech summary big deal for paleo can you promise us these by the end of this week monday at the latest again see my emails of dec for details it would be great to see new mwp box fig asap too but this isnt as high priority as the ts figs eystein and i agree with both susan and martin that it would be good to see new mwp box fig that was hybrid of the old fig concept and the new fig 3b from your science paper it would be good to have two versions if space allows we go with the first otherwise the 2nd both would have your 3blike plot and both would have all the normalized time series that were used to create the 3b plot ie those in fig 1 of your paper version 1 has all the input series stacked on top of each other as in your fig 1 with the summary fig 3blike plot below version 2 is the same but the input series are all on the same axis like in the fod mwp box fig now if you think version 1 plus caption would be smaller than version 2 plus caption need for version 2 ditto if version 1 plus caption was only little bigger than v 2 plus caption again thanks for getting all of your new figs to us asap particularly those targeted for ts consideration many thanks peck jonathan t overpeck director institute for the study of planet earth professor department of geosciences professor department of atmospheric sciences mail and fedex address institute for the study of planet earth 715 n park ave 2nd floor university of arizona tucson az 85721 direct tel 1 520 6229065 fax 1 520 7928795 httpwwwgeoarizonaedu httpwwwispearizonaedu xflowed attachment converted ceudoraattachipccar4_mwpbox4pdf attachment converted ceudoraattachipccar4_mwpbox_apdf xflowed dr timothy j osborn climatic research unit school of environmental sciences university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk email tosbornueaacuk phone 44 1603 592089 fax 44 1603 507784 web httpwwwcruueaacuktimo sunclock httpwwwcruueaacuktimosunclockhtm xflowed
