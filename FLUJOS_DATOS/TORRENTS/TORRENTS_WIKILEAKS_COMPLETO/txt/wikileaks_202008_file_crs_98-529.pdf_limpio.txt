income tax system with flat rate consumption tax is receiving congressional attention the term flat tax is often associated with proposal formulated by robert hall and alvin rabushk hr two senior fe llows at the hoover institution in the 110th congress representative michael burgesss proposal hr 1040 would allow taxpayers to select flat tax based on the concepts of hallrabushka as an alternative to the current income tax system senator richard c shelbys proposal s 1040 and senator arlen specters proposal s 1081 would replace individual and corporate income taxes and estate and gift taxes with flat tax based on the hallrabushka concept this report discusses the idea of replacing the us income tax system with consumption tax although the current tax structure is referred to as an income tax it actually contains elements of both an income and consumptionbased tax consumption base is neithe r inherently superior nor inherently inferior to an income base the combined individual and business taxes proposed by hr can be viewed as modified value added tax v t the individual wage tax would be imposed on wages and salaries and pension receipts part or all of an individuals wage and pension income would be taxfree depending on marital status and number of dependents the business tax would be modified subtraction method v at with wages and salaries and pension contributions subtracted from the v t base in contrast to the usual v t practice the analysis of the flat tax proposal is covered by the following four topics that sometimes overlap broad economic issues narrow sectoral economic issues simplicity and international comparisons first broad economic issues relate to economic effects of the flat tax on the entire economy equity efficiency international trade price level interest rates and revenue second sectoral economic issues deal with specific industries or sectors of the total economy differential effects on businesses charitable organizations housing financial services pensions and insurance health care services and state and local governments third tax economists government leaders and taxpayers are interested in the simplicity of tax system and the current income tax system is complex positive aspect of the proposed flat tax is the ease with which the individual and corporate tax systems could be integrated but the complexity of the current tax code is partially due to attempts to achieve greater equity or to improve economic efficiency and there are often tradeoffs between simplicity equity and efficiency it can be argued that it may be unfair to compare the current income tax system with some form of pure consumption tax by the time consumption tax becomes enacted it may become complicated fourth there are major distinctions between recent consumption tax proposals for the united states and the current tax systems of other deve loped nations numerous aspects of the hr flat tax proposal have not been fleshed out and many important policy issues have yet to be analyzed this report will be updated as issues develop or legislation is introduced

of congress have indicated interest in the concept of replacing our current federal income tax system with some form of consump tion tax including proposals with flat rate the term flat tax is often associated with proposal formulated by robert hall and alvin rabushka hr two senior fellows at the hoover institution at stanford university in 1981 they proposed the replacement of the federal individual income tax and the federal corporate income tax with flat rate consumption tax in early 1995 hall and rabushka published the second edition of their book titled simply the flat tax 1 in 2005 dr hall provided some additional insights into his flat tax proposal2 this report explains and evaluates the hall rabushka proposal for three reasons first although the hr plan has not been specifically advocated by any member of congress it nevertheless has been associated with bills introduced in the in the past congresses 3 furthermore in the 110th congress representative michael burgesss proposal hr 1040 would allow taxpayers to select flat tax based on the concepts of hallrabushka as an alternative to the curre nt income tax system also senator richard c shelbys proposal s 1040 and senator arlen specters proposal s 1081 would replace individual and corporate income taxes and estate and gift taxes with flat tax based on the hallrabushka concept second the hallrabushka proposal concerns many issues relevant to other tax reform proposals third unlike number of other reform plans the hr proposal has sufficient detail to permit examination although numerous aspects of the proposal have yet to be fleshed out 4 the report begins with discussions of congressional interest in the flat tax the concept of an income tax base versus consumption tax base and three types of broadbased consumption taxes next the justification and operation of the proposed hr flat tax are explained lastly selected policy issues are examined including both broad and narrow economic issues simplicity and international comparisons the broad economic issues relate to the economic effects of the flat tax on the entire economy for example equity efficiency and international trade the more narrow economic issues deal with specific industries or sectors of the total economy such as housing or charitable organizations in the 110 th congress as of february 1 2008 nine bills have been introduced that include proposals for fundamental tax reform that is basic changes in what is taxed in tax rates in how taxes are collected or some combination of these reforms most of these proposals would replace the current income tax system with some form of flat rate consumption tax 1 the complete citation of this book is robert hall and alvin rabushka the flat tax second edition stanford

referred to as an income tax in popular discussions it actually contains elements of both an income and consumptionbased tax for example it excludes some income that goes to savings such as pension and individual retirement account ira contributions which is consistent with tax using consumption base overall however the return to new investment is taxed which is consistent with an income tax the easiest way to understand the differences between the income and consumption tax bases is to define and understand the economic concept of income in its broadest sense income is measure of the command over resources that an individual acquires during given time period conceptually an individual can exercise two opti ons with regard to his income he can consume it or he can save it this theoretical relationship between income consumption and saving allows very useful accounting identity to be established income by definition must equal consumption plus saving should the tax base be income or consumption is one inherently superior to the other how do they stack up in terms of simplicity equity and efficiency there appears to be insufficient theoretical or empirical evidence to conclude that consumptionbased tax is inherently superior to an incomebased tax or vice versa g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g5g152g151g156g158g150g153g157g146g152g151g561g22g138g161g142g156g561 the three general types of consumptionbased taxes are retail sales tax valueadded tax v t and consumedincome tax 5 broadbased consumption tax however formulated is equal to tax on wages plus lump sum tax on old capital in existence at the time the tax is imposed g20g142g157g138g146g149g561g21g138g149g142g156g561g22g138g161g561 retail sales tax rst is consumption tax collected only at the retail level by

value added of firm is the difference between firms sales and firms purchases of inputs from other firms in other words firms value added is simply the amount of value firm contributes to good or service by applying its factors of production land labor capital and entrepreneurial ability8 the prevailing procedure is to treat the purchase of capital inputs plant and equipment the same way as the purchase of any other input that is the purchase price is deducted at the time of purchase this tax treatment of capital purchases is equivalent to expensing

addition method under the credit method the firm calculates the v t to be remitted to the government by twostep process first the firm multiplies its sales by the tax rate to calculate v at collected on sales second the firm credits v t paid on inputs against v t collected on sales and remits this difference to the government under the creditinvoice method type of credit method the firm is required to show v t separately on all sales invoices and to calculate the v t credit on inputs by adding all v t shown on purchase invoices under the subtraction method the firm calculates its value added by subtracting its cost of taxed inputs from its sales next the firm determines its v at liability by multiplying its value added by the v at rate under the addition method the firm calculates its value added by adding all payments for untaxed inputs eg wages and profits next the firm multiplies its value added by the v t rate to calculate vat to be remitted to the government 9

existing individual income tax with their flat tax would be major improvement for three reasons the flat tax would be much simpler than the current income tax consumption is better tax base than income and the flat tax would be much more efficient than the current income tax system first hall and rabushka maintain that there is need for tax simplification they argue that the complexity of the current federal individual and corporate income tax systems results in excessive administrative and compliance costs11 second hall and rabushka argue that consumption tax is superior to an income tax because individuals would be taxed on what they take out of the economy when they spend money to consume not on what they produce reflected in working and saving 12 they claim that by exempting investment from taxation consumption taxes encourage investment and discourage spending over time each act of investment traces back to an act of saving thus exempting investment from the tax base amounts to exempting saving13 third hall and rabushka assert that the current tax system results in an inefficient use of resources they argue that their flat tax proposal would improve the allocation of resources which would result in higher economic growth and rise in living standards as will be discussed in more detail some economists dispute hrs justifications for flat tax

some to pay less in the short run but in the long run they claim that higher rate of economic growth would cause many taxpayers who initially lost to eventually benefit21 for 1991 hr compare taxes on adjusted gross income consisting only of wage income with hypothetical tax payments from the wage tax for typical family married couple with 11 dependents hr conclude that currently the typical family with wage income below about 10000 does not pay significant individual income tax on that income and would pay flat tax on wages the typical family with wage income between 10000 and 30000 would pay less under the flat wage tax than they currently pay in income tax but the flat wage tax would be slightly higher on average for the typical family in the 30000 to 90000 range the typical family with wage income over 100000 would pay less under the flat wage tax 22 but hr point out that there are limits to the preceding comparison the individual wage tax component of the flat tax however will raise less revenue than the personal income tax and correspondingly the business tax component of the flat tax will raise more revenue than the existing corporate income tax 23 20 for brief discussion

tax rate on wage income under the flat tax would have been only 85 because personal allowances would have excluded onehalf of wage income from taxation24 in contrast for 1991 the average tax rate on wage income under the individual income tax was 10425 because of the substantial data problems in attempting to measure the incidence of the flat tax compared to the current individual tax hr conclude that we cant tell if there are any income groups who would pay significantly higher taxes including the wage taxes they would pay directly and the business taxes they would pay indirectly this group could not include the poor who receive almost business income 26 g23g495g21g495g561g22g155g142g138g156g158g155g162g514g156g561g3g151g138g149g162g156g146g156g561 the us treasury analyzed the incidence

employerprovided fringe benefits and the imputed rent on owneroccupied housing28 in order for the armeyshelby flat tax to be revenue neutral the us treasury maintained that 208 percentage rate would have to be levied the treasury calculated the incidence of the change to the flat tax on eight different fei classes the treasury concluded that only the highest income class fei of 200000 or more would pay less in taxes other classes would pay more29 these distributional effects are partially the result of assumptions concerning the incidence of different components of the flat tax30

money supply then the flat tax would be shifted backwards onto owners of equities old capital and wage earners gravelle also assesses the lifetime and intergenerational incidence of consumption tax the consumption tax tends to shift the burden to holders of old assets who are likely to be old the young tend to benefit if they are likely to do significant amount of lifetime saving but the young who do little lifetime saving can be made worse off if tax rates are much higher those who do little lifetime saving are likely to be the lifetime poor at the same time very wealthy individuals with accumulated assets who consistently pass on wealth across the generations may also avoid the tax and may find their tax burdens lowered 24 ibid p 92 25 ibid 26 ibid p 93 27 if the earned income tax

shifts probably contribute to less progressive tax31 gravelles analysis raises the issue of horizontal equity since the flat tax would shift the tax burden from the young to the old it should also be noted that old capital and thus the old will bear consumption tax regardless of whether the money supply is altered accommodating the tax with price change will cause the burden to be shared by debt claimantsthe cost of physical assets would rise resulting in the net of tax sales proceeds being fixed but the purchasing power would fall and cause proceeds of both debt and equity holders to effectively bear the tax if price is not changed and there is reason to believe it will be under the flat tax except for minor revision to reflect the cost of fringe benefits prices of goods will not rise and the net of tax sales proceeds would fall by the amount of this tax this tax will fall solely on equity since the value of outstanding debt is fixed this tax could be very high for heavily leveraged assets that are recently purchased in summary the current income tax system is prog ressive but the incidence of the hr flat tax is uncertain there is general agreement concerning the vertical incidence of the proposed shift to the hr flat taxwhether it would reduce or increase tax progressivity g7g143g143g146g140g146g142g151g140g162g561 in public finance the more neutral is tax the less the tax affects private economic decisions and consequently the more efficient is the operation of the economy for households two out of three major decisions would not be altered by this hypothetical consumption tax first this consumption tax would not alter choices among goods because all would be taxed at the same rate thus relative prices would not change in contrast other taxes such as excise taxes which change relative prices would distort household consumer choices by encouraging the substitution of untaxed goods for taxed goods hypothetical income tax on all income would be neutral in this respect second flat tax does not affect the relative prices of present and future consumption in contrast the individual income tax affects the relative prices of present and future consumption because the income tax is levied on income which is saved and then the returns on saving are taxed households workleisure decision however would be affected by flat tax or any other tax on either consumption or income since leisure would not be taxed any tax increase would fall on the returns to work hence under either an consumption or an income tax the price of leisure is reduced relative to the consumption an individual could finance with an extra hour of labor for firm the flat tax would not affect decisions concerning method of financing debt or equity choice among inputs type of business organization corporation partnership or sole proprietorship and goods to produce other types of taxes may affect one or more of these types of decisions 31 crs report 951141 the flat

amount of tax revenue consumptionbased tax would require larger in crease in marginal tax rates than would an income tax distortions caused by these higher marginal rates could offset or even exceed other neutral advantages of the flat tax hence whether an income tax system or flat tax system is more efficient is unknown32 g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g561 hr argue that taxing only consumption rather th an all income saving and consumption would increase the savings rate hr predict that in consequence flat tax would cause an increase in the capital stock that would increase gross domestic product gdp by 2 to 4 within seven years33 national saving consists of government saving business saving and personal saving34 any tax increase or reduction in federal expenditures would be expected to reduce government dissaving and consequently raise national saving 35 thus whether flat tax increases or reduces revenue is relevant to its effect on national saving another issue concerns the personal savings rate but there is conclusive theoretical or empirical evidence that consumption tax will increase the savings rate and consequently the level of national savings36 according to economic theory rise in the after tax rate of return would have two conflicting effects first each dollar saved today results in the possibility of higher amount of consumption in the future this relative increase in the return from saving causes household to want to substitute saving for consumption out of current income substitution effect second higher rate of return on savings raises households income consequently the household has to save less to accumulate some target amount of savings in the future income effect thus this income effect encourages households to have higher current consumption and lower current saving these two conflicting effects mean that economic theory cannot determine the effects of the rate of return on the savings rate highly stylized lifecycle models show that fl at tax would cause substantial increase in the savings rate but these models are extremely controversial 37 these stylized models add third effect for consumption tax unlike mere exclusion of tax on the return the consumption tax allows an upfront deduction for savings but requires the payment of tax on both principal and 32 for an analysis of the efficiency of pure

need to save today to pay these taxes due in the future they can do so while stil l consuming more today because of their large tax cuts thus while the young may consume some part of their tax cut the old reduce their consumption by much more and the overall effect is to increase aggregate savings in the economy but these stylized lifecycle models rely on somewhat idealized assumptions such as all taxpayers having perfect information and certainty that the tax system will not change during their lifetimes if these idealized assumptions are relaxed then the results are not conclusive that switching from an income tax to consumption tax would increase savings 38 crs study compared the longrun effects on the capital stock and consumption of adding 60 billion v t and 60 billion increase in individual income taxes this studys results suggest that selecting v t instead of an increase in individual income taxes would raise the capital stock by less than 2 and consumption in the future by quarter to third of 1 after 50 years 39 these results are not in line with the claims of hr simulation by the congressional budget office cbo analyzed the economic effects of replacing quarter of the revenue of the current income tax with 6 v t on all consumption cbo estimated that this tax substitution would in the longrun increase the saving rate by 05 raise the capital stock by 79 increase output by 15 and raise consumption by 1240 in the 1980s high interest rates iras individual retirement accounts and low marginal tax rates failed to raise the savings rate indicating that in this instance higher rate of return on savings did not increase the savings rate g25g152g155g148g561g7g143g143g152g155g157g561 hr maintain that their flat tax would reduce the marginal tax rate of most taxpayers taxpayers would have marginal rate of either zero or 19 hr estimate that as result their flat tax would increase total hours of work in the us economy by 441 hence total annual output of goods and services in the us economy would rise by about 3 or almost 200 billion42 whether revenue neutral flat tax increases or reduces households marginal tax rate it would have conflicting effects on the number of hours worked by that household households with lower marginal tax rate would have an incentive to substitute work for leisure because of the relative rise in the value of work to leisure substitution effect conversely household would have an incentive to reduce its hours worked because it needs to work fewer hours in order to achieve given standard of living income effect for households with higher marginal rate the substitution effect would tend to decrease work effort but the income effect would tend to increase work effort households marginal rate affects its substitution effect but its average tax rate affects its income effect thus as assessed by current economic theory flat tax could 38 crs report rl32603 the flat tax valueadded tax and national retail

of income tax revenues often have been too low or too high thus there is justifiable concern that in an abrupt transition to flat tax the initial revenue yield could be far too low or too high compared with the amount forecasted any drastic unexpected decline or rise in tax revenue could be destabilizing to the economy g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g157g162g561 consumption is more stable than personal income since people attempt to maintain their living standards during recessions save less and save more during periods of prosperity business income and hence business income taxes usually rises dramatically during an economic expansion but usually declines precipitously during recession because the flat tax excludes business income it would result in more stable total tax revenues over the business cycle than an income tax system g5g152g158g151g157g142g155g140g162g140g149g146g140g138g149g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 the current income tax system is an automatic st abilizer that is without any discretionary action by policymakers the income tax system tends to maintain aggregate demand in the economy by reducing tax revenues during recessions and curtailing aggregate demand by increasing tax revenue during booms the countercyclical effects of flat tax would be much weaker since revenues would be more stable over the business cycle but the importance of these tax effects are diminished in the modern world of highly mobile capital g21g142g140g157g152g155g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 as previously indicated more narrow economic issues deal with specific

if there is price accommodation the general burden of the hr flat tax will fall on wages and old capital at more discrete level the business tax proposed by hr would have differential effects among corporatio ns depending on their financial characteristics and their industry 51 many large established slowgrowing corporations with large depreciation expenses and high interest expenses would be collect much higher business taxes than they pay under the current corporate income tax these corporations would be unable to deduct depreciation for plant and equipment purchased prior to the enactment of the flat tax also they would be unable to deduct interest costs on their outstanding debt furthermore existing inventory costs would not be recovered firms sellin g off inventory or selling assets would face large tax burden especially if debt financed52 51 for comprehensive analysis of this issue see martin sullivan flat taxes and consumption taxes guide to the debate new york

and low depreciation expenses would collect less under the business tax than th ey pay under the current corporate income tax all new investment in plant and equipment would be immediately expensed because of their low level of outstanding debt the loss of the interest expense would be of little concern to these corporations hr use examples to demonstrate that there woul d be dramatic change in the amount of taxes collected by different corporations according to hr in 1993 general motors gm paid about 110 million in corporate income taxes in 1993 gms interest expense and depreciation outweighed its new investment gm had interest expenses of 57 billion and depreciation deductions for past investment of 9 billion but only about 6 billion in new investment thus under the hr flat tax for 1993 hr estimate th at gm would have remitted taxes of 272 billion over 24 times its actual corporate tax liability53 in contrast hr examined the corporate income tax return of the intel corporation in 1993 intel paid 12 billion in corporate income taxes intel had debt and thus interest expenses and invested heavily in new plant and equipment thus under the proposed flat tax intel would have remitted only 277 million for 1993 less than onefourth its actual corporate income tax liability54 the elimination of depreciation expenses would create special transitional problem managers of business would be reluctant to purchase plant and equipment in the year before the flat tax would go into effect because they would be able to write off only one year of depreciation if managers of this business simply waited year the entire investment outlay could be written off that is expensed hence the approval of the flat tax could result in sudden decline and then sharp rise in investment after the flat tax wa s operational furthermore managers of many existing businesses may consider it unfair to change the rules and deny depreciation expenses for past investment hr offer as an option allowing managers of businesses to continue depreciating investments made before the introduction of the flat tax this would require however higher tax rate to offset the resulting loss in revenue and there would be reduction in economic efficiency55 but the higher tax rate would be temporary since depreciation expenses would diminish over time56 furthermore the flat tax would be more complicated if depreciation was permitted also the flat tax would eliminate tax preferences available to specific industries for instance oil producers currently receive tax break on intangibles which allows them to write off most of their drilling costs in addition oil independents use the percentage depletion allowance to write off percentage of their receipts thus the oil producing companies probably would collect more under the business tax than they currently pay in corporate income taxes continued farmers and owners of rental properties 53 hall and rabushka pp 6465 54 ibid pp

charitable organizations 57 the hr flat tax would eliminate this charitable deduction which would likely cause charitable donations to decline but hr claim that the decline in charitable contributions would be small 58 their claim however is controversial59 for example professor charles t clotfelter and richard l schmalbeck estimate that the armey flat tax proposal which is based on the hr proposal would significantly reduce charitable contributions60 g10g152g158g156g146g151g144g561 the flat tax would eliminate the mortgage interest deduction and the property tax deduction61 these deductions are controversial supporters argue that they promote home ownership and home improvement which have positive spillover effects opponents argue that these preferences have little effect on the rate of home ownership and primarily benefit higher income families62 furthermore critics claim that these preferences have led to an overinvestment in housing for example the competitive policy council bipartisan panel established by congress warned that americans are hurting their competitiveness by overinvesting in their houses and underinvesting in the kinds of new products and technologies that generate higher wages and salaries 63 hall and rabushka argue that interest rates would decline and consequently the loss of these tax advantages could be offset by homeowners refinancing their mortgages hr predict that their flat tax would reduce interest rates by at least fifth64 hr point out that in 1994 interest rates on municipal bonds were about onesixth less than comparable taxable bonds but hr assert that taxable bonds also receive tax preferences for example if they are held in pension funds the tax is deferred on interest income 65 hence hr assert that interest rates could easily fall to three quarters of their present levels after tax reform rates on taxfree securities would then fall little as well66 hr maintain that their flat tax would encourage new investment which could cause 57

hypothesis they assume interest rates would fall in the year after tax reform by about fifth67 but their analysis does not incorporate the expanding influence of international movements of capital todays capital markets are truly global owners of financial capital can quickly transfer their funds among countries in order to maximize their expected returns consequently whether or not the flat tax would lower interest rates is unknown hence many families with large interest payments and property tax payments might be unable to continue making their mortgage payments these families might be forced to sell their homes furthermore the sudden elimination of these preferences might cause sudden drop in the value of the average house68 decline in housing values would be loss for sellers but benefit to buyers hr acknowledge that the elimination of interest deductions would result in winners and losers during transition they state if congress decides that transition measure to protect interest deductions is needed we suggest the following any borrower may choose to treat interest payments as tax deduction if the borrower so chooses the lender must treat the interest as taxable income but the borrowers deduction should be only 90 of the actual interest payment while the lenders taxable income should include 100 of the interest receipts 69 this transition option would grandfather in existing interest deductions thus borrowers would benefit at the expense of lenders the proposal also would apply to new loans for the housing industry many homeowners would be protected from the forced sale of their homes but mortgage lenders would suffer financially furthermore this transition proposal would add complexity to the flat tax it is important to recognize that part of the effect of hr in discouraging demand for housing arises from the opportunities for higher return from other investments70

life insurance often includes savings component which is difficult to separate from risk protection71 hall and rabushka claim that it would be easy to measure the valueadded of financial intermediaries and insurance companies72 but developed nations have found that it is so difficult to measure valueadded of financial institutions and insurance companies that they generally exempt these businesses from their v ts73 g18g142g151g156g146g152g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 pensions are favored under current tax law because they are effectively tax exempt treated on consumptiontax basis while firms would still have reasons to provide pensions proposals that would extend this treatment to all investments would make pensions relatively less attractive and might discourage their use if some individuals now save more through pension plan than they would on their own overall savings could be adversely affected as well74 currently taxfavored insurance policies eg whole life insurance would also become relatively less attractive75 g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g5g138g155g142g561 under current law there are numerous tax preferences for health care spending the most significant is that an individual is entitled to an itemized deduction for expenses paid during the tax year for the medical care of the individual the individuals spouse or dependent to the extent that such expenses exceed 75 of adjusted gross income 76 under the hr flat tax all tax preferences for health care would be eliminated including the itemized deduction under the hr flat tax firms would have less of an incentive to provide compensation in the form of health care for employees furthermore individuals with catastrophic health care needs in excess of 75 of adjusted gross income would not receive tax preference hence the hr flat tax would tend to reduce the rate of growth in the demand for health care which in turn would lower the rate of inflation of health care services from what would otherwise occur 71 charles mclure jr the valueadded tax key to deficit reduction washington american enterprise institute 1987 p 135 72 hall and rabushka pp 7475

effects fall into three categories municipal bonds deductibility of state and local taxes and states tax structures77 g15g158g151g146g140g146g153g138g149g561g4g152g151g141g156g561 currently interest on municipal state and local bonds is exempt from federal corporate and individual income taxes this tax exemption has raised the market value of municipal bonds as noted above the effect of the hr proposal on interest rates is disputed but if interest rates decline only slightly or not at all the hr pr oposal would cause outstandi ng municipal bonds to decline sharply in value because of the elimination of the tax exemption the mere possibility of passage of the armey flat tax plan which is similar to the hr proposal reduced the value of outstanding municipal bonds78 many managers of municipal bond funds blamed discussions about flat taxes for the negative cash flow which plagued municipal bond funds throughout 199579 thus if the hr flat tax becomes law individuals owning municipal bonds would experience large capital losses furthermore state and local governments would have to pay higher interest rates on new debt i ssues because municipal securities would longer have tax advantage over other debt issues some economists dispute the wisdom of providing tax subsidy to municipal bonds thus the flat taxs removal of the subsidy may be beneficial

most state and local taxes this is form of revenue sharing for example if state raises its income tax individuals who itemize save on their federal income taxes an amount equal to their marginal federal income tax rate multiplied by the increase in their state income tax payments the hg flat tax would eliminate this tax preference this tax preference is particularly valuable to high income individuals in high tax states such as new york this tax preference has been controversial and some tax economists have recommended that it be curtailed or eliminated 80 77 an overview of the effects

states sales taxes their primary revenue source but most states also levy an income tax which is their second main source of revenue states with income taxes generally base their tax bases on the federal income tax base with slight variations if the federal government replaces its income taxes then the continuation of current state inco taxes would impose high compliance costs on individuals and businesses since these taxpayers would have to continue to calculate their income tax liabilities states would also have high admi nistrative costs but states probably would react by dropping their taxes on net income and adopting consumptionbased tax that would piggyback on the new federal consumption tax base thereby retaining the administrative and compliance benefits that flow from conforming to the federal tax base 81 g21g146g150g153g149g146g140g146g157g162g561 hr argue that their flat tax proposal would reduce drastically the current complexity of the us tax system tax

taxed the flat tax would also eliminate problems the current system encounters with measuring capital income capital gains attempts to distinguish between real and nominal income depreciation procedures and debt versus equity financing positive aspect of the proposed flat tax is the ease with which the individual and corporate tax systems could be integrated thus change that economists have long advocated for its economic efficiency could be accomplished in simple way but it would be possible to levy flat tax with an income base simply by retaining depreciation and inventory accounting the corporate and individual income tax systems could be integrated while retaining an income basewhat makes integration simple is the flat rate

flat tax system is simple the two tax forms can fit on postcards 82 the flat tax returns require little information and only few simple calculations but critics argue that there are numerous underlying complications six additional issues are relevant to the complexity of the proposed flat rate tax first the current income tax system is complex the federal tax code and the federal tax regulation are lengthy and continue to expand many taxpayers spend much time money and effort complying with the current income tax system the complexity of the tax code and the fear of the internal

ibm and the irs estimated the amount of time and money that individuals spend on federal tax compliance83 the authors found that in tax year 2000 1259 million individual taxpayers experienced total compliance burden of 321 billion hours and 188 billion84 this translates into an average burden of 255 hours and 149 per taxpayer85 furthermore for tax year 2003 7875 million individuals paid for the preparation of their returns86 the complexity of the income tax however should not be overstated for example for tax year 2004 the internal revenue service reported that only 4619 million returns out of 13238 million returns were filed by individuals who itemized their deductions87 also the complexity of the current tax code is partially due to attempts to achieve greater equity or improve economic efficiency and there are often tradeoffs between simplicity equity and efficiency second complexity may contribute to the gross income tax gapthe difference between income taxes owed and the amount voluntarily paid in timely mannerwhich the internal revenue service estimated is 350 billion for 200188 in addition widespread tax avoidance reduces tax revenues which in turn necessitates higher tax rates to raise given amount of revenue but enforcement efforts and late payments reduced the gross tax gap by 55 billion for 2001 furthermore it can be argued that in comparison to other developed nations current us tax compliance is satisfactory finally tax gap of unknown magnitude would occur under the flat tax third in comparison to the current income tax flat rate does little to reduce complexity because most taxpayers simply look up their tax liability in table fourth it can be argued that it may be unfair to compare the current income tax system with some form of pure consumption tax by the time consumption tax becomes enacted it may become complicated in part because of lobbying by special interest groups furthermore an initially simple tax may become complicated over time as it is revised fifth as an alternative to the flat tax the current income tax system could be simplified by expanding the tax base which would require eliminating tax preferences and reducing marginal rates sixth the flat tax can in some instances be more complicated rather than simpler than the tax it replaces for example federal government empl oyees and employees of nonprofits would have to add to their wage base the imputed value of their fringe benefits hence separate individual wage tax form would be necessary for these employees the actual calculation of the imputed value of fringe benefits would be complicated another example is that hr have not discussed tax issues concerning multinational corporations 83 john l guyton john f ohare michael p stavrianos and eric

united states and the current tax systems of other developed nations first although the united states is the only developed nation without broadbased consumption tax at the national level other developed nations adopted broadbased consumption taxes as adjuncts rather than as replacements for their income based taxes congressional proposals would replace our current income taxes with consumption taxes rather than use consumption taxes as adjuncts to our current income based system despite what is sometimes claimed the united states would thus be moving into unchartered waters second all developed nations with v ts except japan calculate their v ts using the credit invoice method the hr flat tax proposal how ever would use the subtraction method of calculation for the business tax the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt agreement requires that for consumption tax including v at to be rebatable on exports the tax must be levied on an item by item basis furthermore the business tax is not levied on wage income in contrast to most v ts the business tax would not be border adjustable consequently domestic firms would collect the business tax on their products sold domestically or exported but the business tax would not be collected on imported pro ducts but as previously discussed economic theory has long recognized that border tax adjustments have effect on the balanceoftrade because the balanceoftrade is function of international capital flows third most other developed nations have much larger public sectors government spending as percentage of gross domestic product than the united states these countries offer wider range of social benefits such as national health care in order to reduce inequality and lessen economic insecurity hence these nations need greater tax revenues and consequently levy both broadbased consumption taxes and income taxes g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the concept of replacing our current federal income tax system with flat rate consumption tax is receiving congressional interest the term flat tax is often associated with consumption tax proposal formulated by robert hall and alvi n rabushka two senior fellows at the hoover institution as of feb 1 2008 in the 110th congress three bill have been introduced concerning the hr flat tax concept representative chael burgesss proposal hr 1040 would allow taxpayers to select flat tax based on the concepts of hallrabushka as an alternative to the current income tax system senator richard c shelbys proposal s 1040 and senator arlen specters proposal s 1081 would replace individual and corporate income taxes and estate and gift taxes with flat tax based on the hallrabushka concept this report discusses the idea of replacing the cu rrent us income tax systemwhich is hybrid of an income and consumption taxwith pure consumption tax formulated by hr the combined individual and business taxes proposed by hr can be viewed as modified value added tax v t the individual wage tax would be imposed on wages and salaries and pension receipts part or all of an individuals wage and pension income would be tax free depending on marital status and number of dependents the business tax would be modified subtraction method v at with wages and salaries and pension contributions subtracted from the v t base

its wages and pension contributions when calculating its tax base hall and rabushka argue that replacing the existing individual income tax with their flat tax would be major improvement for three reasons the flat tax would be much simpler than the current complex income tax consumption is better tax base than income and the flat tax would be much more efficient than the current income tax system this reports examination of the hr flat tax pr oposal and their arguments supporting it looked at four topics broad economic issues narrow sectoral economic issues simplicity and international comparisons the broad economic issues concern the economic effects of the flat tax on the entire national economy the flat tax would be shifted backwards onto owners of equities old capital and wage earners the current income tax system is progressive but the incidence of the hr flat tax proposal across income classes is unknown the flat tax would reduce the tax burden on the young but increase it on the old whether the proposed flat tax would be more or less efficient than the current income tax system is unknown there is conclusive theoretical or empirical evidence that the flat tax proposal would significantly affect savings work effort investment or growth consumption base is neither inherently superior nor inferior to an income base the hr flat tax would not be border adjustable current economic theory holds that border tax adjustments have little effect on the balanceoftrade because the balanceoftrade is largely function of international capital flows the hr flat tax proposal would not require any change in the price level most economists believe that the hr flat tax would lower interest rates but minority of economists maintain that interest rates could rise revenue forecasting is an inexact if necessary science hence there is considerable concern that the initial revenue yield from the flat tax could be far too low or too high over the business cycle total tax revenues would be more stable under flat tax than under an income tax system narrow sectoral economic issues concern specific industries or sectors of the total economy the six microeconomic issues discussed were differential effects on businesses charitable organizations housing financial services health care and state and local governments most of these discussions related to the elimination of an existing income tax preference the simplicity of the proposed flat tax is emphasized by hall and rabushka positive aspect of the proposed flat tax is the ease with which the individual and corporate tax systems could be integrated the complexity of the current tax code is partially due to attempts by policymakers to achieve greater equity or improve economic efficiency in comparison to the current income tax flat rate per does little to reduce complexity because most taxpayers simply look up their tax liability in table it can also be argued that it may be unfair to compare the current income tax system with some form of pure consumption tax by the time consumption tax can be enacted it may become complicated as an option to the flat tax some observers maintain that the current income tax system could be simplified by expanding the tax base
