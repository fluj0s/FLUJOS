have had on their subsequent civilian lives the department of veterans affairs va administers directly or in conjunctio n with other federal agencies programs that provide compensation for disabilitie s sustained in military service pension s for disabled poor war veterans cash payments for certain categories of dependents andor survivors medical care for condition s sustained during military service and for other c onditions under priority system that results in most care being provided to low income veterans education training rehabilitation and job placement services to assist veterans upon their return t civilian life loan guarantees to help them obtain homes life insurance to enhanc financial security for their dependents and burial assistance flags gravesites an d headstones when they die the veteran population there were about 256 million veterans as of july 1 1997 of whom 196 million had served during at least one period defined as wartime the number of veteran s is declining and the average age increasing the median age of veterans was 57 7 years and 36 were over 65 years of age about 46 were female the va projects decline of about 26 in the number of veterans between 1990 and 2010 dow n from one of four men i n 1994 to one of eight in 2010 half of whom will be over age 65 declines in the size of military forces and the corresponding effect that decline has on the number of persons entering veterans status means relatively stabl numbers of compensated veterans and fewer veterans seeking readjustment fo r postservice education and training the number of disabled wartime veteran s receiving pensions is declining because of the death of existing beneficiaries an d because veterans who might once have depended upon va pensions as social safety net now have other sources of social insurance primarily social security that bring their incomes above the va pension eligibility levels the increasing average ag of veterans means additional demands for medical services from eligible veterans as aging b rings on chronic conditions needing more frequent care and lengthie r convalescence organization of the department of veterans affairs the va is divided into three administrative structures the veterans benefi t administration the veterans health administration and the national cemeter system va programs are funded through 24 appropriations

veteransother veterans issues before the 105 congressth persian gulf war illnesses and the presumption of servic connection modern warfare in the persian gulf american experience with the persian gulf war differed from previous largescale military operations of the 20 centuryth instead of manpower provided through conscription our forces were comprised of mostly volunteer soldiers regular activeduty personnel were supplemented by large contingent of reservists drawn from their civilian lives on fairly short notice the usual stresses of warfare were intensified by factors such as desert deployment in country with radically different culture an order of battle that elevate d technical sophistication to new heights unseen adversaries from microscopi c organisms to distant rocket launchers and infrequent relief from the stench of oi l well fires personnel were exposed to strong chemicals to ward off irritating an d potentially dangerous insects given drugs pyridostigmine bromide to provide measure of protection against possible nervegas attack and subjected to stead dose of propaganda by the foe that in spite of the apparen t odds against them victory would inevitably belong to iraq since returning from service in the gulf many veterans have complained f illnesses that they thought might be attributable to their service there commonl reported symptoms included fatigue muscle and joint pain severe headaches an d memory loss media reports began to charac terize the array of symptoms as the gulf war syndrome although single illness with the multitude of symptoms has been diagnosed and common characteristics of the veterans circumstances have been identified other than persian gulf service on land or at sea although majority of ill veterans have been diagnosed with recognized disease significant numbe r remain undiagnosed and appear to be suffering from multiple illnesses wit h overlapping symptoms and causes congress provided for all illness claims of persian gulf war veterans to b examined at va dical facilities illnesses diagnosed whenever possible symptoms treated if necessary and database created to facilitate further research into causes3 more than 100 federall yfunded research studies pertaining to gulf war illnesses are underway to date clinical studies have not found an unexplained increase i n deaths hospitalizations or

illnesses are related to chemical weapons but studies of the possible effects of multiple chemical exposure including the effects of lowlevel exposure to chemical weapons are underway the presidential advisory committee on gulf war veterans illnesses finding that many veterans clearly are experiencing medical difficulties connected to their service in the gulf war the advisory committee reviewed numerou s studies of gulf war veterans and their hea lth complaints the advisory committees report dated december 31 1996 concluded that scientific evidence had t produce d causal link between symptoms and illnesses reported by gulf wa r veterans and exposure to pesticides chemical warfare agents biological warfar agents vaccines py ridostigmine bromide infectious diseases depleted uranium oil well fires and smoke and petroleum products nevertheless the advisor committee recommends further research i n several areas including the medical risks especially longterm risks that might be related to multichemical exposure lowlevel exposure to chemical warfare agents and other toxic substances with recognize d carcinogenic potential that were known to present in the persian gulf war finally the report of the advisory committee emphasizes the need to examine closely th relationship between wartime stress and the broad range of physiological an d psychological illnesses currently being reported by gulf war veterans 4 the broader issue of presumptive serviceconnecti ons health services and potentia l cash payments may be given to veterans who experience disabilitie s traceable to period of m ilitary service however with some disorders evidence of serviceconnection is inconclusive cong ress has sometimes granted presumption of serviceconnection so that veterans can be treated and given appropriat compensation while scienti fic studies attempt to determine whether correlation can be found between risks encountered during military service and the subsequen t manifestation of disorder current concern that latent illnesses could be related to toxic exposure during gulf war service was preceded by similar concern that certain diseases could b related to exposure to agent orange or other herbicides in vietnam that concern was preceded by concerns that certain diseases could be related to exposure t nuclear radiation during world war ii or during atomic testing in the 1950s in these cases policy objectives were bas ed on the rationale that veterans should be given the benefitofthedoubt as to the treatment of illnesses potentially traceable to military service 1 these veterans were sick with serious diseases needing treatment 2 they did serv their country often in wartime combat zone and 3 capacity t provide the services existed if they were given highpriority access the effect of risk presumption on scientific study when c oncern mounted that exposure to herbicides in vietnam could have posed health risk th department of defense examined its records to determine which personnel ma actually have been exposed and what level of exposure they may have experiencedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97266crs9 however deployment records and troop movemen t data could not pinpoint exposure with accuracy and the conclusion was drawn that exposure to agent orange or to other herbicides regardless of their toxicity at sufficient levels to be potentiall disease causing had to be presumed given the widespread use of herbicides because exposure to toxic herbicides was presumed for any military personnel who served in vietnam during the period in which agent orange was used science need only provide evidence of an association between particular disease and exposur to herbicides in any setting and at any level of exposure in order to validate presumption that the disease is serviceconnected the benefit of the doubt and persian gulf war syndrome in the absence of firm scientific evidence to the contrary congress has given veterans of the persia n gulf war the benefitofthedoubt that their ailments may be connected to thei r military service however the basis for establishing scientifically link between an exposure to risk and the incidence of disease could be further eroded persian gulf war veterans were potentially exposed to large number of toxins and are w authorized to receive priority treatment for virtually unlimited list of symptoms researchers caution that it may be impossible to identify the causes of illness i n many gulf war veterans because of the absence of baseline data on the health f military personnel and the lack of reliable data on levels of exposure to potentia l risks in their wartime environment in effect because both exposure to toxic risk and the presence of disorder are presumed the statistical relationship between the risk level for one and the incidence of the other may be indeterminable priority health care and disability compensation authority to provide high priority medical care for vietnam veterans with diseases presumed linked t herbicide exposure expires december 31 2002 authorization for priority healt h care for veterans with diseases presumed linked to radiation exposure has been made permanent authority for priority he alth care for persian gulf war veterans has been extended through 2001 federa l research the dod va and hhs through the persian gul f
