secretary of state for legislative affairs pursuant to continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 central elements of us policy regarding international transfers of small arms and light weapons began to develop in the 1990s as part of overall us policy toward conventional arms transfers generally for its part the united states while recognizing that nations have legal right to acquire weapons including small arms for legitimate selfdefense purposes also recognizes that there have been civil conflicts in various less developed nations and regions that have been exacerbated by ready access to small arms and light weapons the us government wants to deal in practical and effective way with the problem of international small arms and light weapons trafficking in regions of conflict while continuing to recognize the legitimacy of legal trade manufacturing and ownership of arms3 principal objectives of united states policy to date the united states government has taken the position that illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons poses the greatest threat to regional security in lessdeveloped areas of the world undergoing civil strife thus the united states believes that combating the illicit weapons trade should be the focal point of international efforts us diplomacy has been directed to achieving that outcome illicit trafficking includes illegal sales to insurgent groups and criminal organizations illegal diversion of legitimate sales or transfers and black market sales in contravention of embargoes or national laws the recirculation of small arms and light weapons from one conflict to another and illegal domestic manufacturing of these items are also considered elements of illicit trafficking the united states has adopted multipronged approach in its diplomacy to combat illicit small arms trafficking the first element of united states policy is to attempt to curb black market or unauthorized transfers of small arms to zones of conflict to terrorists to international criminal organizations and to drug traffickers the second is to attempt to raise the arms export standards of other nations to us standards the third is to streamline and strengthen united states export procedures to improve accountability without interfering with the legal trade in and transfer of arms the fourth is to support the destruction of excess stockpiles of small arms particularly in regions where conflicts have ended as us ambassador donald j mcconnell has summarized the us perspective ultimately simple one size fits all solutions are ineffective in dealing with the complex often regionspecific problems caused by the proliferation of small arms and light weapons focused efforts to identify and curb the sources and methods of the illicit trade via robust export controls law enforcement measures and efforts to 2 continued section 1311of hrept 106479 3 see article by us ambassador donald j mcconnell deputy assistant

light weapons us policy and views are found in special issue at an online state department website at httpusinfostategovjournalsitps0601ijpeijpe0601htm crs3 expeditiously destroy excess stocks and safeguard legitimate government stocks from theft or illegal transfer are the best ways to attack the problem4 problems in implementing united states policy goals the us state department has reported that currently as many as seventy nations produce small arms and light weapons many through licensing arrangements with other producers these weapons are generally inexpensive and require minimal maintenance and training to operate the foreign small arms and light weapons trade whether it is legal or illegal does not lend itself to easy monitoring there is lack of global standards generally and there are widely differing standards among nations on how to monitor and regulate this trade definitions of what items should be covered are also source of difficulty while the export licensing and monitoring laws regulations and procedures of the united states are widely acknowledged to be the most transparent comprehensive and stringent in the world in many countries arms transfers that would be illegal in the united states are not prohibited as matter of law or regulation small arms and light weapons are easily concealed thus making it relatively easy for corrupt officials to permit illicit trafficking or for criminals to transfer these weapons especially in nations that lack the human and financial resources needed for adequate inspections and exportimport controls routes used for smuggling excess weapons into zones of conflict are chosen specifically to defy discovery and monitoring furthermore poorer nations desperate for hard currency are tempted to market excess weapons to secure this revenue5 and the widespread availability of these weapons further complicates establishment of control measures according to the state department available rough estimates indicate that the overall number of small arms and light weapons in circulation globally range from 100 to 500 million and up efforts to obtain precise data on totals regarding these weapons and their sources whether legal or illegal is generally guesswork6 steps taken by the united states to advance its policy goals the united states has been active in international efforts to address the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons on november 15 1997 the united states and 27 other nations signed the interamerican convention against the illicit trafficking in firearms this convention which will be legally binding on its adherents includes provisions to establish system to license and track firearms sales in states of the western hemisphere to enhance information exchanges on this trade among adherent states and to mark 4 ambassador donald j mcconnell combating the spread of small arms the us approach ibid 5 for illustrations of the difficulty of monitoring illicit international
