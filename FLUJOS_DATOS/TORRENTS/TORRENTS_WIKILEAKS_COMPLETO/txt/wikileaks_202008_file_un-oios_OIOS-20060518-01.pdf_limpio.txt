questio nnaire 3checkbldbetween september and december 2005 oios conducted an audit of unhcrs project profile overall oios assessed that the project was competently managed and that considerable advancement had been made wit h its implementation the findings and conclusions were d iscussed with the project board on 22 march 2006 draft of the report was shared with the director division f operational support whose comments which were re ceived in may 2006 are reflected in this final report checkbldas project profile has been success however for unhcrs new registration processsystem to be effective and sustainable and to achieve its longterm objectives unhcr needs to ensure that sufficient attention is given and oversight is provided to field offices to make sure they adequately budget for the necessary technolog ical requirements and the required level of skilled staf f checkbldas outlined in the project boards terms of referen ce tor its responsibilities included making subst antive decisions related to the project plans scope obje ctives staff and resources oios noted that while t he added value of the board was recognised particularly in light of the fact that profile was crossdivisional project and input from the various players was essential it did not fully fulfil its responsibilities instead of being cision making body and providing direction and oversight where necessa ry it was more of platform for information shari ng for the future unhcr needs to assess the rational of havin g decisionmaking project board senior managemen t are not always available which results in infrequent meetin gs while the accountability for the success or fail ure of the project cannot be clearly assigned checkbldthe standard registration procedures need to be sha rpened and improved with regard to information shar ing and privacy in light of this special attention should be given to the systems added functionality of bi ometrics as well as related issues such as data storage and archiving checkbldas long as the system is not fully operational with in unhcr the suggestion of government support and t hird party data sharing should be reconsidered or at least nsitised and limited checkbldthe knowledge transfer within and outside unhcr sho uld be improved future development plan for proj ect profile should be established including the impact of the expansion of unhcrs mandate to idps checkbldin conclusion oios was of the opinion that the pro ject profile team has made commendable efforts but in light of the project vision unhcr still has to address issue s such as senior management support resources and building on project results without ensuring the future viabil ity and development of the project especially in t he current tight financial situation there is risk that the syste m is too complicated and expensive to be sustained in the longterm audit of project profile audit of project profile executive summary executive

activities should be based it recommen ded basic considerations for registration and encouraged the development of registration guidelines as well as new techniques and tools checkbldthe overall objectives of the project are to design new standards and procedures to improve t he quality of registration and update guidelines ccordingly b develop new tools such as software and biometric s to help make registration tasks more uniform and effective c provide direct support to field operations in ca rrying out registration activities by using new met hods and tools and d ensure that staff

for regis tration by dips in conjunction with the population and geographic data section pgds in september 2003 p rovisional release b the creation of new global registration applic ation progres and c the rollout of progres as well as staff traini ng in all unhcr offices that register certain leve l of persons of concern checkbldthe expected impact of the project is an improved q uality of registration management and an improved quality of documentation and protection provided to persons of concern as well as ensuring equitable access to s ervices and entitlements in addition it was expected to improv the unhcr programme delivery with realistic popul ation indicators and verifiable assumptions 1 introduction 1 introduction 6the main objectives of the audit were to checkbldassess

objectives checkbldprior to embarking on project profile consultants deloitte were engaged to study and make recommend ations on the scope of the project oios understands that the results of the study and its recommendations were generally supported by unhcr checkbldit was concluded that senior managements continued support of population data management system was essential to the future success of the project the report also identified that checkbldthere were clear owners for the major population data processes and hence lack of common procedures standards and definitions which result ed in suboptimal information management processes checkbldthe technical infrastructure ie tools and techni ques was fragmented limiting the operational mechanisms for information capture usage and excha nge and checkbldonly very limited resources were dedicated to regis tration and population data management both at headquarters and in the field the limited knowledg experience and information available was continuously threatened due to lack of training p rovided checkbldin oios opinion commendable efforts have been made to address the findings and recommendations of the deloitte report and to incorporate them into projec t profiles objectives for example common registr ation standards have been developed an improved technica l infrastructure has been established by providing computer hardware consultants time and registration traini ng to field operations new registration manual w as provisionally published in 2003 and the final versio n is expected to be published by mid2006 94141project management project management 411 411 objectives cont objectives cont d d checkbldoios appreciates that the risks of nonachievement of the project objectives are well known to the pro ject team the main risks identified by the project are incomp lete andor inadequate registration of persons of c oncern as field operations do not consistently record and mai ntain information on persons of concern as well as proliferation of locally developed independent systems and the ck of consistent practices this can result in the loss of credibility with governmental and other partners an d waste of resources both human and financial checkbldin order to address these risks there needs to be c ontinuity in the deployment and development of regi stration standards and procedures including it systems oio s appreciates that unhcrs present serious financial constraints may have an effect on this in the short term nonetheless it is important that the project team under the guidance of the project board prioritise what i s achievable in 2006 and 2007 to ensure that the ne w registration processsystem becomes effective and that its susta inability is guaranteed otherwise all work done wi ll be lost and the envisaged longterm advantages of the proje ct will not be realized checkbldin oios opinion further steering and prioritising especially with regard to the individual country perations is required this cannot be achieved by the project am on its own and this must therefore be the respons ibility of unhcr senior management both at headquarters and at the field level the discussions whether to contin ue project profile in 2007 will not in oios opinion resolve the fundamental issues challenging the viab ility and sustainability of the project results but only pos tpone the inevitable need for their resolution 10 project profile project board checkbldproject profile is an interdivisional effort led b the division of operational support the project

not include representative of dist 1representatives of dist have nevertheless attended board meetings in oios opinion as project profile is an information technology intensive project and one of the strategic platform s for future application development in unhcr dist should have been an official member from the outset the board agreed to this checkbldaccording to its terms of reference the project bo ard should have made all the substantive decisions related to the project including those related to project plans content scope objectives staffing resources and budgets the board was responsible for overseeing the work reviewing external contracts entered into before submission t the committee on contracts monitoring achievements ensuring ade quate and appropriate progress and making recommen dations to adjust refocus and redirect the project as neces sary to meet the project objectives checkbldin oios view the board did not meet regularly enoug h to fulfill its responsibilities oios received nutes of only four meetings and was not able to establish if any other meetings were held checkbldthe board added value as an information sharing pla tform since it was crossdivisional project and input and opinions from the various players involved were ess ential it did not however fully fulfil its respons ibilities as decision making body 1at the time itts 41 project management 41 project management 412 ownership and governance 412 ownership and governance 11 checkbldfor the future unhcr needs to assess the rational of having decisionmaking project board where acc ountability for the success or failure of the project cannot be clearly assigned checkbldoios is pleased to note that new it governance bo ard has been established that will be responsible for reviewing the substance of all it related projects ownership of registration checkbldproject profile is formally part of dos although the project is interdivisional by nature and cont ent according to the latest plans presented to oios after the phase out of the project its content registration expe rtise will stay within dos under pgds while technical support will be provi ded by dist checkbldthere is further layer of ownership namely of th registered data oios understands that the regist ration data is currently owned by the country operations responsib for the registration that are also directly res ponsible for assuring adequate resources to allow for registration checkbldoios noted that dips has direct role in the regi stration process even though registration data are utilized and refined for protection purposes at later stages of the life cycle of unhcrs persons of concern the registration process and the systems used for that process thus form an inseparable part of protection oios was in formed that dips had suspended the development efforts of case management systems awaiting the outcome of project profile if the development work is to continue dips and dos n eed to agree on systems and data ownership as we ll as the management of the development efforts checkbldoios is of the opinion that without clear ownership the sustainability of the registration process is ambiguous recommendation 01 41 project management 41 project management 412 ownership and governance cont 412 ownership and governance cont d d 12 41 project management 41 project

nine project team staff five wer hired under temporary assistance ta for 2006 two persons we re selected for their respective posts and one ta c ontract expired at the end of 2005 checkbldalthough project profile was initially set out to l ast only two years in light of which it may have b een appropriate to hire the project coordinator through ta ct in retrospect this may not have been the correc t approach the project coordinator contract has had to be cont inually extended since september 2002 the other fo ur staff on ta contracts also occupied functions with an expect ed duration of more than 12 months namely those of the technical architect of the progres system and the r ollout team registration officer this way of hiri ng staff for project although it allowed flexibility and timeli ness in getting the team on board has in the long run caused an additional administrative burden to the project checkbldwith regard to the budget the following table indi cates the estimates as well as the actual budget sp ent on project profile 13 41 project management 41 project management 413 resources cont 413 resources cont d d checkbldas the table indicates the budget initially at th project scope stage estimated that the project w ould cost us 12 million over threeyear period the budget was ter decreased to us 10 million over twoyear per iod current cost estimates relate to us 12 million while the p roject is moving into its fourth year and may be ex tended to fifth year which will have financial consequences checkbldthe bulk of the expenditure to date comprised checkbldstaffing costs about us 5 million checkbldinformation system development contracts us 19 m illion checkbldtravel related to the field rollout us 19 milli on and checkbldnew it equipment for about us 15 million checkbldthis does not however reflect the actual costs of the project as other additional supporting contri butions were made by pgds and dist eg dist has dedicated seve n fulltime posts to project profile in 2006 the project has also supported ongoing registration efforts tha t would have created expenditure it was correctly pointed out however that costs savings resulted from those cost s associated with registration activities and incl uded in the normal budget submissions it is difficult therefo re to quantify the trueadditional costs checkbldoios observed that considering the importance and h igh expectations of the project it had to operate with bare minimum of staff this has been huge challenge fo r the project especially as the implementation tea ms were travelling to field operations some 70 per cent of their time checkbldgiven the availability of funds the project provid ed some country operations with additional resource s equipment and technical support for the progres system this additional support at cost for the operation will not be available after the project ends oios found little evidence in the country operations plans for 2006 that they had prepared for the project implementation by budgetin g the necessary resources equipment staffing skil ls training etc to maintain progres rather the contrary in the responses to the oios field questionnaire 14 checkbldthe introduction of the unhcr standard registratio n procedures is challenge considering the wide ra nge of registration practices adopted by field offices in cluding the different interpretations for some comm only used terms these challenges were encountered by the implementa tion teams during the roll out and the training of staff at field offices checkbldwithout forward direction and monitoring of field p rocedures and with the passage of time oios is co ncerned that the new common registration standards may be eroded while unhcrs new registration handbook describes the principles and standards of registration and provid practical information on how to register manage population data and issue documentation this alone is not sufficie nt to ensure consistent global unhcr registration system in the longer term already number of followup mission s of the project profile team have been requested f or additional training report development and data cleaning checkbldas noted above each country operation implementing the new registration standards was provided with t raining on the new registration standards and the progres syste m oios was informed that key persons were not alwa ys selected for the training and in some cases the training wa s allocated simply to staff showing an interest in the subject training is costly to the organization and it shoul d have been focused and directed to the correct per sons if not the future and the sustainability of the project is in jeopardy and the longterm capacity of staff respon sible for this function is not assured the board members mentioned that as field staff fi eld officers and assistants are normally responsible for the registration process efforts sh ould be madeto provide these staff with the necessa ry skills and expertise to conduct their functions effectively recommendation 02 42 project results 42 project results 421 standard 421 standard

plan project profile w ill have rolled out progres in most country operati ons performing registration before the project is phased out checkbldin some field offices where there is large casel oad and highly customised systems are already in us eg iran and afghanistan the systems will not be replaced by pr ogres at least in the shortterm also for some co untry operations where caseloads are small system like progres w ith database server and technical support require ments will be too advanced and costly to handle checkbldprogres is distributed database application and unlike previous registration systems it is not s tandalone application that could in terms of technical skill s be operated by all staff progres requires speci alized technical support for long term and largescale use the curr ent support plan is based on the idea that dist pro vides technical support and dospdgs provides the registration rela ted content support for field operations checkbldafter the progres system has gone live the responsi bility for operating it rests with each field locat ion this requires willingness of each field office to allocate the ne cessary resources to maintain the data and the syst em these skills are not always available locally which could mean the recruitment of international staff this comes at price checkbldthe support issue should be considered in wider c ontext considering the need for consolidated field data management and the different support layers at loca l regional and headquarters level recommendation 03 16 checkblddue to budget constraints during the development st age of progres the reporting feature was excluded from the first release and was only later included as an addon f unctionality as progres is highly configurable and the reporting needs in country operations vary greatly various f ield operations have developed their own reports t here are standard reports developed or consistently installe d to address most of the general country or headqua rter level reporting needs in oios opinion without fully sta ndardizing at least few reports some of the adva ntages of progres are lost checkbldto be able to provide support for the current varie ty of reports developed at the country level may bec ome challenge if for example 50 country operations have 10 diffe rent reports each the end result is 500 different reports oios is concerned that by concentrating on the needs of ind ividual country operations the opportunities for i mprovement and streamlining of management information will be lost checkbldin the responses to the oios field questionnaire r eporting was the area most mentioned as requiring i mprovement in terms of the possibility to create new reports and or the skills needed to produce reports recommendation 04 42

checkbldover the course of the project the introduction of biometrics has been considered the currently teste d biometric features is fingerprinting the fingerprinting tech nology has been attached to the core progres system as an addon function sponsored by the dutch government and dev eloped by hsb netherlands checkbldwhile biometrics is seen as very valuable tool fo r validating the registration process it is cost ly method to use further consideration of using the feature is there fore necessary and the project profile team should clarify in which situations the use of biometrics is recommended recommendation 05 checkbldwith regard to the storage of the fingerprint data it has been decided that only the template of the fingerprint will be stored ie not the actual image but rather code d description of the fingerprint oios agrees with this approach as it saves storage space and eases the capacity requi rements of the database servers in addition it pro vides extra security as the original fingerprint is not readil available checkbldit should be highlighted however that this storage limitation binds unhcr to the currently selected ve ndor as the coding methodology used is proprietary technology 18 42 project results 42 project results 424 424 governmentimplementing partner support governmentimplementing partner support checkbldthe use of registration data is not limited to coun try operations as field offices are required to pr ovide wide range of statistics based on progres the system indirect ly facilitates data analyses of themes or regions eg general statistics of particular region movements of per sons of concern from one country operation to anoth er etc in addition specific data may be required for externa l partners eg countries considering resettlement of refugees checkbldin paragraph v of the conclusion of the excom date d october 2001 unhcr is requested to explore the modalities for sharing data with states for the sp ecific purposes acknowledged in paragraph f of co nclusion 91 in manner that fully respects international norms and standards regarding personal data protection f of conclusion 91 reads the confidential nature f personal data and the need to continue to protect confidentiality also recognizes that the appropriate sharing of som personal data in line with data protection princi ples can assist states to combat fraud to address irregular moveme nts of refugees and asylum seekers and to identify those not entitled to international protection under the 1951 convention andor 1967 protocol checkbldthe latest progres version 20 supports function ality to share partial registration database with third parties like implementing partners and governments this functio nality has not been tested and therefore there is information available on whether the planned operational scenar io would work in practice nor on the amount of supp ort required by the third party concerned the system requires technical competence that is not readily available in some regions of the world noting the challenges progres support brings to unhcr field offices considerably more t hought should be given to the practicalities involved in s haring the system with third parties if unhcr fiel d offices do not have the expertise to maintain the system it is likely that many of its counterparts governmentsi mplementing partners will recommendation 06 19 checkbldthere are currently clear guidelines for the pri vacy issues related to individual refugee data in lectronic format including data sharing within unhcr as well as wit h the host country country of origin and country f possible resettlement this issue becomes even more pertinen t in light of the fingerprinting technology checkbldto overcome some of the challenges created by the c urrent headquarters based support of progres the t echnical support group has direct remote access to progres i n some country operations and backup field inform ation at the geneva level in others this direct access means th at there is possibility to remotely access the fidential data collected by the field systems although this acces s enables advanced users to support field operation s there is formal security policy to guide and safeguard the use of these confidential data checkbldoios appreciates that dos and dips are currently veloping policies concerning the use of biometric d ata and data confidentiality nonetheless in oios view the cov erage should be widened to include guidelines and p olicies on electronic refugee data storage archiving and sh aring the sharing of information also requires cle ar guidelines on the validation of data received from third parties recommendation 07 42 project results 42 project results 424 424

and shared this includes data sharing w ith the system vendors but also internal data shar ing recommendation 08 checkbldoios observed that there are strategic plans on how to further develop progres in particular devel opment relating to the maintenance of the system should it only in clude fixing severe bugs or should it include sm all enhancements and possibilities for new development such as the expansion of the use of data and addin g protection related components for case management need to be addressed checkbldmoreover unhcr while building the progres system procured the system development from an outside ven dor the understanding was that by the end of the develo pment process the vendor would provide unhcr with th source code as well as the other documentation relating t the system to enable unhcr to support and further develop progres the source code has been provided to unhcr but oios was informed that the related documentat ion was not currently readily available oios has establish ed that there are only two staff members in unhcr wh have any notable experience in the progres system developmen t environment and they are not highly experienced in using system
