inflationadjusted do llars since world war ii us bilateral aid to the region rose sharply in the early 1960s as most african countries achieved independence this was also time of intense cold war competition with the soviet union aid reached another peak in 1985 when famine struck wide areas of sub saharan africa the peak may also have resulted in part from heightened cold warhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33591crs2 competition reflected in president reagan s 1983 description of the soviet union as an evil empire toward the end of the 1980s competition with the soviet union began to fade as us priority while efforts to reduce the us budget deficit began to intensify contributing to an overall re duction in assistance to africa moreover policymakers were placing increased emphasis on hum an rights and commitment to economic reform programs in making their decisions on aid allocations consequently aid to some african countries that had been majo r cold war aid recipients such as zaire now the democratic republic of the cong and liberia was sharply reduced nonetheless there was another spike in aid in 1992 when famine struck the horn of africa and the southern part of the contin ent aid then dropped again with the reductions coming almost entirely in the securityoriented programs military assistance not included in figure 1 and especially the economic support fund esf esf aid is type of economic assistance allocated by the state department in consultation with the us agency for international development usaid with the objective of promoting us security interests from the mid1980s many in congress and in the wider aidoriented co mmunity had come to believe that the security assistance programs in africa had grown too large and that more us aid should be used to promote longterm development source prepared by congressional research service in 1995 at the beginning of the 104th c ongress proposals to restructure and reduce the us foreign assistance program ra ised questions about the future of us aid to subsaharan africa many questi oned the strategic rationale for assisting africa in the postcold war era and asserted that 30 years of us assistance had accomplished little whether in terms of promoting economic growth and democratization or achievi ng other objectives th critics generally favored humanitarian assistance but sought sharp cu ts in other programs as the aid debate proceeded however it became apparent that cuts for africa would be less than initially anticipated the view that the united states has important humanitarian economic and other objectives in africa was vi gorously asserted by supporters of the1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 20050500100015002000250030003500millions of constant 2005
