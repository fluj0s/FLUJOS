created to aid small businesses because they are viewed as important sources of job creation and economic growth but are typically disadvantaged in competing against large firms many minorityowned small businesses are even more disadvantaged and they can apply to join programs that provide limited competition contracts and technical assistance to help them to grow and gain experience to compete successfully against larger businesses the sba has many programs that affect every state and congressional district the disaster loan programs are the subject of frequent congressional and media attention because of complaints about slow processing of loan applications the sba does not view these programs as immediate assistance but the public frequently is looking for rapid response most members of congress receive many constituent inquiries about sba loans the loan guarantee programs and special contracting programs except for disaster loans the sba does not directly make loans to businesses instead it provides guarantees for private business loans that lenders would not otherwise be willing to make under desirable terms such as maturity and interest rate the sba also provides funding to sele cted financial intermediaries that invest in and otherwise support small businesses the sba reviews loan and guarantee applications to assure that there is reasonable probability that loan will be repaid in the event of default on loan the sba uses all available avenues to obtain repayment including seizing income tax refunds this report summarizes the major sba programs it will be updated if ne w programs are added or existing programs phased out

business administration sba not only represents the interests of small businesses but it also provides disaster recovery loans for hurricanes floods and even terrorist attacks to individuals and businesses after hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 many criticized the sbas disaster loan program for not processing loan applications rapidly1 and for allowing large businesses to win government contracts meant for small businesses2 this report provides an overview of the sbas programs the sba s programs have detailed rules on program requirements and administration that are not covered in this report detailed information is available on the sbas website 15 usc 631 et seq and in title 13 of the code of federal regulations3 the small business act states that continued free competition is the essence of the american economic system4 it declares that it is the policy of congress to insure that fair proportion of government contracts are awarded to small businesses and to support small businesses with financing export support and other means moreov er the act charges the sba with representing small business interests with other government agencies the sba also has programs for disadvantaged groups to overcome disadvantages that members of racial and ethnic minorities face in business these programs give participants training and reduced competition for government contracts after graduating from the programs the sba expects that the firms should be able to compete more successfully for government and private sector work sbas origins can be traced to the great depression of the 1930s and world war ii when concerns about unemployment and war production were paramount the sba replaced the reconstruction finance corporation rfc which was created by the federal government in 1932 to provide funding for businesses of all sizes during the depression and later financed war production the rfc shrank during the early 1950s after the end of world war ii and was disbanded amidst charges of political favoritism in granting loans in 1953 congress passed the small business act pl 83163 that created the sba the sba has undergone many changes since 1953 one key change is that it longer makes direct loans to businesses or individuals except for disaster loans as general principle and following its statutory mandate the sba is willing to take more risks than other lenders will but there is limit to the amount of risk it is willing to accept to reduce risk it seeks collateral and examines the borrowers ability to repay loan for example loans and loan guarantees of more than 10000 usually require collateral for some loans and loan guarantees personal guarantees are required if the collateral is considered insufficient by the lender or the sba in short these are loans that must be repaid not grants that are not repaid appropriations cover salaries expenses and losses after debt recovery in the sbas lending and guarantee programs one trend during the

approved for ss than the requested amount by the sba for physical disaster loan are in some circumstances eligible for grants from the federal emergency management agency fema one reason that nonprofit might be approved for less than the full amount by the sba is request for more than 15 million the sba could approve the 15 million and reject the excess the borrower could then approach fema for the amount denied g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g11g151g147g158g155g162g561g6g146g156g138g156g157g142g155g561g14g152g138g151g156g561 economic injury disaster loans eidl are limited to

four types of programs to directly support small businesses that are not affected by disasters the first are loan guarantees in which the sba guarantees loans to small businesses that the private sector would otherwise be unw illing to make because of the risk the second are contracting programs for small businesses that can involve sole source limited competition and cost advantages in government contract competitions sometimes the use of small business subcontractors is an evaluation factor for the prime contractor when government agency is planning procurement it chooses between one of these vehicles and full and open competition in which there are special advantages for small businesses the third are capital access programs that indirectly provide equity funding for small businesses and improve access to capital markets through sba guarantees the fourth are entrepreneurial development programs to provide training to small business owners mostly using volunteers and nonprofits to qualify for any of the sba programs an organization must be both business and small g25g145g138g157g561g11g156g561g138g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g501g561 to participate in either type of program business must meet the sbas definition of small business this is business that is organized for profit has place of business in the united states makes contribution to the us economy by paying taxes or using american labor products and materials and does not exceed the size standard for its industry10 what is small the definition of smallcalled the size standarddepends on what business produces also depending on what is produced the sba determines the size standard either in terms of dollars of revenue or number of employees but not both 11 for example most manufacturers must have more than 500 employees to meet the size standard most general and heavy construction firms except dredging must have an average annual revenue of 31 million or less the formal determination
