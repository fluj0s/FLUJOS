collateral damage natural disasters and industrial emitters may require decon the presence of contamination generally reduces the effectiveness of our combat power contamination forces us into protective equipment that degrades our ability to perform individual and collective tasks contamination forms 11 the following are the different forms of contamination solids radioactive particles biological spores or dusty agents that could appear as fine dust liquids liquid droplets that fall like rain droplets can range from thick and sticky to the consistency of water vapors or gases created by bursting munitions or generators these clouds are affected by the weather and can cover large areas aerosols fine liquids or solid particles suspended in the air they behave much like vapors contaminationhazards transmission 12 contamination hazards can be transmitted in the following manner transfer anything that touches surface covered with liquid or solid contamination will tend to pick up that contamination and move it from one surface to another spread touching surface covered with liquid chemical agent can spread contamination on the same surface thereby increasing the size of the contaminated area vapor vapors can be carried through the air in the form of dust atomized liquids aerosols or true gases vapors in an openoutdoor area disperse rapidly so there is need to decon desorption liquidchemical contamination absorbs into porous surfaces once absorbed it begins to desorb or give off gas that is low levels of vapor pass out of the contaminated surface into the air and can be transferred to any surface that contacts it including bare skin radiation radiation is given off by radioactive dust or dirt most of which appears as fallout for decon purposes radiation can be thought of as solid12 introductionfm 35mcwp 3373 agent classification 13 depending on the length of time agents will be hazard they are classified as nonpersistent an immediate threat that lasts few minutes they rarely require decon persistent takes longer time to act and may last for days in protected environment these agents can last for long periods of time all agents are affected to some extent by the weather even radiological particles can rain out of the air and form hot spots on the ground biological organisms are greatly affected by sunlight chemical agents can be decontaminated by the weather the duration of hazard is complex estimation that is based on numerous factors which include the onesansinvtype of contamination onesansinvcontamination density and droplet size onesansinvtemperature onesansinvwind speed onesansinvsunlight onesansinvhumidity and rain onesansinvcomposition of the contaminated surface onesansinvtype of soil and terrain decontaminants 14 decontaminants are described as follows natural weather rain wind and humidity standard supertropical bleach stb and decontaminating solution number 2 ds2 nonstandard soaps and detergents 15 for more information on the types of decontaminants see appendix b decon concepts 16 whenever soldiers are unable to avoid contamination and have to use protective measures decon is necessary to allow them to remove their protective gear and resume normal operations weathering is the most desirable means of decon however time and operational needs may not permit that option 17 this chapter describes when where and how much to decon protective clothing missionoriented protective posture mopp gear protective equipment and collective protective shelters cpss offer only temporary solution decon is the removal destruction or naturalization of contamination if you become contaminated some decon must occur as soon as possible decon decisions 18 the decision to decon is risk assessment and is made within the context of the mission enemy terrain troops time available and civilianintroduction 13fm35mcwp3373 consideration metttc and the resources available decon must be considered if the contamination levels exceed the negligible risk levels as follows chemical and biological contamination causes mild incapacitation in 5 percent or less of unprotected soldiers operating for 12 continuous hours within 1 meter of contamination for the chemicalagent monitor cam this equates to onebar reading at distance of 1 inch from the surface radiological contamination can cause mild incapacitation in 25 percent or less of unprotected nonpreviously exposed soldiers this equates to reading of more than 033 centigray per hour cgyhr 19 moppgear exchange provides excellent protection against field concentrations of agents however wearing the gear causes performance degradation decon is performed to restore the normal operating tempo but the logistical support that is required to keep soldiers in mopp gear impacts operations therefore decon should be conducted as soon as practical table 1 1 provides comparison data for decon levelstechniques table 11 comparison

least costly method of decon expend resources where they count decon as far forward as possible while metttc dependent performing decon as close to the point as possible reduces the spread of contamination and minimizes any transfer hazard decon by priority the commander identifies which items are most critical to the mission restoring combat power and reestablishing operating tempo are key decon levels 111 the three levels of decon operations are immediate operational and thorough see table 11 page 13 immediate 112 skin decon is soldiers basic survival skill and should be performed within 1 minute of being contaminated using the skin decontaminating kit sdk 113 personal wipe down should be performed within 15 minutes this is done to remove contamination from individual equipment by using an individual equipment decon kit iedk use detector paper or cam to locate the agent for radiological contamination use radiac set to locate it and then brush wipe or shake it off 114 operators spray down should be done within 15 minutes operators use the onboard decon apparatus to decon surfaces that they must touch or contact to operate the equipment radiological contamination in the form of dust particles may be wiped scraped or brushed off operational 115 moppgear exchange should be performed within 6 hours of being contaminated when thorough decon cannot be done soldiers will continue to wear mopp gear and the operating tempo will be reduced 116 vehicle washdown should be performed within 6 hour of being contaminated when the mission does not permit thorough decon this process removes gross contamination and limits the spread of it thorough 117 detailed equipment decon ded and detailed aircraft decon dad restore items so that they can be used without mopp gear normally the ded and the dad are conducted as part of reconstitution or during breaks in combat operations these operations require support from chemical decon unit 118 detailed troop decon dtd normally takes place in conjunction with deddad the contaminated unit conducts this process and supports the deddad operationsintroduction 15fm35mcwp3373 chemicalagentresistant coating carc 119 army equipment is painted with carc which precludes the absorption of chemical agents and thus facilitates decon by preventing penetration of an agent contamination is easier to remove thickened agents are still problem but detergent and water should remove them 120 the proper carc paint colors should be used to paint bumper numbers spot painting and so forth do not use other paints in lieu of carc weather effects 121 if metttc allows leaving the contamination alone is the easiest method of decon however marking reporting and periodically rechecking the contamination are required temperature 122 the higher the temperature the faster the rate of evaporation contamination persistency decreases as the temperature rises it has effect on radiological contamination wind 123 aeration aids in decon agents are dispersed by the wind thus reducing the concentration humidity and rain 124 moisture tends to break down chemical agents but does so slowly heavy rain physically removes contamination however contaminated runoff may build up in drainage areas biological agents dehydrate dry out in low humidity thus reducing their persistency rain may prevent the desorption of aerosols and leach contamination into the soil sunlight 125 sunlight hastens the evaporation and decomposition of agents ultraviolet and infrared radiation in sunlight rapidly kills most biological agents time 126 only time will neutralize and destroy radiological contamination other techniques merely shield or remove the problem d c nc m b t 127 combat effectiveness is degraded by mopp decon can remove the contamination and restore combat power the detection and warning network is vital to ensure that soldiers and equipment are protected when contamination is encountered considerations of decon in combat are immediate decon it saves lives and permits the use of individual equipment and key systems operational decon it reduces the spread and the level of contamination in some cases when combined with weathering mopp levels may be reduced without further decon thorough decon it removes the unit from the fight but allows it to return with restored effectiveness16 introductionfm 35mcwp 3373 128

hours upon making decision to decon you request support from your battalion coordination is made for an operational decon route to an alternate position you have 2 ½ hours to complete the movement and be in firing position the alternate position is 20 minutes away with the decon site about halfway you send the advance party to meet the supporting powerdriven deconequipment pdde crew and organize the site the crew sets up and runs the vehicle washdown while the advance party with battery supply personnel prepares the moppgear exchange the battalion chemical noncommissioned officer nco directs the vehicle washdown as you rotate one platoon at time through the site the firing platoons go quickly as it is critical to have the artillery firing tables available you complete the operation and are in position to fire at the prescribed time your soldiers are in mopp4 because vapor hazard still exists from the residual contamination the advance party found the new area clear of contamination and ammo resupply commences as sections begin improving their positions gun crews one and two leave one soldier on each gun and move the rest of the soldiers 65 feet upwind after check on contamination proves negative the battery nbc nco directs unmasking procedures using two crew members when symptoms show up the crews eat and get relief from the masks the wind direction is monitored

operational decon limits the spread of contamination allows temporary relief from mopp4 and facilitates additional decon requirements by speeding up the weathering process the need for thorough decon may be eliminated this process requires about 120squareyard area and depending on the number of contaminated vehicles may not require nearby water source an operational decon consists of vehicle washdown and moppgear exchange the techniques that may be used to conduct an operational decon are decentralized company control centralized battalion control or centralized brigade control techniques 31 decentralized company control is provided by the unit commander the commander requests pdde support selects the decon site links up with the pdde crew and executes the operational decon 32 centralized battalion control is similar to the above except that the battalion chemical nco controls the decon the site is selected by the battalion commander and the battalion chemical nco directs site setup and security and provides command and control c2 the battalion chemical nco travels with the pdde and communicates via the radio 33 centralized brigade control is done when decon assets within the brigad have been consolidated in this technique the brigade chemical nco performs those functions described for the battalion chemical nco the advantages and disadvantages of operationaldecon techniques are listed in table 31 page 3 2 phases 34 the three phases for an operational decon are preparation execution and site clearance preparation 35 the preparation phase starts with the decision to conduct an operational decon and ends with site that is set up and ready for operation the decision to decon was described in chapter 1 the cam is used to identify which vehicles need decontaminating and pdde support is requested coordination with higher headquarters hq includes identifying the linkup point and the unit that will provide the pdde support signal operating

controlling hq the site may have been designated in the operation order opord or selected based on the current metttc for site characteristics see table 32 37 linkup at the designated point includes establishing security positioning any necessary marshalling areas camouflaging removal points designating the direction of flow into and out of the site and ensuring that unit supply has sufficient replacement mopp gear 38 site setup requires the pdde crew to position itself upwind from the entrance set up the moppgear exchange about 164 feet upwind from the vehicle washdown at 45 angle notify the contaminated unit when the site is ready execution 39 the execution phase starts with establishing positive control over the site and ends with processing the last contaminated vehicle and soldier through the site vehicles move from the predecon area to the site either on order or by watching the vehicle ahead contaminated soldiers leave the vehicle and proceed to the moppgearexchange point the contaminated unit provides security 310 each vehicle receives 2 to 3minute washdown with hot soapy water and moves to point near the moppgear exchange any remaining soldiers requiring moppgear exchange will do so then when the squad or crew has finished it remounts its vehicles and moves into an afterdecon assembly area aa to await further instructions or moves to its next battle position site clearance 311 the siteclearance phase includes cleanup marking and reporting metttc will dictate the cleanup requirements the pdde crew buries or double bags and removes contaminated mopp gear

and individual equipment so that troops can operate it safely for extended periods at reduced mopp levels since small risk of contamination remains periodic checks with the cam the m8m9 detector paper or the m256a1 detector kit must be performed after each operation thorough decon can be done as part of reconstitution or it can be done to support operations throughout the battlefield after thorough decon the unit moves out of the decon site into tactical aa the unit while in this tactical assembly may undergo reconstitution or prepare for future operations combatservicesupport css elements replenish combat stocks refit equipment and replace personnel and equipment as required the contaminated unit with some assistance from chemical unit does the dtd supporting chemical unit does the ded or dad the planning considerations that are required to conduct thoroughdecon operations and the methods that various chemical units decon and smokedecon use to conduct dtdded are discussed in this chapter the exact layout of thoroughdecon site is determined by metttc planning 41 thorough decon is the most effective type of decon but is the most resource intensive combination of weather conditions agent used mission requirements time troops and supplies available may make weathering the decon option of choice commanders decide which type of decon is required based on the recommendation of the chemical personnel 42 generally thoroughdecon operations are conducted beyond the range of enemy directfire systems if contaminated unit requires thorough decon as part of reconstitution operations the decon site is established near the reconstitution area or the brigades rear area usually companysized units are reconstituted in their brigades rear area while battalionlevel units are reconstituted in their divisions rear area organizations larger than battalion will be reconstituted in the corpss rear area further information about reconstitution can be found in fms 1005 and 1009 43 all echelons prepare for thoroughdecon operations as part of the overall planning process from the commanders general guidance the chemical staff can begin to develop the decon plan coordination with higher hq is required to determine the availability of engineer support for site preparation and closure engineers can provide support for sump preparation drainage ditches and sumps coordinate with the civilaffairs office for hostnationthorough decon 42fm 35mcwp 3373 support personnel equipment and supplies and for environmental requirements and restrictions 44 the chemical staff selects possible decon sites throughout the units area of operation ao based on such factors as decon type terrain mission threat road network and availability of water after the decon sites are selected linkup points are chosen to support each site site may have more than one linkup point 45 since decon assets are limited the commander must establish priority of decon support the priority of support lists the units in the order they will receive decon support this can change from phase to phase during an operation the chemical staff develops the priority of support based on an understanding of the commanders intent 46 to give priority of support to the lead task force during the assault phase may not be the best choice since any contaminated elements will most likely not stop for decon until after the assault is completed the commander should establish priority of work that specifies the order in which equipment will be decontaminated for example priority of work may be in this order engineer equipment artillery pieces main battle tank and longhaul vehicles limiting factor is the availability of water typical vehicle requires 500 gallons of water during the ded the actual amount of water required varies by the vehicle and its contamination level the supported units chemical staff must develop water resupply plan for thoroughdecon operations 47 water resupply plan can be as simple as selecting series of linkup points along route where the chemical unit can link up with bulk water truck more complex water resupply plans include caching water throughout the ao coordinating for the movement of water bladders by aircraft and identifying water sources in the units ao the use of nonpotable salt and brackish waters should be considered preparation 48 subordinate units review their higher hq decon plan if additional decon sites or assets are required request them from the higher hq the supporting deconplatoon leader conducts leaders recon of the designated decon sites since the decon sites are initially selected by map recon the actual site may not be suitable if the selected site cannot support decon operations the chemical unit leader attempts to find another site close to the original site and notifies the supported unit and his higher hq of the change 49 the deconplatoon unit leader determines the support requirements that

security medical support is also required depending on the operational situation and the threat some ded sites may be prepared in advance routes must be established and published in the opord leading the contaminated unit to the linkup point note units must be informed not to proceed directly to the decon sitethoroughdecon 43fm35mcwp3373 execution 410 the actual decon operation begins once unit requests decon support the unit leader must assess his situation and accurately report it to his hq this situation report should include the type and extent of contamination the current location his assessment of the units ability to perform the current mission while contaminated and the time he expects the unit to become combat ineffective the contaminated unit should perform immediatedecon techniques to increase its survivability and to limit the spread of contamination an operational decon should also be considered and performed as appropriate the request for decon support must contain several essential elements of information to assist the chemical staff and the deconplatoon leader in coordinating the decon operation these essential elements of information are the designation of the contaminated unit location of the contaminated unit time the unit became contaminated earliest possible time the unit can movebegin decon type of contamination number and type of vehicles contaminated special requirements patientdecon station recovery assets unit d c nt m n ds of r t h supported units frequency and call sign to facilitate initial linkup 411 the supporting chemical unit

chemical unit 412 the supported unit must coordinate the movement of the contaminated unit to the linkup point if the contaminated unit is out of the supported units ao the move must be coordinated with the higher hq 413 once the chemical unit is set up the deconplatoon leader moves to the linkup point other elements may provide assets to support the decon operations such as medical engineer ad and mp these elements linkup with the chemical unit before the arrival of the contaminated unit see table 41 page 44 414 the supported unit is responsible for site security and overall control the deconplatoon leader is responsible for operating the predecon area and processing vehicles 415 after linkup is achieved and all support assets are in position the actual decon operation begins the deconplatoon leader with help from the commander of the contaminated unit or the supported units command and control cell supervises the decon operation all equipment not necessary for decon operations should be located in clear area to limit the spread of contaminationthorough decon 44fm 35mcwp 3373 table41 thoroughdecon support matrix 416 thoroughdecon site consists of the following areas predecon staging area ded and dtd areas and postdecon aa see figure 41 the chemical unit leader selects these areas based on operational guidance road network available cover and concealment and water supply the contaminated unit uses the predecon staging area to ready itself the postdecon aa is the location where the vehicles and soldiers exiting the ded and dtd areas are linked up before moving from the decon site predecon staging area 417 the contaminated unit moves to the predecon staging area about 274 to 547 yards downwind of the thoroughdecon site the contaminated unit per forms predecon actions to include segregating vehicles by checking for contami nation 418 for chemical contamination use the cam and the m8m9 detector paper the contamination level can be estimated by comparing the m8m9 detector paper to figure 42 when monitoring vehicles for contamination there should be about 33 to 49 feet between each vehicle to prevent false posi tive readings with the cam for

soldier dips his gear into the clean water and rinses it for 4 minutes then hands it to the attendant and proceeds to the next station the attendant takes the gear to the equipment checkpoint and places the decontaminated gear on the dirty side of the contamination control line and returns to the containers to pick up more gear the monitor at the checkpoint checks the gear using the appropriate detection device and the procedures associated with that device if the residual contamination exceeds negligible risks recycle the gear and decon it again see chapter 1 of this manual if the gear passes the check place it on the clean side of the contamination control line the attendant will carry the equipment to the reissue point 435 depending on the time available more extensive washing and checking procedures may be used the longer the gear is washed or left out in the air after washing the lower the contamination level the gear may be put in closed areas or plastic bags and checked for hazardous vapors with the m256a1 detector kit or the cam the cam only detects the gseries nerve agent vapors and the hseries blisteragent vapors risk 436 if this step is not done properly contamination may remain on the equipment the resulting vapor hazard could cause casualties to unmasked personnel particularly in closed areas vehicle interiors or heavily wooded areas where air

from the container ensure that water remains inside them step 2 submerge the gloves and overboots in their respective containers of stbhth solution thoroughly scrub the items until visible contamination remains after scrubbing submerge each item once more before moving to the rinse container step 3 thoroughly rinse the scrubbed items making sure that they are rinsed inside as well as out step 4 place usable items on poncho or plastic sheet to air dry and weather step 5 place usable items in plastic trash bags along with an m256a1 detector kit if the detector kit shows contamination remaining the attendants can recycle the items or discard them however if the kit show contamination the items can be reused risk 461 if the overboots are not properly removed the combat boots may become contaminated and contamination may be spread to clean areas if the gloves are not properly removed the undergarments and skin may become contaminatedthorough decon 415fm35mcwp3373 station 5 monitor 462 at this station contamination on personnel is identified spotdecon capabilities are provided and medical aid is provided as required preparation 463 at this station the following equipment and supplies are needed first aid supplies 1 cam 1 anvdr2 for radiological contamination 5 books of m8 detector paper per 100 soldiers 1 case of sdks 464 an aidman should be present to treat any soldiers suffering from chemicalagent symptoms if an aidman is unavailable combat lifesaver should be present execution 465 the attendant checks the soldiers for contamination using the cam liquid agents can be detected with m8 detector paper small quantities of agent vapor can be detected with the cam symptoms of agent poisoning are the most obvious indication of skin contamination at this station the med ic checks each soldier for symptoms of agent poisoning and treats as required soldiers should report any damage to their mopp gear that was identified at stations 2 3 and 4 the attendant can decon any areas identified as contaminated with an sdk soldiers are remonitored after decon it is possible that all liquidchemical contamination is absorbed into the clothing if so m8m9 detector paper will indicate negative even though there is hazard risk 466 if this station is omitted the soldier could become casualty after this station the soldier is not checked for contamination or decontamined again commanders can choose to conduct more extensive contamination checks here if medical assistance and time are available this decreases the risk of casualties station 6 mask removal 467 at this station the mask is removed without contaminating the soldier the mask is taken to mask decon point limiting agent transfer at the station preparation 468 at this station the m8a1 or m22 automatic chemicalagent alarm acaa and engineer tape are needed two soldiers are needed to operate this station they remove and carry the masks to station 7 execution 469 if the hood is still attached to the mask the attendant pulls the hood over the front of the mask grabs the mask by the voicemitter cover and pulls the mask off the soldier the soldier holds his breath as the mask is removed if the mask has optical inserts the attendant holds the mask open so that thethorough decon 416fm 35mcwp 3373 soldier can remove the inserts without touching the outside of the mask the soldier walks upwind 16 feet crosses the vaporcontamination control line and then resumes breathing the attendant brings the mask to station 7 470 if the wind direction remains constant chemical vapor hazard is expected beyond the vaporcontamination control line position the m8a1 or the m22 acaa upwind of the station to warn of vapor hazards the soldier getting decontaminated moves straight ahead while his mask which may still give off vapors is held on the vapor dirty side of the line and taken to station 7 where it is decontaminated risk 471 if the step is not done properly the soldier could breathe toxic vapors there is high probability that the vapor hazard is still present on the mask and the hood the soldier must not touch the outside of the mask because it could contaminate his bare hands the soldier proceeds to station 8 station 7 mask decon point 472 at this station all the contamination is removed from the mask note once 20 items have been processed in the wash containers replace the water once 10 item have been processed in the rinse water replace it place the contaminated waste into the sump preparation 473 at this station the following materials and equipment are

the masks are not contaminated the attendant takes the masks to the reissue point the attendant must take care not to contaminate the reissue point or himself risk 476 if this step is not done properly the soldiers may become contaminated when the masks are reissued to them at the reissue point even though the step is done correctly there is still possible danger when many masks are stacked together small amounts of residual vapor from each mask can become potentially dangerous note runners between stations 7 and 8 are in mopp2 and are prepared to go into mopp4 station 8 reissue point

procedures 482 chemical units operational control continues to receive support from its parent organization the supported unit provides the chemical unit with replacements supplies and material at the end of the ded this shortens the time the chemical unit is nonmission capable following the ded the supported unit must coordinate for the supplies and equipment necessary to operate the dtdthorough decon 418fm 35mcwp 3373 483 typical nonchemical units do not have more than two cams per companysized unit however the dtd requires minimum of three cams the supported hq may need to provide

supply units that operate the class ii points issue the protective masks and overgarments they normally package protective clothing as complete sets of mopp equipment to support predetermined number of soldiers decon supplies may be issued in preconfigured push packages detailed equipment decon 484 chemical units decon and smokedecon platoons are responsible for setting up operating and closing the ded portion of the thoroughdecon operation the ded for chemical and biological contamination is comprised of five stations for radiological contamination the ded uses all but station 2 stations are normally 98 to 164 feet apart however spacing is metttc dependent decon stations 485 the actions that are taken at each of the stations are as follows station 1 primary wash 486 at this station the gross contamination and dirt are removed from the vehicle the vehicle is sprayed for 2 to 3 minutes with hot soapy water the vehicle is then scrubbed to help remove cakedon dirt the mechanical action of scrubbing also helps remove thickened chemical agents although the undersurfaces are difficult to reach try to remove as much dirt as possible after scrubbing the vehicle spray it again for 2 to 3 minutes to remove loosened dirt and contamination this station uses about 250 gallons of water per vehicle larger vehicles with large quantities of dirt use more water the runoff from this station is contaminated and must be treated as hazardous the contaminated runoff must be controlled if available engineer support may be used this station requires high waterpressure systems m12a1 powerdriven decon apparatus pdda and m17 lightweight decontaminating system lds rather than low watervolume systems 65 gpm pumps note thirtyfive cubic feet of space per 250 gallons of liquid runoff should be used when calculating the size for the drainage pump 487 the effectiveness of the wash depends on the type of wash hot soapy water hot water cold water or steam the relative effectiveness rankings for selected surfaces are listed in table 43 page 420 hot soapy water is water heated to about 120oto 140of to which detergent has been added to reduce its surface tension the detergent removes the agent by emulsification which is followed by the mechanical displacement of the suspension hot water alone is less effective than hot soapy water because of the high temperature somethorough decon 419fm35mcwp3373 agents are best removed by steam through vaporization finally for some chemical agents cold water exhibits better solvent characteristics station 2 ds2 application 488 at this station decontaminant is applied to the entire vehicle the vehicle is divided into four parts and member of the scrubbing team is assigned that part of the vehicle this limits the workload of each member of the scrubbing team and avoids duplication of work ds2 is applied starting at the top of the vehicle and working towards the undercarriage every effort is made to apply ds2 to the undercarriage especially if the vehicle has crossed contaminated area the mop is the least tiring method of applying ds2 using mop to apply ds2 creates large amount of spillage however continual use of the m13 decontaminating apparatus portable dap requires the scrubbing team to exert more energy than with using the mop the m13 dap can be used to apply ds2 to hardtoreach areas planning factors for ds2 application are provided at table 44 page 420 489 before starting the decon operation the scrubbing team pours 5gallon cans of ds2 into 30gallon containers if mops are going to be used instead of m13 daps each member of the scrubbing team wears tap apron or wet weather gear to protect himself from the ds2 490 water adversely affects the ds2s ability to react with chemical agents if there is excess water remaining on the vehicle from station 1 the scrubbing team can wait for the majority of the water to evaporate remove the excess water increase the amount of ds2 applied 491 there must be sufficient ds2 on the item being decontaminated for complete neutralization to occur the ds2toagent ratio needs to be 55 to 1 for h agents and 25 to 1 for g agents for vehicle the size of an m1a1 tank this corresponds to 15 and 7 gallons respectively station 3 contact timeinterior decon 492 at this station the ds2 is allowed to completely neutralize the chemical agent and the interior of the vehicle is decontaminated vehicles are moved to concealed position vehicles will remain in station 3 for less than 30 minutes ds2 reacts with most chemical agents within 5 minutes however by allowing the ds2 to remain on the contaminated surface for 30 minutes the amount of agent that will later desorb off gas will be significantly reduced when there is 30minute contact time there will be desorption after decon operations for most chemical agents however studies indicate that distilledmustard hd vapors desorb after decon even if ds2 is allowed to remain for 30 minutes 493 while the vehicle is held at this station for the ds2 to completely react the driver inspects the interior of the vehicle for liquid contamination he is given m8 detector paper to check for chemical contamination if he identifies chemical contamination he is given decon supplies to decon the interior of the vehicle the best decon solution for use in the interior of vehicles is 5 perc ent solution

significant contamination is found on the vehicle the vehicle will be recycled to station 2 for chemical contamination or station 1 for radiological contamination an assistant driver takes the vehicle to the aa 498 chemical the cam is used to check for the presence of vapor from residual liquid contamination one bar or lower reading on the cam indicates negligible contamination level once the cam indicates the presence of vapor contamination m8 detector paper is used to verify the presence of liquid contamination if it is suspected that both the cam and m8 detector paper are producing false

usually more favorable for their employment at that time consequently nbc contamination encountered at night may require decon before daylight 4120 conducting decon operations at night is challenge white light cannot be used without possibly revealing your location however decon personnel must have illumination to perform such essential decon tasks as spraying water applying decontaminants using detection equipment and taking off the mopp gear 4121 use m8m9 detector paper to check for chemical contamination and to see how well the chemical decon was performed if contamination is present the paper color changes to red and cannot be seen if redfiltered light is used the cam and m256a1 detector kit can be used to identify and detect chemical agents but will require light source in order to

personnel to increase their stay time in an area and facilitates their passage through an area largescale terrain decon requires extensive amounts of equipment material and time thus terrain decon is limited to areas of critical importance contaminated areas and structures that can be avoided do not need to be decontaminated except by weathering if they must be used decon may be necessary when decon is not practical use protection to deal with the hazard most terrain and structural surfaces excluding unpainted metal and glass absorb the agent therefore the agent may be transferred to clothing by physical contact the agent may also be transferred through vaporization and subsequent inhalation or diffusion into the eyes and the clothing the decon of equipment containing vulnerable components presents certain challenges electronics and optics are especially vulnerable to damage if not carefully decontaminated some materials such as canvas absorb chemical agents and may not be decontaminated and reused terrain decon 51 terrain decon provides more longterm rather than shortterm benefits generally you cannot decon occupied terrain well enough to allow you to reduce your mopp level right away at best all you can do is speed up the weathering process this may allow you to reduce your mopp level little sooner for example in 2 days instead of 4 or 5 terrain decon can be so expensive and so ineffective that you should consider relocating 52 if you decide on terrain decon limit the amount you do build causeway or breach path through the contamination for entryexit into major facility restrict your efforts to areas where you must work or move matter what you do you will probably have to remain in mopp but you can reduce the danger of picking up liquid contamination and spreading it to other areas 53 the most effective techniques for terrain decon are the natural methods weathering or aging using standard decontaminants will quickly exhaust your resources see appendix b usually the most practical method is to scrap off contaminated surfaces fire is terraindecon method however consideration must be given to the potential downwind vapor hazard if possible contaminated area should be evacuated until time and weather remove the hazard an stb slurry can be used for vital areas to determine the persistency of chemicals at various temperatures refer to fm 39 54 terrain decon may be accomplished using several methods these methods are listed in the order of decreasing effectiveness although they52 special deconoperationsfm 35mcwp 3373 reduce the contact hazard none will prevent hazardous vapors desorbing from contaminated surfaces therefore appropriate protective measures must still be taken weathering 55 weathering is the simplest and easiest form of decon chemical and biological contamination 56 warm windy weather can significantly reduce terrain contamination in some cases this occurs in few hours or it may take few days many variables affect the persistency of chemical and biological hazards so it is impossible to accurately predict how long it takes such contamination to weather sunlight is especially effective against most biological agents radiological contamination 57 although the term weathering is used to describe the decon process weather has little effect on radiological hazards heavy rain and wind may remove some contamination but only time will reduce the radiation emanating from the contamination removingcovering 58 removing or covering contamination does not destroy it but it does keep the hazards away from you temporarily chemical and biological contamination 59 contamination can be removed from paths and unpaved roadways by scraping off layer of earth using heavy earthmoving equipment bulldozers and road graders contaminated paths and paved surfaces can be covered with 4inch layer of earth roofing paper plastic sheets and wood mats this is temporary measure because the agents may penetrate the covering when the contamination penetrates the covering or when the covering is removed the hazards will reappear the coverings may also extend the life of the contamination hazard by reducing its exposure to air and sunlight radiological contamination 510 radiological contamination must be covered by thick layers of dense material like earth three inches of earth will decrease radiation dose rates by half because of the shielding provided by the soil however 12 inches is more effective the job will be easier with earthmoving equipment but the equipment and operators probably will have to undergo decon neutralizing 511 the stb dry mix or stb slurry may be used effectively against chemical or biological contamination but not against radiological contamination trained chemical troops and equipment are required when using the stb slurry which is costly both in time and material chemical and biological contamination 512 the stb dry mix is spread on solid surfaces and raked into soft surfaces like sand or earthspecial decon operations 53fm35mcwp3373 513 the stb slurry is applied to terrain by using spray hose that is attached to an m12a1 decon apparatus operators wear tap aprons over their mopp gear and sit on the front fenders of vehicle to spray the stb slurry the speed of the vehicle should be adjusted according to the terrain this is normally 2 to 4 miles per hour the operators spray fan pattern 3 to 5 feet ahead of the vehicle the pattern overlaps on the center and extends past both sides of the vehicle the stb slurry forms seal over the surface and must be renewed periodically due to deterioration from traffic or weathering one load of stb slurry will decon concrete surface about 328 feet long by 33 feet wide other surfaces may require more decontaminants it takes about an hour to load and mix one load of sbt slurry radiological contamination 514 the stb dry mix and stb slurry have effect on radiological contamination or its hazards burning 515 burning works well against chemically or biologically contaminated vegetation but it is of value against radiological contamination chemical and biological contamination 516 fuel may be used to burn grass or short undergrowth burning also works on dirt surfaces soak the area with diesel fuel kerosene or fuel oil and ignite remotely do not use gasoline it burns too quickly burning will cause vapor hazards downwind and protective measures will have to be used by downwind units area commanders must warn these units of the vapor hazards radiological contamination 517 radiologically contaminated surfaces should not be burned burning will not destroy radiological contamination or its hazards it may spread contamination if radioactive particles become suspended in smoke spread by the wind exploding 518 explosives can be used to blow up areas that are chemically and biologically contaminated however they are of value against radiological contamination chemical and biological contamination 519 detonating cord bangalore torpedoes or mineclearing line charges may be used with the stb dry mix to clear small paths through contaminated area the two methods that are used follow first method remove the holding band and loosen the lid of the bleach drum set the drum with the lid in place upside down over about 3 feet of looped detonation cord remove the drum and leave the bleach piled on the lid as shown in figure 51 page 54 lids may be fired in series with single strand of detonation cord connecting the loops54 special deconoperationsfm 35mcwp 3373 second method remove the holding band and loosen the lid of the bleach drum set the drum in shallow hole as shown in figure 51 b make sure the lid is loose use 5 feet of looped detonating cord 7 feet in soft ground for each drum the drums may be fired individually or in series for gross contamination additional firings may be necessary 520 for either emplacement method the suggested spacing for charges is 33 feet apart for 100footfront contaminated area the charges should be placed along the upwind edge of the contaminated area see figure 51 c figure 51 two methods ofemplacing dry stb for distribution by detonation radiological contamination 521 explosives will not destroy radiological contamination or its hazards flushing 522 flushing with large quantities of water removes contamination pressurized stream of hot soapy water delivered by the pdda m17 lds or fire trucks can remove significant amounts of an agent scrubbing removes even more chemical and biological contamination 523 flushing is not very effective against some kinds of agents especially thickened agents however flushing may speed up the weathering process stb lid detonating

loose radioactive contamination such as fallout rain out however can coat surfaces with film that resists flushing such films must be scrubbed any contamination removed by flushing and scrubbing will remain radioactive so control the runoff clearing 525 to clear passageways remove the contaminated layers covering the terrain chemical and biological contamination 526 most liquid chemical agents will not penetrate the soil more than 2 inches and biological agents penetrate even less earthmoving equipment or hand tools can be used to scrap aside contamination by scraping off 2 to 4 inches of earth passageway can be created that is free of transfer hazards however contamination on either side of the passageway will continue to present vapor hazard radiological contamination 527 fallout does not penetrate the top layer of soil unless it is followed by rain it can be scraped aside move contaminated soil as far away as possible the piles tend to concentrate radiation immediately below nuclear blast area the soil may be radioactive to depth of 5 feet in most cases decon of this much earth is not practical fixedsite decon 528 personnel and equipment need to be decontaminated to reduce the hazard and the spread of contamination limit casualties and minimize operational degradation the goal is to restore the unit to an acceptable level of operational effectiveness the inability of fixed site to move away from contamination makes decon more critical decon is necessary when protective items cannot be worn in performing the mission or when longterm occupancy is anticipated 529 decon capabilities may be designed and built into facility and used if the facility becomes contaminated mobile decon equipment may also be available at fixed site to decon equipment roads and buildings interior decon may be accomplished with large commercial heaters loading docks entries and exits and building exteriors can be decontaminated with more conventional methods such as using an stb dry mix or stb slurry soap and water or an m13 dap commanders should identify all systems that are capable of contributing to the decon effort for example fire trucks steam cleaners and water pumps 530 decon equipment can be retrofitted to accommodate the process in each area for instance rest and relief shelters need rapid personnel decon systems and supply operations need decon system that can handle moderate size pieces of equipment but at high volume light maintenance needs system that can decon equipment sensitive to harsh decontaminants or water and heavy maintenance needs system that can clean large equipment56 special deconoperationsfm 35mcwp 3373 531 the commander should designate and train teams that can perform decon for fixedsite operations the following are

down the outside portions of the equipment case with designated decontaminant after decontaminating the outside wipe down the equipment with either water or an approved solvent to remove traces of the decon solution if equipment seals appear damaged or if penetration of nbc contamination into the inside of the equipment is suspected then the unit should be treated as if it was nonsealed under circumstances should electronic equipment be immersed in decon solution or subjected to highpressure application of decon solutions 537 for chemical contamination wipe all metal electronic cases with ds2 if chemical agent is identified as hd allow 30 minutes contact time next wipe the case down thoroughly with damp cloth dry it off and wipe it down with designated oil for biological agents wait 10 minutes if ds2 is not available or the case is of some material other than metal wipe the equipments exterior with cloth and hot soapy water or use nonstandard decontaminant see appendix b if contamination is not extensive use an iedk 538 corrosive decontaminants such as ds2 should never be used on nonsealed electronic equipment this type of equipment is often found inside shelter

decon contaminated ammunition with cool soapy water apply the soapy water with the pdda or with brushes mops rags or brooms cool soapy water is the preferred decontaminant for all types of contamination canvas items 544 these items include loadcarrying equipment and web gear it may be necessary to burn or bury them if they are heavily contaminated either an stb dry mix or an stb slurry may be used to decon them the stb slurry is more effective in many cases weathering may be the preferred decon technique because scrubbing canvas frequently imbeds the contamination further and worsens the situation if the item must be decontaminated boil it for 1 hour in soapy water this is the preferred method for chemical and biological decon radiological contamination can be removed by brushing it off then washing it may also be vacuumed off surface 545 salvage of contaminated canvas requires great amount of logistic and manpower requirements other options for disposing of

cesium is cesium137 it emits beta and gamma radiation decaying to stable barium137 cesium137 is widely used in gamma sources it occurs in these sources as cesiumchloride pellets cesium chloride is soluble salt the contamination from sealedsource leak absorbs water becomes damp and creeps contamination from sealed cesium source is best decontaminated by wet procedures unless the contamination is on porous surface in which case wet procedures should be preceded by vacuuming cesium is known to adsorb from solution onto glass surfaces decontaminating cesium liquidcontaminated surface is bestspecialdecon operations 513fm35mcwp3373 accomplished by wetting the surface absorbing the solution with rag or other absorbent material and rinsing the area several times with water if the contamination persists use detergent solution and scrub with brush cesiumcontaminated solution that has been standing for some time is best decontaminated by absorbing any remaining liquid treating the surface several times with water allowing the water to stand on the surface for about 1 minute each time and then absorbing the liquid from the surface if the contamination remains further treatment depends on the surface metallic surfaces are treated with strong mineral or oxidizing acids waxed surfaces are removed if contamination still persists abrasives or other removal techniques are used cobalt 569 the common radioisotope of cobalt is cobalt60 beta gamma emitter metallic cobalt60 is commonly used in sealed gamma sources particles of cobalt dust adhering to small articles are readily removed by ultrasonic cleaners or by dipping the article in dilute solution of nitric hydrochloric or sulfuric acid cobaltdust contamination that exists over large area is best removed by vacuuming sealed cobalt sources may leak as result of electrolytic action between the cobalt and the container the result is often soluble cobalt salt which creeps and spreads this is best decontaminated with detergent or an ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta solution followed by treatment with mineral acids contamination from solutions containing cobalt may be treated with water plutonium 570 the most common isotope in which plutonium may be present as contaminant is plutonium239 an alpha emitter this isotope is present in the anudm6 calibration source plutonium contamination may be the result of nuclear weapons accident in which case the plutonium will be scattered as metal or oxide in dust form both forms of plutonium are insoluble aging of plutonium239 contamination is impractical since it has 24000year half life plutonium contamination that covers small area is best decontaminated by vacuuming if contamination remains the area should be washed with detergent solution any contamination that remains can be sealed in protective coating of paint varnish or plastic plutonium oxide or metal dust spread over large area such as field is best decontaminated by removing the top layer of soil and disposing of it as radioactive waste personnel should wear respiratory protection when decontaminating or moving the soil strontium 571 the most common radioisotope of strontium is strontium90 beta emitter the daughter particle of strontium90 is yttrium90 which is also beta emitter strontium90yttrium90 is commonly used in sealed beta sources such as the m6 source generally it is present as chlorine or carbonate the chlorine is hygroscopic it absorbs water and creeps out of the container this contamination is best decontaminated by vacuuming followed by treatment with water complexingagent solution and mineral acid in that order contamination resulting from dilution containing strontium is best decontaminated by absorbing the solution and washing the area with detergent solution if strontium contamination persists the top layer of the514 specialdeconoperationsfm 35mcwp 3373 surface should be removed by abrasives or other removal procedures and sealing coat should be placed over the surface tritium 572 tritium is the radioisotope of hydrogen and is weak beta emitter if it is released to an area as gas the best decon method is to flush the area with air since inhalation of tritium can present an internal hazard personnel entering an area containing tritium gas should wear an appropriate self contained type of breathing apparatus objects in an area exposed to tritium for length of time may absorb the gas and should be disposed of if possible they may be degassed under vacuum by flushing with helium or hydrogen surface which monitors clean may become contaminated again in matter of hours by percolation there is practical way of removing tritium oxide t20 from water due to its similarity to natural water uranium 573 the most probable source of uranium contamination is nuclear weapon accident in which the fissionable uranium is spread as metal or oxide dust the common isotopes of uranium contamination are uranium235 and

present significant problem in solid state they become hazards when they warm up decon is problem because low temperatures also reduce the effect of decontaminants 62 the freezing points of decontaminants are as follows water 32of stb slurry with antiset 0of ds2 25of skd 50of iedk 50of decontaminants 63 when temperatures reach 32of water can longer be used as decon in such situations use ds2 ds2 is effective down to 25of for temperatures below 25of use stb or hth as dry mix two parts of stb to three parts of earth or snow for decon apply the dry mix by shoveling it on contaminated surfaces or by filling sandbags with the mix and dusting it on the surfaces remove the dry mix by brushing scraping or using uncontaminated earth or snow to wash it off other decontaminating methods using nonstandard solvents and fuels may be used but observe fire safety protect personnel from corrosives and take precautions against supercooling effects because of62 effectsof environmental conditionsfm 35mcwp 3373 their low freezing points solvents such as aviation fuel jp8 diesel fuel and kerosene may be used to physically remove contamination these solvents only flush the agent from the surfaces they generally do not neutralize agents nor do they eliminate agents that soak into surfaces nonstandard solvents generally are very flammable and must be handled with care see appendix b

nitrogen cylinders m13 decon apparatus 66 this apparatus is designed to dispense ds2 at temperatures as low as 15of as the temperature drops the flow of decontaminants through the hose and wand becomes degraded m17 lightweight decon system and m12a1 decon apparatus 67 both apparatuses have problems in the cold similar to any other water pump normal engine coldsoaking problems that cause starting difficulties and brittle metal parts have been observed also internal pumps and lines will crack and break when water freezes within these systems to avoid freezeup problems use the shutdown procedures described in tms 34230 22810 and 3423020920p detection and warning devices 68 in the following paragraphs the different types of detection and warning devices are discussed m8m9 detector paper 69 m8m9 detector paper is limited in the cold because only agents in liquid form can be detected if the substance is thickened or solidified collect sample with stick or scraper and wipe it onto sheet of m8m9 detector paper place the sample on heated surface such as an operating vehicle or power generator to thaw the suspected agent because of off gassing do not do this in heated vehicle or tent put box or can over the paper to concentrate any vapors put an m256a1 detector kit inside the box or can heat the suspected agent enough to enable detection and allow agent identification m256a1 detector kit 610 as temperatures drop toward 32of the m256a1 detector kit takes longer to give positive or negative indication when temperatures reach freezing carry the liquid components in the breast pockets of the chemical protective clothing it may also be necessary to put the test sampler back into the shipping bag after sampling and place it on heated surface to hasten the reaction the kit will not work at temperatures below 25of chemicalagent monitor 611 the cam will have difficulty in detecting agents at low temperatures contaminated personnel entering building or collective protection shelter will desorb agents as they warm up use the cam in vestibule or an air lock where the temperature has been raised to that of the buildings or shelters64 effectsof environmental conditionsfm 35mcwp 3373 interior likewise check aircraft and vehicles requiring maintenance as they pass through warmedup site before entry into hanger or maintenance bay m8a1 automatic chemicalagent alarm 612 when operating an m8a1 acaa at temperatures below 20of use the m253 winterization kit warmup time with this kit is 50 minutes equipmentdecon stations 613 place decon sites in builtup areas and near road junctions and intersections of forest lanes to facilitate access divide the decon sites and approach routes into sectors and assign units to keep them open in spite of mud or heavy snow with present technology equipment decon problems in the field are difficult to overcome in an arctic climate commanders should consider fighting dirty in arctic regions fresh units can be rotated into the field so that dirty units can be moved back to builtup areas to decon 614 decon apparatuses and water trucks may have to be deployed with empty tanks instead of full ones as in temperate climates to prevent freezing it may be necessary to preheat water when loading the water trucks and the tanks of the decon apparatuses and keep it heated until it is used these vehicles may have to be enclosed and warmed so that the engines will start decon apparatuses and water trucks must be drained immediately after use to prevent damage from freezing commanders may choose to conduct minimum decon until they can get back to fixed facilities and conduct more thorough decon 615 vehicles and personnel covered with contaminated snow must be decontaminated before the snow has chance to melt and freeze such snow forms layers of ice that make contamination difficult to remove radioactive fallout that is mixed with snowfall must be removed as soon as possible use tree branches if available to remove contaminated snow 616 snow can be used to cover contamination however the snow can blow away or the contamination can resurface when tracked vehicles troop movement or digging disturbs it snow cover provides some protection if left undisturbed but this protection is too uncertain to rely on warmed areas 617 preventing contamination from entering warmed areas is challenging problem for example if soldiers get frozen agents on their clothing it will be hard to detect because low temperatures have slowed its effects however if the temperature warms or if the soldiers enter warmed area the agents become dangerous because of this it may be necessary to set up warming station for each warmed area to isolate the agents otherwise all occupants may be subjected to hazardous liquids and vapors 618 additional soldiers and equipment are needed for these warming stations therefore in coldweather operations the decon and detection priority must be heated support facilities fm 34 discusses individual and collective protection in detaileffectsof environmental conditions 65fm35mcwp3373 urban areas 619 the need for decon operations in urban areas may also exist and it may be easier to support water sources are generally available and commercial chemicals may be used as decontaminants site security may be simplified because of limited observation and poor fields of fire decon operations in urban areas will not differ significantly from similar operations in the field however keep the following considerations in mind streets and structures 620 when buildings are contaminated with persistent chemicals their value for cover concealment and shelter is reduced wood and concrete tend to absorb liquid agents and they may give off toxic vapors for days or weeks building decon is very difficult and requires large quantities of decontaminants the hazard can be reduced by covering the contamination with plastic sheets stb slurry sodium silicate or other substances that cover or absorb the agent even though particular part of building is not intended for occupation it may still need to be decontaminated to prevent the contamination from spreading 621 streets and sidewalks also absorb liquid agents then give off toxic vapors when heated by the sun these surfaces may need to be decontaminated several times to reduce hazards streets sidewalks or other porous surfaces are best decontaminated by weathering if the time and the situation permit civilians 622 try to locate decon operations away from civilians because they may injure themselves or interfere with the work civilians must not be forced to prepare decon sites or to help with decon operations however volunteers who have been cleared by the assistant chief of staff g5 civil affairs g5 may be used supplies and ammunition 623 store ammunition as well as other supplies under cover to protect it from nbc contamination fm 34 explains contamination covers in detail sanitation systems 624 urban areas may have sophisticated sanitation systems when those systems are destroyed sanitary conditions become far worse than those in areas where sanitation systems have never existed sanitation systems must be maintained to avoid epidemics and to avoid overloading biologicaldecon capabilities contaminated water and residue must be controlled so that they will not create hazard to the civilian population or interfere with sanitation systems engineer support may be necessary to construct controlled runoff areas mountains 625 excluding the extremely high alpinetype mountains most mountain systems are characterized by heavy woods or jungle compartments and ridge systems limited routes and highly variable weather conditions all these factors will affect decon operations66 effectsof environmental conditionsfm 35mcwp 3373 mobility 626 the terrain and the disruption of existing routes may dictate that mountain operations be decentralized additional watercarrying vehicles may be needed to support these operations forces must be organized to be selfsufficient and should have decon elements attached to them initially decon platoons are attached to brigades and decon squads are attached to battalions when decon elements operate independently their parent chemical companies may not be able to provide support decon elements must be equipped with greater hauling capabilities especially for water administrative and logistical support to the decon element will have to come from the support unit wind 627 mountains have changing weather and constant winds that promote weathering at faster rate in high mountains calm winds in the ridges and passes are seldom whereas in protected valleys strong winds are rare normally wind velocity increases with altitude generally downwind contamination will be greater because high winds are more frequent however variable winds will make predictions unreliable temperature 628 cool or cold temperatures have an adverse effect on decon operations with every 328foot gain in elevation the temperature will normally drop 3o to 5of the drier the air the more pronounced this drop will be at high altitudes there may be differences of 40oto 50of between the temperature in the sun and that in the shade consequently the temperature rises swiftly after sunrise and drops quickly after sunset low temperatures that normally exist at extremely high altitudes may demand decon procedures and precautions similar to those used in coldweather operations daytime operations can be scheduled to avoid some lowtemperature problems sunlight 629 sunlight destroys most biological agents above the timberline there is little protection from the sun so the effectiveness of biological attack is reduced jungle 630 jungle climates vary with the location close to the equator all seasons are nearly alike with rains throughout the year farther from the equator especially in india and southeast asia jungles have distinct wet monsoon and dry seasons both zones have high temperatures averaging 78oto 98of heavy rainfall as much as 400 inches annually and high humidity 90 percent throughout the year 631 transportation is extremely difficult due to natural obstacles therefore decon operations will be decentralized as much as possible because of high humidity and temperatures mopp gear should not be worn for long periods since decon crews will be more susceptible to heat stress staffs should plan for frequent crew rotations and provide enough decon personnel to conduct decon operationseffectsof environmental conditions 67fm35mcwp3373 632 contamination will be retained temporarily in the jungle canopy reducing the immediate hazard later rains will wash these particles to the ground and concentrate them in low areas these areas are likely to become contamination hot spots decon sites should be put on high ground during the rainy season 633 tropical rainstorms will flood decon sites unless the sites are adequately drained ground that appears firm may become impassable when it rains rain and intense heat will speed the deterioration of many supplies do not break the seals on packing material until it is absolutely necessary 634 rain and high humidity wetness degrade the protective abilities of the overgarment take care to ensure the maximum length of time of the overgarments usefulness additional quantities of overgarments must be maintained to replace those that have gotten wet rain helps the decon process by washing away contamination on exposed surfaces rain can also hydrolyze some agents however runoff may contaminate the soil temperature and humidity 635 when temperatures rise to the 85oto 100of range troops can only continue medium or heavy workloads by reducing their mopp level more soldiers will be needed to make up for extra rest periods and more frequent rotation periods during decon operations 636 frequently oil exposed metal parts and grease wheel bearings to protect them from moisture since petroleum oils and lubricants pol tend to absorb chemical agents additional decon may be needed measures taken to protect electronic communications equipment from moisture will reduce the need for decon since these measures provide good nbc protection seal radios with silicone compound and pack them in waterproof containers when they are not in use remove batteries protect handsets and microphones with plastic bags and check the bags frequently for moisture buildup 637 the jungles high humidity and temperature increase the need for maintenance contact teams must operate independently as they move from site to site doing repairs there may be decon specialists to help them 638 biological agents thrive in the heat humidity and shade which are characteristics of the jungle therefore weathering is not practical means of biological decon 639 solid decontaminants such as stb powder tend to cake and decompose at faster rate than in temperate climates caking is problem but the decomposition eventually makes stb powder ineffective time 640 many tasks in the jungle take more time than in other environments more time for movement and security must be allowed which may leave less time for planning and preparation in the jungle more decon personnel will be required to perform decon operations68 effectsof environmental conditionsfm 35mcwp 3373 security 641 decon stations are lucrative targets therefore security must be prime consideration relocating decon site may require small security force thus additional personnel will be required resupply 642 because of the terrain aerial resupply usually will be common practice keep this in mind when determining the amounts of decontaminants to keep on hand since they will compete with ammunition pol medical supplies food and water for priority of delivery persistency 643 sunlight and wind are reduced within thick jungles due to the vegetation as result chemical and biological agents are less likely to disperse and will remain hazard for an extended time desert 644 desert regions are characterized by extreme temperatures with ranges varying between 30oto 130of over 24hour period these regions have long drought periods which are interrupted by sudden rains that bring flash floods there are shortages of suitable groundwater large areas suitable for trackedvehicle maneuvers may sometime have impassable ravines wet spongy grounds and sand areas water 645 the principal problem for decon in the desert is the lack of water the use of stb slurry and ds2 will burden the logistical system because of the water required for mixing and rinsing nonwaterbased decontaminants natural solvents may be required see appendix b of this manual contamination avoidance becomes increasingly important in desert operations because of limited water sources therefore maximum use should be made of fieldexpedient covers especially at night when an attack by chemical or biological agents is most likely heat stress 646 heat stress is critical problem for soldiers working in the desert environment in full mopp operating decon stations in daytime temperatures may require short periods of work followed by long periods of rest performing operations at night to avoid heat stress may create light discipline problems weathering 647 weathering is viable decon option high daytime temperatures can increase evaporation of liquid contamination as result vapor concentrations will be high but may not last long refer to fm 34 for mopp openingunmasking guidance to estimate the chemical hazards resulting from enemy attacks if liquid contamination soaks into soft porous soil such as loose sand evaporation is not as quick strong winds also increase the evaporation rate low temperatures during the night have reverse effect and tend to increase the persistency of chemical and biological contamination the sandblasting effect of sandstorms may remove contamination fromeffectsof environmental conditions 69fm35mcwp3373 surfaces facing the storm desert sunlight and high temperatures will destroy many chemical and biological agents without additional decon measures bearings and other critical moving parts 648 bearings and other critical moving parts need extra lubrication in the desert this complicates decon because lubricants tend to absorb chemical agents after sandstorm maintenance must be conducted regardless of the last scheduled maintenance therefore perform decon first and if time is critical decon only those surfaces that will be touched during maintenance this will not eliminate vapor hazardsaviation 71chapter7 aviation contamination in the battle space causes unique problem for aviation since an aircraft uses its high mobility to maneuver across the entire battle space avoiding contamination can be very difficult once an aircraft is contaminated it is very difficult to decon therefore aviation units need to prepare effective standing operating procedures sops that emphasize contamination avoidance protection and methods to decon each type of aircraft using an immediate an operational and thorough decon contamination avoidance 71 contamination avoidance is critical due to the difficulty in decon aircrews must be aware of nbc hazards for instance an aircraft that hovers or lands in contaminated area could splash contamination onto itself likewise contaminated passengers or ground crews pose danger of transferring contaminants into the aircraft where they are difficult to remove aircraft could also possibly pick up some contamination by flying through an invisible vapor cloud hazards that will only incapacitate ground personnel for short time can be fatal in the air 72 some things that can be done to limit contamination are as follows know what areas are contaminated and avoid these if possible pick landing zones that will have reduced splash effect if an aircraft must land in contaminated area limit the spread of contamination into the aircraft from the outside for example ground crews at the forward arming and refueling point farp could conduct arming and refueling without requiring the aircrew to exit the aircraft conduct inspections without touching or shaking items the contaminated crews should perform this task many inspection points can be inspected visually increase the use of covers when not flying use engine covers flyaway gear and hatches if possible provide overhead cover for parked aircraft limit the number of aircraft that must operate in contaminated area or use aircraft already contaminated line the troop compartment with plastic field expedient way to limit the spread of contamination when carrying contaminated personnel or casualties plastic curtain can be fastened between the troop compartment and the flight compartment with tape or velcro to limit contamination transfer the aircrafts heater can be used with72 aviationfm 35mcwp 3373 the curtain to create an overpressure in the pilots compartment this will limit vapors from entering the compartment apply m9 detector paper to the landing gear of the aircraft farp personnel should always check the m9 detector paper before servicing the aircraft another piece of m9 detector paper can be placed on the windscreen where the aircrew can see it decontaminants 73 only approved cleaning compounds may be used to decon aircraft caustic decontaminants such as ds2 stb bleaches and sodium hypochlorite are not considered safe stb corrodes metal components and the aircrafts skin and ds2 corrodes rubber plastic and acrylicplastic windows 74 soap and water kerosene jp8 and diesel fuels are approved as decontaminants on selected parts of the aircraft jp8 is effective in removing some agents from the aircrafts skin and components however it does not neutralize the agents personnel must use care when handling jp8 when using cloth soaked in jp8 personnel must avoid wiping internal components near the exhaust if water is available use it to rinse off the jp8 many portions of the aircraft are delicate and cannot stand highpressure water or extreme hot air 75 sodium carbonate is fair decontaminant against g nerve agents but it is not effective against v nerve and blister agents the chemical reaction of the v nerve agent and sodium carbonate is extremely slow and produces product that is very toxic most of the fieldexpedient decontaminants are corrosive and could cause damage to the aircrafts skin or acrylicplastic windows aircraft decon 76 when an aircraft becomes contaminated the aircrew must fly in mopp gear however wearing mopp gear degrades the aircrews ability to perform its jobs over time 77 if air and ground crews are careful when operating in contaminated environment contamination can be contained on the exterior of the aircraft the increased airflow over the aircrafts skin increases the rate of evaporation still some agents will remain and continue to be hazard thickened agents evaporate more slowly and may remain hazard even after prolonged flights if the interior is contaminated flying the aircraft with the doors open can help reduce the hazard the heat from the running engine decontaminates the interior of the engine compartment however more active methods of decon may be needed use the immediate operational or thoroughdecon method with modifications to perform an aircrew spot decon an aircraft washdown and the dadcaution m9 detector paper will show falsepositives if exposedto petroleum productsaviation 73fm35mcwp3373 decon types 78 table 71 shows the types of aircraft decon the crew of contaminated aircraft will use the techniques described in previous chapters to decon unit personnel conduct the aircrew spot decon and aircraft washdown but chemical decon unit usually conducts the dad aircrew spot decon 79 after personal wipe down aviators may conduct spot decon on their aircraft see table 71 the aircrew spot decon provides the same benefits as the operators spray down it limits the transfer and spread of contamination by decontaminating the surfaces that must be touched during operations spot decon applies to the first six functional activities the goal is to limit the transfer and spread of contamination while sustaining flight operations table71 aircraft decon types 710 air or ground crews may perform the aircrew spot decon wash exterior surfaces with decontaminants to flush off contamination fuel soap and water are most commonly used exact procedures and areas to decon are identified in the aircrafts maintenance manual see table 72 pages 74 through 76 for guidance on the aircrew spot decon aircraft washdown 711 an aircraft washdown site consists of single station with other decon sites there may be several stations before arriving at the site the aircrew should fly its aircraft at high speeds to help evaporate exterior contamination if the aircrafts interior has been contaminated open the doors however before arriving at the washdown site close the doors at the washdown site the aircraft will land and reduce its speed to an idle if the aircrew is contaminated

selecting the site to ensure that it has suitable landing zone for the type of aircraft contaminated 713 an aircraft washdown is important when operating an aircraft contaminated by gross amounts of

effective if conducted within 1 hour some amounts of chemical contamination may remain after the aircraft washdown the aircrew should continue to wear as minimum its protective masks and rubber gloves for protection until deliberate decon can be conducted 715 presently there is timely detection method to check the effectiveness of decon for biological contamination medical personnel will monitor the aircrews disposition if biological contamination is suspected detailed aircraft decon 716 the goal of dad is to reduce contamination hazards to negligible risk level so that air and ground crews can operate the aircraft without protective measures the dtd can be conducted at the same time the decon site shou ld be set up in similar fashion to the thoroughdecon site see chapter 4 the decon site consists of the following areas predecon staging area dad and dtd areas and postdecon aa for safety reasons it is not possible to decon aircraft and ground vehicles at the same site separate ded site can be established in the vicinity to support the contaminated aviation units ground vehicles 717 aviation units must be supported by chemical unit to set up and operate the dad site the chemical unit assisted by the supported aviation unit operates the dad site while the aviation unit sets up and operates the dtd see chapter 4 for dtd operations 718 typically dad is either performed as part of reconstitution effort or before maintenance operations after every 25 hours of flight time when the aircraft is either overhauled or grounded for scheduled maintenance contamination hazards should be reduced to negligible risk levels by going through dad when components are removed from the aircraft for repair care must be taken because of residual contamination decon these components either

heat damage and downwind vapor hazards hotair decon for helicopter or light aircraft requires about 30 to 120 minutes to remove all of the contamination times are based on the amount of contamination

pressurized containers such as fire extinguishers must be removed before starting hot air decon these items will fail catastrophically and could cause severe damage the heat will also damage sensitive

contamination remaining detection procedures vary depending on the type of contamination if significant contamination is found on the aircraft it will be recycled to station 2 for chemical contamination or station 1 for radiological contamination 731 chemical use the cam to check for the presence of vapors one bar or lower reading on the cam indicates negligible risk if the cam indicates the presence of vapors use m8 detector paper to check for liquid contamination if it is suspected that these are producing false positive use an m256a1 detector kit to confirm or deny the presence of contamination if the aircraft has significant contamination remaining recycle it desorption of chemical agents may occur after the decon on carcpainted surfaces the desorption of vapors

contamination is detected at station 5 the recycle criteria is used to determine which aircraft are returned to station 2 or if radiologically contaminated station 1 if the unit has sufficient time and resources available any aircraft having more contamination than negligible risk should be recycled however time and resources are usually limited and not all aircraft can be recycled aircraft deconsite selection 734 operational and thoroughdecon sites for aircraft must be selected with care the decon area must be big enough for the required number of aircraft have readily available water source and allow for adequate drainage the site should be relatively secure however it should be close enough to the aos and farp to allow for reasonably quick turnaround of aircraft the site must not

could result in heat casualties and mission failurepatient evacuationanddecon 81chapter8 patient evacuation and decon evacuating patients under nbc conditions forces the unit commander to consider to what extent he will commit evacuation assets to enter the contaminated area generally if most or all of supported force is operating in contaminated area most or all of the medicalevacuation assets will operate there also if it is possible to keep some ambulances free from contamination every effort should be made to do so evacuation considerations 81 on the modern battle space there are three basic modes of evacuating patients personnel ground vehicles and aircraft personnel who physically carry the patients incur great deal of inherent stress cumbersome mopp gear climate increased workloads and fatigue will greatly reduce the effectiveness of unit personnel 82 if evacuation personnel are to be sent into an area that is contaminated with radiation an oeg must be established radiationexposure records must be maintained by the supported unit chemical nco and made available to the commander staff and medical leader based on the oeg the commander or medical leader decides which evacuation elements to send into the contaminated environment every effort is made to limit the number of evacuation assets that are contaminated however number of these assets will become contaminated in the course of battle therefore optimize the use of resources medical and nonmedical which are already contaminated before employing uncontaminated resources 83 once vehicle has entered contaminated area it is highly unlikely that it can be spared long enough to undergo complete decon this will depend on the contaminant the tempo of the battle and the resources available for casualty evacuation normally contaminated vehicles air and ground will be confined to dirty environments 84 ground ambulances should be used instead of air ambulances in contaminated areas they are more plentiful are easier to decon and can be replaced more easily however this does not preclude the use of aircraft if required 85 the patients medical condition and the relative positions of the contaminated area the forward line of troops flot and the threats air defense systems determine if and where air ambulances may be used in the evacuation process one or more air ambulances may be restricted to the contaminated areas to the greatest extent possible use ground vehicles to cross the line separating the contaminated and clean areas82 patient evacuation and deconfm 35mcwp 3373 86 after the patients are loaded the medicalevacuation vehicles proceed to medicaltreatment facility mtf with patientdecon station for the setup of patientdecon station see fm 8107 the patients are decontaminated and treated at this station if further evacuation is required transfer the patients to clean ground or air ambulance the routes that the ground vehicles use to cross between contaminated and clean areas should be considered dirty routes and should not be crossed by clean vehicles the effects of the wind and time on the contaminants must be considered 87 the rotor wash of the helicopters must always be kept in mind when evacuating patients the intense winds will disturb the contaminants increasing vapor hazards 88 the helicopter should be allowed to land and reduce to flat pitch before the patients are brought near additionally the helicopter must not land too close to decon station because any trace of contaminants in the rotor wash may be spread into the clean treatment area 89 evacuating patients must continue even under nbc conditions the medical leader must recognize the constraints that nbc operations place on him and he must plan and train to overcome these constraints patient decon 810 patient decon presents special problems for units and combathealth support chs personnel under nbc conditions contaminated wounded soldiers create increased hazards to rescuers and chs personnel in the following paragraph decon procedures at unit level are discussed 811 on the nbc battle space two classifications of patients will be encountered contaminated and uncontaminated those contaminated may suffer from the effects of an nbc agent conventional wound or both for more information on the treatment of nbc patients see fm 89 some may suffer battle fatigue or heat injuries induced by the stress of nbc conditions and the extended time spent in mopp4 it is important to follow proper decon procedures to limit the spread of contamination the most important decon is performed at the contamination site later decon may be too late to prevent injury all agents should be promptly removed from the skin 812 patient decon must begin at the platoon and company level with the individual soldier the soldier himself or members of his team must perform immediate decon and administer nerveagent antidotes and convulsant antidotes if required tag the patient with dd form 1380 or field expedient tag noting the time and type of contamination see figure 81 if available use the cam or m8m9 detector paper to determine the type and concentration of contamination when the patients condition and the battle permits the patient may go through moppgear exchange see chapter 3 of this manual the moppgear exchange must not cause further injury to the patient patient

process medical companys clearing station 816 the medical companys clearing station may receive patients from the bas or directly from other areas who may be contaminated the clearing station must also have patientdecon area for more information on bas operations under nbc conditions see fms 8104 and 8107 as with the bas the clearing station must have at least an 8man patientdecon team consisting of nonmedical personnel from the supported units to perform the decon procedures for patient decon at the clearing station are the same as fo r the bas hospital 817 to the maximum extent possible hospitals are located away from tactical or logistical targets patients evacuated from forward areas should already be decontaminated however contaminated patients may arrive from forward mtfs and units located within the geographical area of the hospital and require decon patient decon is done by 20 nonmedical personnel from units located in the geographical areabase cluster of the hospital 818 if the hospital does not have cpss and becomes contaminated with persistent agent patients are rerouted to other hospitals all inpatients are evacuated if possible and the hospital is decontaminated on completion of the decon the hospital will return to normal operations 819 hospital with cpss will decon the areas around the entry to these facilities then continue receiving and
