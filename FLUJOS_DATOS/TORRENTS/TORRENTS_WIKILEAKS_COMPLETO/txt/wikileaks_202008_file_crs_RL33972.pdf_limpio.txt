spells out specific requirements for senate committee procedures in addition all senate committees are required to adopt rules that govern their organization and operation those committee rules then elaborate within senate rules how the committee will handle questions of order and procedure committees rules may not be inconsistent with the rules of the senate1 committees may add to the basic rules but they may not add anything that is in conflict with senate rules examining the rules for each committee can show how each approaches issues of comity and fairness in the conduct of its business the rule s also serve to illustrate how each committee handles the division of power and the allocation of responsibility within its membership several committees for example require that if the committee is conducting business with quorum that is less than majority of its members member from the minority party must be present when issuing subpoenas or starting investigations committees may take different approaches on how to give authority to the chair of the committee while still allowing the ranking minority member role in the process some committees require the agreement of the ranking minority member others require that he or she be notified before the subpoena is issued the requirement that each committee must adopt its own set of rules dates back to the 1970 legislative reorganization act pl 91510 that law built on the 1946 legislative reorganization act pl 79601 which created framework for most senate committees by setting out some basic requirements that most committees must adhere to under the provisions of the1970 law senate committees must adopt their rules and have them printed in the congressional record not later than march 1 of the first year of congress typically the senate also publishes compilation of the rules of all the committees each congress and some individual committees also publish their rules as committee print 2 while committee rules govern the actions of senators in committee proceedings there is means for the senate to enforce rules on committee conduct if the requirement that physical majority be present for reporting measure or matter is met there also is means for the senate to enforce committee rules which go beyond those set out in the senates standing rules so for example if committees rules contained provision requiring that member of the minority party be present for quorum but the committee acts without regard to that provision the minority could register their disapproval with the committees actions but there is point of order that could be raised on the senate floor this report analyzes the different approaches senate committees have taken with their rules focusing on additions to the overall senate committee rules structure or unique provisions committees rules can be extensive and detailed or general and short the tables at the end of this report compare key features of the rules

each committee must follow3 the following provisions are taken from rule xxvi of the standing rules of the senate some committees reiterate these rules in their own rules but even for those committees that do not these restrictions apply 4 this is not an exhaustive explanation of senate rules and their impact on committees rather this summary is intended to provide background against which to understand each committees individual rules rules each committee must adopt rules those rules must be published in the congressional record not later than march 1 of the first year of each congress if

committees are relatively evenly spread over the remaining three days 5 committees chose tuesdays 7 committees selected wednesdays and 7 committees picked thursdays as their regular meeting days see table 1 two committees appropriations and select aging meet at the call of the chair within those categories some committees including the armed services commerce science and transportation foreign relations indian affairs and judiciary provide for meeting at least once week the other committees set the meetings at once or twice month

provide one weeks notice of their hearings and business meetings the rule however allows shorter notice if the committee determines there is good cause to hold hearing or meeting with less notice when it comes to the determination of what good cause is senate committees allocate the task of making that decision differently see table 1 the rules of the armed services committee for example say it is the decision of the committee as whole four committees agriculture nutrition and fo restry banking housing and urban affairs finance and indian affairs give the chair of the panel the authority to schedule hearing or meeting with less than weeks notice six committees require some type of cooperation between the chair and ranking member of the committee to meet with less than weeks notice four of those committees budget environment and public works judiciary and special aging require the chair to obtain the agreement of the ranking member to make the cision to hold hearing or meeting with less than usual notice the energy and natural resources committee gives the responsibility to the chair and the committee together while the foreign relations committee chair must consult with the ranking minority member on the committee g21g140g145g142g141g158g149g146g151g144g561g152g143g561g25g146g157g151g142g156g156g142g156g561 several committees go beyond senate requirements in their rules regarding scheduling of witnesses giving greater opportunity to the minority to include witnesses of their choosing during hearing see table 1 the finance committee calls on its staff to ensure there is balance of views early on in hearing and allows each member of the committee to designate individuals to testify the foreign relations committee minority may request an equal number of witnesses as the majority and the small business and entrepreneurship committee allows for an equal number of witnesses for the majority and minority unless there is to be just one administration witness similarly if the senate is evenly divided the budget committee provides for equal numbers of witnesses for the majority and minority with the same exception for single administration witness

senate for the conduct of business the requirement that member of the minority be present is common f eature of committee quorum rules in order to report out measure senate rules require that majority of the committee be physically present dozen committees feature some kind of minority attendance requirement for the conduct of business during committee business meeting see table 2 the environment
