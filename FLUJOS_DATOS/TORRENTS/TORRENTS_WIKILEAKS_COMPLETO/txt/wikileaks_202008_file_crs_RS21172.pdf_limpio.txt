been regulated at the state level for the past 150 years and the various insurance related interest groups have been largely state oriented as result there is limited familiarity on the national level with these insurance industryrelated interest groups or how they differ in their positions on federal legislation current legislation such as the national insurance act s 40 and hr 3200 the nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act hr 1065 and s 929 and the national association of registered agents and brokers reform act hr 5611 has focused congressional and industry attention on the possibility of federal regulation of the insurance industry this report is intended to assist in understanding the issues inherent in creating federal system of insurance regulation by providing some insight into the interests of organi zations most involved in the issue it will be updated as major events occur

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 insurance companies comprise major segment of the us financial services industry unlike banks and other financial institutions that are regulated primarily at the federal level insurance companies have been regulated by the states for the past 150 years although number of changes in this regulatory system have been proposed at the federal level the system has remained largely untouched by these proposals1 there is broad agreement that the current system needs to be made more uniform and efficient but there is widespread disagreement as to what approach should be taken to achieve this goal broadly speaking there are three approaches 1 continue the current statebased system with the national association of insurance commissioners naic leading harmonization efforts 2 create federal charter and federal regulatory system or 3 leave the states as lead regulators but with specific federal mandates or preemptions to produce more uniform system in the 110 th congress senators sununu and johnson introduced s 40 the national insurance act and representatives melissa bean and ed royce introduced similar but not identical companion bill hr 3200 the national insurance act takes the second approach proposing an insurance regulatory system that would be roughly modeled on the dual statefederal regulation that now exists for the banking industry it w ould give insurance companies the option to be chartered and regulated by newly established federal regulator rather than by current state regulators the third approach was first embodied in broad bill the state modernization and regulatory transparency smart act drafted by in the 108 th and 109th congresses and the subject of june 16 2005 hearing chaired by representative richard baker although drafts of the smart act circulated it was never officially introduced two narrower bills leaving the state system intact but preempting and harmonizing parts of it have however been introduced in the 110 th congressthe nonadmitted and reinsurance reform act hr 1065 and s 929 by representative dennis moore and senators mel martinez and bill nelson and the national association of registered agents and brokers re form act hr 5611 by representative david scott perhaps contrary to general perception the insurance industry is not monolithic industry but very competitive one serving multiple markets companies range in size from multiline insurers serving the entire county to small captive insurers that may insure single company in general insurers fall into two broad segments lifeannui tyhealth insurers and propertycasualty insurers some companies are organized as stock companies whereas others operate as mutual or fraternal companies some companies are very large in size whereas others are midsize or small some companies specialize in large commercial accounts whereas others write personal lines of business such as homeowners automobile or individual life and health policies still others concentrate on reinsurance or the selling of insurance to insurance companies to assist them in spreading their risks many insurance companies and their producersagents are members of various trade associations that represent their interests before state legislatures and insurance regulators it is estimated that 1 for more

g344g561there are more than 300 insurancerelated trade associations and professional organizations operating in the united states and canada2 most of these organizations are state oriented but some are now contacting members of congress to express their differing positions on the optional federal chartering or other proposals before congress these differences are due in large part to the diversity in segments and lines of business company structure size and insurance markets in which insurers operate g14g146g143g142g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561g5g152g150g153g138g151g162g561g3g156g156g152g140g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 life insurers as group generally support optional federal chartering proposals because their products are more national in scope that is life products are based on actuarial tables of life expectancy that vary little across state lines and tend to be more standardized than nonlife products major commercial banks seeking life insurance functions or affiliates in the insurance industry also tend to prefer national federal charters to match their own and to ease their own entry into life insurance markets nationwide within the life industry it is usually the larger insurers that actively seek federal chartering smaller insurers serving more regional markets tend to be neutral or opposed acli american council of life insurers httpwwwaclicom acli is the major trade association for life insurance and annuity companies in 2008 it reports that its 353 members account for 93 of the life insurance premiums and 94 of annuity considerations in the united states some acli members also write longterm care and disability income insurance products the acli has developed its own proposals for optional federal chartering of life insurance companies in the past and strongly endorses the national insurance act licony life insurance council of new york

for federal chartering is more prevalent among the large oldline insurers writing commercial lines of coverages much of the rest of the industry is opposed to direct federal regulation but open to some federal intervention such as representative bakers proposal the smaller pc insurers usually argue their personal line products such as auto and homeowners insuranc are inherently local in nature with differing state legal requirements and precedents that are best addressed and regulated at the state level aia american insurance association httpwwwa iadcorg aia is the oldest pc association

portion writing employee benefit plans is already directly or indirectly regulated at the federal level however health insurers are still subject to state insurance laws and regulations and there is wide diversity of opinion among them as to whether to support federal intervention contrary to the situation in the life and pc industries it is some of the smaller health insurers that have problems complying with differing state rules and would like to see uniform federal system some larger insurers with the resources to successfully comply with the rules in all states perceive it as competitive advantage to remain with statebased regulatory system considering the diversity of opinion among health insurers and the possibility that they would not be subject to whatever form of federal intervention might be passed it is not rprising that the major health insurance trades have not taken strong position on the issue ahip americas health insurance plans httpwwwahipnet ahip was formed

behind legislation for federal chartering of insurance companies they are already accustomed to dual regulatory system whereby they can choose to have either state or federal charter with its
