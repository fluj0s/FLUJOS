and in longterm national economic growth and productivity reflecting these and other ideas legislation established publicprivate program to assist smaller usbased manufacturing firms in identifying and adopting new technologies the focus on small and mediumsized companies derived from their perceived contribution to job creation innovation and manufacturing research has shown that businesses of fewer than 500 employees are about 25 times as innovative per employee as large firms the 341000 firms that fit this category represent over 99 of the nations manufacturing enterprises employ over 10 million people and account for 70 of total us manufacturing employment 1 the improved use of technology by small and mediumsized businesses is seen as important to the competitiveness of american manufacturing firms how product is designed and produced often determines costs quality and reliability lack of attention to process technologies and techniques may be the result of various factors including finances absence of information equipment shortages andor undervaluation of the benefits of technology the purpose of the centers program is to address these issues through outreach and the application of expertise technologies and knowledge developed within the manufacturing research activities of the federal government particularly the national institute of standards and technology

originally funded by the department of defense through the technology reinvestment project which was terminated in fy1994 centers offer expertise needs evaluation application demonstrations for new production technologies training and information dissemination larger regional organizations use federal university and private sector technologies knowledge and skills in providing improved manufacturing techniques designed to increase efficiency and quality and to decrease costs they also can furnish individual project engineering help in selecting and employing software and equipment factory assessments and provide onsite assistance with new technologies managerial financial and marketing services are accessible new rd is conducted by the centers which only use technologies

extension efforts including the mep program manufacturing extension programs manufacturers views of services of the 551 responses to 766 questionnaires distributed approximately 73 found that their relationships with an extension activity had positive effect on the companys business performance fifteen percent indicated that there was effect at all among the impacts identified were improved use of technology 63 better product quality 61 and expanded productivity 56 according to gao this suggested that manufacturing extension activities had some success in achieving their primary goal of helping manufacturers improve their operations through the use of appropriate technologies and through increases in product quality and worker productivity the study also found that companies which used internal funding to implement recommendations offered by extension programs were the most likely to find an overall positive impact significantly approximately 97 percent of these respondents

organizations noted that practical experience in the field contributed to the success of staff activities as did the affordability of the assistance companies that did not utilize the resources provided by the mep tended to be those that were unaware of the program and the opportunities associated with it further refining this information in march 1996 report manufacturing extension programs manufacturers views about delivery and impact of services gao also noted that company size and age were significant factors in business perceptions the extension program smaller under 1 million gross sales and newer established after 1985 firms were most likely to report that their overall business performance was boosted by mep assistance while there were real differences in perception between extension services offered by nist and those funded by other institutions there was difference in assessments of effectiveness based on whether or not payment was required according to gao those firms that paid fees were half as likely as those that paid fees to credit the assistance for having an extremely positive impact as opposed to generally positive impact on their business performance according to nist mep centers have responded to more than 310000 requests for assistance since the programs inception 2 regular reporting is required of the centers covering the number and type of projects undertaken centers also are mandated to collect information that may provide indicators of longerterm results including changes in sales financial investments inventory reduction savings in labor and materials and jobs created or saved the latest survey of clients using the centers during fy2005 found that the 4726 companies responding indicated that 53000 jobs were retained or created 63 billion in sales were increased or retained and 22 billion in new private sector investment was placed in plant modernization and training 3 the national academy of public administration also studied the mep program and found that while on balance the mep program performs capably and effectively and that the core premise remains viable as it is fulfilling its mission by leveraging both public and private resources to assist the nations small manufacturers there should be consideration of fundamental change in the mix of the types of services it provides as well as the structures for delivering them 4 as such next generation strategic plan has been developed by the partnership to concentrate on not just the shop floor but on the entire enterprise and its position in the

available in the marketplace instead of the government picking winners and losers opponents argue the marketplace should make decisions regarding firms worthy of inve stment however proponents of the program stress that direct funding is available to companies through mep and that assistance is technical scientific andor managerial the centers facilitate the adoption of new technologies that foster competition and promote innovation congress continues to explore the issue of manufacturing extension within the context of federal support for research and development until fy2004 despite some opposition to the manufacturing extension partnership there had been continued and generally increased funding for the program the lower level of appropriations for fy1999 and fy2000 reflected decrease in the federal portion of center financing as the programs surpass the original sixyear funding limit not declining congressional support for the activity the ongoing involvement and financial backing of state and local organizations may indicate additional widespread commitment to program designed to expand private sector use of manufacturing technologies already funded by the government and developed by the agencies in response to their mission requirements while the administrations budget proposals continued to call for substantial reductions in support for mep with the exception of fy2004 the congress had appropriated full funding for the centers program however in fy2008 support fell 144 from the previous fiscal year the administrations fy2009 budget request recommends terminating federal funding for the program while the bill ordered reported from the house committee on appropriations and s 3182 as reported from the senate committees on appropriations contain large increases in mep financing in the current congress the america competes act created and authorized financial support for new program of partnerships between industry and other educational or research institutions to develop new manufacturing processes techniques or materials in addition manufacturing fellowship program would be created with stipends available for postdoctoral work at nist these activities differ from the established mep effort where new manufacturing research is conducted as existing manufacturing technology is applied to the needs of small and mediumsized firms the issue of the statutory sixyear limitation on government financing of individual centers was addressed by the technology administration act of 1998 pl 105309 yet questions still remain particularly in light of efforts by the administration and past efforts by the house to reduce federal support for the centers the original intent of the funding restriction was to encourage the centers to be selfsupporting that does not appear to be feasible at the current time does this mean the centers are not providin g the help that companies are willing to pay for or are reimbursements too costly for the small firms the program is intended to assist what increased role might state and local government play in supporting centers and is it possible to attract more
