current conflicts in iraq and afghanistan cluster munitions have been highly criticized internationally for causing significant number of civilian deaths and efforts have been undertaken to ban and regulate their use this report will be updated what are cluster munitions1 cluster munitions are weapons that open in mid air and dispense smaller submunitions anywhere from few dozen to hundreds into an area they can be delivered by aircraft or from ground systems such as artillery rockets and missiles cluster munitions are valued militarily because one munition can kill or destroy many targets within its impact area and fewer weapons systems are needed to deliver fewer munitions to attack multiple targets cluster munitions also permit smaller force to engage larger adversary and are considered by some an economy of force weapon many cluster munitions rely on simple mechanical fuzes that arm the submunition based on its rate of spin and explode on impact or after time delay newer generation of sensorfuzed submunitions are being introduced by number of nations to improve the munitions and submunitions accuracy and to reduce the large number of residual unexploded submunitions these sensorfuzed submunitions are designed to sense and destroy vehicles without creating an extensive hazard area of unexploded submunitions 1 information in this section unless otherwise noted is from mark hiznay operational and technical aspects of cluster munitions united nations institute for disarmament research disarmament forum 2006 pp 1525 crs2 history2 cluster bombs were first used in world war ii and inclusive of their debut cluster munitions have been used in at least 21 states by at least 13 different countries cluster munitions were used extensively in southeast asia by the united states in the 1960s and 1970s and the international committee of the red cross icrc estimates that in laos alone 9 to 27 million unexploded submunitions remained after the conflict resulting in over 10000 civilian casualties to date cluster munitions were used by the soviets in afghanistan by the british in the falklands by the coalition in the gulf war and by the warring factions in yugoslavia in kosovo and yugoslavia in 1999 nato forces dropped 1765 cluster bombs containing approximately 295000 submunitions from 20012002 the united states dropped 1228 cluster bombs containing 248056 submunitions in afghanistan and us and british forces used almost 13000 cluster munitions containing an estimated 18 to 2 million submunitions during the first three weeks of combat in iraq in 2003 senior us government officials have stated that the united states has not used cluster munitions since 2003 during the intervention in iraq3 it is widely believed that confusion over us cluster submunitions blu97b that were the same color and size as airdropped humanitarian food packets played major role in the us decision to suspend cluster munitions use in afghanistan but not before using them in iraq httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22907 in 2006 israeli use of cluster munitions against hezbollah forces in lebanon resulted in widespread international criticism israel was said to have fired significant quantities of cluster munitions primarily during the last three days of the 34day war after cease fire deal had been agreed to4 resulting in almost 1 million unexploded cluster bomblets to which the attributed 14 deaths during the conflict5 reports maintain that hezbollah fired about 113 cluster rockets at northern israel and in turn israels use of cluster munitions supposedly affected 26 of southern lebanons arable land and contaminated about 13 square miles with unexploded submunitions6 one report states that there was failure rate of upwards of 70 of israels cluster weapons7 cluster munitions criticisms the fundamental criticisms of cluster munitions are that they disperse large numbers of submunitions imprecisely over an extended area that they frequently fail to detonate and are difficult to detect and that submunitions can remain explosive hazards for decades civilian casualties are primarily caused by munitions being fired into areas where soldiers and civilians are intermixed inaccurate cluster munitions landing in populated areas or civilians traversing areas where cluster munitions have been employed but failed to explode two technical characteristics of 2 ibid 3 stephen d mull acting assistant secretary of state for politicalmilitary affairs us cluster munitions policy ontherecord briefing washington dc may 21 2008 4 scott peterson

conflict say experts united nations office at geneva news media october 4 2006 6 scott peterson 7 ibid failure rate as described here is either failure to detonate on impact or failure to detonate after predetermined time delay crs3 submunitions failure rate and lack of selfdestruct capability have received great deal of attention failure rate8 there appears to be significant discrepancies among failure rate estimates some manufacturers claim submunition failure rate of 2 to 5 whereas mine clearance specialists have frequently reported failure rates of 10 to 30 number of factors influence submunition reliability these include delivery technique age of the submunition air temperature landing in soft or muddy ground getting caught in trees and vegetation and submunitions being damaged after dispersal or landing in such manner that their impact fuzes fail to initiate lack of selfdestruct capability submunitions lacking selfdestruct capability referred to as dumb munitions are of particular concern because they can remain hazard for decades thereby increasing the potential for civilian casualties some nations are developing smart or sensorfuzed weapons with greater reliability and variety of selfdestruct mechanisms intended to address the residual hazard of submuntions9 experts maintain that selfdestruct features reduce but do not eliminate the unexploded ordnance problem caused by cluster munitions and that the advantage httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22907 gained by using smart cluster munitions are negated when highfailure rate andor dumb cluster munitions are used in the same area10 for some nations replacing dumb and highfailure rate cluster munitions may not be an option china russia and the republic of korea maintain that they cannot afford to replace all current submunitions with smart submunitions11 international attempts to regulate use the use of cluster munitions is currently not prohibited under international law or governed by international treaty there are however two major ongoing international initiatives to regulate cluster munitions convention on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons ccw in an effort to restrict or ban specific types of weapons used in armed conflicts 51 states negotiated the ccw in 198012 when the treaty entered into force in december 1983 it applied only to incendiary weapons mines and boobytraps and weapons intended to cause casualties through very small fragments since then some states parties have added provisions through additional protocols to address other types of weapons negotiations on cluster munitions are carried out under protocol v on explosive remnants of war the united states was originally against any 8 unless otherwise noted

opposition in june 2007 some have characterized the ccw as slowmoving ponderous and lacking life13 oslo convention on cluster munitions14 described as frustrated with the ccw process in 2007 number of ccw members led by norway initiated negotiations outside of the ccw to ban cluster munitions15 on may 30 2008 they reached an agreement to ban cluster munitions16 the united states russia china israel egypt india and pakistan did not participate in the talks or sign the agreement convention participants plan to return to oslo norway in december 2008 to sign the agreement which will enter into force once 30 nations have signed17 the oslo convention on cluster munitions inter alia bans the use of cluster munitions as well as their development production acquisition transfer and stockpiling18 the oslo convention does not prohibit cluster munitions that can detect and engage single target or explosive submunitions equipped with an electronic selfdestruction or self deactivating feature19 an exemption that seemingly permits sensorfuzed or smart cluster submunitions current us policy on cluster munitions us government officials have httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22907 stated that the united states relies on them cluster munitions as an important part of our own defense strategy and that washingtons preferred alternative to ban would be to pursue technological fixes that will make sure that these weapons are longer viable once the conflict is over20 the united states has also agreed to address the humanitarian aspects of cluster munitions use through the convention on certain chemical weapons ccw rather than the oslo convention on cluster munitions21 us officials note that cluster munitions are available for use by every combat aircraft in the us inventory they are integral to every army or marine maneuver element and in some cases constitute up to 50 percent of tactical indirect fire support us forces simply can not 13 change of heart or of tactic cluster

removal and abatement us department of state is there strategy for responsible us engagement on cluster munitions april 28 2008 crs5 fight by design or by doctrine without holding out at least the possibility of using cluster munitions22 the united states also maintains that using cluster munitions reduces the number of aircraft and artillery systems needed to support military operations and that if cluster munitions were eliminated significantly more money would need to be spent on new weapons systems ammunition and logistical resources officials further suggest that if cluster munitions were eliminated most militaries would increase their use of massed artillery and rocket barrages which would likely increase destruction of key infrastructure us officials were concerned that early versions of the oslo convention on cluster munitions would prevent military forces from nonstates parties from providing humanitarian and peacekeeping support and significantly affect nato military operations but the version signed may 30 2008 does permit states parties to engage in military cooperation and operations with nonstates parties article 21 paragraph 3 new us policy23 sources indicate that the department of defense will soon issue new policy on cluster munitions this policy is said to require that cluster munitions used after 2018 must leave less than 1 of unexploded submunitions on the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22907 battlefield this policy supposedly will permit the development of new generation of cluster munitions less dangerous to civilians while such high level of performance might be achievable under controlled laboratory conditions previously mentioned factors such as delivery technique landing in soft or muddy ground getting caught in trees and vegetation and submunitions being damaged after dispersal or landing could result in an appreciable number of dud submunitions even if it has selfdeactivation feature recent legislative initiatives in february 2007 the house and senate introduced hr 1755 and s 594 the cluster munitions civilian protection act of 2007 which inter alia limits the use sale or transfer of cluster munitions unless the submunitions have 99 or higher function rate and precludes cluster munition use in areas where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians the house version has been referred to the armed services subcommittee on readiness and the senate version to the committee on foreign relations the 2008 omnibus appropriations measure pl 110161 the consolidated appropriations act 2008 sec 646 b placed oneyear moratorium on the export or transfer of cluster munitions unless 1 the munition has 99 or higher tested rate 2 that any exported cluster munitions or associated technologies are for use against clearly defined military targets and 3 that these munitions will not be used where civilians are known to be present us government officials have stated that we are not now because of this law sec 646b of pl 110161 in effect providing cluster munitions to foreign partners24 22 ibid 23 kris osborn cluster effects duds defense news june 16 2008 pp 1116 and

issues for congress cluster munitions in an era of precision weapons it may be argued that even with advances in sensorfuzed type submunitions that seek out and destroy certain targets cluster munitions are still essentially an indiscriminate area weapon in an era where precision weapons are increasingly becoming the military norm in operation desert storm in 1991 only about 10 of ordnance used were precisionguided but by the time of the iraq invasion in 2003 the ratio of smart to dumb weapons was nearly reversed25 since then this trend towards greater precision has continued if not accelerated with the development of precision rocket artillery mortar munitions and smallerprecision aerial bombs designed to reduce collateral damage26 given current and predicted future precision weaponry trends cluster munitions might be losing their military relevance much as chemical weapons did between world war i and world war ii national defense strategy and cluster munitions according to reports the secretary of defense allegedly overruling objections of service chiefs has recently approved the 2008 national defense strategy which will shift focus from preparing for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22907 major conventional wars to preparing for more iraqlike missions27 instead the services will be asked to focus their efforts on current operations in iraq and afghanistan and not structure longterm plans for how to train and equip forces based on fighting major war against potential adversary such as china or russia28 it is possible that this strategic shift might have implications for the future of cluster munitions as well us officials have recently stated when youre fighting counterinsurgency which is whats happening in both afghanistan and iraq i think our military planners would agree that theyre cluster munitions not appropriate and wouldnt be very useful29 in this context cluster munitions may have little or military utility in anticipated future us military operations weapons in lieu of cluster munitions according to the state department the us military suspended its use of cluster munitions in iraq and afghanistan in 2003 for subsequent military operations where cluster munitions would otherwise have been the weapon of choice congress might review what types of weapons were substituted in place of cluster munitions and how effective they were in achieving the desired tactical results such insights could prove valuable in analyzing us policy options on the future of cluster munitions 25 jr wilson pinpoint accuracy bombs rockets
