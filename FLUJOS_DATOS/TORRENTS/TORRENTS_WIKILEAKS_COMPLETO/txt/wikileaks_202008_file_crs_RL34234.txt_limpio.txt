september 3 2008 mary beth nikitin coordinator foreign affairs defense and trade division anthony andrews and mark holt resources science and industry division managing the nuclear fuel cycle policy implications of expanding global access to nuclear power summary after several decades of decline and disfavor nuclear power is attracting renewed interest new permit applications for 30 reactors have been filed in the united states and another 150 are planned or proposed globally with about dozen more already under construction in the united states interest appears driven in part by provisions in the 2005 energy policy act authorizing streamlined licensing that combine construction and operating permits and tax credits for production from advanced nuclear power facilities moreover the us department of energy proposes to spend billions of dollars to develop the next generation of nuclear power technology expanding global access to nuclear power nevertheless has the potential to lead to the spread of sensitive nuclear technology despite 30 years of effort to limit access to uranium enrichment several undeterred states pursued clandestine nuclear programs the aq khan black market networks sales to iran and north korea representing the most egregious examples concern over the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies combined with growing consensus that the world must seek alternatives to dwindling and polluting fossil fuels may be giving way to optimism that advanced nuclear technologies may offer proliferation resistance proposals offering countries access to nuclear power and thus the fuel cycle have ranged from formal commitment by these countries to forswear enrichment and reprocessing technology to facto approach in which state does not operate fuel cycle facilities but makes explicit commitment to restrictions at all the most recent proposal under the us global nuclear energy partnership gnep represents shift in us policy by not requiring participants to forgo domestic fuel cycle programs whether developing states will find existing proposals attractive enough to forgo what they see as their inalienable right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes remains to be seen congress will have considerable role in at least four areas of oversight related to fuel cycle proposals the first is providing funding and oversight of us domestic programs related to expanding nuclear energy in the united states the second area is policy direction andor funding for international measures to assure supply third set of policy issues may arise in the context of implementing the international component of gnep fourth area in which congress plays key role is in the approval of nuclear cooperation agreements the 110th

nuclear power introduction1 renewed interest in nuclear power and expanding its role in meeting world energy demands has also led to increased concerns for limiting the spread of nuclear weaponsrelevant technology after languishing for several decades the united states appears poised for new phase of nuclear reactor construction two new uranium enrichment plants are already under construction in anticipation of an increased demand for nuclear fuel spent nuclear fuel disposal has remained the most critical aspect of the nuclear fuel cycle for the united states where longstanding nonproliferation policy discouraged commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing2 other countries provide commercial reprocessing services and with several notable exceptions have kept their commercial and weapons fuel cycles separate new proposals to offer commercial nuclear power opportunities to nonfuel cycle nations would guarantee them supply of nuclear fuel in exchange for commitments to forgo enrichment and reprocessing the us department of energy considers nuclear power as the only proven technology that can provide abundant supplies of baseload electricity reliably and without air pollution or emissions of greenhouse gases3 the national energy policy development group recommended in 2001 that president bush support the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as major component of our national energy policy about the same time the us department of energy doe created the generation iv international forum to collaborate with 10 other states in investigating innovative nuclear energy system concepts for meeting future energy challenges the bush administration requested millions of dollars from congress in 2003 to support several programs related to the development of new nuclear power plants in the united states including the advanced fuel cycle initiative and generation iv in passing the energy policy act of 2005 congress created certain incentives and streamlined license application procedures for new nuclear power plants in february 2006 the secretary of energy announced the global nuclear energy initiative gnep as part of president bushs advanced energy initiative 1 jill marie parillo and sharon squassoni were original contributors to this report 2 crs report rs22542 nuclear fuel reprocessing us policy development by anthony andrews 3 us department of energy the global nuclear energy partnership factsheet 06 ga5050601 also available at httpwwwgnepenergygov crs2 meanwhile concerns over nuclear proliferation have steadily risen as ostensibly commercial uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies have been subverted for military purposes in 2003 and 2004 it became evident that pakistani nuclear scientist aq khan sold sensitive technology and equipment related to uranium enrichment process that can be used to make fuel for nuclear power and research reactors or to make fissile material for nuclear weapons to states such as libya iran and north korea although pakistans leaders maintain they did not acquiesce in or abet khans activities pakistan remains outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and the nuclear suppliers group nsg iran has been direct recipient of pakistani enrichment technology4 the international atomic energy agency iaeas board of governors found in 2005 that irans breach of its safeguards obligations constituted noncompliance with its safeguards agreement and referred the case to the security council in february 2006 despite repeated calls by the security council for iran to halt enrichment and reprocessingrelated activities and imposition of sanctions iran continues to develop enrichment capability at natanz5 iran insists on its inalienable right to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy pursuant to article iv of the npt interpretations of this right have varied over time6 the iaea director general mohamed elbaradei has not disputed this inalienable right and by and large neither have us government officials however the case of iran raises perhaps the most critical question in this decade for strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime how can access to sensitive fuel cycle activities which could be used to produce fissile material for weapons be circumscribed without further alienating nonnuclear weapon states in the npt leaders of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime have suggested ways of reining in the diffusion of such inherently dualuse technology primarily through the creation of incentives not to enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium the international community is in the process of evaluating those proposals and may decide upon mix of approaches most of the proposals are not new but rather variations of those developed thirty or more years ago7 in the 1970s efforts to limit or manage the spread of 4 crs report rs21592 irans nuclear program recent developments by sharon squassoni 5

must be consistent with states obligations under articles ii and ii of the treaty article ii refers to states obligation to foreswear nuclear weapons development and article iii refers to states obligation to undertake safeguards for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfillment of its obligations under the treaty 7 see timeline of fuel cycle proposals available at httpwwwiaeaorgnewscenter crs3 nuclear fuel cycle technologies for nonproliferation reasons foundered for technical and political reasons but many states were nevertheless deterred from enrichment and reprocessing simply by the high technical and financial costs of developing sensitive nuclear technologies as well as by slump in the nuclear market several developments may now make efforts to limit access to the nuclear fuel cycle more attractive growing concern about the spread of enrichment technology specifically via aq khan black market network as well as irans efforts growing consensus that the world must seek alternatives to polluting fossil fuels and optimism about new nuclear technologies that may offer more proliferationresistant systems central to the debate is developing proposals attractive enough to compel states to forego what they see as their inalienable right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes at the same time there is debate on how to improve the iaea safeguards system and its means of detecting diversion of nuclear material to weapons program in the face of expanded nuclear power facilities worldwide this report is intended to provide members and congressional staff with the background needed to understand the current debate over proposed strategies to redesign the global nuclear fuel cycle it begins with look at the motivating factors underlying the resurgent interest in nuclear power the nuclear power industrys current state of affairs and the interdependence with the nuclear fuel cycle number of proposals have been offered that are aimed at limiting direct participation in the global nuclear fuel industry by assuring access to nuclear fuel supplies year agency proposal 2003 iaea would establish internationally owned fuel cycle centers 2004 united states would keep uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing in the hands of current technology holders while providing fuel guarantees to those who abandon the option 2005 iaea explored variety of options to address front end and back end problems and their attractiveness to different groups of states and surveyed past proposals 2005 russian federation would establish international fuel cycle centers 2006 united states us global nuclear energy partnership originally proposed that certain recognized fuel cycle countries would ensure reliable supply to the rest of the world in return for commitments to renounce enrichment and reprocessing also proposed solutions for recycling of spent fuel and storage issues 2006 us uk russia six country concept would

plutonium renewed interest in nuclear power expansion8 commercializing nuclear power has proved far more challenging than first envisioned world nuclear capacity had reached about 200 gigawatts during the 1980s but as confidence in nuclear power safety declined after accidents at three mile island and chernobyl the rate of adding new capacity fell more than 75 during the following decade9 today nuclear power provides about 368 gigawatts 15 of the worlds electricity generation though significant amount it is far less than that projected 50 years ago high construction and operating costs safety problems and accidents and controversy over nuclear waste disposal slowed the worldwide growth of nuclear power with uranium once considered scarce resource reprocessing was promised as means of extending the energy remaining in spent nuclear fuel and fast breeder reactor technology promised to produce more fuel than reactor consumed in the 1980s as the economics of nuclear power became questionable with declining fossil fuel prices and increased uranium supplies national programs to develop fast breeder reactors came nearly to standstill moreover the plutonium fuel produced by breeder reactors drew strong opposition over its potential use in nuclear weapons in the past few years however the original promises of nuclear power have attracted renewed interest around the world what has changed sharply higher prices for oil and natural gas are fundamental factor in national energy policymaking average world oil prices have risen from below 10 per barrel at the beginning of 1999 to above 80 per barrel in the fall of 200710 us natural gas prices have followed similar track and neardoubling of international 8 this section was prepared by mark holt specialist in energy policy and anthony andrews specialist in energy policy in the resources science and industry division congressional research service 9 international energy agency world energy outlook 2006 p 349 10 energy information administration at httptontoeiadoegovdnavpethistwtotworldw htm crs5 shipments of liquefied natural gas since 199811 indicates that natural gas prices have also risen around the world as result national governments are searching for alternative energy sources often including nuclear power however only 20 of the worlds electricity generation is fueled by natural gas and 7 by oil the majority of the worlds electricity is generated from coal12 so nuclear powers ability to directly substitute for oil and gas is limited at least in the near term for nuclear power to have significant impact on oil demand longterm changes in energyuse patterns would have to take place particularly in the transportation sector one possibility is that nuclear power plants could be used to produce hydrogen which could provide energy for fuelcell vehicles the us department of energy is developing processes that could produce industrial scale quantities of hydrogen in hightemperature reactor by 201913 and is concurrently supporting development of fuel cell vehicles another possibility is the commercialization of allelectric or plugin hybrid vehicles that could be recharged with nucleargenerated electricity but even if such technologies were to be successfully developed it would take many years for the new vehicles and in the case of hydrogen fuel delivery infrastructure to have significant energy impact government policies aside higher oil and gas prices are heightening interest in nuclear power by improving current projections of nuclear powers economic viability in the united states natural gas has been the overwhelming fuel of choice for new electrical generation capacity since the early 1990s but recent high prices have caused planned coalfired capacity in 2009 to reach nearly twice the level of planned gasfired capacity14 increased demand has led to rising us prices for coal which already generates nearly half of us electricity and 40 of world electricity15 because fuel costs constitute relatively small percentage of nuclear power costs higher natural gas and coal prices could make new nuclear power plants economically competitive despite sharply rising uranium prices16 growing worldwide concern about greenhouse gas emissions particularly carbon dioxide from fossil fuels has renewed attention to nuclear powers lack of direct co2 emissions although few national governments or international organizations have explicitly adopted policies in support of nuclear power to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions many ghg policies and proposals may indirectly encourage nuclear power expansion legislative proposals such as tradeable permits and carbon taxes could increase the cost of electricity from new fossilfuelfired power plants above that of nuclear power plants 11 eia httpwwweiadoegovemeuinternationalgastradehtml 12 world energy outlook op cit pp 139 141 13 doe fy 2008 congressional budget vol 3 p 577 14 eia httpwwweiadoegovcneafelectricityepaepat2p4html 15 world energy outlook op cit p 140 16 crs report rl33442 nuclear power outlook for new us reactors by larry parker and mark holt crs6 some support for nuclear power as way to reduce ghg emissions has emerged in academic and thinktank circles as stated by the massachusetts institute of technology in its major study the future of nuclear power our position is that the prospect of global climate change from greenhouse gas emissions and the adverse consequences that flow from these emissions is the principal justification for government support of the nuclear energy option17 but environmental groups generally contend that the nuclear accident waste and weapons proliferation risks posed by nuclear power outweigh any ghg benefits the large construction expenditures required by commercial reactors they contend would yield greater ghg reductions if used for energy efficiency and renewable generation finally they note that nuclear power while not directly emitting greenhouse gases produces indirect emissions through the nuclear fuel cycle and during plant construction another key factor behind the renewed interest in nuclear power is the improved performance of existing reactors us commercial reactors generated electricity at an average of 898 of their total capacity in 2006 after averaging around 75 in the mid1990s and around 65 in the mid1980s worldwide performance has seen similar improvement18 the improved operation of nuclear power plants has helped drive down the cost of nucleargenerated electricity average us reactor operations and maintenance costs including fuel but excluding capital costs dropped steadily from high of about 35 centskilowatthour kwh in 1987 to below 2 centskwh in 2001 in 2001 dollars19 by 2005 the us average operating cost was 17 centskwh20 nuclear interest has been further increased in the united states by incentives in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the law provides nuclear energy production tax credit for up to 6000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity compensation for regulatory delays for the first six new reactors and federal loan guarantees for nuclear power and other advanced energy technologies under certain baseline assumptions the tax credit could determine whether new us nuclear plants would be economically viable21 us electric utilities and other companies during the past two years have announced plans to submit license applications to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for more than 30 new commercial reactors table 1 nrc has issued early site permits which resolve siterelated issues for possible future reactor construction at locations in illinois and mississippi and is nearing completion of third permit in virginia the tennessee valley

despite that flurry of activity new reactor orders have been placed reactors have been ordered in the united states since 1978 and all orders after 1973 were subsequently cancelled new reactors are on order elsewhere in the world and several nonnuclear countries have announced that they are considering the nuclear option as figure 1 shows the vast majority of reactors currently under construction are in asia with only handful in the rest of the world despite the recent positive developments for nuclear power much uncertainty still remains about its prospects construction costs for new nuclear power plants which were probably the dominant factor in halting the first round of nuclear expansion continue to loom as potential insurmountable obstacle to renewed nuclear power growth average us nuclear plant construction costs more than doubled from 1971 to 1978 according to the office of technology assessment and nearly doubled again by the mid1980s not including interest accrued during construction22 including interest many us nuclear plants proved to be grossly uneconomic often with capital costs totaling more than 3000 per kilowatt of capacity in 2000 dollars23 and relying on the utility regulatory system to recover their costs major reactor vendors such as general electric and westinghouse contend that new designs and construction methods will cut costs considerably nuclear supporters also point to new us nuclear licensing system that is intended to avoid some of the regulatory problems that delayed completion of some reactors in the past us commercial reactor has been completed during the past decade however and the new licensing system has yet to be tested the french reactor vendor areva estimated that the first of its newly designed power plants in france would cost 2600 per kilowatt which would be high in the likely range of economic viability reported construction costs of reactors completed around the world since the 1990s range so widely and vary so much in circumstance that they provide little insight into probable future costs24 many other important factors in the future of nuclear power are similarly uncertain prices of competing fuels particularly natural gas have risen recently but have been volatile in the recent past if fossil fuel prices become depressed for sustained period as in the late 1980s through the 1990s support for nuclear power as an alternative energy source could again be undermined major accidents such as three mile island and chernobyl would almost certainly diminish public support for nuclear power disposal of highlevel nuclear waste which reprocessing or recycling is intended to address will continue to generate controversy as 22 office of technology assessment nuclear power in an age of uncertainty otae216 february

china and india nuclear power supplied 224 of electricity generated in oecd countries in 2005 170 in the former soviet countries and 21 in developing countries25 unlike the united states where active construction of new reactors ended in 1996 the rest of the world has continued building nuclear plants although at modest pace since 1996 about 40 commercial reactors have started up an average of about four per year about 30 reactors were permanently closed during that period although many of them were smaller than the newly started reactors26 as shown in the following figures current reactor construction is dominated by asia of the 27 reactors currently under construction around the world 18 are in asia while only five are in europe three in the americas and one in the middle east iran planned or proposed nuclear power plants show similar trend of the 203 potential reactors identified in the following figures more than half 112 are in asia while 44 are in europe 40 in the americas and seven in the middle east the renewed worldwide interest in nuclear power has led to possible expansion of the technology to currently nonnuclear nations six of the countries that are currently building or formally considering reactor projects egypt indonesia iran israel malaysia and vietnam have never operated nuclear power plants several other nonnuclear countries have also raised the possibility of building nuclear power plants including belarus libya jordan nigeria qatar saudi arabia syria thailand and turkey27 see figure 2 below nuclear fuel services market the possible upsurge in worldwide nuclear power plant construction has focused new attention on nuclear fuel production chronic worldwide overcapacity in all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle appears to be ending evidenced by sharply higher prices for uranium and enrichment services the tightening supplies have sparked plans for new fuel cycle facilities around the world and also renewed concerns about controls over the

through an enrichment process the concentration of 235u is increased several times above its natural level of 07 nuclear power plant operator or utility purchases yellowcake and contracts for its conversion to uranium hexafluoride then enrichment and finally fabrication into fuel elements figure 1 commercial enrichment services are available in the united states europe russia and japan fuel fabrication services are even more widely available while waiting for conversion the yellowcake remains fungible commodity that can be consigned by the reactor operator to any conversion plant and the product sent to any enrichment plant within trade restrictions between countries28 the sale of yellowcake had been informal until recently when it moved to more formal commodity transaction basis the various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle are described below figure 1 the conceptual nuclear fuel cycle yellowcake conventionally mined uranium ore openpit and underground is milled then acid leached

and japan37 but security of uranium supply while always an underlying policy concern has rarely been real problem because production vastly outstripped demand during the first three decades of the commercial nuclear power era until about the mid1980s38 as result huge overhang of military and civilian stockpiles of uranium helped maintain worldwide buyers market since the mid1980s however world nuclear fuel requirements continued to rise while uranium exploration and production fell by 2000 as us spotmarket prices hit bottom at about 7 per pound the western worlds nuclear fuel requirements

centrifuges successively enriches the gas in 235u final enrichment will vary depending on the requirements of specific reactor normally up to about 4 gaseous diffusion technology was first developed in the united states and later adopted by france and britain it is more energyintensive than the newer centrifuge enrichment process however the legacy gaseous diffusion plants currently operating in the united states and france have higher capacities than the newer centrifuge enrichment plants uranium enrichment services are sold in kilograms kg or metric tons 1000 kg separative work units swu which is measure of the amount of work needed in the thermodynamic sense to enhance the 235u concentration the number of swus required to produce fuel depends on several factors the quantity of fuel required level of enrichment required the initial enrichment of the feed 0711 in the case of natural uranium and the tails assay which is the 235u concentration remaining in the depleted processing stream for example to produce 1 kg of uranium enriched to 3 235u at tails assay of 02 235u 43 kgswu are used to process 55 kg of natural uranium42 the price of yellowcake is an important factor in enrichment demand under high price conditions it may be economically preferable to expend more swus enriching lesser quantity of yellowcake thus leaving lower tails assay in 2005 the approximately 53 million lbs of yellowcake contracted for enrichment required 11 million swus higher uranium prices also leads to recycling stockpiles of higher assay tails back through enrichment 41 ruthane neely and

fabrication is specialized service rather than commodity transaction the now lowenriched uranium uf6 undergoes one final process converting to uranium dioxide uo2 before the final stage of fuel fabrication it is then sintered into pellets and loaded into zirconium alloy tubes fuel rods about 1215 feet long and half an inch in diameter the fuel rods are bundled into fuel assemblies which vary from less than 100 to as many as 300 rods apiece fuel fabrication services are offered by 16 suppliers operating in 18 countries at around 34 facilities in 2002 iaea estimated that worldwide fabrication capacity of 19000 tons fuel assemblies and elements exceeded the demand by 5350 the oversupply had existed for many years and as consequence facilities were shut down and ownership was consolidated essentially all us fabrication demand is met by three companies providing fabrication service at four facilities framatome anp inc in lynchburg va and richland wa global nuclear fuel in wilmington nc and westinghouse electric in columbia sc about 30 other nuclear fuel fabrication facilities are in operation elsewhere in the world51 final stages of the fuel cycle the final stages of the nuclear fuel cycle take place after nuclear fuel assemblies have been loaded into reactor in the reactor the uranium 235 235u splits or fissions releasing energy neutrons and fission products highly radioactive fragments of 235u nuclei the neutrons may cause other 235u nuclei to fission creating nuclear chain reaction some neutrons are also absorbed by 238u nuclei to create plutonium 239 239pu which itself may then fission after several years in the reactor fuel assemblies will build up too many neutronabsorbing fission products and become too depleted in fissile 235u to efficiently sustain nuclear chain reaction at that point the assemblies are considered spent nuclear fuel and removed from the reactor spent fuel typically contains about 1 235u 1 plutonium 4 fission products and the remainder 238u the last stage of the fuel cycle after spent fuel is removed from reactor has proved highly contentious one option is to directly dispose of spent fuel in deep geologic repository to isolate it for the hundreds of thousands of years that it may remain hazardous the other option is to reprocess the spent fuel to separate the uranium and plutonium for use in new fuel supporters of reprocessing or recycling contend that it could greatly reduce the volume and longevity of nuclear waste while 49 ibid 50 iaea country nuclear fuel cycle profiles 2nd ed 51 nuclear engineering international 2007 world nuclear industry handbook p 207 crs18 vastly expanding the amount of energy extracted from the worlds uranium resources opponents contend that commercial use of separated plutonium key material in nuclear weapons as well as reactor fuel poses nuclear weapons proliferation threat commercialscale spent fuel reprocessing is currently conducted in france britain and russia the 239pu they produce is blended with uranium to make mixed oxide mox fuel in which the 239pu largely substitutes for 235u two french reprocessing plants at hague can each reprocess up to 800 metric tons of spent fuel per year while britains thorp facility at sellafield has capacity of 900 metric tons per year russia has 400ton plant at ozersk and japan is building an 800ton plant at rokkasho to succeed 90ton demonstration facility at tokai mura britain and france also have older plants to reprocess gascooled reactor fuel and india has 275ton plant52 about 200 metric tons of mox fuel is used annually about 2 of new nuclear fuel53 equivalent to about 2000 metric tons of mined uranium54 however the benefits of reprocessing spent fuel from todays nuclear power plants are modest existing commercial light water reactors use ordinary water to slow down or moderate the neutrons released by the fission process the relatively slow thermal neutrons are highly efficient in causing fission in certain isotopes of heavy elements such as 235u and 239pu55 therefore fewer of those isotopes are needed in nuclear fuel to sustain nuclear chain reaction the downside is that thermal neutrons cannot efficiently induce fission in more than few specific isotopes in todays commercial reactors therefore the buildup of nonfissile plutonium and other isotopes sharply limits the number of reprocessing cycles before the recycled fuel can longer sustain nuclear chain reaction and must be stored or disposed of in contrast fast neutrons which have not been moderated are less effective in inducing fission than thermal neutrons but can induce fission in all actinides including all plutonium isotopes therefore nuclear fuel for fast reactor must have higher proportion of fissionable isotopes than thermal reactor to sustain chain reaction but larger number of different isotopes can constitute that fissionable proportion fast reactors ability to fission all actinides actinium and heavier elements makes it theoretically possible to repeatedly separate those materials from spent fuel and feed them back into the reactor until they are entirely fissioned fast reactors are also ideal for breeding the maximum amount of 239pu from 238u eventually 52 world nuclear association processing of used nuclear fuel for recycle march 2007 at httpwwwworldnuclearorginfoinf69html 53 world nuclear

with different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei crs19 converting virtually all of natural uranium to useable nuclear fuel56 current reprocessing programs are generally viewed by their proponents as interim steps toward commercial nuclear fuel cycle based on fast reactors waste disposal and energy security reprocessing of spent fuel from fast breeder reactors has long been the ultimate goal of nuclear power supporters as noted above fast reactors operated either as breeders or nonbreeders can eliminate plutonium from nuclear waste and greatly extend uranium supplies but opponents contend that such potential benefits are not worth the costs and nonproliferation risks removing uranium from spent nuclear fuel through reprocessing would eliminate most of the volume of radioactive material requiring disposal in deep geologic repository in addition the removal of plutonium and conversion to shorter lived fission products would eliminate most of the longterm post1000 years radioactivity in nuclear waste but the waste resulting from reprocessing would have nearly the same shortterm radioactivity and heat as the original spent fuel because the reprocessing waste consists primarily of fission products which generate most of the radioactivity and heat in spent fuel because heat is the main limiting factor on repository capacity conventional reprocessing would not provide major disposal benefits in the near term doe is addressing that problem with proposal to further separate the primary heatgenerating fission products cesium 137 and strontium 90 from high level waste for separate storage and decay over several hundred years that proposal would greatly increase repository capacity although it would require an alternative secure storage system for the cesium and strontium that has yet to be designed energy security has been primary driving force behind the development of nuclear energy particularly in countries such as france and japan that have few natural energy resources recent cutoffs in oil and gas have underscored the instability of oil and gas supply which could be mitigated by nuclear energy for example in 2006 natural gas price dispute between russia and ukraine resulted in temporary cutoff of natural gas to western and central europe in 2007 price disputes between russia and azerbaijan and belarus caused temporary cutoff in oil to russia from azerbaijan and in oil from russia to germany poland and slovakia moreover temporary production shutdowns in the gulf of mexico and the transalaskan pipeline instability in nigeria and nationalization of oil and gas fields in bolivia in 2006 have all raised concerns about oil and gas supplies and 56 the core of breeder reactor is configured so that more fissile 239pu is produced from 238u than the amount of fissile material initially loaded into the core that is consumed 235u or 239 pu in breeder therefore enough fissile material could be recovered through reprocessing to refuel the reactor and to provide fuel for additional breeders the core of fast reactor can also be configured to produce less 239pu than fissile material consumed if the primary goal is to eliminate 239pu from spent fuel in that case much less 238u ultimately would be converted to 239pu and therefore less total energy produced from given amount of natural uranium crs20 worldwide price volatility relative to gas and oil the ability to stockpile uranium is widely seen as offering greater assurances of weathering potential cutoffs worldwide uranium resources are generally considered to be sufficient for at least several decades uranium supply is highly diversified with uranium mining spread across the globe while uranium conversion enrichment and fuel fabrication are more concentrated in handful of countries but because most reactors around the world rely at least partly on foreign sources of uranium and nuclear fuel services nuclear reactors nearly everywhere face some level of supply vulnerability to mitigate such concern countries such as china india and japan are seeking to secure longterm uranium contracts to support nuclear expansion goals efforts are underway to establish an international nuclear fuel bank attempt to inject greater certainty in fuel supplies as discussed in the next section ultimately only the development of breeder reactors and reprocessing could provide true nuclear energy independence this remains the longterm goal of resourcepoor france and japan and russia as well although their research and development programs have faced numerous obstacles and schedule slowdowns proposals on the fuel cycle57 proposals on limiting access to the full nuclear fuel cycle have ranged from formal commitment to forswear enrichment and reprocessing technology to facto approach in which state does not operate fuel cycle facilities but makes explicit commitment to give them up to restrictions at all all of these proposals aim to persuade countries not to develop their own fuel production capabilities by providing economically attractive alternatives that allay concerns about politically motivated interruption to fuel supply most proposals focus on this frontend problem dealing with fuel supply and production issues the us global nuclear energy partnership gnep envisions giving incentives on the backend of the fuel cycle as well by offering management of spent fuel and toxic byproducts president bushs 2004 proposal in speech at the national defense university on february 11 2004 president bush said the world needed to close loophole in the npt that allows states to legally acquire the technology to produce nuclear material which could be used for clandestine weapons program to remedy this he proposed that the forty members of the nuclear suppliers group nsg should refuse to sell enrichment and reprocessing equipment and technologies to any state that does not already posses 57 this section was prepared by mary beth nikitin analyst in wmd nonproliferation sharon squassoni specialist in national defense and jill parillo research associate in the foreign affairs defense and trade division and anthony andrews specialist in energy policy in the resources science and industry division crs21 fullscale functioning enrichment and reprocessing plants58 president bush also called on the worlds leading nuclear fuel services exporters to ensure that states have reliable access at reasonable cost to fuel for civilian reactors so long as those states renounce enrichment and reprocessing in wake of the aq khan network revelations also highlighted in the february 2004 speech the international community had renewed interest in addressing this quandary since 2004 the group of eight g8 nations have announced yearlong suspension of any such transfers at their annual summit meetings and international study groups have been formed to try and find agreement on more permanent solution to the problem59 president bushs 2004 proposal is the only one that calls for countries to explicitly renounce pursuit of enrichment or reprocessing technologies in exchange for reliable access to nuclear fuel it was meant to disarm advocates of indigenous fuel cycle development of the argument that only indigenous supply is secure there has been little agreement on president bushs proposals many nonnuclear weapon states see this as an attempt to limit their inalienable right to the use of peaceful nuclear energy under article iv of the npt and are not willing to consider limits on peaceful nuclear technologies until more progress on nuclear disarmament has been made key questions about implementation of this proposal remain unanswered for example who is included in the group of supplier states and how is fullscale functioning plants defined would irans enrichment program qualify today even if it did not back in 2004 and what about nonnpt states with the full fuel cycle as part of their weapons programs also how would related technologies be treated for example would restrictions also apply to postirradiation experiments on spent nuclear fuel which yield significant data about reactor operations but can also contribute to knowledge about reprocessing for weapons purposes since 2004 delay in defining these terms appears to have provided an incentive for some states such as canada south africa argentina and australia to expedite their pursuit of full operational enrichment capability so as not to be excluded when and if such division between fuel cycle haves and havenots is made following president bushs 2004 speech nsg members discussed how they might implement such restrictions since the 1970s nsg members have adhered to an informal restriction on transferring enrichment reprocessing and heavy water technology to states outside the nsg france proposed criteriabased approach that would lay out set of criteria that recipient states would first need to meet including the following member of the npt in full compliance 58 president announces new measures to counter the threat of wmd february 11 2004 at httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases200402200402114html 59 see paragraph 13 of the heiligendamm

and additional protocol in force breach of safeguards obligations iaea board of governors decisions taken to address lack of confidence over peaceful intentions adherence to nsg guidelines bilateral agreement with the supplier that includes assurances on nonexplosive uses effective safeguards in perpetuity and retransfer commitment to apply international standards of physical protection commitment to iaea safety standards the nsg also discussed including more subjective criteria in decision to supply state with fuel cycle technology such as general conditions of stability and security potential negative impact on the stability and security of the recipient state and whether there is credible and coherent rationale for pursuing enrichment and reprocessing capability for civil nuclear power purposes consensus has yet been reached on how to define these criteria and number of questions remain for example it is clear from these requirements that states outside the npt such as india pakistan and israel would be prohibited from reprocessing and enrichment cooperation with nsg members which may account for us rejection of the approach to add further complications the nuclear cooperation agreement socalled 123 agreement between the us and india signed in july 2007 provides consent in principle for india to reprocess us spent fuel and agreement in principle to transfer enrichment and reprocessingrelated technology to india pursuant to an amendment to the agreement these two details suggest that india is reprocessing technology holder despite not having its reprocessing facilities under comprehensive iaea safeguards and call into question criteria for distinguishing between states that should receive assistance and those that should not particularly since india is neither party to the npt nor an nsg member the united states had objected to the criteriabased approach favoring moratorium until spring 2008 the united states reportedly would be in favor of establishing criteria if it included requirement that uranium enrichment be exported only through black box arrangement canada objects to this and negotiations are still underway60 in summary president bushs proposal as put forth in 2004 faces significant challenges in implementation given the prevailing views against restrictions and the lack of consensus within the nsg on how to proceed

he noted that future system should achieve full parity among all states under new security structure that does not depend on nuclear weapons or nuclear deterrence iaea experts groupinfcirc640 in

nonproliferation criteria are met 3 physical leu material reserve65 the report emphasizes that participation in these arrangements should be voluntary that progress on this question will be incremental and that many options should be explored to give consumer states sufficient choices to meet their needs the report is still under discussion by iaea board members putin initiative in

multitiered backup mechanism to ensure the supply of low enriched uranium leu for nuclear fuel the proposal would work as follows 1 commercial supply relationship is interrupted for reasons other than nonproliferation 2 the recipient or supplier state can approach the iaea to request backup supply 3 the iaea would rule out commercial or technical reasons for interruption to avoid market disruption and assess whether the recipient meets the following qualifications it must have comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol in force it must adhere to international nuclear safety and physical protection standards and it is not pursuing sensitive fuel cycle activities which are not defined 4 the iaea would facilitate new arrangements with alternative suppliers two mechanisms were proposed to create multiple tiers of assurances including standard backup provision in commercial contracts and establishing reserves of leu not necessarily held by the iaea but possibly with rights regarding the use of the reserves the six country concept specifically mentioned the 17 tons of us heu declared in september 2006 to be excess to defense needs which would be converted to leu and held in reserve to support fuel supply assurances74 according to us ambassador gregory schulte any such reserve in the united states would be kept under national control75 stringent us requirements on usorigin material pursuant to the 1954 atomic energy act as amended may limit the attractiveness of that material for some states such requirements include safeguards in perpetuity prior consent for enrichment and reprocessing and the right of return should non nuclear weapon state detonate nuclear explosive device76 the six country concept addressed several future options all of which are longer

introduced on march 22 2007 and referred to the senate committee on finance the house hr 1585 and senate versions s 1547 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2008 both authorized 50 million to be appropriated to the department of energy for the international atomic energy agency nuclear fuel bank the conference report supports the establishment of fuel bank and notes that additional work will be required in order to provide appropriate guidance to the executive branch regarding criteria for access by foreign countries to any fuel bank established at the iaea with materials or funds provided by the united states83 both the house hr2641 and senate s 1751 energy and water appropriations acts recommended that funds be made available for an international nuclear fuel bank under the iaea and make available 100 million and 50 million respectively the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 which became pl 110161 on december 26 2007 provided that 50 million should be available until expended for the contribution of the united states to create lowenriched uranium stockpile for an international nuclear fuel bank supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful means under the international atomic energy agency on august 4 2008 the us secretary of energy issued an official letter to the iaea donating nearly 50 million to the international nuclear fuel bank84 this

of september 2009 to reach the funding goal of 150 million world nuclear association in may 2006 the privatesector world nuclear association wna working group on security of the international nuclear fuel cycle outlined proposals for assuring frontend and backend nuclear fuel supplies88 like the six country concept the wna proposal envisions system of supply assurances that starts first with normal market procedures attempting to reestablish nuclear fuel supply after interruptions also similar to the sixparty proposal preestablished network of suppliers could be triggered through the iaea if supply were interrupted for political reasons if that network then failed stocks held by national governments could be used the first tier of assurances therefore is through commercial suppliers the second level of supply commitment would use standard backup supply clause in enrichment contracts supported by governments and the iaea to ensure that single enricher is unfairly burdened with the responsibility of providing backup supply the other remaining enrichers would then supply the contracted enrichment in equal shares under terms agreed between the iaea and the enrichers according to the proposal for fuel fabrication backup supply system would be more complicated according to the wna report because fuel design is specific to each reactor design an effective mechanism would require stockpiling of different fuel typesdesigns the cost of such mechanism could thus be substantial according to the report however wna noted that unlike uranium enrichment technology uranium fuel fabrication is not of proliferation concern the wna report also noted the need for backend nuclear fuel cycle supply assurances to prevent future scenario in which reprocessing technologies spread as nuclear power programs expand the report recommends that clear option to reprocess spent fuel at affordable prices is offered to states that do not have indigenous reprocessing programs such assurances would be part of longerterm approach other proposals japan presented complementary proposal to the six country concept at the iaea in september 2006 japans concerns with the six country concept centered on the implication that it would deny the right for states to use nuclear technology for commercial purposes and because it assured the supply only of leu rather than all 87 uae

services japan proposed instead to create an iaea standby arrangements system that would act as an early warning system to prevent break in supply to recipients with list of supply capacities from each state updated annually and virtual bank of frontend fuel cycle services from natural uranium to fuel fabrication the iaea would facilitate supply to recipient states before supply was completely stopped states determined by the iaea board of governors to be in good nonproliferation standing by the iaea could participate germany proposed in may 2007 that new enrichment facility be built and placed under iaea ownership in extraterritorial area89 an independent management board or consortium would finance and run the plant on commercial basis but the iaea would decide whether to supply enriched fuel according to nonproliferation criteria germany argues that this approach is advantageous since it does not prohibit uranium enrichment but does provide commercially viable politically neutral option for fuel supply and could create competition on the world market by creating new fuel service provider with an economically viable option on neutral ground it will be harder for states to justify starting their own enrichment program for commercial reasons the united kingdom has proposed that enrichment bonds be created that would give advance assurance of export approvals for nuclear fuel to recipient states the bonds would be an agreement between supplier state or states the recipient state and the iaea in which the supplier government would guarantee that subject to the iaeas determination that the recipient was in good nonproliferation standing national enrichment providers will be given the necessary export approvals to supply the recipient states it is transparent legal mechanism designed to give further credible assurance of supply with prior consent to export arrangement the iaea would make the final decision on whether conditions had been met to allow the export of leu90 global nuclear energy partnership in february 2006 us secretary of energy bodman announced the global nuclear energy partnership gnep drawing together two of the bush administrations

planned yucca mountain nv repository awaiting future reprocessing and recycling reprocessing facilities would use new technologies developed by afci to avoid separation of pure plutonium that could be used for weapons however there is some controversy over how proliferationresistant such processes might be high level waste from reprocessing mostly fission products would go to the yucca mountain repository and the recycled plutonium and uranium would be fabricated into fuel for an advanced burner reactor fast reactor to be developed by does generation iv nuclear energy systems initiative in the longer term plutonium and other transuranics in spent fuel would be fabricated into new fuel for future fast reactors eventually that fuel would be continually recycled until all the transuranics are consumed leaving the fission products to be disposed of in geologic repository the international component of gnep envisions consortium of nations with advanced nuclear technology that would provide fuel services and reactors to countries that refrain from fuel cycle activities such as enrichment and reprocessing it is essentially fuel leasing approach wherein the supplier takes responsibility for the final disposition of the spent fuel this could mean taking back the spent fuel but might also mean according to doe that the supplier would retain the responsibility to ensure that the material is secured safeguarded and disposed of in manner that meets shared nonproliferation policies91 while this describes the responsibility of the supplier the vagueness of the language suggests that any number of solutions including onsite storage could be the outcome gnep envisions system whereby supplier states take back spent fuel but many nations lack the political will to do so skeptics have raised the question of whether the technology used in gnep will be net gain for nonproliferation efforts since the united states does not reprocess or reuse plutonium now in their view the proliferationresistance of technologies under consideration must be assessed against the status quo in the united states which is disposal of sealed intact fuel rods in geologic repository much of the afcis research is focusing on separations technology called urex in which uranium and other elements are chemically removed from dissolved spent fuel leaving mixture of plutonium and other highly radioactive elements proponents believe urex is proliferationresistant because further purification would be required to make the plutonium useable for weapons and because its high radioactivity would make it difficult to divert or work with in contrast conventional reprocessing using the purex process can produce weapons useable plutonium however critics see the potential nonproliferation benefits of urex over purex as minimal richard garwin suggested in testimony to congress in 2006 that urex fuel fails the proliferationresistance test since it contains 90 plutonium it could be far more attractive to divert than current spent fuel which 91 doe global nuclear energy partnership home page at httpwwwgnepenergygov crs32 contains 1 plutonium in other words terrorist would only have to reprocess 11 kg of urex fuel to obtain roughly 10 kg of plutonium in contrast to reprocessing 1000 kg of highly radioactive spent fuel to get the same amount from light water reactor fuel92 another nonproliferationrelated concern about gnep is how its implementation will affect global stockpiles of separated plutonium frank von hippel points to costly failed plutonium recycling programs in the uk russia and japan where separated plutonium stocks have accumulated to 250 tons enough for 30000 nuclear warheads in von hippels view gnep would exchange the safer onsite spent fuel storage at reactors for central storage of separated transuranics and highlevel waste cost ten times more and increase the global plutonium stockpile93 separate set of questions focuses on how effective gnep will be in achieving its goals as the only proposal currently that offers incentives for the backend of the fuel cycle it may hold more promise of attracting states to participate in the fuel supply assurances part of the framework however backend fuel cycle assurances will require significant changes in policies and laws as well as efforts to commercialize technologies further it is far from clear that all suppliers will be able to offer the full range of fuel cycle assurances raising the question of the relative competitiveness of suppliers these critics do not argue that the overall vision of gnep is misplaced but instead are skeptical that its vision can be achieved particularly in the timeframe proposed gnep itself marks departure from us policy of not encouraging the use of plutonium in civil nuclear fuel cycles supporters suggest that the us policy developed in the late 1970s did not envision recycling process that would not separate pure plutonium and therefore question the underlying assumptions of that longstanding policy critics of gnep have suggested that even though many nations did not agree with the united states in the 1970s on the dangers of having stockpiles of separated plutonium the message that the united states conveyed was that reprocessing was unnecessary to reap the benefits of nuclear power and that gnep conveys the opposite message now moreover some critics point to the accumulation since the 1970s of separated plutonium as particular threat given the potential for terrorist interest in acquiring nuclear material an october 2007 study published by the national academies of science recommended that research and development activities for new reprocessing plants continue but be scaled back with more time and peer review before commercial plants are built it strongly criticized does timeline for the program saying that achieving gneps goals are too early in development to justify does accelerated 92 richard garwin rd

attracted some international interest at least among potential supplier states officials from china france japan russia and the united states met in washington dc on may 21 2007 to discuss gnep and its goals according to joint statement issued after the meeting the participants believe in order to implement the gnep without prejudice to other corresponding initiatives number of near and longterm technical challenges must be met they include development of advanced more proliferation resistant fuel cycle approaches and reactor technologies that will preserve existing international market regulations in formal presentation of gnep principles made september 16 2007 in vienna austria participation was opened to all nations on voluntary basis that agree to internationally accepted standards for safe peaceful and secure nuclear fuel cycle95 sixteen countries joined the united states in signing the statement of principles for gnep in september 2007 and italy canada and the republic of korea have joined the partnership since then96 the principles call for safe expansion of nuclear energy enhanced nuclear safeguards international supply frameworks and development of fast reactors more proliferation resistant nuclear power reactors and spent fuel recycling technologies in facilities that do not separate pure plutonium they did not call upon states to renounce or refrain from indigenous development of enrichment or reprocessing technologies but emphasized the goal of creating viable alternative to acquisition of sensitive fuel cycle technologies it further emphasized that participants would not be giving up any rights to benefit from peaceful nuclear energy it may be difficult for the united states and others to define which states are suppliers and which are recipients informally us policy currently recognizes 10 states as having enrichment capability the five nuclear weapon states us uk france china russia plus japan argentina brazil the netherlands and germany while argentina has plant pilcaniyeu under safeguards this plant has never operated commercially and it is doubtful that it will be costeffective since it uses outdated gaseous diffusion technology brazils centrifuge enrichment plant at resende is still in the early stages of commissioning and wont produce at commercial scale for several years states such as australia canada

110161 congress provided 181 million out of 395 million requested by the administration of this amount 151 million is for research development and design activities with funds for constructing facilities for technology demonstration or commercialization97 the additional 30 million is for upgrades to existing facilities the administration had proposed that technology demonstration facilities be built and begin operating in the period fy2008fy2020 in its press release the house energy and water appropriations committee said that the budget cuts were made because it is unnecessary to rush into plan that continues to raise concerns among scientists and has only weak support from industry given that there are reasonable options available for short term storage of nuclear waste and that this project will cost tens of billions of dollars and last for decades98 the senate report on energy and water appropriations similarly cautioned that the policy of reinitiating the recycling of spent nuclear fuel in the united states is significant issue and one that has international implications the committee believes the administration must come forward with greater scientific technical and policy information that examines more alternatives in the fuel cycle and recycling process the administration is directed to limit the fy2008 work scope to research and development and technology demonstrations at existing facilities funds may be used beyond conceptual design of new facilities or the sodium cooled fast burner reactor99 the house appropriations committee recommended cutting afci to 900 million in fy2009 eliminating all funding for gnep the remaining funds would be used for research on advanced fuel cycle technology but none could be used for design or construction of new facilities the committee urged doe to continue coordinating its fuel cycle research with other countries that already have spent fuel recycling capability but not with countries aspiring to have nuclear capabilities the senate appropriations committee recommended 2297 million for afci for fy2009 focusing on advanced fuel separation and fuel fabrication without specifically mentioning gnep

31 3 crs39 prospects for implementing fuel assurance mechanisms proposals to provide an international and institutional framework for peaceful nuclear activities have abounded since the 1940s but few have been implemented the ussponsored baruch plan introduced at the united nations in 1946 recommended establishing an international agency with managerial control or ownership of all atomic energy activities the international atomic energy agency established in 1957 emerged as paler version of what was suggested in the baruch plan but still retains authorities in its statute to store fissile material concern about proliferation led to flurry of proposals in the 1970s and 1980s as the united states and others convened groups to study the issues101 one idea studied in the mid1970s was regional nuclear fuel cycle centers focused on reprocessing technologies several factors contributed to its lack of success despite support by the us congress low uranium prices making plutonium recovery relatively unattractive slump in the nuclear industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s and us opposition to reprocessing from the late 1970s member states of the iaea also convened the international fuel cycle evaluation project which involved 60 countries and international organizations infce working group reports suggested establishing multitiered assurance of supply mechanism similar to the one proposed by the six country concept in 2006 states also studied international plutonium storage in the late 1970s and early 1980s but could not agree on how to define excess material or the requirements for releasing materials as in the past the success of current proposals may depend on whether nuclear energy is truly revived not just in the united states but globally that revival will likely depend on significant support for nuclear energy in the form of policy price supports and incentives factors that may help improve the position of nuclear energy against alternative sources of electricity include higher prices for other sources natural gas and coal through carbon tax improved reactor designs to reduce capital costs regulatory improvements and waste disposal solutions the willingness of fuel recipient states to participate in international enrichment centers rather than develop indigenous enrichment capabilities and confidence in fuel supply assurance mechanisms such as an international fuel bank will largely determine the success of the overall policy goal to prevent further spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies so far proposals addressing this challenge have originated in the supplier states with many recipient states continuing to voice concern that their right to peaceful nuclear energy technology under the npt is in jeopardy increasingly however participation is being presented as market based decision by country not to at least for the present develop their own fuel enrichment program 101 for an analysis of these past proposals see lawrence scheinman equal opportunity historical challenges and future prospects of the nuclear fuel cycle arms control today may 2007 crs40 another factor that will shape the success of these proposals is the possible addition of other incentives simply making nuclear energy costeffective may not induce countries to forgo indigenous enrichment and reprocessing such decisions may require other incentives perhaps even outside the nuclear realm to make them palatable the experience of iran may be instructive here russias offer to provide assured enrichment services on russian soil has gone nowhere instead other broader trade incentives may be necessary while the case of iran may illustrate the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of country determined to develop capability for weapons program nonnuclear weapon states will clearly take notice of how solution develops for iran issues for congress congress would have considerable role in at least four areas of oversight related to fuel cycle proposals the first is providing funding and oversight of us domestic programs related to expanding nuclear energy in the united states key among these programs are gnep the advanced fuel cycle initiative other nuclear research and development programs and federal incentives for building new commercial reactors102 the second area is policy direction andor funding for international measures to assure supply what guarantees should the united states insist on in exchange for helping provide fuel assurances hr 885 contains nonproliferation requirements for states participating in an iaea fuel bank yet the nti fuel bank and other proposals do not although the six country concept contains an option for fuel bank it would not require participants to forswear enrichment and reprocessing third set of policy issues may arise in the context of implementing the international component of gnep as referenced above in the original policy documents gnep participant states would agree to refrain from fuel cycle initiatives however in its most recent ministerial meeting this language was longer used and participation was opened to all this is most likely meant to increase participation in the initiative by emphasizing that gnep is not asking state to give up rights to peaceful nuclear technology some observers believe that further restrictions on nonnuclear weapon states party to the npt are untenable in the absence of substantial disarmament commitments by nuclear weapon states in particular january 4 2007 wall street journal oped by george schultz bill perry henry kissinger and sam nunn entitled world free of nuclear weapons noted that nonnuclear weapon states have grown increasingly skeptical of the sincerity of nuclear weapon states in this regard some observers have asserted that nonnuclear weapon states will not tolerate limits on npt article iv rights right to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy without progress under article vi of the npt disarmament amending the npt is seen by most observers as unattainable 102 see crs report rl33558 nuclear energy policy by mark holt crs41 the iaea experts group report infcirc640 did point to the political usefulness of achieving ban on producing fissile material for nuclear weapons known as fissile material production cutoff treaty or fmct to provide more balance between the obligations of nuclear and nonnuclear weapon states although the united states tabled draft fmct in may 2006 at the conference on disarmament in geneva negotiations await resolution of agenda issues that have plagued that body for over decade further some see the us position that such treaty is inherently unverifiable as particular stumbling block103 ultimately any such treaty would require senate advice and consent to ratification fourth area in which congress plays key role would be in the approval of nuclear cooperation agreements two such agreements have been negotiated but not yet approved by congress one with india and one with russia the extent to which india is granted certain privileges eg prior consent for reprocessing usorigin material may influence how congress votes on the socalled section 123 agreement after the relevant portion of the us atomic energy act with india such an agreement is required by the atomic energy act before any significant nuclear equipment or material can be exported the state department released the details of the proposed agreement july 27 2007 contending that it meets all statutory requirements104 controversy in the indian parliament over the agreement has put it on hold as of midoctober 2007 presidents bush and putin announced that they had initialed the negotiated agreement in july 3 2007105 prior to 2006 when president bush and putin announced their intention to negotiate 123 agreement russias nuclear commerce with iran presented the chief obstacle to such cooperation several factors may have contributed to us officials delinking peaceful nuclear cooperation with russia from russian behavior on iran tougher line by moscow since 2003 with respect to iran and negotiation of spent fuel take back for the russianbuilt bushehr reactor as condition of fuel supply president bushs embrace of nuclear power as an alternative to reliance on hydrocarbons and dirty energy sources president bushs proposals to multilateralize the nuclear fuel cycle and develop proliferationresistant technologies through gnep and russias proposals to act as an international fuel center by storing and reprocessing spent fuel
