6110c26 shspec72 security checking auditing errors all the heretics the catholic church has had trouble with were produced by the mechanism of incomplete confessions this is poetic justice since the church buried most of the earlier knowledge that had been around so sec check the very thing which is supposed to prevent dissension upsets and slowed cases if badly done restimulates heresy of some sort which eventually brings about an overthrow of the group sooner or later the cycle is that this overt not being pulled but restimulated causes the pc to lessen it by running down the target of the overt this is new overt which then makes him also run down the group that failed to pull the withhold if you fail to pull the withhold you will get the effect of the succeeding overts as the pc makes nothing of the people who might find out this is part of lessening the missed overt it also serves to make it such that one would ever believe those people if the overt ever does come out the amazing thing is that the withhold as its pulled transmutes from smoking volcano before it is pulled to limp dead fish as its gotten off so if you start to release it but dont carry through youve left the pc with live head of steam which will frequently explode the way to have accidents with dangerous object is to know its dangerous and not know how to handle it weve tended to tell students that you cant do anything wrong with auditing in order to inspire confidence and to degree its true but now that we have accomplished speedup of getting rid of the basic core of reactivity weve paid for it with loss of the safety mechanisms of older processes like conceptual processes objectives etc now we have to run things that make people pretty uncomfortable when it is done wrong this is not permanent but it can be quite uncomfortable at the time part of the trouble too is that the auditor can be looking very pleasant doing his best though he has make gaes so that the pc when he finds himself looking awful blames himself for it and feels it couldnt be the auditors fault when in fact it is his fault the common denominator of gaes is some degree of auditing done where there have been errors it is mostly incomprehension of auditing directions examples are leaving withhold question unflat doing wrong assessment or using wrong assessment running prehav level until the ta is moving and leaving it failing to continue to sec check pc as his case advances
