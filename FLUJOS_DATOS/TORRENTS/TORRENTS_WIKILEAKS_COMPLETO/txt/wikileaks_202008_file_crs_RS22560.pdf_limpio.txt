court ordered the federal emergency management agency fema to provide evacuees more detailed explanations for nying them longer term housing assistance benefits under 408 of the stafford act3 the court found that femas notice procedures in denying longterm housing be nefits under 408 did not comport with the due process clause of the constitution4 the court also directed fema to resume providing shortterm housing assistance bene fits to all the evacuees who were found ineligible for the longterm housing benefits until the evacuees receive the more detailed explanations and have had

hout adequate shelter14 pursuant to presidential disaster declaration15 fema determined that the evacu ees from hurricanes katrina and rita qualified for shortterm housing rental ssistance under 403 of the stafford act16 approximately six months later in fe bruary of 2006 fema began the process of transferring eligible evacuees to its longer term housing program under 40817 which provides up to eighteen months of housing assistance to disaster evacuees to r eceive longerterm housing assistance however i ndividuals must apply and meet certain statutory and regula tory requirements18 in march of 2006 fema notified thousands of evacuees by letter that they were ineligible to receive longterm housing benefits and after several extensions fema stopped providing shortterm housing assistance to the majority of those evacuees deemed ineligible for continuing benefits19 this action prompted acorn on behalf of its affected members to file for temporary restraining order that would prevent fema from ter minating the temporar housing benefits as planned20 acorn was joined in its suit by individual plaintiffs thereafter the us district court for the district of columbia denied pl aintiffs request for temporary restraining order but converted it into motion for preliminary injunction which was the issue before the court21 district court decision the district court in granting the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction found that femas pr ocedures for notifying evacuees of the denial of longterm housing assistan ce were constitutiona lly inadequate22 in its opinion the court began by addressing femas procedural challenges to the lawsuit first fema claimed that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims because the stafford act and administrative procedure act provide that actions taken within the discretion of federal agencies are not reviewable in court23 the court reasonedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22560crs4 24 memorandum opinion at 7 25 id at 8 26 id 27 id at 9 the court discussed the organization s creation of katrina survivors association to counsel individual survivors about emergency housing options among other activities as evidence of housing being an important issue to acorn 28 id at 10 29 katz v georgetown univ 246 f3d 685 687688 dc cir 2001 in order to prevail plaintiffs must demonstrate substantial like lihood of success on the merits that they would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties and th at the public interest would be furthered by the injunction 30 memorandum opinion at 11 31 see eg board of regents v roth 408 us 564 577 1972 32 memorandum opinion at 12that these provisions were inapplicable in this case because the plaintiffs were challenging femas notice of ineligibility and not the reasons for the ineligibility decisions24 next the court addressed fe mas contention that acorn lacked standing to sue on behalf of its members25 fema claimed that acor n lacked standing on the grounds that the due process claims asserted by acorn must be litigated by each individual applicant and that the claims related to housing benefits were not germane to acorns purpose26 the court determined that acorn met all of the elements for associational standing including the requirement that th issues in the case be germane to the organizations mission27 as to femas assertion that due process claims need to be litigated on an individual basis the court reiterated its view that the suit raised questions regarding the constitutionality of femas notice procedures in general as opposed to the individual eligibility for benefits of specific claimants28 furthermore the court explained that individual participati on is not normally required when an association seeks prospective or injunctive relief for its members in assessing the plaintiffs request for preliminary injunctive re lief the court found that the plaintiffs satisfied the requirements of fourpar t test enunciated by the dc circuit court of appeals in katz v georgetown university 29 the court focused its analysis on the requirement th at the plaintiffs must blish likelihood for success on the merits to succeed on the merits the pl aintiffs needed to show that the evacuees possessed property interest in the housing be nefits they had been receiving and that femas termination and denial letters did not provide constitutionally adequate notice of the reasons for its decisions or an opportunity for meaningful appeal30 the court discussed the principle that an individuals legitimate claim of entitlement to government benefit can create constitutionally protected interest in the benefit31 here the court determined that the temporary housing assistan ce benefits fema provides without consideration of who w ill ultimately be elig ible for the longterm benefits creates such constitutionally protected interest32 the court reasoned that since all individuals receiving shortterm housing assistance are eligible to apply for longterm housinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22560crs5 33 id 34 the court drew these factors for the evaluati on of due process from matthews v eldridge 424 us 319 335 1976 35 memorandum opinion at 13 36 id 37 id at 15 38 id at 14 39 id at 16 40 notice of appeal at 1 41 defendants motion for st ay pending appeal at 1 42 substitution order at 1benefits then all of the evacuees before th court possessed the sa procedural rights in the application process33 in evaluating the constitutional adequacy of femas notice to evacuees the court looked at several factors34 the court discussed the importa nce of the plaintiffs private interest in continued housing assistance the probability of erroneous deprivation of that interest under the procedures used and the governments ab ility to provide additional or substitute procedural requirements35 in looking at the private interest at stake the court held that the plaintiffs interest in tinued housing assistance was of fundamentally important nature36 moreover the court found that this interest had been protected inadequately citing femas ad mittedly erroneous denial of benefits under its procedures in other instances37 regarding the opportunity for meaningful appeal the court found that the codes and phrases used in the denial letters were cryptic and that the explanatory guide accompanying the letters was vague and nonspecific38 the court also rejected femas contention that its extensive appeals process mitigates any lack of adequate individual notice the court reasoned that the vague explanations for femas decisions lead claimants to great deal of conjecture that reduces the meaningfulness of any appeal furthermore the court determined that fema failed to demonstrate that more detailed explanation of the denials would present an increased burden and cost outweighing the private interest of evacuees facing eviction39 substitution order following the november 29 opinion fema appealed the district courts ruling on december 540 and also filed motion for stay pending appeal of the district courts order41 subsequently the court found that the relief it had ordered had been misinterpreted and mischaracterized in pleadings to it and the court of appeals42 accordingly the court issued substitution order on december 12 2006 that reiterated what relief was due namely provision to plaintiffs of more detailed explanations for denials of 408 assistance including the f actual and statutory bases for denial and more fulsome instructions for curing ineligibility or proceeding with an appeal immediate restoration of 403 benefits with those benefits to continue until affected evacuees receive more detailed explanations and have time to pursue an appeal and payment to plaintiffs of the amount of 403 assistance they would have otherwisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22560crs6 43 id at 12 44 defendants motion for st ay pending appeal at 12 45 id resuming 403 assistance requires cooperati on at the state and local level because 403 assistance is not directly provided to disaster victims instead 403 assistance was administered through public assistance grants to states see eg 44 cfr 206202 46 see eg sheltering and housing katrina

courts order fema also stated that it was working on preparing more easily understandable letters for evacuees at the same time fema had appealed the denial of its motion for stay to the court of

emergency management agency fema civ il case 065403 at 1 dc cir dec 22 2006 the court of appeals explained that the be nefits had already terminated as of aug 31 2006 or lapsed after the district court denied th initial motion for temporary restraining order 48 idat 1 in the order the court established briefing schedule that set march 7 2007 as the receipt date for the appellants reply briefreceived from september 1 2006 through november 30 200643 in its motion for stay pending appeal fema argued that reinst ating 403 assistance to the evacuees deemed ineligible for 408 assistance would be an extraordinarily difficult if not impossible task44 according to fema the difficulty ar ises because reinstating 403 benefits involves the cooperation of both state and local governments in order to provide housing assistance45 in responding to hurricane katrin fema created the 403 apartment program and administered the program thr ough municipal governments under this program fema reimbursed states that entered into lease agreements for apartments to be used as shelter for evacuees46 on december 22 2006 the court of appeals granted femas emergency motion for stay pending appeal of the district courts order requiring fema to immediately restore 403 housing assistance benefits and pay housing assistance benefits that the affected evacuees otherwise would have received from september 1 2006 through november 30 200647 however the court of appeal s denied femas motion for stay pending appeal regarding the district cour ts order directing fema to provide more detailed explanations for the denials of 408 benefits and instructions on how to proceed with an appeal to the affected evacuees and the court of appeals also ordered that the appeals be expedited48
