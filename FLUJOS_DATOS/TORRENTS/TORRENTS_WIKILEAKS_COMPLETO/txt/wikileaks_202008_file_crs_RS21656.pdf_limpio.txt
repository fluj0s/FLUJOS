blind trusts by federal officials jack maskell legislative attorney american law division summary blind trust as discussed in this report is device employed by federal official to hold administer and manage the private fi nancial assets investments and ownerships of the official and his or her spouse and dependant children as method of conflict of interest avoidance in establishing qualified blind trust upon the approval of the appropriate supervisory ethics entity the offi cial transfers without restriction control and management of private ssets to an independent tr ustee who may not communicate information about the identity of the holdings in the trust to the official the trust is considered blind because eventually throug h the sale of transferred assets and the purchase of new ones the public officer w ill be shielded from knowledge of the identity of the specific assets in the trust without such knowledge conflic t of interest issues would be avoided because pa rticular asset in the trust could act as an influence upon the official duties that the offi cer performs for the government this report provides brief di scussion of the use of blind trusts by federal officials in the context of conflict of interest regulation nd avoidance initially it should be noted that there is federal statute which expressly require s that particular federal officials place assets into blind trust upon ente ring public service with the federal government rather the use of blind trus t is one of several methods of conflict of interest avoidan ce under federal law and regulation there are now uniform statutory requirements for the establishment and maintena nce of blind trusts and federal officials who are to use such devices either voluntarily or as remedial measure for identified conflicts of interest must receive from their supervisory ethics office prior approval of the proposed trustee and the trust instrument to qualify the blind trust for ethics purposes background conflicts of interest disclosure and disqualification the body of federal law and regulation concerning conflic ts of interest and the private assets and investments of federal officials is generally directed at the concern as expressed by the supreme court that an impairment of impartial judgment can occur in even the most wellmeaning men when their personal economic interests are affected byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21656crs2 1 united states v mississi ppi valley generating co 364 us 520 549 1960 2 hrept 87748 87th congress 1s t session at 3 1961 on revised

and recommendations of officers of th government be made in the public interest and not be tainted even unintentionally with influence from private or personal fina ncial interests3 it is assumed of course that persons in or entering into government service will own and possess financial assets instruments and property to somewhat similar extent as those comparably situated in the general populati on federal officers and employees are not however expected to divest themselves of all their worldly goods to avoid conflicts of interest rather with respect to federal fficials personal ownershi p of assets financial instruments and incomeproduc ing property the principal thods of conflic t of interest regulation under federal law are di squalification nd disclosure disqualification the principal federal conflict of interest law provides that an official who administers federal law shoul d not take any official action on or make recommendations concerning any particular governmental matter in which that official or one closely associated with the official has personal financial interest4 that is federal officials in the executive branch of government other than the president or vice president5 must generally recuse or disqualify themselves from participating in any particular governmental matter in which they have financial interest or in which their spouse dependant children part ner or business with which they are associated has financial interest executive branch offi cials may also be re quired under regulations promulgated by the office of government et hics oge to recuse themselves from certain governmental matters affecting an even broader category of persons or entities with whom they have covered relationship6 disclosure to enforce conflict of interest provisions to deter the ownership of assets which may raise ethical problems and to provide public information and assurances concerning the ethical conduct of highlevel

ethics personnel to identify potential ethics and conf lict problems and to resolve any conflict of interest issues that may be raised by th ownership of certain assets by particular public official remedial action which may be required by ethics officials to resolve identified conflicts of interest with respect to certain assets may include divestiture establishment of qualified blind trust pr ocurement of conflict of interest waivers specific written recusal instruments and requests for voluntary transfer or reassignment10 although there is not general divestiture requirement for federa l officials entering government service11 the regulation of federal conflict of interest law in the executive branch provides that certain financial interests may as noted above necessitate some remedial measure including divestiture for the official to come into compliance with federal conflict of interest laws or regulations12 regulations issued by the office of government ethics indicate

instances the establishment of qualified blind trust may be used as conflict of interest avoidance device as an lternative to outright divestiture of particular assets or other measures in addition to regular reviews and possible remediations officials who are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate must file disclosure statement within five days of nomination the statement is to be reviewed and any remedial action proposed by ag ency or department et hics officials then reviewed and approved by the office of gove rnment ethics and then forwarded to the appropriate senate committee14 in the executive review process an ethics agreement may be entered into whereby the official to avoid conflicts issues with respect to particular assets agrees to cer tain remedial action including the transfer of assets to qualified blind trust instead of divestiture or specific disqualification agreements15 the senate committee initially reviewing such nomination or th senate as whole may also require from the nominee an agreement for the disposition of certain assets including their sale or transfer to blind trust as condition of favorable action on the nomination regardless of or in addition to any ex ecutive branch actions and agreements16 in addition to the establishment of bli nd trust as remedial measure for specific conflicts of interest blind trusts may also be created by officials on their own initiative to avoid potential conflict issues andor to ease reporting burdens blind trusts may be used by such government officials even when the disqualification re quirements of federal law do not apply to them such as for members of congress the president and the vice president if such trusts meet the require ments of qualif ied blind trusts

interests of th official for dis qualification purposes18 the conflict of interest theory under which the blind tr ust provisions operate is that since the government officer will not know the identity of the specific assets in the trust those financial interests c ould not act as influences on his or her official decisions thus avoiding real or apparent conflicts19 assets originally placed into the trust will of course be known to the official and therefor will generally continue to be financial interests of the public official for conflict of interest purposes until the trustee notifies the official that such asset has been di sposed of or has value of less than 100020 for blind trust to be effective as c onflict of interest voidance device the law recognizes that the official must be shield ed from knowledge and cont rol of the assets in the trust by making the trust truly blind and by assuring that the trustee is actually independent of and autonomous from direction or influence of the reporting official the statute therefore 1 requires the trustee to be an independent professional and not be associated or affiliated with the official or any interested party 2 requires assets to be placed in the trust with restrictions upon their sale or disposition at the discretion of the trustee 3 prohibits communications from the trustee to interested parties other than to notify when an original asset has been disposed of or becomes valued at less than 1000 and to give information on the overall va lue and income of the entire trust 4 prohibits interested
