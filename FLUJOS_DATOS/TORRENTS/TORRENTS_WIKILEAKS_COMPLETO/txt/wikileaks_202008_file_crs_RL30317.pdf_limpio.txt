capital gains taxes and who might benefit fr om reduction in these taxes these different approaches include absolute meas ures of distribution such as how the tax is distributed relative to the distribution of the population and the average tax paid relative measures of distribution whether aftertax incomes wo uld become more or less equal without the tax measures of the distribution of tax liability and measures of who pays the tax these measures are presented for 1999 and indicate that capital gains taxes are concentrated among high income individuals those with earnings over 200000 who constitute the top 18 percent of income account for 786 percent of capita l gains taxes while the average capital gains tax paid is 476 the average for th highest income class is 20536 and the average for the bottom half is less than 10 capital gains taxes contribute to progressive tax system while capital gains taxes average 13 percent of disposable income they account for 57 percent in the highest income bracket and less than one tenth of one percent for the bottom 70 percent of the population some of this concentration in higher income classes occurs because of th concentration of taxes at higher income levels however capital gains taxes are also concentr ated relative to other taxes the capital gains tax is 45 percent of tota l federal income payroll and excise taxes however it is 14 percent of total taxes in the highest income bracket and less than one half of one percent for the bottom 7 0 percent of the population for the income tax alone capital gains taxes are 8 1 percent of total income taxes but 162 percent of income taxes in the top incom class in the bottom 70 percent of the distribution the capital gains tax is less than one percent of income taxes about quarter of taxpayers who pay capital gains tax are in the bottom 70 percent of the distribution while 11 percent of capital gains taxpayers are in the top 18 percent of the population about 12 percent of all taxpayers pay capital gains tax in the highest income class 75 percent pay capital gains tax this report will not be updated unless new data become

already legislated lower tax rates fo r1 property held for five years that are not in effect yet if it did the overall magnitude of the tax would be smaller it also does not take account of corporate capital gains taxes the income measure used is an expanded income definition which is adjusted gros s2 income plus taxexempt interest employer contributions for health and life insurance employer share of the fica ta x workers compensation nontaxable social security benefits insurance value of medicare benefits ternative minimum tax preference items and excluded income of individua ls living abroad this definition is narrower than that used by treasury however the important point to focus on in understanding the meaning of the income classes is the share of the population in each class note that this distribution is slightly different from the distribution of capital gain s3 income because it is cor rected for the fact that some taxpayers have tax liability and also for the smaller tax rates for those in the 15 percent bracket capital gains taxes distributional effects many types of data have been presented to illustrate who p ays capital gains taxes and who might benefit fr om reduction in these taxes these different approaches include absolute meas ures of distribution such as how the tax is distributed relative to the distribution of the population and what the average tax is relative measures of distribution wheth er aftertax incomes would become more or less equal without the tax measures of the distribution of tax liability and measures of who pays th tax all of these measures are discussed below and all are based on 1999 incom levels and data provided by the joint committee on taxation data supporting the calculations are presented at the end of this discussion 1 measures of absolute burden table 1 provide s measure of absolute burden which shows that the burden is highly concentrated in the higher income cl asses those with incomes over 200000 constitute 18 percent of the population but account for 786 percent of the tax 2 those with i ncomes over 100000 constitute about 8 percent of the population but pay over 90 per cent of the tax by contrast the bottom third of the population and even the bottom lf pay virtually none of the tax although that is in part because larger fractions of individuals in lower income groups do not have income tax liability the middle third of taxpayers pay about 1 percent of the tax the average tax i s3 476 in the low er income and middle income classes tax cuts are under 10 while the tax cut in the highest income bracket is about 20000 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30317crs2 table 1 distribution of capital gains taxes across the population and the average tax 1999 income levels income class percent

joint committee on taxation data measures of relative burden and progressivity some argue that the analysis above is not very meaningful because income i s more concentrated at the higher income levels and any income tax is concentrate d among higher income individuals an alte rnative way to assess distribution is to look at the effect on the relative dis tribution of income and to ask whether the tax makes incomes more equal or less equal one can also use this approach to determin whether the provision makes the tax system less progressiv or more progressive the way to measure this type of effect is to compare the distribution of the tax with the distribution of aftertax income if both distributions are the same then the ta x benefit is distributionally neutral if higher income individuals pay larger share of the tax relative to their aftertax income the tax makes incomes less equal an d increases the progressivity of the tax system table 2 presen ts data on these measures of distribution which indicate that the capital gains taxes reduce income inequalit and increase progressivity for example those with incomes over 200000 receive 18 percent of aftertax income but pay 78 percent of the capital gains tax similarly those with incomes over 100000 wh receive third of the aftertax income pay 90 percent of the tax these differences are also reflected in the capital gains tax as percent of aftertax income at lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30317crs3 and moderate income levels the capital gains tax is less than tenth of percent of disposabl income at the highest income

in the form of refundable credit inevitably do not affect wer income individuals because they pay income taxes measures of distribution of tax cut are of ten presented in the form of percentage change in tax liability perhaps in part for this reason however changes in the distribution of tax liability do not really tell us anything about inequality of incomes for example proportional reduction in tax liability in progressive tax system makes afterta x income shares less equal and of course benefits higher income individuals more in an absolute sense thus it cannot be said to be distributionally neutral measure distributional ind exes of tax burdens have however been used for certain measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30317crs4 for discussion of progressivity indices see donald w kiefer distributional tax4 progressivity indices national tax journal vol 37 december 1984 pp 497514of progressivity although other and more common measures are based on th distribution of pre and posttax income 4 note that percent age changes can be very deceiving as measures of tax benefit for example taxpayer with tax liability f 10 who received reduction in tax of 5 would have 50 percent reduction in tax liability which is very large percentage yet it is not very meaningful tax cut indeed the percentage change in liability is undefined mathematically when taxes are zero and percentage changes approac h infinity when taxes approach zero in any case the fo llowing two tables show the distribution of the tax compared to the distribution of tax liability tab 3 refers to federal income

than is existing tax liability for example in table 3 th highest income class that pays 79 percent of the capital gains tax pays 25 percent of total taxes excluding the cor porate tax and pays 39 percent of the income tax the data on cap ital gains taxes as percentage of income payroll and excise tax liability also show that capital gains taxes are proportionally greater for high incom taxpayers capital gains are 4 5 percent of taxes overall but 14 percent of the taxes paid by those in the highes t income class for all other taxpayers capital gains taxes as share of total taxe s are less than the average similarly in table 4 in the case of the income tax the capital gains tax acco unts for 81 percent of overall income taxes the 162 percent of taxes in the highest income group for

research service calculations based on joint committee on taxation datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30317crs6 who pays the capital gains tax another measure that is sometimes used to assess the distributional effect of tax is to examine where the bulk of the population that pays any of the tax falls for almost any tax such measure will tend to report that more low and middle income taxpayers pay tax than high income ind ividuals simply because there are many more people who fall in the lower and middle income classes moreov er without measures of magnitude such measures are not very informative in determining burdens r benefits of reducing taxes nevertheless table 5 reports this type of measure i t does demonstrate one of the reasons that capital gains tax cuts benefit high income individuals using virtually any distributio nal measures only 12 percent of individuals pay capital gains taxes largely because many individuals d not have any income from capital gains and in the lower income brackets because of lack of tax liability s well however in the highest income bracket 75 percent of taxpayers pay capital gains taxes while in the next highest bracket 48 percent pay

gains in the ten years from 1979 1988 during the indivi dual years the share ranged from 59 percent to 91 percent although the latter number w as very atypical in five of the years the share was less than 65 percent in seven of the years it was less than 70 perc ent and for all but one years it was less than 80 percentthe third co lumn of table 5 shows the shares of individuals with capital gains tax by cumulating from the bottom for example 23 percent of those who pa capital gains taxes have incomes under 50000 and 47 percent of taxpayers who pay capital gains taxes have incomes under 75000 column 4 cumulates in the othe r direction for example it indicates that 767 percent of individuals who pay capital gains taxes have incomes above 50000 these numbers suggest that the capita l gains taxes are atypical in their concentration among higher income individuals limitations of distributional measures while these distributional measures provi picture of where the burden of the capital gains tax falls there are certain limitations to these measures one potential problem is the measure of income this measure of income is based on data take n from tax returns and it is not the exact equivalent of economic income since there are certain imputed and accrued income items including unrealized capital gains that are not included at the same time the tax asure differs from cash income as well these limitations of the data can be addressed in part however by focusing on the population shares represented by each income class problem specific to examining the capital gains t ax is the fact that capital gains can be realized in large and uneven amounts for example taxpayer may have sold large asset that yields large amount of gain thus some of the taxpayers who5 have large gains may be classified as having higher in come simply because of the gain recent study of capital gains during the 1980s suggests that while there is some tendency of annual snapshots to overstate the gain at high income levels it is typically not serious enough distortion in most years to alter th basic pattern of distribution6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30317crs8 appendix sources of data the following two
