eesa division of hr 1424 pl 110 343 established numerous reporting requirements regarding variety of issues and many of those reports have already been published the entities charged with preparation of these reports include both new entities established by the act eg the financial stability oversight board and the congressional oversight panel as well as agencies and officials who existed before the enactment of eesa eg the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller general of the united states the recipients of these reports also vary as well as their timing frequency and factors that trigger their development these differences notwithstanding all of the eesa reports appear to share common purposeto provide information to congress and other entities on the implementation of the acts provisions single entity receives all of the eesarequired re ports it is not readily apparent why some of the reports are to be sent to particular set of eight appropriate committees some to subset of those committees and some to congress as whole although one of the purposes of the legislation is to provide public accountability for the use of eesa authorities only one of the reports is required to be made to the public some of the reports are required to be submitted very quickly but other reports are not required for years some of the reporting requirements are recurring eg every 30 days or quarterly while others are onetime requirements most of the requirements include clear starting points for the submission of the reports but in some cases the starting points are unclear many of the acts reporting requirements seem to address the same or similar issues the number and variety of the required reports may have been intended to provide variety of perspectives on the implementation of eesa but the lack of integration of those requirements may make understanding the implementation of the act diffic ult also given the nature of the troubled assets currently being purchased under the act ie bank stock instead of mortgages or other instruments related to mortgages it is unclear whether some of the specific requirements are still relevant other information that is not specifically required by the act eg how the federal funds are being used by the recipients may be more helpful to congress and others as they conduct oversight of the program finally some of the reporting requirements expire on the date that the last troubled asset is sold or transferred or the date that the last insurance contract expires without some kind of lag period for these requirements complete history of the transactions may not be provided this report will be updated when new information becomes available

the financial crisis are and what is the departments strategy for addressing those causes what metrics can the department cite to show the effects of the 250 billion spent thus far what have financial institutions done with the taxpayer money received so far is the public receiving fair deal how is treasury deciding which institutions receive the money elizabeth warren the chairwoman of the cop was quoted as saying that the federal government did not appear to have coherent strategy for addressing the financial crisis 17 however one member of the cop representative jeb hensarling did not sign the report reportedly saying he could not do so until every panel member has the resources and rights necessary to conduct effective oversight and until the panel adopts serious agenda that truly

on december 30 2009 the department of the treasury responded to the 10 questions posed in the cops first report19 on january 9 2009 the cop issued its second report which included an analysis of the treasury response to its first report 20 the cop report concluded that the departments response did not provide complete answers to several of the questions and failed to address number of the questions at all21 for example the report indicated that the cop still does not know what the banks are doing with taxpayer money and noted that while eesa does not require reports on this issue from the recipients of tarp funds it is within treasurys authority to make such reports condition of receiving funding to establish benchmarks for tarp recipient conduct or to have formal procedures for voluntary reporting by tarp recipient institutions or formal guidelines on the use of funds 22 the cop also indicated that its third report would be issued on february 8 2009 and its fourth report would be issued on march 11 2009

the act also requires the cop to submit to congress special report on regulatory reform not later than january 20 2009 analyzing the current state of the regulatory system and its effectiveness at overseeing the participants in the financial system and protecting consumers the report is also required to provide recommendations for improvement including recommendations regarding whether any participants in the financial markets that are currently outside the regulatory system should become subject to the regulatory system the rationale underlying such recommendation and whether there are any gaps in existing consumer protections in relation to this reporting requirement the cop announced that it planned to hold january 14 2009 public hearing in washington dc on regulatory reform of the financial sector 23 the stated goal of the hearing is to achieve better understanding of current regulations and how the existing regulatory structure contributed to the ongoing financial and mortgage crises in order to determine what if any reforms are necessary

requirements indicates that those requirements are both numerous and varied the individuals and organizations tasked with submitting eesa reports include 1 the secretary of the treasury 2 the financial stability oversight board 3 the cop 4 the special inspector general for the tarp 5 the comptroller general 6 the director of omb and omb itself 7 the congressional budget office 8 federal property managers 9 the board of governors of the federal reserve system and 10 the securities and exchange commission in one case section 116b the reporting requirement is placed on program the troubled asset relief program rath er than an individual or an organization 38 the designated recipients of the reports are equally varied including the appropriate congressional committees defined as the senate committees on banking housing and urban affairs finance budget and appropriations and the house committees on financial services ways and means budget and appropriations subset of those appropriate committees eg in section 116b and section 117 only the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs and the house committee on financial services congress as whole the cop the special inspector general for the tarp the president and the public single entity receives all of the eesarequired reports also it is not readily apparent why some of the reports are filed with the set of ap propriate committees some to subset of those committees and some to congress as whole when reports are required to be submitted to the congress the parliamentarian in each house of congress on behalf of the speaker of the house and the presiding officer of the senate decides which officers and committees ultimately receive the reports 37 because eesa was enacted on october 3 2008 this report appears to be required by january 1 2009 38 in this case because the tarp is authorized to be established by the secretary of the treasury section 101a1 of the act the secretary or the office of financial stability th at is required to implement the program may actually carry out this requirement httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34740g20g142g153g152g155g157g146g151g144g561g20g142g154g158g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g7g150g142g155g144g142g151g140g162g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g21g157g138g139g146g149g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561g3g140g157g561g152g143g561g344g342g342g350g561

same or similar issues for example section 105a requires the secretary of the treasury to report to the appropriate committees within 60 days and every 30 days afterward on all actions taken by the secretary including all agreements transactions and insurance contracts section 105b requires the secretary to report to the same committees on the same transactions within seven days of each 50 billion in commitments to purchase troubled assets section 116 requires the comptroller general to oversee the activities of the tarp and report on his findings at least every 60 days which would presumably include tarprelated agreements transactions and insurance contracts section 121 requires the special inspector general to report every quarter on its audits of among other things all troubled assets purchased or sold under section 101 and the management of any insurance program under section 102 also section 105c of the act requires the secretary of the treasury to review the current state of the financial markets and the regulatory system and submit written report to the appropriate committees of congress not later than april 30 2009 that report is also required to provide recommendations regarding whether any participants in the financial markets that are currently outside the regulatory system should become subject to the regulatory system similarly section 125b2 requires the cop to submit special report on regulatory reform by january 20 2009 analyzing the current state of the regulatory system and its effectiveness at overseeing the participants in the financial system and protecting consumers the report is also required to provide recommendations for improvement including recommendations regarding whether any participants in the financial markets that are currently outside the regulatory system should become subject to the regulatory system the number and variety of the required reports may have been intended to provide variety of perspectives on the implementation of eesa but the lack of integration of those requirements may make understanding the implementation of the act difficult also given the nature of the troubled assets being purchased under the tarp ie bank stock instead of mortgages or other instruments related to mortgages it is unclear whether some of the reporting requirements are still relevant to the activities being carried out for example section 105a3 requires the secretary of the treasury to provide detailed financial statement with respect to the exercise of authority under this act including all agreements made or renewed b all insurance contracts entered into pursuant to section 102 c all transactions occurring during such period including the types of parties involved d the nature of the assets purchased all projected costs and liabilities f operating expenses including compensation for financial agents g the valuation or pricing method used for each trans action and h description of the vehicles established to exercise such authority the secretary of the treasury announced on november 12 that the department of the treasury longer plans to buy mortgagebased troubled assets and will instead aid banks and other firms that issue student auto and credit card loans in part by jumpstarting the market that provides financing for these companies 39 therefore some of these particular reporting requirements may longer be relevant or helpful as result some have called for congress to revisit eesa s reporting requirements40 39 peter whoriskey david cho and binyamin

may be more useful to congress and others as they oversee the implementation of the program for example several members of congress have expressed concerns that the funds being invested in banks are being used to pay dividends to stockholders purchase smaller ba nks or finance bonuses and other types of compensation for bank executivesnot to increase lending41 although some of the reporting requirements appear to be general enough to allow the reporting entities to include how the funds were used individual or organization is currently required to do so as the cops january 9 2009 report stated eesa does not require recipients of tarp funds to make reports on the use of funds however it is within treasurys authority to make such reports condition of receiving funding to establish benchmarks for tarp recipient conduct or to have formal procedures for voluntary reporting by tarp recipient institutions or formal guidelines on the use of funds the adoption of any one of these options would further the purposes of helping build and restore the confidence of taxpayers investors and policy makers 42 also although section 22d of eesa says one of the purposes of the legislation is to provide public accountability for the use of the acts authorities only one of the reports is required by eesa to be made to the public43 most if not all of the required reports have been made public so far but it is currently unclear whether and if so how the practice will continue one of the recommendations from conference on public accountability under eesa is that congress should make clear that any reports required to be made to congress under the eesa should also be made public unless specifically made confidential in the act or some portion is specifically designated by the reporting entity as being exempt from disclosure under foia44 some of the reports are required to be submitted to the recipients relatively quickly and some of the reporting deadlines have already occurred on the other hand some of the reports are not required for years for example section 134 of the act requires omb to submit report to the congress on the net amount within the troubled asset relief program under this act five years after the date that eesa was enacted ie on october 3 2013 some of the reporting requirements are recurring eg in section 125b1 which requires the cop to submit its regular reports every 30 days other reports however are only required to be submitted one time eg in section 125b2 which requires the cop to submit special report to congress by january 20 2009 most of the reporting requirements include clear starting or ending points for the submission of the reports eg those that are required within 30 days after the date that eesa was enacted or continued specifically he said the bill was primarily intended to pr ovide funds to buy up bad mortgagerelated securities and to help homeowners but it was quickly used to make the united states coowner of number of large and probably smaller banks for that and other reasons he said congress needs to take another hard look at its handiwork 41 see for example binyamin appelbaum banks to continue paying dividends bailout money is for lending critics say washington post october 30 2008 p a1 and charlene carter leading house democrats pressure treasury on banks use of federal funds congressnow october

however the starting points for the reporting deadlines are unclear for example section 104g requires the financial stability oversight board to submit reports not less frequently than quarterly but the act does not indicate when these reports are to begin similarly section 116a3 requires the comptroller general to report less frequently than once every 60 days but does not indicate when those reports are to begin finally some of the reporting requirements eg those placed on the secretary by section 105 expire on the date that the last troubled asset is sold or transferred or the date that the last insurance contract expires without some kind of lag period for the expiration of these reporting requirements eg 30 or 60 days after the last sale or transfer of troubled assets complete history of these transactions may not be provided to congress or the public
