isolated previously unknown type of co ronavirus which they believe is the cause of the disease the genetic material of the sars virus has been sequenced and this may be helpful in termining the origin of the vi rus and understanding its behavior as well as developing treatment and vaccine currently all tests for sars infection are considered experimental the world health organization who and others are working to devel op reliable diagnostic test wh ich can be used to confirm clinical diagnosis of sars federal state and local public health ag encies share responsibility for range of different activities that are important in effectivel reacting to and ultimately overcoming disease outbreak such as sars in investigating the sars outbreak the most important activities are case

new infectious disease that causes flulike symptoms which may progre ss to pneumonia the incubation period is 27 days but may be up to 10 days symptoms include fever malaise chills headache body ache coughing difficulty breathing and diarrh ea the disease course and recovery period may take as long as 3 weeks in 10 of sars cases the symptoms are severe and patients need mechanical assistance to breathe the more severe form of sars tends to occur in people over 40 years of age the world health organization who timates the overall case fatality rate is about 15 and over 50 in persons 65 years or older1 mortality is higher in people with underlying chronic disease hepatitis b diabetes hypertension heart di sease stroke or in those who sought treatment at late stage of sars sars was first recognized in viet nam in late february 2003 by who epidemiologist and on march 12 2003 who issued global alert on sars the new disease was later linked to an outbreak of respiratory disease that began in mid november 2002 in guangdong province china as of may 22 2003 total of 8046 sars cases and 682 deaths have been reported to who from 28 countries on 5 continents2 china hong kong and taiwan account for 93 of all reported cases and 91 of reported deaths in these areas public health experts are concerned that the disease has been spreading within the local community rather than just within hospitals or households indicating the proba bility of continued sars cases in the united states as of may 21 2003 the cent ers for disease control and prevention cdc has received reports from 40 states of 355 cases and sarsrelated deaths of the total 290 are suspect cases and 65 are probable cases3 in late march 2003 an intern ational team of scientis ts announced the isolation of previously unknown type of coronavirus which they believe is the cause of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31937crs2 4 coronaviruses were first isolated from chickens in 1937 the name derives from its crownlike appearance when viewed with the electron microscope this family of viruses are known to infect cattle pigs rodents cats dogs and birds coronaviruses are serious disease problem for agriculture especially chickens 5 dna or deoxyribonucleic acid differs from rna ribonucleic acid in the type of sugar group contained in the molecule while the here ditary material of all living things and many viruses is composed of dna some viruses have rna as the hereditary materialdisease4 experiments in monkeys conducted by dutch and u s scientists seem to confirm that coronavirus is the cause of sars however scien tists in canada and china believe coinfection w ith another agent chlamydia or metapneumovirus may also be involved scientists believe coinfection or some other factor like genetics or hygiene may explain why certain patients called superspreaders seem to be particularly infectious to those around them coronaviruses are known to cause serious respiratory and enteric disease in farm animals and pets slight genetic changes in the coronavirus greatly alter its lethality and the disease symptoms in animals in humans coronaviruses are thought to cause about 30 of common colds patients with sars shed virus in droplet s of respiratory secretions created while coughing or sneezing as well as in their stool and urine although most sars cases have occurred in people such as family members or healthcare workers who have had direct close contact with an infected person cluste r of over 300 cases occurred in residents of hong kong apartment comp lex where contaminated sewage is thought to have spread the disease like other human respiratory viruses the sars virus can survive 48 hours at room temperature and for longer periods at colder temperatures scientists in hong kong report that the sars virus can survive for 72 hours on environmental surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic the sars virus may be unique however in its ability to survive for up to 4 days in stool samples from patients with diarrhea although detergen ts are not effective at inactivating the sars virus standard disinfectants such as bleach and alcohol are effective the genetic material of the sars viru s is composed of rna rather than dna5 all rna viruses are inherently subject to high level of muta tions consequently the sars virus may change rapidly and evade drug treatments or vaccines on april 12 2003 researchers in vancouve r canada released genome sequence data for one sars virus isolate this was followed few days later by quence data from cdc several other labs have also sequenced additional sars virus isolates the labs are currently analyzing variations among the genome sequence data this information may be helpful in determining the origin of the virus as well as understanding its behavior the genome data might also help researchers develop treatments vaccine and diagnostic tests currently all tests for sars infection are considered experimental who and others are working to devel op reliable diagnostic test wh ich can be used to confirm clinical diagnosis of sars because identifying case of sars is diagnosis of exclusion until reliable sars laboratory st is available the accuracy of reported sars case numbers will rely on other laboratory tests to rule out alternative disease agents combined with clinical diag nosis of sars given the nonspecifichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31937crs3 6 dennis normile battling sars on the front lines science v 300 may 2 2003 pp 714 715symptoms of sars clinical diagnosis will not be as precise as laboratory test and will not include the expected much larg er number of mild sars cases all known respiratory viruses cause range of disease symptoms from mild to severe scientists have found some individuals who are infect ed with the sars virus yet have only minimal symptoms it is unknown if pa tient with mild sars can spread the disease to others an accurate diagnostic test will identify such mild cases to help prevent the spread of the disease as well as gain more accurate statistical picture on the extent of the sars outbreak if the sars case definition is expanded to include mild disease cases then the total number of sars cases will increase thereby lowering the case fatality rate currently estimated at 15 scientists must learn more about the sars disease process before they can identify what test antibody viral culture polymerase chain reaction pcr to use on which specimen throat or nasal swab blood stool urine for each stage of disease an antibody test may not become pos itive for more than 3 weeks after symptoms begin and not all patients mount an antibody response viral culture may not be positive at an early stage of disease or in all patient tissues the pcr test which indicates snippets of viral genome are present may remain positive long after disease symptoms have resolved b ecause defective noninfectious virus may continue to be present in the patient the media have reported on sars trea tment developed in hong kong that some credit with helping patients overcome the disease the treatment consists of ribavirin an antiviral agent and st eroids which act on the patients immune response however because laboratory sts of ribavirin against coronavirus found the drug to be ineffective some researchers speculate that these patients would get better even without treatment6 the issue is unlikely to be resolved until clinical trials are performed comparing various treatment regimens differences among countries in sars deaths and case fatality rates are most likely due to patient delay in seeking medical care but may also be due to more virulent virus or differences in how sars patients are treated differe nces in the number of sars cases among countries especially in health care personnel may reflect gaps or delays in imposing necessary infection contro l measures in hospitals because sars is new disease and not completely understood public health officials are very concerned about spread of the sars virus and the atypical pneumonia and influenzalike symptoms associated with the disease however because in most countries sars has not r eadily spread in the local community many experts conclude that the sars virus is not as contagious as the influenza virus in contrast past influenza epid emics have spread rapidly nd been much more deadly 1968 flu outbreak spread worldwide w ithin 8 weeks and caused 700000 deaths the 1918 influenza epidemic is said to have killed 20 million people worldwide scientists believe similar deadly

additional questioning of potential donors to determine if they may be at elevated risk for sars due to recent travel or due to exposure to person with sars although current fda regulations require that all blood donor s be in good health at the time of donation the new guidance will allow for the temporary defe rral of blood donors who may have been exposed to sars fda estimates that the new guidance will have minimal impact on the quantity of the blood supply based on current travel estimates at most 04 of donors will be deferred the guidance document was issued for immediate implementation in order to assure the safety of the blood supply until more is learned about th is new viral disease although the guidance applies to whole blood and blood components intended fo r

on may 7 2003 before the house oversi ght and investigations subcommittee the general accounting office gao identif ied number of gaps in public health preparedness that could interfe re in the nations response to disease threat such as sars16 in site visits to seven cities and their respective state governments gao found that the level of prep aredness varied and planning for regional coordination was lacking the state and local officials identified communication problems inadequacies in their surveillance systems and laboratory facilities and workforce shortages due to state budget cuts and s hortage of people with the necessary skills most hospitals lacked the capacity to treat large influx of infectious disease patients due to already overcrowded emergency departments lack of adequate medical equipment personal protective supplies isolation facilities and staff while four out of five hospitals surveyed by gao reported having developed an emergency response plan for largescale infectious disease outbreaks few have participated in drills or exercises in testimony on may 21 2003 before th senate permanent subcommittee on investigations dr michael osterholm direct or of the center for infectious disease research at the university of minnesota stated that he believed that there will be resurgence of sars early next winter that could far exceed our experience to date dr osterholm stated that given the transmission of the sars virus in china and taiwan the respiratory disease has now seeded itself in significant number of humans as to make its elimination impossible as student of the natural history of infectious diseases i am convinced that like the early days of the hiv epidemic the worst of sars is yet to come wh asked at the hearing for their opinion on the future impact of sars both dr julie gerberding director of cdc and dr anthony fauci director of niaid ag reed with the assessment made by dr osterholm dr osterholm stated that the public health syst em remains underfunded in the us not only is more money requi red but also additi onal qualified personnel who will serve on the front lines of our ever increasing battleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31937crs9 also testifying at the may 21 2003 nate hearing was dr mary selecky secretary of the washington state department of health and president of the association of state and territo rial health officials dr selecky spoke of the strains currently experienced in her state by public health workers who are responding to emergencies such as the smallpox vaccination program sars west nile virus the outbreak of bovine spongiform encepha lopathy bse in canada as well as working on routine communicable diseases and preventative health issues dr selecky described the challenges in coordinating between the various levels of government in how her office cdc and cal health officials investigated whether the respiratory symptoms experienced by crew members of container ship in the tacoma washington port were consistent with the sars case definition while cdcs division of global gration and quarantine was helpful their resource limitations made it difficult to respond to all of the questi ons and calls for assistance pouring in from across the country dr selecky agreed with dr osterholm that state and local health departments are f acing serious shortage of trained public health professionals she stated that according to the national association of state personnel executives states are facing up to 40 loss in employees due to retirement over the next 5 years and the health workforce is the area in which the resulting shortages will be the most severe in conclusion although most experts agr ee that recent increases in funding for public health has been critical they believe that continued inve stment is necessary in order to redress the decades of neglect in the nations public health infrastructure given the serious budget deficit problems ex perienced at the stat and local levels it is likely that state and local government s will look to the federal government for continued support in the effort to enhance public hea lth preparedness
