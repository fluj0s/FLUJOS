government corporations category currently consisting of some 17 corporate agencies performing functions assigned to them in law government corporation as defined in this report is government agency that is established by congress to provide marketoriented public service and required to produce revenues that meet or approximate its expenditures government corporations should not be confused with quasi governmental entities such as governmentsponsored enterprises which are amalgams of the governmental and private sectors the government corporation model has been utilized by the federal government for over century todays government corporations cover the spectrum in size and function from large wellknown entities such as the us postal service and the federal deposit insurance corporation to small lowvisibility corporate bodies such as the federal financing bank in the department of the treasury and federal prison industries in the department of justice the federal government does not possess general incorporation statute as states do each government corporation is chartered through an act of congress the use of separate acts to charter each corporation has resulted in wide variance in the legal and organizational structure of government corporations that said the government corporation control act of 1945 as amended does provide for the standardized budget auditing debt management and depository practices for those corporations listed in the act within the executive branch one agency is responsible for the oversight and supervision of government corporations neither the house nor the senate have single committees with the responsibility to oversee all government corporations instead each corporation is overseen by the committees with jurisdiction over its policy area many government corporations such as the tennessee valley authority have been established to exist in perpetuity other government corporations such as the us enrichment corporation though have been designed to serve as transition vehicles to transform from governmental entities into private firms congress has found the government corporation an attractive governance option the government corporation typically does not require annual appropriations since it generates revenues from the provision of goods and services moreover each government corporation may be endowed with the administrative flexibilities required to accomplish its goals while remaining responsive to congress and the president finally as noted above the government corporation may be established to serve an enduring purpose or may serve as vehicle for privatization this report will be updated at the beginning of each congress

government corporations to achieve policy goals for over century 1 among members of congress the executive branch and the scholarly community interest in the government corporation option and variations on this class of agency has increased in recent decades2 at least three factors contribute to this interest first the restrictive character of the federal budget encourages agencies to develop new source s of revenue eg outsourcing services to the private sector and to other agencies and to attempt to avoid increasing outlays3 second experience suggests that it is politically easier for corporate bodies to be exempted by congress from the federal governments general management laws eg the freedom of information act employee compensation restrictions etc than it is for traditional agencies finally the corporate concept appears to many correctly or otherw ise to be supportive of the new public management that emphasizes entrepreneurship risktaking and private sector practices in federal administration 4 in typical contemporary session of congress several bills are introduced to establish government corporations in the 110th congress for example hr 3896 proposed establishing two government corporations to fund and direct the repair and development of us infrastructure roads bridges railways etc similarly in the 109th congress hr 4100 and s 2172 proposed creating louisiana reconstruction corporation to economically revitalize the areas of louisiana that were damaged by hurricane katrina these actions prompt questions as to their legal character their utility visàvis traditional agencies and their limitations as units of governmental institutions government corporation is not always an the optimal administrative entity for achieving governance objectives there are times when it may be an appropriate choice and times when it may not understanding the unique 1 this report was originally written by ronald c moe who retired from crs it has been revised many times

public law provides guidance in weighing these choices5 this continuing interest raises rudimentary question what is federal government corporation or more precisely what are the essential characteristics of government corporation as defined in this report federal government corporation is an agency of the federal government established by congress to perform public purpose which provides marketoriented product or service and is intended to produce revenue that meets or approximates its expenditures by this definition there are 17 entities that are government corporations 6 the us code does not provide single definition of the term government corporation title 5 of the us code defines government corporation as corporation owned or controlled by the government of the united states 5 usc 1037 meanwhile the government corporation control act gcca 31 usc 910110 states th at the term government corporation means mixedownership government corporation and whollyowned government corporation it then lists 27 entities as being government corporations for the purposes of chapter 91 of title 318 in addition to the enumeration of corporations provided in the gcca there have been several other listings of corporations available each different and based upon the definition employed by the compiler corporations cover the spectrum fro m such large wellknown corporations as the united states postal service and the federal deposit insurance corporation to such small low visibility corporate bodies as the federal financing bank in the treasury department and federal prison industries unicor in the justice department the number of federal corporations is in moderate flux new corporations are established from time to time the international clean energy foundation in 20089 and existent ones are dissolved eg pennsylvania avenue developmen t corporation in 1996 and the rural telephone bank in 200810 government corporations should not be confused with quasi governmental entities such as governmentsponsored enterprises gses gse eg fannie mae is privately owned 5 see for example ronald c moe the importance of public law new and old paradigms of government management in phillip j cooper and chester newland eds handbook of public law and administration san francisco josseybass publishers 1997 pp 4157 6 for list of federal government corporations as defined in this report please consult the appendix this reports definition of government corporation excludes great many federal entities it excludes private corporations created by federal statute eg the american national red cross the securities investor protection corporation and fannie mae it also excludes some corporations that congress itself has called government corporations for example the 108 th congress established the millennium challenge corporation mcc as government corporation pl 108 199 though clearly federal entity the mcc is not included on this reports list because mcc does not provide marketoriented products or servicesthe mcc is grantawarding agency that is not designed to be financially selfsufficient 7 this definition holds only for the purpose of this title ie title 5 of the us code 8 though not yet reflected in the us code pl 110140 sec 925c added 28th entity to the list of government corporationsthe international clean energy foundation 9 pl 110140 sec 921927

except in passing in this report12 unlike government corporations with gses and other quasi governmental entities the legal and political lines of accountability can be ambiguous13 in 1996 for instance the office of personnel management opm created the united states investigation services corporation as an employee stockownership plan esop an entry into the quasi government category that sparked debate regarding its status and authority 14

the federal government has been invo lved in few commercial enterprises there were some early instances of the federal government participating in otherwise private corporate enterprises on shared ownership basis most notably the first and second banks of the united states this practice came into question however as consequence of supreme court ruling in 1819 15 from that time to today the federal government has tended to avoid sharing ownership with private entities the first time the federal government acquired corporation outright occurred in 1903 when the panama railroad company was purchased from the french panama canal company16 since 11 in 1996 the board of directors of the federal national mortgage association changed its name to fannie mae although the law still refers to the organization by its former name 12 for discussion of gses see crs report rs21663 governmentsponsored enterprises gses an institutional overview by kevin r kosar and thomas h stanton

the federal government with growth in that number tending to come in spurts and generally in response to emergencies the first largescale use of the corporate option accompanied the mobilization for world war i17 later the depression of the 1930s fostered numerous corporations eg the reconstruction finance corporation and the tennessee valley authority18 finally world war ii prompted the establishment of additional federal corporations after the passing of each of these emergencies many of the corporations that dealt with them were abolished or absorbed into the permanent executive branch agencies in 1945 partly in response to the proliferation of corporate bodies created for the war effort congress passed the government corporation control act gcca 59 stat 841 31 usc 9101 9110 the act standardized budget auditing debt management and depository practices for corporations notwithstanding unusual provisions that may be present in their enabling statute government corporations remain agencies of the united states 19 and are therefore subject to all laws governing agencies except where exempted from coverage by provisions of general management laws20 the gcca is not general incorporation act such as is in effect in the states the charter for each federal government corporation is the separate enabling legislation passed by congress the gcca also does not offer general definition of what constitutes government corporation it simply enumerates the organizations covered by the act in addition to the enumeration of corporations in the gcca there have been several other listings of corporations available each different and based upon the definition employed by the compiler 21 the corporations cover the spectrum from such large wellknown corporations as the united states postal service and the federal deposit insurance corporation to such small lowvisibility corporate bodies as the federal financing bank and federal prison industries unicor in the absence of

1948 budget message stated experience indicates that the corporate form of organization is peculiarly adapted to the administration of government programs which are predominately of commercial characterthose which are revenue producing are at least potentially selfsustaining and involve large number of businesstype transactions with the public in their business operations such programs require greater flexibility than the customary type of appropriations budget ordinarily permits as rule the usefulness of corporation rests on its ability to deal with the public in manner employed by private enterprise for similar work 22 that said congress has created many entities titled government corporations and corporations that do not meet these criteria the legal services corporation lsc the corporation for public broadcasting cpb and the newly established international clean energy foundation are examples of corporations that do not perform commercial functions and rely upon annual appropriations23 principal intention behind assigning this status and title was to provide considerable insulation from oversight by the central management agencies and the application of the general management laws g5g145g138g155g138g140g157g142g155g146g156g157g146g140g156g561g152g143g561g138g561g9g152g159g142g155g151g150g142g151g157g561g5g152g155g153g152g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 two federal

themselves are agents of the state subject to constitutional limitations25 as the supreme court concluded in the 1995 lebron case government corporation has certain inherent legal characteristics that cannot be shed simply by legislative language or by corporate fiat26 the nature of the function performed eg managing railroad has effect upon its 22 us congress house document 19 80th congress 2nd

sued by michael lebron for rejecting on political grounds an advertising sign he had contracted with them to display lebron claimed that his first amendment rights had been abridged by amtrak because it is government corporation and therefore an agency of the united states amtrak argued on the other hand that its legislation provid that it will not be an agency or establishment of the united

fundamentally separate and distinct with the distinctions based largely in legal theory not economic theory27 this understanding is essential to recognizing both the potentialities and limitations of the government corporate concept the government corporation remains governmental in character until congress determines it shall be fully private thereby coming under private law as general proposition the attorney general is vested with central control over the litigation to which the us government is party28 various statutes recognize that the attorney general is the chief legal officer for all departments and agencies however in an uneven pattern over the years exceptions have been permitted to this cent ral authority the independent regulatory commissions for instance have some independence although the degree of independence varies considerably from commission to commission in their litigation authority29 while the justice department has consistently favored central coordination of litigation this view has been difficult to maintain in practice with the relatively small staff of the department and its understandable reluctance to become responsible for routine litigation there has been trend toward awarding greater authority and flexibility to the departments and agencies in their legal affairs with respect to government corporations though often their enabling legislation assigns them legal personality distinct from that of the united states most are subject to and may initiate civil suits government corporations being agencies of the united states have their employees come under the limited waiver of immunity provided in the federal tort claims act ftca 30 distinguished public administrator harold seidma n notes as body corporate government

bank of the treasury department31 in practical terms the purpose of permitting corporations to sue and be sued in their own name is to enable private business to contract with government corporation under the assurance that if something goes amiss it can go to court to settle the matter with regular government agency however contractual dispute must normally go through laborious process in the court of claims if the contractor wins he must wait for an appropriation the departments of justice and treasury the office of management and budget omb the president and both houses of congress may become involved in the claim w ith the government corporation however this process is simplified and when contractor prevails he can usually obtain prompt settlement

executive branch with few exceptions are subject to uniform rules and regulations with respect to the budgets both the president and congress use agency budgets as management tools government corporations on the other hand are exempt either individually or collectively from many executive branch budgetary regulations32 these exemptions are predicated for the most part on the idea that with the corporate structure consumers of corporations products and services rather than the general taxpayer are the principal source of revenue the gcca as amended in 1982 96 stat 1042 pr ovides that each wholly owned government corporation shall prepare and submit to the president businesstype budget in way and before date the president prescribes by regulation for the budget program this budget program shall contain estimates of the financial condition and operation of the corporation for the current and following fiscal years and the condition and results of operations of the last fiscal year further it shall contain statements of financial condition income and expense and sources and uses of money an analysis of surplus and deficit and additional statements and information to make known the financial condition and operations of the corporation including estimates of operations by major activities administrative expenses borrowings the amount of us gove rnment capital that will be returned to the treasury during the fiscal year and appropriations needed to restore capital impairment 31 usc 9104 the objective of the budget program is to permit the corporation sufficient financial flexibility to carry out its activities the president after review and revision submits these budget programs to congress with the executive branch budget under the chief financial officers

statement on internal accounting and administrative control systems33 traditional agencies of the united states receive the preponderance of their financial support from funds appropriated by congress government corporations on the other hand generally receive most if not all their funds from users of their services thus the latter relationship has business character in which it is the obligation of the corporate body to provide services as long as the buyers are willing to pay this being the case revenues expenditures and even personnel will tend to fluctuate according to consumer demand many members of congress feel somewhat uneasy with broad business type budgets also referred to as budget programs to be sure congress can alter these budget programs and can limit the use of corporate funds for any purpose but this option is seldom employed faced with complex projections and agencies with little direct budgetary impact members understandably give corporate bodies marginal attention as general assessment the corporations come under comparatively little congressional scrutiny except when there is some political or financial threat evident as seidman notes in essence the businesstype budget provides for qualitative rather than quantitative review of proposed corporate expenses 34 until 1975 gao was responsible under the gcca fo r performing annual financial audits of government corporations at the request of gao the gcca was amended to provide for audits of the financial transactions of wholly owned corporations at least once every three years rather than annual audits in 1990 as part of the cfoa gaos recommendation that government corporations be subject once again to annual audits was accepted henceforth however the audit is to be conducted by the corporations inspector general or by an independent external auditor as determined by the inspector general or if there is inspector general the head of the corporation according to accepted government auditing standards 35 the comptroller general however continues to be authorized to revi ew the financial statements of government corporations

there are positives and negatives to the various options for corporate governance board of directors is the trademark of government corporation according to many lawmakers and attorneys marshall dimock an academic writing in 1949 argued that board of directors was considered an essential element for an authentic government corporation being separate and distinct entity headed by its own board of directors the corporation is inherently better able to succeed than the ordinary department of government 38 few years later harold seidman challenged the view that board of directors was an essential and necessarily desirable element for government corporation dimocks view he asserted was based on an inappropriate borrowing of state practice by the federal government state incorporation laws require boards of directors for private corporations to insure representation where ownership is held by more than one party in government corporations under this reasoning because ownership resides in the government alone there is inherent need for board of directors 39 government corporations seidman pointed out have existed and operated without boards of directors board of directors may well be found advisable and useful under some circumstances but seidman said it is not the sine qua non of government corporation40 whether or not board of directors is essential or desirable for government corporation the fact is that all but two federal government corporatio ns presently have boards of directors the two exceptions are ginnie mae and the st lawrence seaway development corporation in study published in 1981 the national academy of public administration was critical of boards of directors in general 37 cabinet secretaries placed on corporate boards or any boards for that matter rarely attend such meetings sending subordinates instead to protect departmental interests for approval of this process see us department of justice 6 op off legal counsel 257 delegation of cabinet members functions as exofficio members of the board of directors of the solar energy and energy conservation bank 1982 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc an agency within the department of labor provides evidence of the problems that some analysts contend are associated with boards of directors that include officials of other departments the board of directors of the pbgc has three members the secretary of the treasury the secretary of commerce and as chairman the secretary of labor such arrangements according to the national academy of public administration report inherently cause confusion as to the corporations status and the role of the secretary of labor to have cabinet officers serve as directors of subordinate unit of an executive department other than their own places him and the head of that department in an anomalous position can the secretaries of the treasury and commerce give orders to the secretary of labor on the other hand are the secretaries of treasury and commerce when acting as pbgc directors in any way required in formulating policies to conform to the policies of the secretary of labor perhaps because of such anomalies

corporation model has more drawbacks than advantages and that in most cases the governing board would be better replaced by an advisory board and the corporation managed by an administrator with full executive powers governing board may cut or confuse the normal lines of authority from the president or departmental secretary to th corporations chief ex ecutive officer with an advisory board the secretarys authority to give that officer policy instruction is clear as is the officers right to report directly to the secr etary and to work out any exemptions from or qualifications of administration or departmental policies and practices which the corporation requires 41 there is little doubt that board of directors particularly parttime outsiders board is buffer between the corporations top executive and political officials including the president whether such buffer is desirable feature in the overall administrative system however is question subject to debate notably it is also argued that corporation board appointments are patronage plums for the white house since the jobs are not generally demanding the effectiveness and utility of boards is dependent upon number of factors the coherency of the enabling legislation the conceptual integrity and soundness of the program itself and the number and quality of membership large boards comprising more than 12 members for instance may experience difficulty in making decisions the play of internal factors such as the size of the board the primary loyalties of board members whether to the corporation or to an outside constituency group and the relationship of the board to the corporate management all also have their place in the managerial equation g17g159g142g155g156g146g144g145g157g561 there is at present little central management agency oversight or supervision of government corporations as category of agency in the executive branch nor is there any central unit charged with designing government corporations from the perspective of presidential or central management interests 42 government corporations today are largely perceived as discrete entities each with its own political and administrative requirements and each with its own route and degree of political accountability individual corporations come under scrutiny from time to time by omb and congress or more precisely congressional committee responsible for oversight more often than not the immediate impetus for the oversight follows from indications that corporation is operating at financial risk or there is an appearance of wrongdoing the current absence of systematic oversight of corporations as class runs counter to the intentions of the sponsors of the gcca th bureau of the budget bob predecessor organization to omb was instrumental in the pass age of the gcca and created separate office to oversee the formation and monitor the operation of government corporations on behalf of the president

corporations or to develop and implement consistent policies governing their formation authorities and operations43 government corporations are not considered by omb to be category of organization to be supervised collectively omb in support of its position contends the responsibility for oversight of government corporations was not changed by the omb 2000 reorganization that is government corpora tions will continue to be reviewed by the resource management office rmo which has responsibility for the functional area most closely associated with the corporations mission omb does not review government corporations separately from other government organizations that perform similar functions 44 the executive branch treatment of management responsibilities respecting government corporations as class of organization tends to place additional burdens on congress and its committees to determine if the corporations are respecting the provisions of the general management laws eg the national environmental protection act 42 usc 4321 one corollary of limited central management oversight of government corporations is the lack of answers to fundamental issues regarding when and how government corporations ought to be created and utilized there are at least two schools of thought respecting the proper use of the government corporation option relating to its structure authority and financial systems one school holds that government corporations including agencies called corporations but which do not perform commercial activities should be encouraged provided maximum policy and financial autonomy and be subject to such oversight as is appropriate for other agencies and instrumentalities in the same policy field the legal responsibilities of the corporation should be located in its enabling statute the position of the second school is that government corporations should be established only when appropriate criteria and standards developed by central management agency are met such standards should be reflected in national incorporation law and apply to all proposed and functioning corporate bodies properly defined government corporations should be considered to be part of the executive branch but with recognition of their distinctive needs and oversight requirements as category of institutions 43 bob ceased to monitor government corporations and enterprises during the 1960s charles bingman speaking to 1978 conference on public enterprises noted that he had been the last person in the bob to undertake this monitoring role he stated that he

toward eventual full privatization45 our interest here is limited to the corporation as transition option the principal utility of the transitional government corporation is that it can demonstrate marketability and asset value critical elements in any successful privatization venture an early successful example of the government corporation concept as transition vehicle involved conrail conrail was created by congress as government corporation in 1976 from the remnants of seven private bankrupt railroads it took some 10 years and an investment of 8 billion by the federal government to bring conrail up to industry standards before entertaining reasonable expectation that the railroad would be attractive to private investors 46 the federal government received approximately 2 billion from the sale but the real payoff was that the northeastern region of the country was once again provided viable freight rail system the transition period as government corporation was necessary to develop record as potentially profitmaking venture prior to successful privatization divestiture effort47 more recently the us enrichment corporation usec has completed its transitional process toward full privatization with mixed results the usec until 1993 regular agency in the department of energy doe operated uranium enrichment plants in kentucky and ohio in the 1950s the plants produced highly enriched uran ium heu for defense purposes times changed and the united states was successfully challenged by new international entrants into the market the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 106 stat 2776 established the us enrichment corporation as wholly owned government corporation the general intent of the legislation was to privatize the two plants and let them compete in the world market privatization plan was delivered by the usec to the president and congress in 1995 the plan suggested that there were two primary methods of corporate divestiture an initial public offering ipo and merger or acquisition with another corporation or group of corporations48 after considerable discussion the ipo option was selected as it had been with conrail the ipo of stock was completed on july 28 1998 and raised an estimated 19 billion for the federal government the usec transition process highlighted however one of the perennial problems in privatization efforts congress may intend corporation to be private but it also may 45 in this report privatization is defined narrowly to em brace only those actions resulting in ultimate full divestiture the term privatization has been defined and interpreted in different ways see crs report rl33777 privatization and the federal government an introduction by kevin r kosar 46 national academy of public administration conrail and the uranium enrichment corporation comparison by alan dean washington napa 1989 p 5 47 it should not be forgotten that before conrail could be privatized it first had to be nationalized seven private railroad corporations went bankrupt and it required the federal government to resolve bankruptcy issues establish longterm comprehensive commercial rail plan develop corporate management capacity invest capital funds renegotiate contracts and get the whole project functioning in short period of time the federal government was successful and only then was the private sector interested in buying

policy implementation in this instance congress wanted the corporation to participate in implementing foreign policy objective which was to purchase at above market rates substantial amount of russian enriched uranium otherwise destined for russian weapons under th heu agreement the usec received enriched uranium from russian nuclear weapons and in addition to its payment for the material returned an equivalent amount of natural unenriched uranium to russia to sell on the world market this arrangement from the corporations perspective was not viable and in october 1999 the usec solicited congress for relief 49 another characteristic of private corporation legally organized and defined as such is the right to cancel program or withdraw from an activity if it is not deemed in the fiduciary interests of the shareholders to the consternation of doe officials such decision was reached recently by the usec board of directors one of the assets transferred from the doe to the usec in the divestiture was the right to commercialize new enrichment technology called atomic vapor laser and isotope separation vlis technology in which doe had invested over 2 billion on june 9 1999 the board of directors of the usec determined that vlis was not commercially viable and canceled the program the boards decision made manifest the fiduciary distinctions between government and private

potential it is helpful to bear in mind however that there is general provision in law that defines what precisely government corporations are when writing the gcca congress and the executive branch simply viewed the various corporate bodies and defined them by enumeration rather than by required characteristics this relatively unstructured approach has meant that some corporate bodies eg the us postal service are not included in the gcca enumeration whereas other bodies 49 martha m hamilton uranium company seeks federal aid privatized usec warns of losses washington post oct 30 1999 p e8 50

corporation for national and community service are listed there is little managerial oversight at present of government corporations as an institutional category by either the president or congress what oversight there is tends to be corporation specific in the case of congress corporations are assigned to committees of subjectmatter jurisdiction gao report recommended that corporations properly require both subject matter and management oversight and that the gcca should be reconstituted to establish in law the characteristics of various types of corporate bodies 53 government corporations may be viewed as permanent agencies to perform continuing governmental function eg the federal deposit insurance corporation temporary agency eg the pennsylvania avenue development corporation or transition agency to facilitate the process whereby governmental agency or program is divested and transferred to the private sector eg the us enrichment corporation these options indicate the flexibility of the government corporation concept and may provide models for extending the corporate organization to other appropriationsfunded agencies eg the us patent and trademark office and the us mint both the latter agencies and their programs meet the basic criteria for government corporation and suggestions to this effect have been made the future of government corporations as category of federal organization appears generally bright although they are not widely understood in executive management circles the need for the executive branch and congress to develop new organizational structures that take into account both the public law requirements of government status and the flexibility that properly accompanies corporate bodies dependent upon revenues for services will foreseeably increase rather than diminish 54 the managerial quality of the law establishing corporation may be critical variable in determining the success or failure of that enterprise if the conceptual basis of the law establishing corporation or economic assumptions therein are faulty as was allegedly the case with the synthetic fuels corporation in the late 1970s government corporation may become liability to the executive branch and face short tenure55 on the other hand if federal government corporation is designed to conform with public law governmental management principles and sound economics corporate agency may provide creative instrument to promote the public policy objectives of elected officials although it has been the purpose of this report to emphasize the distinctive characteristics of federal government corporations it is important to conclude with statement of their shared characteristics with other federal agencies the mission of both regular appropriationsfinanced agencies and of government corporations is the same to implement the laws passed by congress 53 us general accounting office congress should consider revising basic corporate
