term in subsection 1 as embodying the product arising from employeremployee relationship if work is created outside of the employeremployee relationship it may still qualify as work for hire under

parties must have an express written agreement designating the work as one for hire when work qualifies the employer is the author and the legal owner of the copyright interest the copyright act grants authors the right to transfer all of their exclusive rights and in certain specific instances right to termi nate the transfer the termination right is intended to safeguard authors against unremunerative transfe rs arising from an historic unequal bargaining power it permits the author to determine the value of the work after it has been fully exploited and to renegotiate transfer of exclusive rights to enable the author to share in the greatly appreciated value of an important work works made for hire however are not subject to the termination right parties may by express agreement vary the rights which would otherwise be owned by the employer in work for hire under 10113 in settings other than an employeremployee relationship governed by 1011 however if the relationship between the parties is not one that will otherwise qualify as specially commissioned work for hire under 1012 the agreement that the work shall be regarded as such will not be effective

substantive amendment effected without adequate public input and review7 prior to the amendment in 1999 sound recordings were not expressly included in the categories of work specially ordered or commissioned in subparagraph 2 whether the change was technical or substantive proved to be controversial the house judiciary subcommittee on courts intellectual property held hearing on may 25 2000 on the effect of the amendment witnesses were not generally in agreement distilled to its essence the issue is as follows the recording industry and its performing artists routinely treat sound recordings as works for hire there are currently many sound recordings filed with the us copyright office as special ly commissioned works for hire the us copyright office however merely accepts the registration and does not inquire whether sound recording meets all of the requirements of work for hire8 some argue that because sound recording was not specifically listed in subparagraph 2 prior to the 1999 amendment it could not be specially commissioned work for hire pursuant thereto9 others contend that sound recordings already qualified under subparagraph 2 as contributions to collective works therefore the addition of sound recordings as discrete category did not materially change their status within the rubric of work for hire10 the question is ultimately an important one because if they are works for hire under the copyright act neither individual nor joint authors may exercise the termination rights that they might enjoy in the absence of work for hire status and because termination rights for authors of sound recordings will not mature until 2028 courts have not yet begun to consider the issue11 yet even though an authors termination rights in sound recording are not likely to ripen before 2028 the question may reach the courts in other contexts before then it is reported that mp3com is challenging recordinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20763crs4 12 new workforhire

hire ownership of sound recordings in conne ction with damages awarded by court against it in ongoing copyright infringement litigation12 nevertheless the broad question whether prior to the 1999 amendment sound recording qualified as specially commissioned work for hire for purposes of an authors termination right is not settled acknowledging the controversy generated by the amendment congress deleted sound recordings from the list of categories in 1012 year after they were added in the work made for hire and copyright corrections act of 200013 interestingly the corrective legislation is definitive in declining to resolve the outstanding question whether sound recordings qualify as works for hire under other classifications of 1012 the law adds new language to the definition specifying in determining whether any work is eligible to be considered work made for hire under paragraph 2 neither the amendment contained in section 1011d of the intellectual proper ty and communications omnibus reform act of 1999 as enacted by section 1000a9 of public law 106113 nor the deletion of the words added by that amendment shall be considered or otherwise given any legal significance or b shall be interpreted to indicate congressional approval or disapproval of or acquiescence in any judicial determination by the courts or the copyright office paragraph 2 shall be interpreted as if both section 2a1 of the work made for hire and copyright corrections act of 2000 and section 1011d of the intellectual property and communications omnibus reform act of 1999 as enacted by section 1000a9 of public law 106113 were never enacted and without regard to any inaction or awareness by the congress at any time of any judicial determinations14 thus at such time when court is confronted with the question whether sound recording can be work for hire it is directed to specifically disregard the 1999 and 2000 amendments as component of the provisions legislative history evincing congressional intent committee report language accompanying hr 5107 the bill enacted explains that the purpose of the amendment is to restore the status quo as it existed before november 29 1999 as to the issue of whether sound recording can qualify as work for hire under the second part of the definition of that term in section 101 of the copyright act and to do so in manner that does not prejudice any person or entity that might have interests concerning this question15 the amendment made by the act is expressly retroactive to november 29 1999
