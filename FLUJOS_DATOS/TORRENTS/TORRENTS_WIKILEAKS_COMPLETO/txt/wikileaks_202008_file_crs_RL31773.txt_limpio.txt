december 2 2005 christine scott specialist in tax economics domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress medicaid and the state fiscal crisis of 20002003 summary medicaid health insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and the states is facing period of quickly escalating costs at time when the need as measured by the number of uninsured among the population it serves the low income disabled families and elderly is rising the pressures of quickly rising costs and increasing need are driving legislative attention both at the state and federal levels between fy2000 and fy2003 the annual growth rate of federal medicaid expenditures was 113 during the fy2000 through fy2003 period states unable to use deficit spending faced fiscal pressures from decline in or slower growth rates for general state revenues due to the economic downturn and constraints on the states use of creative financing mechanisms for medicaid medicaid was frequently pointed to as significant contributor to the fiscal pressures this was not the first time that medicaid has been fiscal flash point in the mid1990s congress passed legislation to repeal the medicaid program and replace it with fixed grant program president clinton vetoed this effort the period of economic growth in the 1990s relieved some of the fiscal pressures however the fiscal pressures returned in the early 2000s the joint nature of the medicaid program means that program policy changes can occur at either or both the federal and state level for states making significant cuts in the medicaid program is challenging because some of the quickly growing cost items such as nursing facility care are federally required in addition cutting the program when unemployment is high and the number of uninsured is growing is politically unpopular as result states combined to lobby for fiscal relief from congress in the 108th congress the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 108027 provided temporary fiscal relief to states through combination of grants and an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage alternatively the bush administration proposed various options to control medicaid spending including waivers through the health insurance flexibility and accountability hifa initiative and medicaid reform proposal the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 provided some fiscal relief to states by temporarily increasing disproportionate share to hospital dsh allotments and increasing the floor for dsh allotments for certain states however pl 108173 also created prescription drug benefit under the medicare program the prescription drug benefit which will begin in 2006 will be partially funded by the states this report describes medicaid financing mechanisms some of the factors that contribute to the programs spending growth how medicaid fits into state budgets what

and the states while states have considerable flexibility to design and administer their medicaid programs certain groups of individuals must be covered for certain categories of services generally eligibility is limited to lowincome children pregnant women parents of dependent children the elderly and people with disabilities the federal governments share of medicaid costs is determined by formula included in statute states must contribute the remaining portion of costs in order to qualify for federal funds in fiscal year fy 2004 medicaid enrollment was estimated at 549 million including 257 million children and 140 million aged blind or disabled individuals1 in fy20022 total state and federal medicaid medical assistance and administration payments were 2582 billion medical assistance payments were 2463 billion with the four largest categories being nursing facilities 193 of the total prepaid health care capitation paymentsmanaged care organizations 133 inpatient hospital services 127 and prescription drugs 95 the 10 largest states in terms of total medical assistance payments in fy2002 were new york california texas pennsylvania florida ohio illinois massachusetts new jersey and michigan they accounted for 571 of total medicaid medical assistance payments nine of the 10 are also in the top 10 states for total population3 medicaid financing medicaid is jointly funded by the states and the federal government generally the federal share of medicaid is based on matching percentage state must pay its share of medicaid program costs to receive matching federal payments however the simple mechanism of federal matching percentage for medicaid program 1 centers for medicare and medicaid services 2004 cms statistics table 11 available

for hospitals disproportionate share payments to hospitals known as dsh that serve large number of lowincome or medicaid patients and 2 the upper payment limits upls for services by type of provider and provider ownership private or public these two financing mechanisms allowed under law made it possible for states to finance their medicaid programs with less than their required state match in effect increasing their federal match rate however these sources of financing have been restricted just as other sources of state revenues are also decreasing federal medical assistance percentage the federal governments share of states expenditures for medicaid is called the federal medical assistance percentage fmap the fmap for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia is determined annually based on statutory formula that uses the average per capita income of each state and the united states for the three most recent calendar years for which data are available from the department of commerce this formula is designed to pay higher fmap to states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and vice versa for states with higher per capita incomes fmaps must not fall below 50 or exceed 834 there is an fmap of 50 for administrative expenses and higher match for certain services and administrative functions in fy2003 and fy2004 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra pl 108027 provided fiscal relief to the states through temporary increase in the fmap for states that met certain requirements for the last two quarters of fy2003 and the first three quarters of fy2004 eligible states were held harmless protected from any decline in the fmap from fy2002 levels and the resulting fmaps were increased by 295 points for these quarters in general state was eligible for the higher fmap if the medicaid program eligibility was not more restrictive than their program eligibility on september 2 2003 table 1

including administration were 2582 billion the federal government share was 1466 billion or about 568 for the period fy1992 through fy2002 the federal share of total medicaid expenditures ranged from 565 to 574 with the annual average share for the period being 567 the temporary increase in the fmaps provided by jgtrra for fy2003 and fy2004 did not significantly increase the federal share the congressional budget office estimated that the temporary fmaps changes only increased federal medicaid expenditures in fy2003 by 4 billion or 255 in the 50 states and the district of columbia medicaid is an individual entitlement there are limits on the federal payments for medicaid as long as the state pays its share of the matching funds in contrast medicaid programs in the territories are subject to federal spending caps figure 1 illustrates total expenditures for medicaid for fy1992 through fy2003 for fy2003 federal expenditures for medicaid were 1607 billion with state expenditures

federal expenditures and estimated state expenditures disproportionate share payments and provider taxes7 the disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment was established in 1981 to give states greater flexibility to use payment methods for medicaid other than the medicare reimbursement principles and to provide protections for hospitals particularly those with high level of lowincome and uninsured patients in effect hospitals designated as dsh hospitals receive higher reimbursement for services than other providers portion of the reimbursement paid to the state by the federal government through the fmap funding mechanism is called the dsh adjustment originally there was upper limit placed on dsh adjustments in the early 1990s the combination of high growth rate in medical costs generally and an economic downturn resulted in states combining creative financing mechanisms particularly provider taxes or donations with dsh adjustments which had limit to increase federal medicaid payments the increased federal payments in effect permitted the states to transfer part of the medical costs normally paid for by states such as support for public hospitals to the federal government between 1990 and 1992 dsh adjustments grew from less than 1 billion to 174 7 for more complete history and analysis of dsh payments see crs report 97483 medicaid disproportionate share payments by jean hearne crs6 billion after 1992 dsh adjustment growth slowed considerably although the level of national dsh adjustments remains high 159 billion in 2002 under provider taxes and donations the state would impose providerspecific tax or accept donation from medicaid provider these funds would be included as part of the state share of medicaid funding and matched by the federal government the providers would then have their taxes or donations returned by receiving higher payments than they would have otherwise received including higher dsh adjustments with any remaining funds retained by the state for other uses because dsh adjustments had limit at the time and did not have to be tied to particular beneficiaries or services they became popular means of drawing down federal dollars not all states used this financing mechanism but some states were very aggressive in their use of the mechanism with large share of the federal payments diverted to other uses including meeting the states required matching rate an example of the financing mechanism using the provider tax would be as follows the state medicaid agency paid dsh designated hospital 100 for services provided reflecting higher reimbursement level for dsh adjustment then claimed and received 60 federal match the state has 60 fmap the hospital returned to the state via donation or tax 80 of the 100 it was paid at the end of the transaction the hospital had been paid 20 by the state but the federal government had reimbursed the state for 60 leaving an additional 40 the state could use for any purpose to curb the use of provider taxes and donations the medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 pl 102234 restricted the use of donations to limited situations and permitted states to impose any providerspecific taxes they wished however the federal match would be reduced dollar for dollar for any donations or taxes that did not meet specific requirements specifically the providertax had to be broadbased and subject to cap on the amount of state medicaid program expenses the taxes could be used to support the medicaid voluntary contribution and providerspecific tax amendments of 1991 also established national and state limits on dsh adjustments the national limit was 12 of medicaid expenditures in any year the state limits were based on 1992 dsh adjustment levels states with 1992 adjustment levels greater than 12 of the states total medicaid expenditures would receive adjustments at the 1992 dollar levels until the adjustments became 12 of total medicaid spending states with 1992 adjustment levels below 12 of medicaid expenditures could receive allotments increasing their adjustments up to limit of 12 in essence states could continue to receive dsh adjustments which are not based on actual services up to 12 generally of medicaid expenditures the size of total dsh adjustments and the lack of reliable data on what the adjustments accomplished focused attention on the payments and they became target of federal budget cutters the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 1997 pl 10533 established specific levels of dsh adjustments for 1998 through 2002 with later years increasing by the growth in the consumer price index cpi the annual limits were to decline during the 1998 to 2002 period but the medicare medicaid crs7 and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa pl 106554 relaxed the levels for 2001 and 2002 in 2003 the dsh allotment returned to the levels set by bba 1997 resulting in decline in the allotment compared to 2002 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 provided 16 increase in adjustments for fy2004 and altered the calculation of future adjustments in future years if the calculated adjustment is less than or equal to the fy2004 adjustment the adjustment for that fiscal year will be the prior fiscal year adjustment increased by the cpi in fy2002 six states new york california texas new jersey louisiana and pennsylvania accounted for over half of total dsh adjustments dsh adjustments in fy2002 were 159 billion or 62 of total medicaid medical assistance and administration payments upper payment limits upl and intergovernmental transfers igt8 in 1987 the secretary of hhs issued regulations establishing upper payment limits upl for different types of medicaid covered services interacting with this policy was provision of medicaid law that allows state governments to fund up to 60 of the nonfederal share of medicaid expenditures with local government funds it is this source of intergovernmental transfers that plays role in state accounting practices for upl and that has drawn the attention of congress in 2000 it became apparent that some states were using the combination of upl and intergovernmental transfers to receive payments in excess of what the federal share of payments would have been based on the actual rate paid for services9 those states were paying county or city service providers at rates above the usual payment rates to claim higher federal match the local providers would be required to return the excess payments to the state to cover part of the state medicaid expenditures or for other purposes in the 1987 rules states were allowed to pay all providers regardless of ownership up to 100 of the medicare payment rate as part of the financing mechanism populations in private and public city or county hospitals were combined to determine the total expenditures for federal match up to 100 of the medicare rate the private facilities were paid the normal medicaid reimbursement rate below 100 of the medicare rate with the excess the amount that would bring total expenditures up to 100 of medicare going to public city or county facilities which were required to return the excess to the state through an igt as part of the new rules imposed during the clinton administration public city or county hospital reimbursements had upl of 150 of the medicare payment rate while private facilities remained at 100 states had to treat private and public city or county patient populations separately in calculating total expenditures for the federal match the bush administration changed the rules to impose the 100 of 8 for more detailed history and analysis of upl and igt see crs report rl31021 medicaid upper payment limits and intergovernmental transfers current issues and recent regulatory and legislative action by lisa herz 9 ibid pp 23 crs8 medicare payment rates on public facilities move that has reduced this source of revenue for states during the current period of budget pressures however states can still claim federal medicaid reimbursement for payments to providers at the upper payment level regardless of the providers actual cost of services to the extent the upl is above actual service costs the state will receive additional or excess revenues intergovernmental transfers are still permitted for use in calculating state medicaid expenditures within the program match requirements this is because of the nature of state and local government relations local governments derive their authority including taxing authority from the state government and can be viewed as units of state government therefore funds the local government transfers to be used for medicaid are different from state funds used for medicaid the administrations fy2005 budget proposal contained two provisions which would impact state medicaid financing through the use of the upl and intergovernmental transfers10 in the budget there were two new proposed initiatives to ensure the proper use of federal medicaid payments 1 limiting federal reimbursement to the cost of services provided and 2 restricting the use of certain types of intergovernmental transfers the budget proposal did not provide specifics on the two initiatives federal medicaid expenditure growth it has been noted that the history of medicaid expenditure growth has five distinct periods11 these periods are defined as follows 19651972 this was the period when medicaid was introduced and states began to develop programs resulting in growth rate for federal medicaid spending of 53 year by 1972 every state except alaska and arizona had program 19731980 during this period the supplemental security income ssi program for aged and disabled persons began and states had new options for institutional coverage federal medicaid expenditures grew at 15 annual rate 19811989 during this period there were number of legislative changes to medicaid at the federal level some to reduce costs and others to expand eligibility the annual growth for federal medicaid expenditures was 11 10 us department of health and human services budget in brief fy2005 jan 2004 p 6 11 andy schneider and david rousseau medicaid financing the medicaid resource book the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured july 2002 chapter 3 pp 81127 crs9 19901992 during this period federal medicaid expenditures grew at 28 annual rate reflecting the states use of creative financing mechanisms to maximize federal payments particularly dsh payments at time of economic downturn 19931998 during this period reforms were made to dsh payments welfare reform took place and medicaid spending restrictions were imposed on dsh provider taxes and provider donations to reduce federal medicaid expenditures the average annual rate of growth was 6 but between 1995 and 1998 the rate of growth was only 37 since 1998 medicaid costs appear to have entered new phase of growth particularly for certain services while medicaid federal and state feeforservice prescription drug expenditures grew at an annual rate of 190 between 1998 and 2002 estimates from the office of the actuary at cms12 suggest that prescription drug expenditures will have grown by 170 between 2002 and 2003 and are projected to grow by 154 between 2003 and 2004 the projections by the office of the actuary also show an increase in total public and private expenditures for prescription drugs of 841 between 1998 and 2002 with the public share of prescription drug expenditures increasing during this period from 211 to 217 the growth in medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs therefore reflects general changes in the price and usage of prescription drugs and is not necessarily by product of medicaid program rules or changes medicaid expenditures for nursing home care grew between 1998 and 2001 by 170 and are projected to grow by 85 in 2002 and at annual rate of about 60 in 2003 and 2004 the public share of total nursing home expenditures is projected to increase from 588 in 1998 to 641 in 2002 the impact of these growth rates is significant because in fy2002 prescription drugs and nursing home facilities represented 96 and 190 of net federal medicaid assistance payments although the growth in total federal medicaid expenditures was 104 between fy2002 and fy2003 the congressional budget office cbo projects13 slower annual average growth rate of about 45 for the fy2004 through fy2007 period this is because during this period the higher temporary fmaps will expire the medicare prescription drug benefit program14 will begin and there are likely to be other changes to state programs that will reduce the growth in costs after this period of slow growth cbo projects that increasing medical prices and enrollment for medicaid will result in an average annual rate of growth for total federal medicaid expenditures of about 86 for the fy2008 through fy2014 period figure 2 shows 12 office of the actuary centers for medicare and medicaid services national health care

actual federal medicaid expenditures all other fiscal years are estimates beginning in 2006 the medicare prescription drug benefit program will shift federal expenditures for drug benefits for the medicaid population known as dual eligibles those eligible for both the medicaid and medicare programs from the medicaid program to the medicare program this shift from medicaid to medicare however will not provide significant relief to the states for medicaid prescription drug expenditures for dual eligibles currently the medicare program does not cover prescription drugs but state medicaid programs do include prescription drugs as an optional benefit not required by the federal government under provision of the new medicare prescription drug benefit program known as the clawback states

amount that the states will be required to pay declines over time from 90 to 75 in effect the states will continue to pay for share of prescription drug benefits for dual eligibles15 15 for additional information see crs report rl32440 implications of the medicare prescription drug benefit for state budgets by april grady and christine scott crs11 comparing medicaid and medicare growth common comparison is that of personal health care expenditures for medicaid and medicare16 which would show that while medicare spending between fy1998 and fy2003 grew at an annual rate of 53 medicaids annual spending growth for the same time period was 97 however the two programs differ in scope and coverage and are not directly comparable the addition of the medicare prescription drug benefit program will alter the growth rates of both programs in the future but long term care for the elderly and disabled remains medicaid expenditure and therefore partially state responsibility medicaid and state budgets there are two measures that can be used to assess the role of medicaid in state budgets total medicaid expenditures as share of total state expenditures and statefunded medicaid expenditures as share of total statefunded expenditures the first measure 214 in state fiscal year sfy 2003 measures the total administrative size of the medicaid program because it includes both federal and state expenditures the fiscal responsibility of the states for medicaid represents smaller portion of this total however because total state budgets include federal revenues for transportation and other federal grant programs in addition to medicaid the second measure is more reflective of the fiscal exposure that states face due to medicaid figure 3 illustrates the role that medicaid has played in state budgets for sfy1989 through sfy200317 as figure 3 illustrates statefunded medicaid spending comprised 63 of total statefunded spending in sfy1989 and grew to 126 by sfy2003 the major growth period for statefunded medicaid spending as share of statefunded spending was in the early 1990s the economic downturn high growth in medical costs and the use of dsh and other financing mechanisms provider taxes or donations and intergovernmental transfers count as state expenditures contributed to an increase in medicaids share from 63 in sfy1989 to 100 in sfy1992 16

congressional research service crs based on data collected by the national association of state budget officers nasbo state expenditures do not include expenditures from federal revenues the district

the sfy1995 to sfy2000 period total statefunded expenditures increased by an average annual rate of 65 while statefunded medicaid expenditures increased by an average annual rate of 51 as result the medicaid share of total statefunded expenditures declined during the sfy2000 to sfy2003 period this changed and statefunded total expenditures increased by only 48 annually while statefunded medicaid expenditures increased by 95 during the sfy1995 to sfy2000 period statefunded expenditures for some functions elementary and secondary education and corrections increased at an annual rate higher than that of total statefunded expenditures while statefunded expenditures for public assistance had negative annual growth rate for the sfy2000 to sfy2003 period only the annual growth rates for medicaid and other expenditures residual category were higher than that of total statefunded expenditures whereas the annual growth rate for public assistance was negative in sfy2003 the medicaid share of

the economic downturn in the early 1990s and the economic boom of the late 1990s in the early 1990s statefunded medicaid expenditures grew at very high annual rates partially reflecting the use of financing mechanisms provider taxes or donations and intergovernmental transfers are counted as state expenditures to maximize the federal payments in the late 1990s the rates of growth for statefunded medicaid expenditures were generally lower than that of total statefunded expenditures reflecting the expansion of other state programs particularly education during the economic boom in the period between 2000 and 2003 medicaid expenditures grew at faster rate than total statefunded expenditures reflecting combination of the faster rate of growth in medicaid service costs and the entitlement nature of the crs15 program however it is not known how much of the growth in recent years is due to costs for federally mandated coverage or due to earlier expansions of state programs

drug benefit program the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 created medicare part d prescription drug benefit beginning in 2006 that will impact both state and federal financing of the medicaid program as of 2006 state and federal medicaid funds can longer be used to fund prescription drugs for the medicaid population known as dual eligibles18 dual eligibles wishing to obtain prescription drug coverage will have to enroll in the medicare part d program states will be required to provide funding for the medicare drug program based on their level of state medicaid spending in 2003 on prescription drugs for dual eligibles19 18 dual eligibles are those persons eligible for both medicare and the full range of benefits offered in their states medicaid program 19 for more specific information on individuals eligible for the new medicare drug program continued crs16 under the medicare prescription drug plan states must pay percentage 90 declining each year to 75 of their inflationadjusted 2003 state medicaid spending per dual eligible for prescription drugs for each dual eligible person enrolled in the medicare prescription drug program in effect the states will be required to continue paying for portion of the prescription drugs for dual eligibles formerly provided through state medicaid programs the ultimate impact on state budgets and medicaid programs of the medicare drug program cannot be determined at this time in part because the program does not begin until 2006 there are at least three areas of concern for medicaid programs and financing in state budgets medicaid drug coverage medicaid drug expenditures for dual eligibles will decline because states are prohibited from providing those drugs covered under the medicare drug program however they may provide some medicaid coverage for drugs not covered under medicare part d until the medicare drug program coverage is defined the specifics are determined by the private sponsors of the plans the impact on medicaid plans and costs for dual eligibles is unknown medicaid drug prices there may be an impact for states on medicaid drug prices paid by their medicaid programs because of the change in the volume of drug purchases by the programs in the future in addition the medicaid programs are not guaranteed the medicare drug plan price if it is lower as result the impact of this provision on medicaid drug prices for individuals continuing to receive drug benefits under medicaid is unknown participation an individual eligible for medicare may choose not to join the medicaid program even if the individual is eligible under current law participation in medicaid programs by dual eligibles has traditionally been low once mma is implemented an individual applying for the new drug program may also be determined eligible for medicaid this could increase state expenditures for two reasons 1 utilization of medicaid services by the new enrollees and 2 funding for the new enrollees in the medicare drug program is partially paid by the state even if the person would never have otherwise joined the medicaid program in contrast to these unknowns there is one impact on state medicaid budgets that is certain because every state will pay based on their 2003 per capita spending state that had more generous medicaid drug benefit in 2003 will pay more per 19 continued see crs report rl31966 overview of the medicare drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 by jennifer osullivan hinda chaikind sibyl tilson jennifer boulanger and

statutory or traditional interpretation20 these requirements can take one of the following forms the governors proposed budget must be balanced the enacted budget must be balanced or the budget must be balanced at the end of the fiscal year or biennium during the latter portion of the 1990s states were experiencing growth period in revenues revenues associated with growing economy such as income taxes and in particular capital gains grew faster than official state predictions21 survey of states by the national conference of state legislatures ncsl reported 30 states had revenues exceeding expectations for sfy1998 and 24 states had revenues exceeding expectations for sfy1999 mostly from sales and income taxes in addition states negotiated with the tobacco manufacturers settlement that allocates funds to states based on several factors including medicaid expenditures and the smoking rate the tobacco companies are estimated to pay states that are part of the settlement approximately 200 billion between 1998 and 202322 as state economies declined during the 2000 through 2003 period so did the growth in the associated revenue streams combination of an economic decline and tax cuts

ease state and federal responses to the current state fiscal crisis states to close budget gap state must either reduce expenditures increase revenues or both reducing expenditures for programs or general government operations will be based upon state priorities as determined by the governor and legislature to the extent that states determine that other programs such as education are higher priority than medicaid medicaid expenditures may be reduced through changes such as limiting eligibility or benefits prior to cutting programs states generally use administrative and other tools to reduce program costs and eliminate any fraud or waste in the program the federal changes beginning in the 1990s to restrict the use of certain financing mechanisms and limit federal cost increases

fmaps for states affected by hurricane katrina exclude certain hurricane katrina evacuees and their income for purposes of calculating state fmaps and disregard employer contributions toward pensions in the calculation of fmaps if they exceed certain threshold the provisions of the budget reconciliation bills that increase the fmap for certain states provide fiscal relief by increasing the federal

would have the option of operating their medicaid programs under current rules with the current financing system or under alternative rules with federal allotment system of financing under the alternative states would be required to provide comprehensive benefits for those individuals considered mandatory beneficiaries by the federal government and this portion of the program would continue to be financed under fmap rules states would be granted flexibility to design benefits for individuals and services considered optional by the federal government based on the information provided in press releases by the secretary of hhs it is not clear exactly what limits would be placed on the flexibility being granted states legislation for the proposal was introduced in the 108th session of congress for the portion of the program related to optional beneficiaries the administration proposal would have replaced the current entitlement to states for federal financing support with annual federal allotments for the medicaid and schip programs there would be two annual allotments one for acute care health insurance and one for longterm care and community services states would be able to transfer funds between the two allotments for fy2004 the allotments for each state for the portion of the program for optional beneficiaries would be based on the states spending for medicaid and schip in 2002 the fy2004 allotment would be higher than what would be expected under the current medicaid financing structure the allotments would increase or decrease in future years based on an unspecified formula for seven years the allotments would be higher than the states would have received under current financing but would be lower in the next three years and thereafter other recent proposed federal initiatives the administrations fy2005 budget proposal contained two provisions which would have impacted state medicaid financing through the use of the upl and intergovernmental transfers29 in the budget there were two new proposed initiatives to ensure the proper use of federal medicaid payments 1 limiting federal reimbursement to the cost of services provided and 2 restricting the use of certain types of intergovernmental transfers the budget proposal did not provide specifics on the two initiatives in addition to the budget proposals on january 7 2004 cms
