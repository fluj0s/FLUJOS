2007 michael f martin analyst in asian political economics foreign affairs defense and tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106us clothing and textile trade with china and the world trends since the end of quotas summary the elimination of the last set of quotas of the agreement on tex tiles and clothing atc on january 1 2005 ostensibly brought about the end of decades of quantitative restrictions on the international exchange of clothing and textiles trade analysts around the world expected that th final lifting of import limits would foster increased growth in clothing and textile trade as well as restructuring of clothing and textile production in particular some ma rket watchers predic ted dramatic shift of clothing and textile pr oduction to china at the expense of many other nations for the us domestic market the end of the atc quotas was expected to bring about three major changes first there would be sharp increase in us clothing and textile imports second th ere would be major shift in sourcing clothing and textile imports to china third the influx of clothing and textile imports was expected to have deleterious effect on the us clothing and textile industry fourth because of the anticipated negativ impact on the us clothing and textile industry there was belief that the us g overnment would make use of various trade remedies to fend off the rising tide of clothing and textile imports the events of the first two years of postatc quotas 2005 and 2006 both confirmed and contradicted the experts predictions the global clothing and textile market did grow faster over the last two ears than before but there has not been the anticipated sharp shift in production to chin similarly while us clothing and textile imports continued to grow in 2005 and 2006 it is unclear if the end of the atc quotas was the main cause of that growth in addition while anecdotal evidence from the us clothing and tex tile industry indicates greater competition from china trade data and industry produc tion levels do not reveal clear evidence that the termination of the atc was major contributing factor to the recent loss of employment in the us clothing and textile industry one major factor complicating analysis of postatc clothing and textile trade was the decision by the united states and the european union to utilize available trade remedies to forestall the impact of end of quantitative restrictions on clothing and textile trade after the united stat imposed safeguard measures in 2004 and 2005 china and the united states negotiate d memorandum of understanding that continued quotas on selected items until 2008 for congress postatc clothing and textile trade has raised several issues it may choose to consider first congre ss may consider modifying current trade remedy laws particul arly those dealing with safegu ard measures and countervailing duties second congress may wish to exa mine in more detail the impact of the end of the atc quotas on the us clothing and tex tile industry third congress may also consider examining the effectiveness of various trade preference programs especially as they relate to clothing and textiles this report will be

60 of the harmonized system us clothing and textile trade with china and the world trends since the end of quotas the termination of over 40 years of quot as on january 1 2005 ushered in new era for the global trade in clothing and textiles1 an ad hoc multilateral system of quotas originally established as shor tterm measure to allow the united states and western europe to adjust to emerging competition from other parts of the world was finally coming to an end after 10 years of transition under the world trade organizations wto agreement on textiles and clothing atc international trade for clothing and textiles among wto members was to be longer subject to quantity restrictions precisely how the end of quotas would aff ect us clothing and textile trade was the subject of extensive research and some uncertainty while many studies predicted shift in clothing and textile production to quotaconstrained nations ie those which reached or came close to their quotas there was disagreement on the size and pace of the production shift nor was ther consensus on which nations would suffer decline in their clothing and textile exports as consequence of the end of the atc despite their differences in opinion on th overall impact of the end of the atc most studies concurred that one of the bi ggest beneficiaries w ould be the peoples republic of china china with its rge pool of lowcost skilled workers and abundant industrial capacity ch ina would be able to take advantage of the clothing and textile trade opportunities creat ed by the removal of quotas however the ability of china to expand its clothing and textile exports to the united states faced some constraints under the terms of chinas wto accession the united states and other wto members retained the option to impose safeguard measures on chinese clothing and textiles exports if they were proving disruptive to the domestic us clothing and textile markets plus if the united states could demonstrate that chinas clothing and textiles exports were being subsidized in an inappropriate manner or sold below cost the united states could impose countervailing or antidumping duties under existing us trade remedy laws on chinese exports this report examines recent trade statistic s to ascertain the initial effects of the end of quotas on us clothing and textile tr ade with china and the rest of the worldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs2 2 the lta itself replaced prior multilateral agreement known as the short term arrangement regarding international trade in cotton textileswhich was in effect from 1961 to 1963history of the agreement on textiles and clothing atc the international trade in textiles and clothing has long been subject to various forms of trade restrictions including quotas over the last 40 years there has been gradual reduction of these trade barriers generally under the auspices of either the wto or its predecessor the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt genesis of the atc in 1974 about 40 nations became partie s to the multifibre arrangement or mfa which replaced the long term agreement regarding international trade in cotton textiles lta signed under gatt in 19622 originally conceived as short term arrangement on the road to quotafree trade for clothing and textiles the mfa expanded the scope of the lta to in clude wool and ma nmade fibers however concerns about the economic wellbeing of domestic clothing and textile manufacturers in both more industrialized countries including the united states and less industrialized countries made it difficult to negotiate an end to the mfa as result the agreement was renegotiated four times over the next 20 years continuing the history of trade restraints on clothing and textiles in 1995 the agreement on textiles and clothing atc replaced the mfa starting 10year process of eliminating quotas for international trade in clothing and textiles the atcs quota phase out contained two concu rrent mechanisms designed to gradually eliminated quantitative restrictions on clothing and textile trade in theory this gradual transition period would allow clothing and textile manufacturers enough time to prepare for the more comp etitive global market of the postatc era table 1 quota phaseout mechanisms of the atc dateaccumulated share of clothing and textiles trade without quotasincrease in size of quota for clothing and textile trade still subject to quotas 1195 16 16 1198 33 251102 51 271105 100 full integration the two concurrent mechanisms of the atc quota phaseout involved the elimination of quotas in four stages ong with the simultaneous increase in quotahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs3 3 for example an article in dollars sens magazine septemberoctober 2005 on the end of the atc quotas was entitled falling off c liff alluding to both the potential negative effects on smaller clothing exporting nations and the structuring of the quota removal 4 general tariff rate is the rate levied upon imports from countries granted normal trade relations statuslimits for goods still under constraint see table 1 at the start of the years 1995 1998 2002 and 2005 parties to the atc would liminate quotas for prescribed percentage of their volume of trade in clot hing and textiles in addition for those products still subject to quotas parties to the atc would increase the quotas by prescribed percentage thereby opening their domestic markets to more imported goods the atc also required that products from different categories textiles and clothing wool cotton or manmade fibres etc be included in each of the four stages of the quota phaseout in part to ma ke it more difficult to protect particular segment of the clothing and tex tile industry during the transition while the quota phaseout process appeared relatively gradual in theory it was relatively abrupt in practice by selec ting less traded products andor products with underutilized quotas for integration in th first three stages market watchers maintain the united states and other nati ons were able to prolong the period of protection for product categories where domes tic manufacturers held larger market share until the final stage industry anal ysts at times referred to the final quota phaseout on january 1 2005 as cliff when the quota on the most of the more frequently traded products and the produc ts where existing quotas were typically fully utilized would be lifted3 the creation of the supposed quota cliff was considered both benefit and problem for domestic manufacturers if companies fully utilized the 10year window to make their operations more competitive and costefficient the maximization of the transition period would reduce the poten tial shock of opera ting in quotafree market however if companies procrastinated making adjustments the cliff only provided the companies with longer pe riod of protection and potentially greater shock with the quotas were lifted mitigating factors the potential impact of the atc on liberalizing clothing and textile trade is mitigated by three factors first the at c was limited only to the removal of quotas parties to the agreement c ould continue to impose impor t tariffs on clothing and textiles if nation set its import tariffs comparatively high then some foreign companies may still be kept out of the nations clothing and textile market and the domestic manufacturers may still be protected tariffs the current us tariff rates for clothing and textiles indicate that there may be some efforts to erect import barriers on selective basis see table 2 within the general tariff rates4 for each of the 14 chapters included in clothing and textiles there is significant variation fro m product to product cr eating fairly wide range of tariffs levied on clothing and textile imports in addition within eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs4 chapter the united states has peak tariff rates that may be imposed on imports in special circumstances table 2 us general and peak tariff rates for clothing and textile imports hs chapter general tariff rate range peak tariff rate 50 00 39 900 51 27 250 800 52 00 145

one of the chapters the lowest general tariff rate levied is zero percent however the highest general tariff rate ranges from 39 to 320 in addition the peak tariff rate varies acr oss the chapters from 600 to 1135 these general and peak tariff rates are comparatively high for the united states indicating general pattern of protection for the clot hing and textile market in addition the imposition of higher tariffs on specific items within each chapter is also indirect evidence of an effort to restrain the impor t of certain clothing and textile products safeguard measures second the atcs impact is mitigated because it does not prevent countries from utilizing safeguard measures as well as antidumping and counterva iling duty cases to block imports proposal in 2005 from 15 less industrialized countries to th wtos council of trade in goods calling for twoyear moratorium on antidumping cases after the termination of the atc was unable to secure the needed consensus in part due to objections from us and european clothing and textile manufacturers special provisions of chinas wto accession third as part of its accession to wto membersh ip in december 2001 china agreed to specialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs5 5 for more information on the china safeguards see crs report rl32168 safeguards on textile and apparel imports from china by vivian c jones 6 among these studies are us international trade commission textile and apparel assessment of the competitiveness of certain foreign s uppliers to the us market publication 3671 january 2004 the agreement on textiles and clothing impact on us cotton by stephen macdonald agapi somwar u leslie meyer and xinshen diao cotton continuedprovisions that allowed other wto members to utilize two safeguard mechanisms against chinese clothing and textile produc ts if the importing country believes that the chinese imports are causing or threatening to cause domestic market disruption5 the first safeguard mechanism is unique as it applies only to clothing and textile products second general safeguard mech anism applies to all chinese exports the clothing and textile specific safe guard mechanism can be invoked by any wto member by requesting consultation with china the simple act of requesting consultation immediately imposes quota on the product equal to 6 or 75 more than the amount imported over the previous 12 months even if there is agreement with china on the safeguard measure the wto member has the option to continue to enforce the import quota there is requirement for wto notification nor are there provisions for multilatera l surveillance these quotas can only be imposed for oneyear without chinas agreement this safeguard mechanism is only available until december 31 2008 brazil colombia the european union and the united states have made use of this provision the general safeguard mechanism is available until december 10 2013 in this case the wto member must notify the wtos committee on safeguards in contrast to the first safeguard mechanism safeguard measures may only be imposed after consultations or in critical circumstances where provisional measures are considered justified also for this category of safeguard measures the wto member has the option of imposing quotas tariffs or other forms of import restrictions plus whereas the clothing and textile specific measures are limited to 12 months the general safeguard measures can be imposed for up to three years because of the possible utilization of various safeguard mechanisms and the continued option to maintain tariffs and other nontariff trade barriers the atc did not fully bring about free trade for clot hing and textiles instead it eliminated one mechanism and arguably the main mech anism whereby countries altered trade patterns for clothing and textiles as result it was reasonable to expect significant change in the international trade in clothing and textiles after the termination of the all atc quotas on january 1 2005 prognostications for postatc trade not surprisingly there were number of studies done to predict what would happen to the international trade in clothing and textiles after the elimination of quotas prior to the termination of the atc on january 1 20056 these studieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs6 6 continued and wool situation and outlook cws 2001 economic

unavailable at the time this report was writtengenerally agreed that there would be shift in production to quotaconstrained countries but differed on the amount and sp eed of the shift china was repeatedly cited in these studies as major bene ficiary of the termination of quotas in summary there was fairly broad c onsensus on several aspects of clothing and textile trade after the termination of the atc analysts generally agreed that global trade in clothing and textiles would grow more quickly after the removal of quotas china and india would increase their market shares for both clothing and textile exports but there was consensus on the amount of this increase estimates for china varied from 3 to 10 the united states would import more of its clothing and textiles from china ranging from onethird twothirds of its imports us clothing and textile manufacturers would reduce their operations shut down factories and lay off workers due to increased competition from china india and other suppliers one study estimated up to 63000 job losses due to chinese imports preferential trade arrangements may buffer the impact of the quota removal for clothing and textile manufacturers in the caribbean south and central america the middle east and africa there is possibility that the united states the eu and other wto members may impose trade remedies in response to the increase in imports from china india and other asian suppliers changes in global trade flows global trade figures for clothing provid partial confirmation of the experts predictions for gains for china and india

romania experienced slight decline of little over 90 million while us clothi ng exports dipped by about 61 million for the initial year of the postatc era global trade in clothing appears to be less story of shifting producti on as one of emerging centers of growth while south korea and taiwan both modest exporters of clothing when the atc was in effect experienced export declines of 239 and 200 respectively most of the major clothing exporters did not see sharp drop in their exports instead they witnessed modest export increases while most of the growth in clothing trade was concentrated in china and to lesser extent indiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs8 global textile trade experienced similar change as clothing but with more major winners and different group of losers see table 4

south koreas textiles expor ts slipped by 41 between 2004 and 2005 while japan and taiwan had their exports diminish by 33 belgium and france also experienced minor falloffs in their textile exports in 2005 in summary although both clothing and xtile production did shift to china and india in 2005 it was not as dramatic shift as some experts had predicted instead the data appears to indicate that existing clothing and textile operations continued to produce and export in 2005 at about the same levels that they did in 2004 however increases in production tended to occur in china and in india httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs9 9 world trade organization international trade statistic 2006 table iv76 and iv84 us clothing and textile trade with china and the world as indicated in table 3 and

united states imported over 80 billion in clothing and nearly 23 billion in textiles in 2005 more than any other wto member in both categories9 one significant difference between the global and us clothing and textile trade is the relative size of the two markets for the global market the trade in textiles is roughly threequarters the size of trade in clothing however in the us market total trade in textiles is about twofifths th size of total trade in clothing and the value of us clothing imports is about four times the size of textile imports table 5 us net trade flows for clothing and

imports between 2004 and 2005 and an pparent carryover effect between 2005 and 2006 for clothing there was sharp increase in clothing imports from china in 2005 seemingly at the expense of mexico for textiles china was again the main beneficiary in 2005 and it aly and pakistan were the main losershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs10 10 because the united states utilizes different method for evaluating imports and exports in its official trade statistics the values found in tables in this section differ from those listed in tables 3 4 and 5 for an explanation of the different definitions used by the united states and their effects on international comparisons of trade data see crs report rs22640 whats the difference comparing us and chinese trade data by michael f martin postatc clothing and textile imports the view from the united states10 since 1990 there has been rapid growth in us clothing imports but comparatively modest increases in textile imports see table 6 between 1990 and 2006 us clothing imports rose by 590 b illion or an average annual growth rate of 142 textile imports by contrast increased by 73 billion or an average annual growth rate of 76 as result the value of us clothing imports in 2006 was over six times the value of textile imports the pattern of clothing and textile import growth is also worth noting for both clothing and textiles the biggest yearonyear increases did not occur in years where quotas were pha sed out as predicted by the experts in addition while the average annual growth rate for clothing imports during the phasing out of quotas 19952005 was slightly higher than the years 1991 1994 the average annual growth rate for textile imports was actually wer during the elimina tion of quotas plus both clothing and textiles experienced yearon year declines in 2001 possibly indicating that the events of september 11 2001 may ve had greater effect on us clothing and textile trade than the termination of the atc table 6

textile imports since 1990 were similar to the pattern for clothing imports previously major sources of textiles were surpassed by countries that we re well behind the frontrunners in 1990 however the pattern for textile imports differs from clothing imports in two ways first while china has risen to the top supplier of us textile imports it is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs13 dominating the market like it is for clothi ng second the other top textile suppliers are not experiencing absolute declines in their sales to the united states as has been the case with clothing table 8 lists the

million respectively between 1997 and 2006 impact of the quota phase out as previously stated the elimination of clothing and textile quotas was done in f our phases starting in 1995 and ending in 2005 each party to the atc including th united states was to specify when its existing quotas would be eliminated if the existing quotas were constraining imports their removal should cause subseque nt increase in imports us trade data for phases 2 3 and 4 of the atc quota rem oval reveals more complicated pattern see figure 1 11 figure 1 presents indices of us clothing and textile imports separated into three groups according to when their quot was eliminated for goods included in phase 2 there was apparent increase in the growth of imports following the elimination of their quotas on january 1 1998 similarly products included in phase 3 did not jump sharply after the elimina tion of their quotas on january 1 2002 items included in phase 4 did show modest growth spurt in 2005 but then sharply declined in 2006 in general figure 1 seemingly does not support the idea that the elimination of the quotas was the primary f actor leading to significantly increased us clothing and textile imports however there were several mitigating factors that complicate the analysis source us department of commerce office of textile and apparel otexa the first mitigating factor is chinas accession to the wto in december 2001 as part of becoming wto member china was granted normal trade relations ntr status by the united states which liberalized us import policies towards chinese goods in general independent of the atc quota removals chinas ntr status may have caused an increase in chinese imports including clothing and textile imports second mitigating factor was the economic impact of the attacks of september 11 2001 on us imports yearonyear u s merchandise imports in 2001 declined by 11 billion in october 15 billion in november and 17 billion december monthly import volumes did not post yearonyear increase until april 2002 and did not surpass monthly 2000 levels until december 200212 third mitigating factor which will be discussed below was the imposition of us safeguard measures on selected chinese clothing and textile imports before and after phase 4 of the atc quota elimination these safe guard measures ostensibly imposed to protect the united states from market disruptions may havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs16 13 for more information on the differences betw een us and chinese trade statistics see crs report rs22640 whats the difference comparing us and china trade data by michael f martin 14 hs63 includes such items as bed linens blanke ts curtains tarpaulins and worn clothingconstrained chinese imports and thereby obscured the effects of quota removals on clothing and textile trade flows interpreting us trade data overall there are six trends in the us trade data that are of particular note first us clothing imports grew faster than textile imports over the last 10 years second th growth in clothi ng imports accelerated starting in 2003 third the yearonyear in crease in clothing and textile imports between 2004 and 2005 was not significantly gr eater than the years before and after fourth for both clothing and textile imports china and india rose among the leading suppliers fifth the rise of china and india as sources of clothing and textile imports has not meant major decline in imports from other leading suppliers instead the other major sources of clothing and textile imports have by and large maintained the value of their exports to the united states but have lost market share due to the increase in us clothing imports sixth u s import data when sorted by the phased elimination of quotas does not show signif icant surges in imports following the termination of quotas for two of the three phases considered postatc clothing and textile exports the view from china according to official us trade statistics china began its rise to become the top supplier of clothing and textiles for its top trading partner with the start of the new millennium it appears that the combined effects of chinas accession to the wto in december 2001 and the phase d termination of the atc removed trade barriers that had previously prevented china from exporting more clothing and textiles to the united states however for various reasons official us trade statistics and official chinese trade statistics differ and on ccasion differ quite dramatically13 an examination of chinas official statistics can determine if they also see similar rapid rise in clothing and textile trade with the united states also by analyzing chinas clothing and textiles exports in general it is possible to determine if the r ecent increase in exports is unique to chinas trade with the united states or more general phenomena chinas clothing exports to the united states and the world figure 2 provides look at chinas clothing exports to the united states over the last 10 years from chinas perspective for each year total clothing exports are divided into its three hs chapters knitted appare l hs61 woven apparel hs62 and miscellaneous articles made with textiles hs6314 in general chinas clothing export data is similar in scale and trend to us data there are few minor differences however the united states reports about 2 billion more in clothing imports from china from 1997 to 2004 with the gap narrowing in 2005 and 2006 also the chines data shows rather dramatic spikehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs17 in clothing exports in 2005 the first year af ter the termination of the atc while the us data has smoother increase in chinese clothing imports from 2003 to 2006 while these differences may seem minor they may have political implications that will be discussed later in this report source global trade atlas having established that the chinese data also reveal recent jump in clothing exports to the united states it is impor tant to determine if this is unique phenomena with the united states or if ch inas clothing exports are on the rise in general figure 3 compares the rise in chinas clothing exports to the united states to its total clothing exports the graph reveals two key characteristics of the relationship between chinas clothing exports to the united states and its clothing exports to the world first the united states captures small but growin g portion of chinas clothing exports in 1997 the united states received 98 of chinas clothing exports in 2006 it represented 180 of its clothing export market second chinas total clothing exports have risen rather steadily since 2002 but its exports to the united states have grown in more uneven fashion clothing ex ports to the united states

to 2001 tex tile exports to the united states were nearly stagnant resulting in decline in the portion of chinas textiles shipped to the united states from 42 to 37 from 2001 to 2004 exports to the

53 of chin as total textile ex ports in 2006 textile exports to the united states increased by about 100 million and its market share declined to 47 comparing us and chinese data chinas clothing and textile trade data provides picture of sinous trade flows that is generally consistent with u s trade data both countries report rapid growth in clothing and textile trade over the last 10 years with notable increases following the termination of the atc china and the united states have chinas clothing and textile exports making quantum jump in 2005 with subsequent growth slowdown in 2006 however both countries also reveal that the growth in chinas clothing and textiles exports predates the termination of the atc for both clothing and textiles there is notable stepping up of trade levels between 2001 and 2002 with the higher growth rate continuing until 2004 plus following the apparent one time jump in 2005 the yearonyear increase in us clothing and textile imports from china in 2006 declined to 36 billion similar to annual increases from 1991 to 1995 the data from the two nations also rev eal differences between clothing and textile trade whereas china has become an increasingly important source of us clothing and textile imports china is the clear market leader for clothing but faces continued competition from canada in the textile market from the chinese perspective the us market increased in importance over the last 10 years but in the textile market the united states remains comparatively small and possibly declining outlet for chinas textile exports one possible interpretation of the trade data is that the united states is more dependent on importing clothing and textiles from china than china is dependent on exporting its clothing and textiles to the united states according to the data this possible reliance may be more pronounced for cl othing than for textiles if true this may have implications for the effectiveness of us pressure on china to redress the growing bilateral trade imbalance by imposing trade remedies on chinas clothing and textiles exports impact on us clothing and textile industry besides the potential effect on the us international trade balance any increase in clothing and textiles imports brought bout by the termination of the atc could have an impact on the us clothing and xtile industry faced with an increase in the import of clothing and textile produc ts some us manufacturers may longerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs20 be as competitive as before and cut back or cease operations and dismiss some or all of their workers while it is relatively early statistics for the us clothing and textile industry provide mixed evidence on the impact of the atc quota elimination on domestic clothing and textile manufacturing and employment domestic production trends figure 5 shows the gross value of us clothing and textile production employ ment by us clothing and textile manufacturers from 1990 to 2005 the value of clothing and textile production rose between 1990 and 1997 but employment dec lined starting in 1998 both production and employment for both us clothing and textile manufacturers began to decline source us bureau of economic analysis us department of labor although the recent decreases in domestic clothing and textile production and employment is largely concurrent with the removal of atc quotas the timing and pace of these decreases raises some doubts bout the significance of apparent correlation domestic clothi ng production was largely unc hanged after the phase 1 quotas were eliminated and the value of xtile output actually increased also the largest yearonyear reducti on in textile production and the second largest declines in clothing pr oduction occurred in 2001 not year in which quotas were lifted plus while the value of us clothing production has continued its sharp decline since 2001 textile production s nearly leveled off domestic clothing and textile labor trends also pose problems in analyzing the impact of the quota removal but for di fferent reasons there was notable downward trend in domestic clothing and textile employment even before the

and largest quota removal in 2005 for the textile indus try the pace of staff reductions began to pick up after the second quota remova l in 1998 implying that the first quota removal had little impact on the i ndustrys employment situation while the concurrent decline in the production and employment of the us clothing and textile industry with the rise in clothing and textile imports during the phasing out of the quotas may be interpre ted as evidence of an adverse impact on us manufacturers statistical analys is raises some doubt about such an interpretation because ther was preexisting secular decline in the us industry the staged removal of quotas might or might not have been contributing factor in the actual production decline from 1998 to 2005 econometric models examining the relationship between domestic production and imports of clothing and textiles provided mixed results15 anecdotal evidence while the international trade data and domestic industry data provide rath er ambiguous results on the possible impact of quota elimination on the us clothing and textile industry there is fairly extensive pool of anecdotal evidence that th recent increase in clothing and textile impor ts have had deleterious effect on us manufacturers in april 2005 report on textile safeguard procedures the government accountability office gao pointed to secular increases in monthly brassiere and sock imports from china as evidence of the domestic market disruption cau sed by the removal of quotas16 however in neither case did the gao report provide dir ect evidence that the sharp increase in imports resulted in drop in us bra ssiere or sock production or employment us clothing and textile manufacturers and their representatives often cite spikes in the import of certain produc ts frequently imports from china as evidence to establish that the removal of quotas has harmed the domestic industry for example june 2003 press release by coalition of us clothing and textile

available to the united states on clothing and textiles from china see crs report rl32168 safeguards on textile and apparel imports from china by vivian c jonescoalition claimed that chinese imports of decontrolled categories of clothing and textiles had increased 400 in 15 months and as result china already has captured 40 of the us market in those decontrolled categories and is projected to take between 65 and 75 by the end of the year18 the next sentence then connects the rise in chinese imports to the domestic industry saying to avoid further devastating plant closings and j ob losses the us government must move immediately to selfinitiate the special chinese textile safeguard on sensitive textile and apparel categories19 as will be explained below the united states had already started this process before this letter arrived at the white house increased competition from china need not necessarily take the form of increased imports it can also come in the form of price competition for some products for example although the overa ll import price indices for clothing and textiles increased during the phasing out of the atc quotas the import price index for made up or worn textile items d ecreased from 1049 in january 1995 to 945 in january 200720 even without an increase in the quantity of imports us manufacturers may be pressu red to reduce production costs and eliminate jobs due to decreases in the market prices of th eir products caused by lower import prices imposition of us safeguards the sharp rise in clothing and textile imports from china after 2001 led to the united states invoking safeguard pr ovision included in chinas wto accession agreement21 according to the accession agreement the united states may impose import quotas of textiles and clothing fro m china if the increase in the value of shipments from china causes market disruption in the united states the terms of the agreement allow the united states to act unilaterally for one year after which it must consult with the china in order to continue the quotas this special safeguard provision for chinese clothing and xtile imports expires on december 31 2008 the legal authority

interpreted the excess quotahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs26 as evidence that the fear of second surge was misplaced and that the market adjustments to the termination of the atc took place in 2005 others however believe that us importers became very risk adverse in 2006 and intentionally avoiding purchasing constrained pr oducts from chinese suppliers in 2006 interpreting pre and postatc trade in general the trade data confirm many of the predictions by the market analysts prior to the termination of the atc quotas global clothing and textile trade is growing more rapidly after 2005 than it did before 2005 and china is major beneficiary of the greater growth china secured nearly threequarters of the yearon year increase in clothing trade between 2004 and 2005 and its increase in textiles exports between 2004 and 2005 was slightly greater than the total rise on global textiles trade plus as predicted the united states is importing more of its clothing and textiles from china however when examined more closely there are patterns in the trade data that either were not anticipated or are not consistent with some of the analysts predictions for example while there has been the expected market growth both in the global and us market the fores een major shifts in production have not occurred instead the data suggests that most nations were able to maintain the value of their clothing and textiles exports after the termination of the atc quotas possibly indicating that the preferential trade programs were helping some nations clothing and textile trade however most countries were unable to significantly increase their exports while china and to lesser extent india were able to expand their exports in other words china was able to increase its share of the global and us clothing and textile markets by capturing most of the market growth also the surge in chinese clothing and textile exports in 2005 was smaller than many analysts suggested it would be for example chinas shares of the us clothing and textile markets in 2006 291 for clothing and 149 for textiles is well below the levels projected by the atmi study this in part may be due to the imposition of safeguard measures in 2005 and 2006 however the under utilization of the uschina mou quotas in 2006 may indicate that much of the increase in chinese clothing and textile exports has passed similarly us clothing and trade data and industry figures for the us clothing and textile industry present mixed pictur of the impact of the end of the atc quotas on us clothing and textile produc tion and employment the value of us clothing textile production rose during the initial stages of the atc quota phase out with the major declines starting afte r chinas wto accession by contrast employment for both the clothing and xtile industry declined steadily from 1990 to 2005 but not necessarily concu rrently with the elimination of quotas as previously discussed the us utilization of safeguard measures may have mitigated some of the negative impact of the termination of the atc quotas however the fact that the 2006 quotas were not fully used would seem to indicate that the safeguards are not necessarily preventing chinese imports from subplanting us manufacturers and workers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34106crs27 23 chinese textile exporters to face new us probe

unanticipated and perhaps unpredic table trend in the us trade data was the substantial rise in clothing and textile imports starting prior to the end of the atc quotas in the clothing market us total imports jumped by 58 billion in 2003 touching off fouryear run of rapid in creases in the textile market the big increase in total imports occurred in 2004 not in 2005 or 2006 besides the possible effects of the safeguard measures another possible expl anation for the pre atc termination growth was china s accession to the wto in december 2001 one final prediction that proved to be comparatively accurate was the use of trade remedies by the united states yet there are two aspects of the use of trade remedies that the analysts did not foretell first the preemptive petitioning of the cita for safeguard measures prior to january 1 2005 was unprecedented second following the announced preliminary c ountervailing duty decision by the us department of commerce on chinese coated paper there are reports that coalition of us clothing and textile companies is consulting with lawy ers about initiating claim against chinese clothing and textile imports23 implications for congress the termination of atc quotas in 2005 and the ensuing growth of clothing and textile imports regardless of any causal relationship between the two events have added clothing and textile trade to growing list of bilateral trade issues between the united states and china to limited degree the accelerated growth in chinese clothing and textiles exports to the united states over the last few years has contributed to mounting us bilateral trade deficit24 one of the unanswered questions raised by the imposition of quotas under the uschina mou is if there will be sur ge in chinese imports if the quotas lapse at the end of 2008 if there is such surge it is also uncertain if us manufacturers will choose to re spond by petitioning the cita for the imposition of safeguard measures under the general safeguard mech anism available until 2013 or pursue the matter with the us international tr ade commission by requesting countervailing duties in either case current trends in the us clothing and textile markets dovetail with several legal issues th at congress may choose to ddress seve ral bills have already been introduced hr 708 hr 1229 and s 974 that address the application of

manufacturers and workers may seek trade adjustment assistance27 on march 28 2007 the trade adjustment assistance reform act of 2007 hr 1729 was introduced seeking to amend the trade act of 1974 to provide gr eater eligibility for clothing and textile workers for assistance as well as to in crease federal funding for the assistance program finally the apparent ability of most nations to preserve their clothing and textile export volumes to the united states despite the rise in chinese goods may signal that the various trade promotion programs are pr oving beneficial programs such as gsp the andean trade preference act and the carribean basin initiative may protect and promote the development of competitive in dustries in less indus trialized nations similarly free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement may help provide the edge clothing and textile manufacturers in beneficiary countries need to compete ag ainst chinese suppliers with several of these trade preference programs coming up for renewal and number of free trade agreements possibly coming up for ratification congress may wish to consider the case of the clothing and textile industry in the postatc era as part of their deliberations
