on china classified by classified by deputy chief of mission david s sedney reasons 14 bd summary 1 c china wants the united states government to take action to get google to reduce the resolution of the google earth images of chinas military nuclear space energy and other sensitive government agency installations in order to deprive terrorists of potentially dangerous information xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx told the dcm on xxxxxxxxxxxx said the beijing request was based on possible grave consequences if terrorists exploit the information to harm china google earth is private company the dcm reminded xxxxxxxxxxxx was noncommittal on whether china would directly contact google or the european imagery providers and the other sources of high resolution imagery on the internet other countries have shared similar concerns with china xxxxxxxxxxxx said but he refused to divulge country names end summary google earth high resolution images threat to china 2 c google earth is providing high resolution images of sensitive chinese facilities over the internet thereby endangering prc national security xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx told the dcm during xxxxxxxxxxxx meeting these facilities include military installations nuclear test sites satellite launch sites oil production facilities power generating plants and important government departments the resolution is one meter for most of china and is as fine as 06 meters in beijing and shanghai allowing anyone with internet access to view these facilities in great detail moreover google earth allows users to post information about specific locations xxxxxxxxxxxx continued which means information about important chinese agencies and sensitive installations is effectively being published on the internet grave consequences if terrorists use imagery 3 c xxxxxxxxxxxx said china is extremely concerned that terrorist organizations could access the high resolution imagery and posted information and present grave threat to prc national security if terrorists used the imagery from google earth to cause damage to china there would be grave consequences warned xxxxxxxxxxxx in the spirit of our sound bilateral cooperative relationship particularly on counterterrorism issues xxxxxxxxxxxx asked that the united states place great importance on chinas concerns understand the sensitivity of the matter and take action so that google will reduce the resolution of the images of chinas sensitive facilities dcm google private company and not imagery source 3 c the dcm told xxxxxxxxxxxx that he would report the request to washington but noted that google is private company the dcm said he had information to offer on what if any role or response the united states government might have to the chinese presentation the dcm noted that the chinese points only asked for reduction in the resolution and asked if the chinese sought any specific level the dcm also asked whether xxxxxxxxxxxx had contacted google directly and since google purchases the imagery as any individual or entity can whether china had contacted the satellite imagery providers xxxxxxxxxxxx other unspecified countries have similar concerns 4 c xxxxxxxxxxxx responded that china is approaching the united states government because the issue is directly relevant to counterterrorism and that while google is private company it operates in the united states political and legal environment china is requesting the united states take action to prevent the information from being misused to cause damage to china xxxxxxxxxxxx reiterated he offered that china had been in discussions with other countries with similar concerns about google earth however xxxxxxxxxxxx refused to provide the names of the other countries noting he was unable to share the information due to prior agreements with beijing 00023571 002 of 002 those countries europe the source of imagery but google earth is the key 5 c china will talk to google about the technical details xxxxxxxxxxxx continued adding that it is not for the mfa to determine the appropriate resolution level china knows the source data comes from european companies satellite operators and the european space agency but xxxxxxxxxxxx said china sees google as the problem because it makes the information easily accessible when pressed xxxxxxxxxxxx admitted that beijing had not yet contacted the european providers or the governments associated with the european space program xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx said that while china will look at the other internet sources of the high resolution imagery googles well known imagery is of greatest concern randt
