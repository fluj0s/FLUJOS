8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673coastal louisiana attempting to restore an ecosystem introduction about 15000 acres of wetlands in coastal louisiana are being lost each year as they are converted to open water some of the factors identified as causing this conversion such as dredging channels for oil and gas pipelines are result of human activities while others such as land subsidence are result of either natural causes or mix of natural and human causes federal public works projects for flood control and navigation have c ontributed to these losses which have major ecological economic and social costs while these costs are concentrated in louisiana they can affect the regional and nati onal economy as coastal louisiana is bisected by the mississippi river and is the site of significant commercial and recreational seafood harvests and substantial amount of oil and gas enters the national distribution system through this region halting or reversing these trends will take time and be expensive since the wetland loss problem was initia lly recognized about 35 years ago several federal agencies the state and cal universities have been wo rking to better understand why these losses are occurring and how to effectively slow and eventually reverse this process numerous projects with sites pecific restoration benefits have been initiated especially since legislation in creased federal funds in the early 1990s these projects are neutralizing conditions that lead to loss at some sites and are reestablishing some wetlands federal agenci and the state have started to consider these projects within the context of more systematic approach to wetland restoration throughout the region in the past several years congress continues to cons ider legislative options to address wetlands loss in coastal louisiana in these deliberations it will be able to draw from july 2004 us army corps of engineers corps st udy that looks at the region in more systematic fashion and iden tifies possible remedies some legislative proposals would authorize specific restoration project s or activities or further examination of the causes and effects of loss other pr oposals would dedicate so federal revenues from offshore oil and gas development to restoration efforts among the many questions congress may examine are is this wetland loss local state or national problem what options are available to respond to this problem how much would each option cost and what would it accomplish what portion of the cost should the federal government pay what roles should the federal government and the state play in restoration this report reviews physical changes in coastal louisiana emphasizing the rate of wetlands losses and the problems that result from these losses it reviews

blackandwhite format 2 coastal louisiana is generally the area that th state has defined to be in its coastal zone and encompasses almost 30 of the stateefforts to understand and respond to these phy sical changes the report then reviews the us army corps of engineers current draft restoration pla n it discusses what success might mean in the context of coastal louisiana and compares what is proposed to some other efforts to restore rge ecosystems it concludes by reviewing relevant legislation considered by the 108th congress the problems in coastal louisiana coastal louisiana is fragile landscape where wetlands are easily altered by human actions or changes in physical processes it is also dynamic landscape where large changes can occur rapidly in recent decades the most pronounced change has been that this area is losing coastal wetlands at rapid but slowing rate wetlands have changed to open water open water is far less productive ecosystem providing less habitat for many plant nd animal species and producing less biomass including species of commercial or recreational importance than wetlands wetlands also buffer inland areas and development from ocean storms while open water increases exposure to these storms ex posure puts personal property and community infrastructure as well as pipelines and other energy infrastructure that is concentrated in this area at greater risk the parties that will participate in the restoration effort agree that the overall goal will be to stabilize and then expand the wetland acreage this goal can be accomplished by some combination of slowing the rate of loss at some sites and reestablishing wetlands at other sites corollary to this goal may be that the greatest program benefits will result in the largest net increase in wetlands rates of loss of wetlands have been tracked by scientists for more than 25 years they have used information about the cau ses rates and patte rns of loss to make projections through 2050 past and project ed changes are shown in map produced by the us geological survey usgs these changes include both land loss and gain1 this map shows three important characteristics of change in wetland acres it shows that past and future land loss is not occurring uniformly across the breadth of coastal louisiana but rather is concentrated near the mouth of the mississippi river it also shows that the total loss is the sum of losses occurring at many sites that are often small and largely disconnected from each other but that in total add up to significant number of acres and significant damage to the ecosystem it also shows that there are significant gains in few locations the landscape the landscape of coastal louisi ana which is has four major elements wetlands barriers and beaches uplands and open waters2 all these landscape elements are affected not only by the ocean but also by the mississippihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs3 3 unless otherwise noted all the data used to describe this landscape come from the us army corps of engineers louisiana coastal area ec osystem restoration study draft july 2004 hereafter referred to as draf t corps ecosystem restoration

nd sometimes flood waters into many parts of coastal louisiana the m outh of the river where it builds up delta by depositing sediment from the entire watershed has migrated several times to different locations along coastal louisiana in recent centuries and would likely do so again if not for the dike levee and flood control projects built by the corps that combine to contain it within the current channel3 wetlands have been the dominant feature in coastal louisiana the usgs and louisianas department of natural resources estimate th at louisiana has about 37 million acres of coastal wetlands4 while the corps has calculated that wetlands occupy 35 million acres or 423 of the re storation project study area coastal wetlands nearest the ocean exist in waters with high salinity salinity levels drop as one moves away from the ocean or closer to source of freshwater such as watershed drainage scien tists generally subdivide loui sianas coastal wetlands into subgroups each supports habitat for diffe rent mixes of plant and animal species every type can be highly productive in the july 2004 corps study six subgroups were identified 898000 acres of wetla nd forestswamp 107700 acres of wetland scrub 860000 acres of freshwater marsh 658900 acres of intermediate marsh 547600 acres of brackish marsh and 423400 acres of saline marsh5 the narrow string of coastal barriers and beaches are an insignificant amount of the total area in coastal louisiana certainly less than 1 but they provide critical buffer for the wetlands they prot ect the wetlands and upland areas from the full force of ocean waves and fl ood waters cean salinity and wind rather than one continuous barrier beach system along the entire coast of louisiana there are several distinct barrier systems thes barriers also provide important habitat barrier islands and beaches are composed of unconsolidated sediments and adjust rapidly in response to ocean forces currently several portions are eroding rapidly experiencing some of the high est land loss rates in the nation6 within the coastal wetlands and landward of the wetlands are moreelevated uplands characterized by different vegetation7 these uplands are the sites of most settlement and commercial enterprise in coastal louisiana these moreelevated areas come in several different forms ba sed on the geologic processes by which they were created uplands total only 242300 acr or 29 of the study area open water is rapidly increasing in the study area as the 15000 acres of wetlands being lost each year transition to this c ondition open water nowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs4 8 as the mouth of the river and the delta that forms at the mouth has migrated several times in the past 7000 years many locations along the central portion of the states coast have undergone periods of both widespread and rapid growth followed by extensive erosion and subsidence geologists identify seven dis tinct deltas and within the current one four distinct sediment complexes that have formed since 1839 encompasses 45 million acres or 547 of the study area much of this expansion is in ponds that were formerly coastal fresh water or intermediate marshes erosion that causes shorelines of existing ponds to expand has ranged up to distance of 1000 feet according to the corps rapid change coastal louisiana is extremely dynamic from geological standpoint as each of the major landscape ements can change rapidly change can be rapid because the forces that affect the landscape strike frequently in geologic time and are very powerful and because th is landscape is especially vulnerable to these forces of change the two main fo rces are hurricanes from the gulf of mexico and flood waters draining out of the missi ssippi river watershed these forces can breach the coastal barrier and beach system s inundate large areas of lowlying land and destroy large wetland areas these natural processes and the physical changes they cause are frequently in conflict with human uses and values which depend in part on stable and unchanging coastal environment before the major navigation and flood control projects were built along the river land building processes were dominant where it emptied into the gulf and deposited diments originating from throughout the drainage basin while shoreline receding pro cesses were prevalent in areas where the inflow of sediment was less than was needed to sustain the coastal land forms8 these major projects have fostered co mmercial development by reducing flooding and maintaining navigation however they also have limited th amount of sediment reaching the mouth of the river and accelerated the velocity of flow contributing to coastal instability by reducing the amount of sediment deposited in coastal louisiana and pushing larger portion of that sedime nt beyond the delta and offshore part of the challenge of the restoration then is to create or maintain coastal ecosystem that functions as relatively stable physical environment in dynamic setting coastal barrier and beach systems are very responsive to the dynamic forces affecting coastal louisiana they depend on the river as source of material to build and stabilize the coastline these system s which include the entire beach system from dunes on the land side to sand bars offs hore are already unstable and any rise in sea level or additional subsidence will ex acerbate these changes especially in an extremely flat area like coastal louisiana changes can show up very quickly in the condition of coastal barriers and beaches the deterioration or loss of these buffers exposes coastal wetlands to ocean forces ch as waves and to physical conditions especially higher salinity levels that hasten their demise land losses most of the land that is being lost to open water is coastal wetlands louisiana has 30 of all the coastal marsh one category of coastal wetland in the coterminous 48 states but currently accounts for 90 of all coastal marsh losses according to the usgs usgs estimates that the state has lost abouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs5 9 all loss estimates were calculated by the usgss national wetlands research center which has published number of reports describing past and predicted loss rates the center has produced color map of past 19322000 and predicted 20002050 land losses and gains information about this ma p and web address are in footnote 1 10 one channel in particular the 76 mile mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo constructed in the 1960s to shorten the trip between new orleans and the gulf is estimated to have caused the loss of almost 20000 acres of wetlands modifying or even closing it will likely be an important component of any restorati on plan and is in the july 2004 draft proposal122 million acres of coastal wetland in the past 70 years which is roughly equivalent to the area of delaware additional studi show that the rate of loss has been slowing averaging more than 28000 acres annually between 1956 and 1978 about 22000 acres between 1978 and 1990 and bout 15 000 acres betw een 1990 and 2000 recent usgs projection of future losses forecasts that an additional 448000 acres could be lost by 2050 if further ac tions are taken to halt or reverse current processes9 if there were further changes to current programs these losses would be partially offset by gains that ar estimated to total about 103000 acres from restoration projects that are already unde rway and from natural processes in some locations one partial explanation for why the amount of loss is slowing is that much less remains to be lost than was th ere 70 years ago although the average annual decline as portion of the remaining wetlands has been falling as well the major causes of these losses are know n in composite some of these are natural others are manmade and the remainder are natural causes amplified by human activity these frequently articulated causes include the land very thick layer of uncons olidated sediment deposited by the mississippi river is subsiding sea level is rising oil and gas deposits are being wit hdrawn which can cause additional subsidence dams and diversions throughout the ssissippi river wate rshed have greatly reduced the amount of sediment that reaches coastal louisiana where it could have replenished and built up the wetlands levees along the river to provide flood protection limit periodic flooding into the marshes that had brought additiona l sediment and nutrients and canals and channels that provide navigation through the wetlands for oil and gas industries and others in total they traverse hundreds of miles cause disruptions to the movement of water and nutrients and facilitate salt water intrusion boat traffic using them generates additional shoreline erosion10 it is difficult to allocate wetland loss among these causes one reason for this challenge is that relationships among these factors vary from location to location for example the western coastal area of the state is different geologically than the central and eastern areas where the past and present deltas are located second reason is the considerable uncertainty as to how some of these factors relate to each other for example canals that traverse coastal louisiana northsouth create direct pathways that allow salt water to penetrate into the fresh and brackish water marshes while eastwest canals disrupt the hydrology by creating barriers to flows but few ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs6 11 unless otherwise noted data in this s ubsection come from 2003 report to congress on the effectiveness of breaux act projects titled breaking new ground in louisiana prepared by the louisiana coastal wetlands

subcommittee on water resource s and environment july 15 2004 hearing on the corps proposalsthese flow in single direction and eith er due northsouth or eastwest third reason is that major changes are often di ctated by periodic and unpredictable big events such as landfalls by major hurricanes or the infrequent changes in the location of the mouth of the mississippi river fo r instance many hydrologists believe that the river is trying to change course again so that the main stem would empty into the atchafalaya basin to the west of the cu rrent mouth bypassing both new orleans and the current delta to the south of the city all these natural processes and human modifications work in different combinations at different locations with result that all of coastal louisiana is not becoming open water at an equal pace th few places where sediment is accreting and wetlands are slowly building are the exceptions and encompass only small fraction when compared to the sites that ar losing land in some areas land loss has already been extensive and marshes and wetlands are already largely converted according to the corps analysis the areas with the greatest overall land loss are around the mouth of the mississippi river wh ere most of the development that has modified the natural environment is concentrated as are the physical processes associated with the draining river scientists have greatly improved understanding of the physical processes by which wetlands are converted into open water since they started studying them more than three decades ago they understand how these causes combine to change the landscape of coastal wetlands in this area they have determined for example that the effect of the loss varies the narrow bands where the wetlands and the water environment intersect called edge habitat can be highly productive edge habitat temporarily increases as marsh breaks apart so populations that depend on this habitat temporarily increase as well but as fragmented marsh continues to be converted into open water the amount of edge habitat available decreases and the populations that depend on that marsh and on the edge habitat eventually collapse the costs of wetlands loss11 the losses of wetla nds have costs both to the people and economic activity that depend directly on th is area and to broader ecosystems and enterprise more generally these losses have already harmed some economic activities centered in this area including fisheries oil and gas industries and facilities associated with ports and navigation more generally and those effects are likely to grow unless industry makes additional investments to protect their facilities economic activ ity is substantial in this area one measure of this is that investment in coastal louisian is estimated to total 100 billion12 oil and gas facilities include many production storage processing and di stribution facilities and the area is bisected by numerous pi pelines most of the nearly 3000 miles of channels in the coastal wetlands some for deep draft vessels and others for shallowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs7 13 breaking new ground in louisiana p8 14 all the forecasts

the countrys offshore oil and gas is produced off this coast nd 25 of the foreign and domestic oil used in this country comes ashore through coastal louisiana13 in addition part of the strategic petroleum reserve is located in coastal louisiana from an ecological perspective these coastal wetlands are critical not only to fulltime resident species but also to much larger ecosystems these wetlands provide wintering habitat for millions of waterfowl and other migratory species who use the mississippi flyway at least 20 of waterfowl in the country spend winters in this area also these wetlands are the home to 11 endangered species and 13 threatened species recognized by the fede ral government it should be surprise given the many ecological values to be found in this region that it is the site of multiple federal designations including 20 national wildlife refuges and one unit in the national park system na tional historic park and pr eserve these federal lands total more than 192000 acres the loss of wetlands is reducing or compromising the natural values for which many of these sites were initially designated coastal wetlands also support large fish ery by providing habitat and food the commercial fishery is valued at 343 million in landings it is estimated that more than 25 of the seafood consumed in the country comes through louisiana and that more than 75 of the species commercial and recreational in the northern gulf of mexico spend portion of their lifecycles in the wetlands of louisiana another study estimates that commerc ial and recreational fisher ies create more than 40000 jobs and contribute more than 35 billion to the states economy estimates of the annual economic impact of r ecreational fishing to the state range between 700 million and almost 1 billion other benefits that are being reduced include water quality and storm protection for example 1989 study cited in breaking new ground in louisiana estimated that the coasts 25 million acres of wetlands have annual storm protection values between 520 million and 22 billion if larg wetland areas are lost the existing levee system will be more exposed to the erosive forces of storms to reduce the risk created by these wetland losses some levees may need to be f ortified by adding stone or concrete to their surface to deflect these forces advocates of restoration ve developed scenarios of potential financial impacts should deterioration continue and hurricane strike14 if pipelines or storage facilities are damaged oil producti on could decline 625000 barrels day if this were to last from three to five weeks the cost to consumers because of higher prices for gasoline alone would be 17 to 29 billi on second set of costs would result if the mississippi river channel is closed to transportation because of storm damage or siltation oneweek closure would cost 50 million while twoweek closure would cost an estimated 200 million thir d set of costs could be incurred by

comparing largescale restorations coastal louisiana and south florida proponents of legislation to fund and support restoration in coastal louisiana point to prior congressional action for south florida in 2000 congress passed legislation providing 78 billion for the restoration of south florida as part of the water resources development act of 2000 pl 106541 south florida and coastal louisiana have many similarities the project areas are of similar size have similar total populations similar proportions of public lands and almost identical amounts of critical wetlands among the differences are that wetland conversion rates have been higher in louisiana where more coastal wetlands are being lost in addition floridas losses which are mostly deterioration rather than conversion are being caused by agricultural activities urban development and modification to the hydrologic system also louisiana is portrayed as working coast while south florida is largely protected landscape centered on the everglades current protection programs have important differences florida projects require 50 nonfederal cost share while louisiana projects currently require 15 total florida spending is authorized at 11 billion while total louisiana funding is authorized at 600 million under authorized efforts florida will restore or preserve 217000 acres of wetlands while louisiana will restore or preserve about 142000 wetland acres greater political success in selling the florida program is attributed to 1 meaningful process for gathering input and resolving disputes among stakeholders and

national sea grant library 2003 8 ppbe lost with an economic loss to th state of 84 million and to the overall mississippi and central flyways of 245 billion per year proponents of federal assistance see the losses that have already occurred and the much larger losses that might occur as national problems deserving strong response that would presumably include considerable federal funding and federal expertise they may see the south florida ecosystem restoration as model of federal and state cooperation where they share the costs and responsibilities see box both are productive ecosystems and have substantial ecological values reflected in large swaths of federally protected areas in units of the national wildlife refuge system however coastal louisiana has not been viewed as natural treasure and does not contain any federal designations that draw as much attention as the everglades national park rather it appears to be viewed more as working landscape that has number of unusual attributes this perspective about coastal louisiana however has created challenge for proponents of the restoration to demonstrate that the changes occurring in coastal louisiana are or will become national problem in need of significant federal involvement and fina ncial assistance rather than one that is primarily regional or local prior responses to wetland losses in louisiana managing the dynamic natu ral processes in south louisiana has been collage of piecemeal efforts thes efforts have involved indi vidual projects or activities at specific sites to address identified pr oblems or needs with little attention to implications for the greater landscape most projects have centered on largescale construction to maintain or improve navigation move water in more desired

the next section federal and state efforts to address the coastal wetlands loss and related coastal management issues can be traced back to the early 1970s when the rate extent and distribution of the coastal wetland loss problem was initially documented and publicized subsequent re search was conducted to be tter document the sites and rates of loss and to learn more about the causes later in the 1970s the state developed coastal manage ment plan that was fede rally approved in 1978 making the state eligible for modest federal grants this plan further addressed the wetland loss issue in the context of state and local planning and resource management act 6 louisiana enacted wetland law known as act 6 in 198915 more correctly referred to as the louisiana coastal wetlands cons ervation restoration and management act act 6 made the states department of natural resources dnr the lead agency to develop and imp lement coastal restor ation projects it requires the dnr to prepare and

project list each year nd projects are selected on their merits however the plan does not include any overall strategy to identify project priorities each year this task force allocates approximately 50 million to implement the priority projects summary compiled by corps staff in august 2003 showed that the corps alone had spent more than 208 million under the breaux act with spending trending upward from year to year the corps has stated that it is spending about 50 million annually to construct prot ection and restora tion projects and 5 million annually for project planning17 since 1990

techniques plantin g vegetation dedicated dredging protecting shorelines and diverting flowing waters benefit attributed to this program is that predictable funding from year to year has allowed the corps and others to experiment with innovative restoration technique s and to learn more about the positive and negative attributes of alternative thods all projects are maintained and monitored for 20 years these projects will create restor or protect approximately 71000 acres in total equal to between four nd five years of losses at the current rate and when all the 142 authorized projects are

operating for much shorter time with little information yet on what is being accomplished over the next 50 years the corps estimates that the caernarvon diversion will add 16000 acres of wetlands and the davis pond diversion will add almost 34000 acres of wetlands19 these gains will be equal to little more than three years of losses at current rates coast 2050 in the next major federalstate initiative an interagency group representing federal state and local interests and led by the corps completed long range plan called coast 2050 toward sustainable coastal louisiana often referred to as coast 2050 in 1998 this study looked at the land loss problem from broader ecosystem perspective than earlier studies it compiled available information about the problems and provi ded comprehensive overview of all planning efforts to date it subdivided co astal louisiana into four subregions based on hydrologic boundaries planning organiza tion that has been retained with limited modified boundaries in the current corps pr oposal and is presented below with that proposal for each subregion general strategies and projects that could be implemented to attain those strategies were identified for three time periods 15 years 615 years and 1650 years the general strategic goals for each subr egion respond to three goals related to desired natural processes these goals stated in scientific terms were to 1 build up sediments on which wetlands can reestablish themselves 2 maintain the transition between fresh and higher ocean sa linity levels to achieve diversity and 3 allow the hydrology of the area to operate as system the study report proposed 77 restoration strategies many of them construction project s to be implemented over the next 50 years it estimated that implementing these strategies would cost total of about 14 billion and protect or rest ore almost 450000 acres of wetlands it concluded that if current fforts were to continue without expanding it the current program would address only 22 of the land loss problems20 the corps current proposal shortly after the coast 2050 plan was completed it became increasingly apparent to those federal agencies and stat interests most directly involved in this effort that additional development of sy stemwide restoration program as the basis for authorizing additional fe deral spending was needed the corps and the state initiated development of comprehensive ecosystem restoration study in march 2000 the product of this effort the louisiana coastal area lca ecosystem restoration study issued by the corps is frequen tly referred to as the nearterm study because it focused on actions that c ould be initiated over the next 10 years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs12 types of restor ation projects restoration projects in coastal wetland environment can take numerous forms and they are referred to in many different ways types of projects include the following freshwater diversions channel water and sediments and nutrients into wetlands to slow saltwater intrusion and promote marsh expansion outfall management regulates freshwater diversion flows to ensure that water reaches the target areas most effectively sediment diversions are created by opening levee so that water and sediment flow into nearby wetlands replicating natural processes for building land dredged material marsh creation places sediment at specified elevations in deteriorating wetland to encourage revegetation shoreline protection includes all techniques used to diffuse wave energy at the beach or stabilize the shoreline sediment and nutrient trapping includes techniques usually used in dunes behind beaches to accumulate sediment or slow water flow rates hydrologic restoration restores natural drainage patterns by altering past modifications including levees navigation channels and dredged canals marsh management reestablishes vegetation and habitat by controlling water elevations and salinity in contained marsh areas barrier island restoration stabilizes and better protects these islands through diverse methods such as planting vegetation and constructing breakwaters vegetation planting establishes flood and salttolerant marsh plants to stabilize soils source adopted from table 2 in breaking new ground in louisiana p 20an initial version of the draft was completed in october 2003 but was never officially released for general review it was widely anticipated that the corps would have recommended an option that included numerous projects ranging from small restorations to major diversions several alternatives re portedly ranged between 43 billion and 147 billion with the likely preferred option costing about 8 billion it was widely reported in the press that the administration represented by the office of management and budget omb reviewed this draft and the cost estimates then directed the corps to reduce the estimated cost of this program the corps released for public review its revised draft study which responded to ombs concerns in july 2004 the projects it identified were combined in 15 different ways then compared for meeting four critical needs criteria 1 preventing future land loss 2 restoring deltaic process 3 restoring geomorphic structure creating marshes and prot ecting the shoreline are examples provided and 4 protecting vital community and socioecono mic resources the corps concluded that only one of these 15 combinations would meet all four criteria and it was therefore identified as the preferred option it timated that implementin g this option would cost slightly less than 2 billion the corps anticipates that it will complete final version of this plan soon the final plan with the selected option is intended to be the basis for subsequent congressional action to authorize appropr iations and where necessary specific projects one vehicle for such action might be the next iteration of water resources development

108th congress is presented below dividing up the coast the corps analysis of the proposed projects is subdivided among four regions similar to the earlier coast 2050 report the four regions termed subprovinces by the corps are outlined in figure 1 on the top of the next page21 figure 2 on the bottom shows major roads larger communities and physical features in coastal louisiana the corps considered each subprovince independent of the others so there is analysis of how projects in one subprovince might affect the natural resources or physical processes in the adjoining subprovinces the physical landscapes in subprovinces 1 through 3 are similar to each other in many ways as they encompa ss present or past mississippi river deltas and are called the deltaic pl ain subprovince 4 is differe nt with more upland and freshwater wetland acreage and less open water and is called the chenier plain22 the subprovinces are as follows subprovince 1 is bounded by the pearl river along the mississippi state boundary to the east and the mississippi ri ver channel along most of the west it includes the city of new orleans lake pontchartrain and breton sound subprovince 2 is bounded by the mississippi river along most of the east and bayou lafourche along most of the west it is protected from the gulf by string of coastal barriers larger communities include gretna adjacent to new orleans grand isle and port fourchon at the mouth of bayou lafourche subprovince 3 is bounded on the east by bayou lafourche and on the west by freshwater bayou the atchafalaya river drains through the center of this subprovince near morgan city the other large community is houma subprovince 4 lies between freshwater bayou and the sabine river along the texas state line it is being called the chenier plain because the cheniers provide much more pronounced boundaries between coastal salt marshes on the ocean side and freshwater marshes and lakes inland ca meron is large town in this subprovince each subprovince has distinct physical characteristics and different array of problems to be addressed subprovince 1 has already suffered extensive land loss the rate of loss is expected to decrease in the future as the remaining area dwindles and there will be much less to lose subprovince 2 is currently losing the greatest number of acres and the rate is projected to remain high subprovince 3 is accreting in portions of the atchafalaya basin and is losing less land than subprovince 2 in subprovince 4 erosion continues along the edges of marshes nd lakes but overall land loss is projected to be far slower he re than in the other three subprovinces httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs14 figure 1 louisiana coastal area study area and subregion boundaries figure 2 major cultural

list is adapted from background paper prepared by the staff of the house transportation and infrastructures committees subcommittee on water resources and environment prior to the july 15 2004 hearing on this topic the proposed plan the proposals in this draft shown in figure 3 would cost an estimated total of 196 b illion to implement over the next 10 years it is thought that authorizing legislation would require the federal g overnment to pay 65 of the total based on legisl ation authorizing other larg escale restoration projects although some in the state believe that th federal share should be greater since past federal navigation and flood c ontrol projects have been so central to the wetland losses the state has several possi ble sources to fund its share elements of the draft plan for which the corps would seek authorization are23 implementing five features 1 the mississippi river gulf outlet ecological restoration which includes constructing breakwaters along

comparing the number of features in each subprovince is not necessarily good comparison of the relative level of effort 25 us department of the in terior geological survey identifying offshore sand resources to restore louisianas barrier shoreline draft st petersburg fl jan 2004 4 ppthis set of proposals is drawn from much larger list of 166 possible restoration features that are identified in the plan this larger list of possible features is not distributed equally among the four subprovinces of this total 37 are in subprovince 1 33 are in subprovince 2 16 are in subprovince 3 and 14 are in subprovince 4 the differences in both the physical environment nd rates of loss are reflected in the frequency and type of restoration features that the corps identified in each subprovince

while in subprovince 4 it is salinity control24 while most of the features deal direc tly with wetland restorations stabilizing and rebuilding coastal barrier islands also will be critical to the success of this program since they protect wetlands marshe s and lagoons from the full force of tidal action and ocean storms in addition by k eeping out ocean waters they maintain the current balance between salt and fresh waters in the marshes the salinity level of the water is major factor in determining which plant and animal communities will thrive extensive surveys have been conduc ted to locate sand reservoirs that could be mined to rebuild coastal barriers sa nd of the necessary texture may not be very common in geologic environment like th mississippi river delta where most of the materials are much finer sand is expensive to transport because of the bulk and is uncommon in the necessary concentrations within the mississippi river delta the usgs has identified 14 potential sand reservoirs offshore that contain about the estimated volume that will be needed and concentrations and depths that are economically feasible based on cr iteria developed by the corps25 the national academy of sciences study in addition to the corps efforts that has culminated in the restoration plan the national academy of engineering national academy of scien ces is conducting study begun in late 2002 to explore four broad questions associ ated with the draft restoration plan are the strategies based on sound analysis appropriate for the plan goals and an adequate list are implementation priorities appropriate and can they be phased in what major questions need to be an swered to implement the plan and how can these needs be met and given the high cost of the plan what are its potential benefits to the national economy and nati onal interest the academy has not released any produc t from this study some believe that implementation of any plan should be layed until the academy and others have fully examined these four questions because of the uncertainty raised by not having complete answers calls for delay are c ountered by others who live in work in or represent coastal louisiana and fear that inaction will result in even greater losseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs18 26 the five types as shown in table on pa ge mr43 are fresh marsh intermediate marsh

be based on comparison of the overall number of wetland acres in coastal louisiana at different times will be used by the corps and others to measure the accomplishments of the restoration effort this accounting will probably compare wetland losses and gains over spans of time with baseline forecasts of losses and gains if restoration program existed these differences including its magnitude and the location of the changes may then be used to assess changes in other ecosyst em variables such as overall productivity plant or animal populations of intere st or socioeconomic changes charts that show changing rates of loss in the past and predictions for the future have been staples of recent analyses of chan ges an example of such charts from the recent corps analysis is reproduced in figure 4 the corps calls this figure conceptual outcomes for restoration the past is shown by the solid line the future by the four dashed lines the figure shows without providing any dates or scale that land was being added from year to year until the apex of the curve which probably equates with some time in the early or mid 20th century the rate of lossmore recently would likely slow in the future even if remedial actions are initiated d various restoration proposals could slow the rate of loss further c stabilize the total amount of land at about the current level b or increase the land area resulting in net gain most of the corps charts and the accompanying analyses measure total acres of all wetlands such measures while easy to grasp may be insufficient for at least two reasons first not all wetlands provide the same values wetland scientists and others recognize many distinct types in coastal louisiana the corps recognized five in its description of th restoration study area 26 these different types occur in response to variations in salinity levels the height of the water table and other physical factors some types are more common than others but these more commonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs19 ones may not have always been so nd may not provide the desired or most concentrated benefits also the types that are easier to create or restore may not be the types that provide the desired ecological benefits second location in coastal louisiana is critical to defining the benefits that each wetland provides wetlands that have virtually identical physical prope rties may provide different values because of where they are located and the functions they serve in broader environmental or ecosystem context more sophisticated assessment of coastal louisiana restoration would measure wetland losses and gains for each major type of wetland such an assessment could provide more informa tion on the condition of the remaining wetlands and of the wetlands that would be created by each of the proposed projects the corps analysis has statistics by subpr ovince on current conditions and past net loss it also has projections by percentage for each of the five wetland types in each subprovince comparing conditions today with conditions in 50 years assuming that additional projects are initiated and ones currently underway are completed these projections show not surprisingly that the percentage of open water area would grow in all four subprovinces at th expense of different types of wetlands with saline marsh probably suffering the greatest decline the corps analysis does not compile the number of wetland acres that would be added or other benefits that would accrue if the tentatively selected plan were implemented the corps and others who support restor ation effort have tied success to an aggregate wetlands in the coastal louisian landscape and not to either specific wetland area beyond the four subprovinces or specific type of wetland the restoration area actually is composed of numerous smaller water basins that are largely independent of each other theref ore there is considerable flexibility in where projects can be undertaken and wh at they must accomplish to slow and eventually reverse the rate of loss in this setting the proposed program includes eight elements that will work in concert three elements involving more than half the proposed projects would introduce rive r water or deposit sediment into areas where the sediment can build up to an elevation where wetla nd vegetation gradually is reintroduced the water introductions w ill help keep salinity at desired levels other elements will deal with the stabilization and restoration of barrier islands and beaches to protect the wetlands from the for ces of the ocean and with alterations to the current channelization of the river all these changes will protect the remaining wetlands as well as expand wetlands as these projects are put in place the definition of success may well evolve to reflect accomplishments and changing perceptions of priorities for the restoration effort it will take many years to reverse the current trend of loss even if these efforts are successful if action is taken the rate of land loss is forecast to decline but continue in the future this declin would not necessarily reflect improved conditions but rather that the amount of past loss has left much less wetland to be converted one expert has st ated rather than indicatin g that the problem is less severe the declining rate of loss show s us how much damage weve sufferedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs20 27 rex caffey professor at l ouisiana state university agri cultural center and louisiana sea grant statement water marks 24 new orleans

scope of the most promin ent of these efforts mean that it will almost always be the case already27 it is also estimated that restoration projects that are already approved could reduce future losses by up to 25 but even with this slowing of the process usgs has forecast that the co astal louisiana could lose as much as an additional 448000 acres of wetlands by 205028 ecosystem restoration context for considering the coastal louisiana effort the coastal louisiana restoration is one of several federa l programs proposed or initiated to restore ecosystems and imp rove environmental conditions over large geographic areas29 while these programs are in diverse settings have diverse goals and include many different types of construction and resource management activities they have number of common elements one common element is that each of these efforts is presented as national rather than regional or local issue that justifies significant federal fina ncial and technical i nvolvement in the rest oration some other common elements are working in coordinated manner with many public and private participants over large area understanding complicated science and focusing on interrelated physical and biological parts and how they work to gether rather than specific components such as single species of plant or animal altering the results of earlier federal pr ograms and projects that contributed to creating conditions that are now view ed as needing to be remedied maintaining and improving bene fits in ecological components creating selfsustaining systems that minimize the need for additional intervention in the future using the flexibility of an adaptive management approach developing extended partne rships and widespread support for the effort and involving multiple federal agen cies and federal programs coastal louisiana restoration has seve ral additional features in common with many other largescale efforts for example almost all of them have been centered on water they usually attempt to improve water quality improve hydrology surface and subsurface flow patterns or provide other waterrelated benefits such as more productive habitat in coastal areas and estuaries in watersheds or in the marine environment examples of other wate rcentered projects to which the label of ecosystem restoration has been applied are occurring in the florida everglades thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs21 chesapeake bay watershed and the pacific northwest for salmon recovery others are being planned or proposed such as in the upper mississippi river the california baydelta and the great lakes supporters of these other projects are likely to press just as hard for fede ral funds and support from the federal and congressional perspective these restoration initiatives can be divided into two broad groups one group of programs has large engineering components and includes expensive c onstruction projects in this group exemplified by the florida everglades restoration construc tionbased programs usually are attempting to alter the hydrol ogy to provide add itional environmental improvements while ma intaining existing flood contro l and navigation benefits where large engineering components are at the center of the restoration the lead federal agency will be one with strong construction mission such as the corps or the bureau of reclamation burec in the second group construction is less im portant or not part of the program in this group exemplified by the chesapeake bay program the overall restoration budgets tend to be smaller and are spread among more participants with greater emphasis on broad partnerships in these programs providing financial and other incentives to modify landowner behavior through activities such as installing best management practices to limit water pollution are often more central to providing additional environmenta l benefits in this group other federal agencies such as the environmental protection agency epa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration or the fish and wildlif service may lead the program congressional endorseme nt in the forms of author izations and appropriations are central to initiating and supporting large scale restorations with significant federal involvement especially when they include expensive construction components for efforts that are not cent ered on construction many activities may be done under existing authorities and through established programs for example in chesapeake bay only the epa has specific authorizing legislation under whic h it coordinates the program many other federal agencies ch as the natural resources conservation service in the department of agriculture support the chesapeake bay effort by providing additional staff nd additional funding under exis ting programs in the bay watershed to carry out their missions under existing authorities in seeking congressional support proponents try to build substa ntial record of endorsements and justifications through the hearing proce ss such an effort is currently underway on behalf of the coastal louisi ana restoration the federal government is rarely the so participant these efforts involve partnerships with state and local govern ment who provide fina ncial resources and local perspectives and with other parties including university researchers in and near the project area and businesses and industry who may be affected by the effort in the chesapeake bay program many individual interests which number in the hundreds work through coordinating groups that provide forums for communication and deliberation the chesapeake bay alliance private group that receives funds from epa performs this function and appears to have been important to the overall program the chesapeake bay foundation performs similar function representing the environmental community and is the most visible and prominent voice for the environmental perspectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs22 success has been defined in many diffe rent ways in these efforts the chesapeake bay program which has been operating for more than 25 years has adjusted its goals against which success could be measured several times by agreement among the major participants the chesapeake bay foundation recently questioned whether the bay program has overstated its accomplishments according to press reports three senators from bay states sought an assessment of the accuracy of this claim when they requested that the government accountability office gao investigate the overall progress how progre ss is measured and the effectiveness of efforts to ensure that the proper measures are being used it may be that the same trio of topics could usefully be explored bout wetland restoration in coastal louisiana or any of the other large scale restorati ons the chesapeake bay program experience does suggests that clear goals should be articulated early on measures should be established to determine the degree to which those goals are being attained and goals should be periodically revi ewed and adjusted congressional considerations the 108th congress has given time both to ga ining fuller understanding of the problems of coastal louisiana and explor ing options for federal role in any solutions several house and senate committees have held hearings in the most recent hearing the house transpor tation and infrastructure committees subcommittee on water resources and nvironment received testimony on the corps recently released draft ecosystem restoration study on july 15 2004 in this and other hearings on this re storation almost all witne sses have endor sed the overall goal of restoration and str ong federal role in working toward that goal some areas of disagreement have emerged as more specific subjects are being discussed in these hearings as well as in public meetings in louisiana including specific project priorities levels of effort and the size of the federal and state expenditures how costs should be shared between the federal g overnment and project beneficiaries and relationships between the federal comm unity and state and local interests proponents have been trying to aut horize actions that would support the restoration through water resources velopment legislation which authorizes corps of engineers projects in the house version of this legislation hr 2557 which passed the house on september 24 2003 5058 would establish ten member task force of federal and state entities to develop comprehensive protection and restoration plan and programmatic environmental impact statement for the coastal louisiana ecosystem the task force would report on its activities to the house transportation and infrastructure committee and the senate environment and public works committee the task force would coordinate ongoing activities the federal government and the state would share equally the costs of this planning activity the senate version of this legisla tion s 2773 which is substitute bill prepared after the senate committee on environment and public works had ordered the bill to be reported on june 23 2004 has numerous coastal louisiana provisions in 3421 it would establish ninemember ta sk force eight federal officials and one state official to make recommendations to the secretary of the army about all efforts to protect and restore the coastal louisiana ecosystem it would submit biennial report to congress summarizing its activitie s in addition the secretary wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs23 30 for more information see crs report rl30444 conservation and reinvestment act cara hr 701 and related initiative in the 106th congress develop comprehensive plan to protect and restore the south louisiana ecosystem and submit it to congress by july 1 2008 this bill also has provisions authorizing feasibility studies and specific activities the secretary would review authorized federal water resource projects in coastal louisiana for their compatibility with the restoration effort the bill also would authorize science and technology pr ogram with total appropriations of 50 million to provide forum for experts to in teract with the rest oration program and make recommendations in addition 85 million would be authorized for demonstration projects all demonstration projects would be approved by the secretary other provisi ons would authorize 140 million for the bayou lafourche sediment reintroduction proj ect and 50 million for program to use dredge spoil in beneficial manner all projects implemented under this section would have 35 nonfederal cost share and operation and ma intenance for all projects would be the responsibility of the nonfederal interest the secretary would sure that nonfederal interests provide their propor tionate share if the s ecretary determines that an activity would be justified based on predicted environmen tal benefits and would be cost effective further economic justification would be required in addition to legislation that is speci fic to south louisiana congress has been considering other proposals since the 105th congress that would provide portion of federal offshore oil and gas re venues to the state that coul d be used for restoration these proposals hr 4100 and s 2590 in the 108th congress would dedicate amounts annually to specified fe deral natural resource progra ms and grants to states major portion of these funds would be us ed to set up coastal impact assistance programs to offset local and state costs associated with offshore oil and gas activities with most money going to the six states adjacent to federal waters where these activities are occurring most of the proposals in prior congresses would have provided approximately 3 billion year the proposals in the 108th congress would provide smaller amounts u nder all the proposals that ve received consideration louisiana would have received more money than any other state largely because of the large scale of the offs hore development and onshore s upport this legislation came closest to being enacted in the second session of the 106th congress when the house passed bill hr 701 and th senate energy committee reported an amended version of that bill30 concluding observations as conclusion of the 108th congress nears it seems highly probably that it will not act on any coastal louisiana restora tion legislation meanwhile the corps anticipates that it will complete final t of recommended elements soon that would likely be the basis for further c ongressional deliberations in the 109th congress whether coastal restoration legislation in the 109th congress would be similar to the bills that were introduced in this cong ress is unclear many questions may be addressed in such gislation includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32673crs24 how quickly should losses end and how rapidly should wetlands be restored where along the louisiana coast shoul d restorations be concentrated which restoration elements are authorized and what portion of the total cost woul d the state be required to pay also any potential appropriations to implement coastal louisiana restoration legislation may have to compete for funding with restorations in other places such as the great lakes these debates could be pa rticularly contentious in light of the anticipated budget deficit in the mean time louisiana will likely continue to lose wetlands and the corps will likely continue to design and implement some restoration projects
