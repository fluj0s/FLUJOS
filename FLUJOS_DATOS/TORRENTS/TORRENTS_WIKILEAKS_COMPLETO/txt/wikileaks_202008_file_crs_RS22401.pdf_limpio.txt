outlaws four kinds of launderingpromotional concealment smurfing and tax evasioncommitted or attempted under one or more of three jurisdictional conditions laundering involving certain financial transactions laundering involving international transfers and stings more precisely section 1956a1 outlaws financial transactions involving the proceeds of other certain crimespredicate offenses referred to as specified unlawful activitiescommitted or attempted 1 with the intent to promote further predicate offenses 2 with the intent to evade taxation 3 knowing the transaction is designed to launder the proceeds or 4 knowing the transaction is designed to avoid antilaundering reporting requirements section 1956a2 outlaws the interstate or international transportation or transmission or attempted transportation or transmission of funds 1 with the intent to promote predicate offense 2 knowing that the purpose is to conc eal laundering of the funds and knowing that the funds are the proceeds of predicate offense or 3 knowing that the purpose is to avoid reporting requirements and knowing that the funds are the proceeds of predicate offense section 1956a3 is sting section it outlaws financial transactions or attempted transactions that the defendant believes involve the proceeds of predicate offense and that are intended to 1 promote predicate offense 2 launder the proceeds or 3 avoid reporting requirements all but two of the ten section 1956 crimes are re lated in one or another to the commission or purported commission of at least one of list of predicate offenses specified unlawful activities the predicate offenses come in three varieties state crimes foreign crimes and federal crimes the list of state crimes is relatively short and consists of any state crime that is rico predicate offense that is any act or threat involving murder kidnaping gambling arson robbery bribery extortion dealing in obscene matter or dealing in controlled substance or listed chemical as defined in section 102 of the controlled substances act which is chargeable under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year the list of foreign crimes recognized as section 1956 predicate offenses is very much the sameviolations of the laws of another country involving murder kidnaping bribery drug trafficking and the likebut it only applies in cases involving financial transaction occurring in whole or in part in this country the list of federal predicate offenses is considerable longer if for other reason than it is specific rather than generic each of the ten criminal proscriptions found in section 1956 outlaws both the completed offense and the attempt to commit it section 1956h outlaws conspiracy to violate any of these proscriptions consequences prison terms fines civil penalties and confiscation may follow as consequence of conviction of money laundering offense any violation of section 1956 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years violations of section 1956a1 and a2 the financial institution and interstate or foreign transmission offenses are punishable by fine of more than the greater of 500000 or twice the value of the property involved in the offense sting violations are punishable by fine of not mo re than the greater of 250000 500000 for an organization or twice of amount involved in the offense violators of any provisions of section 1956 are subject to civil penalty of more than the greater of 10000 or the value of the property involved in the offense forfeiture is the confiscation of property to the government as consequence of the propertys proximity to some form of criminal activity the proceeds of confiscation are generally shared among the law enforcement agencies that participate in the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22401g15g152g151g142g162g561g14g138 g158g151g141g142g155g146g151 g144g561 g561

vehicle for confiscation in two very distinct ways first the proceeds of any section 1956 predicate offense and any property traceable to such proceeds are subject to confiscation without the necessity of any actual violation of section 1956 second property involved in section 1956 money laundering offense or property traceable to such involved property may be confiscated the eighth amendment prohibits excessive fines fines are excessive if they are grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offenders misconduct while the excessive fines clause may impose limits upon the permissible extent of the confiscation for failure to comply with antimoney laundering reporting statutes forfeitures under section 1956 are not ordinarily considered excessive because of the gravity of the offense and its predicate offenses g343g350g561g23g495g21g495g5g495g561g343g351g347g349g561 unless there is some element of promotion concealment or evasion section 1956 does not make simply spending or depositing tainted money crime section 1957 does it outlaws otherwise innocent transactions contaminated by the origin of the property involved in the transaction using most of the same definitions as secti on 1956 the elements of 1957 cover anyone who 1 in the united states b in the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the united states or c outside the united states if the defendant is an american 2 knowingly 3 engages or b attempts to engage in 4 monetary transaction 5 in or affecting us interstate or foreign commerce 6 in criminally derived property that is of greater value than 10000 and b is derived from specified unlawful activity section 1957 also proscribes attempts to violate its provisions section 1956h outlaws conspiracy to violate section 1957 violations of section 1957 and conspiracy to violate section 1957 are each punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years andor by fine of not more than the greater of 250000 500000 for an organization or twice the amount involved in the transaction violators of section 1957 are subject to civil penalty of more than the greater of 10000 or the value of the property involved in the offense any property involved in violation of section 1957 or traceable to property involved in violation of section 1957 is subject to confiscation under either civil or criminal procedures and the applicable law is essentially the same as in the case of section 1956 g22g155g138g159g142g149g561g3g140g157g561 the money laundering provisions of sections 1956 1957 punish transactions involving promotion concealment evasion spending nd depositing the travel act 18 usc 1952 punishes interstate or foreign travel or use of the facilities of interstate or foreign commerce conducted with the intent to distribute the proceeds of more modest list of predicate offenses or to promote or carry on such offenses when there is an overt act in furtherance of that intent the

unlawful activity section 1956 and 1957 are travel act predicate offenses unlawful activity and although the money laundering predicate offense list is more extensive several of the travel act predicate offenses are also money laundering predicates the travel act essentially condemns three crimes each with an interstate element the distribution of the proceeds of predicate offense the promotion of predicate offense or the commission of violent crime in aid of predicate offense the first two variants bear some resemblance to the concealment and promotion offenses of section 1956 and somewhat more remotely to the depositspending proscriptions of section 1957 the violent crime component of the travel act is only coincidentally related to money laundering and consequently will be mentioned only in passing the courts often abbreviate their statement of the elements to encompass only whichever of the three versions is at issue distribution the essential elements of violation under section 1952a are 1 travel in interstate or foreign commerce 2 with the specific intent to distribute the proceeds of an unlawful activity and 3 knowing and willful commission of an act in furtherance of that intent facilitation the government must prove 1 interstate travel or use of an interstate facility 2 with the intent to promote an unlawful activity and 3 followed by performance or attempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity violence to prove violation of the travel act the government was required to establish that ajaj 1 used facility of interstate or foreign commerce 2 with intent to commit any unlawful activity including arson and 3 thereafter performed an additional act to further the unlawful activity the distribution and facilitation offenses of the travel act 18 usc 1952a1 and 18 usc 1952a3 are punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years the crimeofviolence infurtherance offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years offenders of any of the three offenses are subject to fine of the greater of not more than 250000 500000 for organizations or twice the gain or loss associated with the offense
