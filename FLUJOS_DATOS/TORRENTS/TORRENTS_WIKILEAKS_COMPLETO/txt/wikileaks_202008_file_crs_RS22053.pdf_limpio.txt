of reform and democracy in arab and muslimmajority countries2 in the months following the presidents re marks new plans emerged for encouraging democracy in the greater middle east3 on february 13 2004 the english language website of the london based arabic daily hayat published draft copy of the proposed g84 greater middle east plan working pape r devised by us administration officials in conjunction with european partners to be presented at the june 810 2004 g8 summit meeting in sea island georgia5 the draft plan drew upon data from the united nations arab human development report of 2002 and 2003 which extensively outlined number of development shortfa lls facing the arab world among other things the draft paper called on g8 members to provide technical assistance to monitor elections sponsor training programs for inde pendent journalists increase funding for nongovernmental organizations establish middle east devel opment bank and provide training to women interested in running for elective office in countries with upc oming parliamentary elections overall the draft paper focused almost exclusively on reform and made little reference to the arabisraeli peace process although some observers praised the initia tive for taking multilateral approach to democracy promotion in the middle east the surprise leak of the draft to the media elicited wave of criticism from arab governments and independent commentators6 arab governments such as egypt and jord an expressed frustration over not having been part of the drafting process nd expressed their dismay over having to find out about the proposal through the media rather than throug h consultations with the us government others questioned the very definition of the greater middle east suggesting that there was little commonality among certa in countries in the region and that it was difficult to apply such broad set of policies to diverse geographical area some analysts saw contradiction in the draft which relied heavily on the findings of the arab humanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22053crs3 7 according to robert satloff of the washington institute for near east policy more than quarter of all residents of

library which is nominally part of the egyptian governmentdevelopment reports but then sought to prescribe solutions for many nonarab and non muslim peoples7 as result of the leak some arab governme nts suggested that they should offer their own internal reform programs accordin g to jordanian foreign minister marwan muasher the idea is to come up with homegrown process in order that others not impose something from the outside8 some us policymakers who seek to balance us national security needs with the needs of re gional governments ve refuted the notion that the united states seeks to dictate reform policies to arab and muslimmajority countries instead they argue that the united states seeks to support serious and verifiable internal reform programs in c ountries where they exist but feels justified in taking the lead on the issue of reform with many countries in the middl east because local reformers are largely shut out of the political process arab reform initiatives after the initial skepticism over the first dr aft us and european diplomats hoped that arab leaders and intellectuals would produce regional agenda for reform prior to the g8 summit in june 2004 the greater middle east plan could then be offered as g8 response to regional demands for reform some arab countries such as jordan have already taken steps to introduce their own reform initiatives in january 2004 the yemeni governme nt hosted regional conference on democracy human rights and the role of th international criminal court which produced the sanaa declaration9 the declaration

recommendations for reforms calling for the drafting of modern constitutions that outline clear separation of legislative and executive powers the abolition of emergency laws and extraordinary courts independent ownership of the media and the granting of political rights to students to allow for peaceful demonstrations beyond political reform issues the document called for twostate solution to the arabisraeli conflict respect for the territorial integrity of iraq and the transformation of the middle ea st into an area free of weapons of mass destruction in may 2004 the arab league held re scheduled summit meeting in tunisia to adopt resolutions on political reform accordin g to delegate statements the resolutions drafted prior to the summit meeting agreed that all arab countries needed to change but at their own pace the arab league was anxious to come to an agreement on general statements of reform prior to the g8 summit meeting in june to avoid the appearance that western governments were driving the re form agenda in the middle east some commentators viewed the arab league meeting as an attempt by governments to take ownership of the reform process rather than leaving it to independent arab intellectuals and activists according to the new york times the final arab league document although generally referring to respecting hum an rights and furthering the rights of women did not provide specific details to effect change in the middle east and one conference participant described the final resolution as wishy washy12 the june 810 2004 g8 summit meeting in sea

the unspoken fact behind all of the discussions is that we are trying to work with bunch of people who are going to be kicked out of office if democratic change moves forward for now its easier to support free trade agreements than political change14 however the democracy assistance dialogue did allow some human rights activists to express their opinions directly to govern ment officials one egyptian human rights activist bahey eddin hassan of the cairo institute for human rights studies stated that arab regimes were the main obstacles for hindering reform and that palestinian and iraqi
