including hoover and grand coulee da ms were constructed by the bureau of reclamation department of the interi or to provide water for irrigation growing populations and changing valu have increased demands on water supplies and river systems resulting in water use and management conflicts throughout the country particularly in the west where population is expanding rapidly in many western states agricultural needs are often in direct conflict with urban needs as well as with water dema nd for threatened and endangered species habitat recreation and scenic enjoyment debate over western water resources re volves around the issue of how best to plan for and manage the use of this renewable yet sometimes scarce and increasingly sought after resource some observers advocate enhancing water

the federal government nd the natural resources defense council nrdc on how to respond to judges ru ling that operation of the federal friant dam on the san joaquin river ca is in vi olation of california state fish and game code the ruling is part of an 18yearo ld lawsuit between friant and nrdc and calls for providing water to support salmon bitat in reaches of the river that have been dry and void of salmon since the mid 1940s when water was diverted from the river for irrigation many activities in cluded in the settlement would require congressional authorization at issue for entities not party to the settlement is how reintroduction of federa lly threatened or endangered species salmon would affect existing irrigation and power project operations as well as how increases in water flow would affect land use and flood flows httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33565crs2 background and analysis for more than century the federa l government has been involved in developing water projects for variet of purposes including flood control navigation power generation and irrigation most major water projects such as large dams and diversions we re constructed by either the bureau of reclamation bureau in the department of the interi or or the us army corps of engineers corps in the department of defense traditionally the corps has built and maintained projects design ed primarily for flood control navigation and power generation whereas bureau projects were signed primarily to facilitate settlement of the west by storing and providing re liable supplies of water for irrigation and reclamation of arid lands while both agencies suppl water for some municipal and industrial uses they do so largely as secondary responsibility in connection with larger multipurpose projects most of the nations pub lic municipal water systems have been built by local comm unities under prevailing state water laws today the bureau operates nearly 350 st orage reservoirs nd approximately 250 diversion dams including some of the rgest dams in the world such as hoover dam on the colorado river and grand coulee dam on the columbia river in total the bureaus projects provide water to approximately 9 million acres of farmland and nearly 31 million people in 17 western states the bureau also operates 58 power plants because of the strategic importanc of its largest facilities the bureau has heightened security at all key facilities to protect projects in the wake of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 most bureau water supply projects were built under authority granted to the secretary of the interior in the reclamation act of 1902 or through individual project authorizations the original intent of the reclamation act was to encourage families to settle and farm lands in the arid and semiarid west where precipitation is typically 30 to 50 of amounts in the east construction of reclamation projects expanded greatly during the 1930s nd 1940s and continued rapidly til the late 1960s and early 1970s by th late 1960s combination of changing national priorities and local needs increasing construction costs and the prior development of most prime locations for water works contributed to decline in new construction of major water works nationwide wate r supply for traditional offstream uses including municipal industrial and agri cultural uses was increasingly in direct competition with growing interest in allocating water to maintain or enhance in stream uses such as recreation scenic enjoyment and fish and wildlife habitat during the 1970s construction of new pr ojects slowed to handful of major works culminating in the completion of the tellico dam project in tennessee and the tennessee tombigbee waterway thr ough alabama and mississippi these projects pitted conservation and environmental groups as well as some fiscal conservatives against the traditional wate r resources development community new on the scene was the national environmen tal policy act of 1970 nepa which for the first time required an assessment of the environmental effects of federal projects and provided for more public scrutiny of such projects in 1978 president carter announced that future federal water polic would focus on improving water resources management construc ting only projects that were ec onomically viable cooperatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33565crs3 with state and local entities and sustaining environmental quality the reagan administration continued to oppose large projects contending they were fiscally unsound new construction of federally financed water projects virtually stopped until congress passed the wa ter resources developm ent act wrda of 1986 which addressed corps project s and policies federal wa ter research and planning activities were also reduced during the early years of the reagan administration which felt that states should have great er role in carrying out such activities consistent with this outlook presiden t reagan abolished the water resources council an umbrella agency established in 1968 to coordinate federal water policy and to assess the status of the nation s water resource and development needs congress subsequently scaled back veral remaining authorized projects changed repayment and costshare structur and passed laws that altered project operations and water deliver programs for example in 1982 congress passed the reclamation reform act which altered the bureaus water pricing policies for some users the act revised acr eage limitation requirements and charges for water received to irrigate leased lands congress soon in creased local entities share in construction costs for corps water resource proj ects with passage of the 1986 wrda over the last decade both the corps nd the bureau have undertaken projects or programs aimed at mitigating or preventing environmental degradation due in part to the construction and operation of large water projects while at the same time expanding water supply facilities the agen cies have pursued these actions through administrative efforts and c ongressional mandates as well as in response to court actions currently the federal governme nt is involved in several restoration initiatives including the florida everglades the california baydelta and the columbia and snake river basins in the pacific northwest these initiatives have been quite controversial each involves ma ny stakeholders at the local and regional level water users landow ners farmers commercial and sport fishermen urban water suppliers and users navigationa l interests hydropower customers and providers recreationists nd environmentalists and has been years in the making at the same time demand for traditional or new water resource projects continues particularly for ways to augment local water supplies maintain or improve navigation and control or prevent floods nd shoreline erosion in addition demand continues from some sectors for new or pr eviously authorized large water supply projects eg auburn and temperance flat s dams and sites reservoir all in california for both the everglades and calfed water supply facilities are included in proposals for restoration legislative and oversight issues the 109th congress is considering several water resource issues in legislation ranging from reauthorizing the bureau of reclamations water recycling program to individual project authorizations and agency policy changes eg reoperation of water project facilities in the central valle of california and in the colorado and columbia river basins oversight of ongoing agency activities such as water management in the klamath and san joa quin river basins salton sea restoration allocation

behrens security of reclamation facilities on june 22 2006 the house resources water and powe r subcommittee held an oversight hearing on security concerns at bureau of reclamation facilities security remains heightened at bureau facilities in the wake of terrorist attacks in new york and washington dc on september 11 2001 the bureau initially closed visitor facilities and cancelled tours at all facilities while most visitor facilities have reopened facilities may close depending on security alert levels and sitespecific concerns at any time for example the bureau heightened security at many facilities during recen t codeorange alerts and is exp ected to do so in the future further in february 2004 the bureau cl osed the road over folsom dam ca largely because of security concerns because bureau facilitie s were not directly affected by september 11 events the bureau did not receive funding in the first two releases of emergency supplemental appropriations following the attack ho wever

the klamath river basin an area on the californiaoregon border has become focal point for local and nati onal discussions on wa ter management and water scarcity these issues were broug ht to the forefront in 2001 when severe drought prompted the bureau to curtail irrigation water deliveries to approximately 200000 acres of farm and pasture lands within the roughly 235000acre klamath project service area the cutback was made to make water available for three fishhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33565crs5 2 pacific coast federation of fishermens associations et v us bureau of reclamation national

population tensions were again high in 2002 when water temperatures and atypi cally low flows in the lower klamath may have contributed to the deat h of at least 33000 adult salmon the klamath project has been part of increasingly complex water management issues involving several tribes fisher men farmers envir onmentalists hydropower producers and recreationists upstream farmers are generally pitted against fishermen native american interests and other downstream users and many sides have policy concerns involvi ng valuable sectors of th local and regional economy farmers point to their contractual rights to water deliveries from the federal klamath project and to hardships for their families if water is cut off others assert that the salmon fishery is also economically valuab and that farmer s could be provided temporary economic assistance while salmon extinction would be permanent still others assert that there are ways to serve all interests or that the science underlying the determinations of the releva nt agencies is simply wrong the key issue is how to operate the bureaus project facilities to meet irrigation contract obligations without jeopardizing the three esalis ted fish to address this issue the bureau issued 10year operati ons plan in february 2002 and biological assessment necessary under the for operating its klamath project however subsequent biological opinions found the bureaus 10year operations plan would likely jeopardize the continued existence of the listed suckers and coho salmon as well as adversely modify proposed critical habitat although biological opinions issued on may 31 2002 by the us fish and wildlife service fws and the national marine fisheries service nmfs also popularly referred to as noaa fisheries both included reasonable and pr udent alternatives rpas the bureau formally rejected both fina l biological opinions and opt ed to operate under oneyear plan that it asserts complies with the opinions while met with enthusiasm from area farmers the bureaus decision drew much criticism and concern from environmentalists fishermen tribes and others on april 10 2003 the bureau issued its klamath project 2003 operations pl an and noted that planning for multi year operations of the project is ongoing the bureau issued its 2005 operating plan in april 2005 in 2003 2004 and 2005 the bureau stated that its current year plan was consistent with the 2002 biological opinions the ag encies fws and nmfs have not issued biological opi nion on the oneyear operations plans and hence the 2002 biological opi nions and rpas govern project operations in the meantime however the 2002 nmfs rpas for coho salmon were found to be arbitrary and capricious by the us 9th circuit court of appeals2 the court concluded the bureau of reclamations 10year operation plan was arbitrary and capricious because nmfs failed to analyze in eight of ten years the effects of project operations on coho salmon species that has threeyear life cycle it is not yet clear what effect the court decision will have on klamath project operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33565crs6 3 see

nonfederal hydr oelectric projects background and procedural reform issues by nic lanebecause of the controversy in 2001 the secretary of the interior asked the national research council nrc to evaluate the federal bi ological opinions that had been used to prevent the bureau from livering water to farmers in 2001 the nrc released an interim report in february 2002 and final report in october 2003 both concluded there was neither sound scientific basis for maintaining upper klamath lake levels and increased river flow s as recommended in the 2001 biological opinions nor sufficient basis for supporting th lower flows in the bureaus original operations plan for 2001 further the nrc concluded that rec overy of endangered suckers and threatened coho salmon in the klamath basin might best be achieved by broadly addressing land and water management concerns including the klamath dams nrc also concluded that opera tion of the klamath project as opposed to operation of other basin projects such as that on the trinity river was not the cause of the 2002 lower basin fish kill and chan ges in klamath project operations would not have prevented the fish kill on october 13 2004 the secretary of the interior announced the signing of klamath wate rshed coordination agreement among four cabinetlevel federal agencies the agreement was initiated to address the fractured resource management specifically noted by the nrc and others pacificorp large regional utility owns and operates seven hydroelectric dams in the klamath basin known collectively as the klamath river hydroelectric project project the dams ferc license number 2082 were built between 1908 and 1962 and produce 151 megawatts of electricity the projects ferc license expired on march 1 2006 until new ferc license valid for 3050 years is approved the project will operate under annually renewe d temporary licenses as part of the new license application nmfs and fws have submitted pre liminary prescriptions requiring the construction of fishways to allow upstream and downstream fish passage at four of the dams the federal agencies state that the fishway prescriptions would restore access to 58 miles of habita t for chinook steelhead and lamprey and improve connectivity for resident fish such as trout this includes 46 miles of habitat for the esalisted coho salmon fish passa ge would also create the opportunity for reintroduction plan to return salmon steel head and lamprey to more than 300 miles of historic habita t above the dams3 pacificorp estimates that the cost of implementing the nmfs and fws preliminary license prescriptions coul d be as much as 200 million and it has concerns that this expense would not reso lve the basins fisheries issues due among other things to poor water quality upstream of the pacificorp dams4 under 241 of the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 ferc license applicants or other parties to the proceedings may challenge fe deral agencies fishway

for the klamath project for fy2007 247 million was requested7 title transfer congress more and more is considering legislation that would transfer the ownership title of individual bureau of reclamation water supply projects to current water users these title transfer bills vary depending on the circumstances of each project however some general issu apply transfer issues range from questions regarding projects worth nd valuation to legal and policy questions regarding the transfers affect on other ar ea water users fish and wildlife future project operations and future management of lands asso ciated with the project the clinton administration first actively negotiated title transfer on voluntary basis with interested wate rirrigation districts beginning in 1995 when it announced policy framework to establish process for negotiating title transfers while some districts pursued the administrations framework process others sought direct legislative authority for transfers in ge neral congress must authorize transfer of title to reclamation f acilities 32 stat 389 43 usc 498 regardless of the process used to get to transfer agreement central issue with title transfer legisl ation is whether the transfers should be mandated or just authorize d some argue that the transfers are minor land transactions and advocate that congress di rect they take place within certain time period others strongly disagree debate mostly centers on the role the national environmental policy act n epa would and should pl ay prior to projects transfer environmentalists generally fear that direct ed transfer with or without specific nepa language would effectively allow the bureau and project transfer proponents to avoid assessing andor mitigating envir onmental effects of the proposed transfers conversely project proponents have pursued directed transfers to avoid what they see as unnecessary delays and to ensure transfers take place for example some title transfer legislation directs the tran sfer to occur in accordance with all applicable law while other legislation directs it to take place pursuant to an agreement already negotiated with project water users some laws authorize the transfers eg pl 106220 and pl 106221 whereas others mandate the transfer eg pl 106249 pl 106377 and pl 106512httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33565crs8 other discussions center on the role th endangered species act might play on project operations after the tran sfer one of the main concerns for environmentalists appears to be that once the project is out of federal ownership there will longer be legal obligation for the district to consult with other federal entities on the impact of project operations on threatened or endangered species as is now required of the bureau unde r section 7 of the add itionally environmentalists and others fear that once out of federal hands there will be little if any public scrutiny or federal oversight of project operations conversely project proponents are likely to fa vor private operations controversies regarding the application of nepa and to project title transfers as well as the question of whether to direct or authorize the transfers are likely to remain at issue other issues i nvolve concerns about th overall costs of the transfers who should pay for costs associ ated with the transfer effects on third parties liability the valuation of project facilities and lands and treatment of mineral or other receipts and financial compensation for the projects related to many of the issues outlined above is the question of how these projects might be operated in the future although the house resources committee has noted that it contemplates that facilities would be main tained and managed without significant changes and in some cases bill language states that the projects shall be managed for the purposes for which the project was authorized transfer bills approved by the committees have been silent on enforcement issues and in describing what might occur if the new owners change operations other than they must comply with all applicable laws at that time little has been said for exam ple about what might occur if new project owners decide to partition project lands for new homes and convert irrigation water to domestic use to date two sets of identical bills to transfer irrigation

departure from the historical mission of providing water for irrigation with use as an incidental project purpose the most recent project to be approved is for espanola new mexico pl 108354 this legislati on also authorizes feasibility study for chimayo water supply system these projects have been somewhat controversial largely due to the relatively large share of federal cons truction costs proposed typi cally the bureau requires that people benefitting from reclamation project repay 100 of the construction costs plus interest attributed to pr oject purposes for ex ample if projects purpose is 50 irrigation 30 flood control and 20 water users would pay reimburse the federal g overnment for 100 of their 20 of construction costs of the project plus interest the federa l cost share would be 0 of the 20 cost allocated to purposes in contrast the federal cost share nonreimbursable component for the bureaus rural water supply project s typically ranges from 75 to 85 some have raised concerns that these projects have the potential to overwhelm the bureaus budget for example the federal contribution to the lewis and clark project is estimated at 214 million for perspective the bureaus budget ranges in the neighborhood of approxima tely 800 million net current authority annually prior to the recent authoriza tions the bureau had approximately 60 authorized projects in various stages of c onstruction with projected construction costs for completion of 49 billion outstanding construction authoriz ations now total approximately 7 billion excluding def erred projects such as auburn dam some also fear that these projects are outside the realm of those historically constructed by the bureau nd believe they would be bette r handled via other existing federal water quality or water supply pr ograms such as the usdas rural utility service or the epas state re volving loan fund however as designed the projects do not fit epa or usda criteria and thus project proponents have looked to the bureau for funding an additional concern with the lewis and clark legislation was that it authorized projects outside of the bureau of reclamati ons historic service area
