1994 legislative prayer and school prayer the constitutional difference david m ackerman legislative attorney american law division summary the supreme court has held governmentsponsored prayer in the public school s to violate t he establishment of religion clause of the first amendment in contrast i t has held clergyled prayer in legislative assemblies such as the congress and the stat legislatures to be constitutionally permitted because both situations involv government sponsorship of prayer th rulings are sometimes said to be contradictory the court however has drawn significant factual and legal distinctions between the two situations nonetheless it remains true that the contrary decisions reflect differen t approaches to the interpretation of the establishment clause school prayer the supreme court has handed down more than dozen decisions involving religion in the public schools but three decisions are crucial for understanding this area of th e1 law in engel v vitale in 1962 and abington school district v schempp in 1963 th e2 3 supreme court first held governmentsponsored votional activities in the public schools to constitute an establishment of religion in

we beg th blessings upon us our parents our teachers and our country in holding the prayer exercise unconstitutional 61 the court stated the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religio n must at leas t mean that in this country it is part of the business of government t compose official prayers for any group of the american people to recite as part f religious program carried on by government government in this country be it state or federal is without power to prescribe b law any par ticular form of prayer which is to be used as an official prayer in carrying on any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity 370 us at 425 and 430 abington and the companion case of murray v curlett involved governmen t requirements in pennsylvania and baltimore md that each school day begin wit h readings from the bible and the unison recital of the lords prayer in striking dow n those requirements as well 81 the court asserted the exercises are religious exercises required by the states in violation of th command of the first amendment that the government maintain strict neutrality neither aiding nor opposing religion 374 us at 203 in both cases the states excused students who objected to taking par t in the exercises but the court suggested that the exercises could not be truly voluntary in the context of compulsory school attend ance laws and in any event the establishment clause does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the enactment of laws whi ch establish an official religion whether those laws operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not5 in the third case lee v weisman the court by 54 margin held it to b e6 unconstitutional for public secondary school to include an invocation and benedictio n by clergyman in its commencement ceremony the court explicitly reaffirmed enge l and abington and concluded that the prayer ex ercises in this case are especially improper because the state has in every practical sense compelled attendance and participation in an explicit religious exercise at an event of singular importance to every student 7 students were not required to attend the ceremony to receive thei r diplomas but the court stated that law reaches past formalism and to say teenage student has real choice

involved prayer at the opening of state legislature but th reasoning of the decision gave general approval to prayer at all legislative levels including in the congress at issue in marsh v chambers was the constitutionality of the practice of th e10 nebraska legislature of opening each legislative day with prayer by chaplain paid b the state in holding the prac tice constitutional 63 the court stated that the practice of legislativ prayer was deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country and had become part of the fabric of our society it stressed that legislative prayer d existed from colonial times through the founding of the republic had been practiced in congress for nearly two centuries and was consistent practice in most of the stat legislatures but along with this historical data the court emphasized the fact that th first congress in 1789 had authorized the appointment of paid chaplains to offer prayers at each legislative sess ion only three days before it reached agreement on the language of the bill of rights including the religion clauses of the first amendment standin g alone historical patterns cannot justify contemporary violations of constitutiona l guarantee s the court said but here historical evidence sheds light on what th draftsmen intended the establishment clause to mean clearly the cour t11httpwikileaksorgwikicrs94821crs4 id at 78812 720 f2d 689 198313 engel v vitale supra at 431 43314 112 sct at 265915concluded the men who wrot the first amendment religion clauses did not view paid legislative chaplains and opening prayers as violation of that amendment 12 it can hardly be thought that in the same week members of the first congress vote d to appoint nd to pay chaplain for each house and also voted to approve the draf t of the first amendment for submission to the states they intended the establishment clause of the amendment to forbid what they had just declared acceptable 463 us at 790 soon after marsh was decided by the court the us court of appeals for th district of columbia acted on related case called murray v buchanan that cas challenged the constitutionality of paid chaplains prayers not in state legislature but in the congress itself after the decision in marsh came down the appellate court in an banc decision dismissed murray on the grounds it longer raised substantia l constitutional question in brief ruling the court stated simply that the suprem e13 courts decision in marsh v chambers is dispositive of appellants challenge to th public funding of congressional chaplains distinctions the distinctions between governmentsponsored prayer in the public schools an d governmentsponsored prayer in legislative assemblies thus appear to be twofold first the supreme court h as found legislative prayer in effect to be an historically sanctioned exception to the general proscription of the establishment clause in engel and abington the court interpreted the establishment clause broadly the history of religion in europe and the colonies the court said demonstrated both that union of government an d religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion and that governmentally established religions and religious persecutions go hand in hand thus it said th e14 meaning of the establishment clau is essentially that government must be strictly neutral toward religion serving neither as its advocate nor as its enemy in lee it used th narrower p rinciple that at minimum the constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise in the publi c15 schools these interpretations of the establishment clause have meant that governmen t cannot sponsor devotional exercises either as daily ritual or as part of such significant event as commencement but legislative prayer is different the court has said because the first congress that wrote the establishment clause hired legislative chaplains to offer daily prayers at the same time thus matter how broadly the establishment clause is interpreted it cannot be read as proscribing legislative prayer second the court has cited factual differences both in the age of participants and in the legal compulsion to attend the prayer exercises as important it has noted tha t legislative prayer involves adults who are under compulsion to be present for th exercise while prayer in the public schools involves impressionable children who ar ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94821crs5 engel v vitale supra at 43116subject both to compulsory attendance law s and to substantial social pressure to conform it has suggested in short that governmentsponsored school prayer is more coercive in nature than legislative prayer and th us more violative of the purposes of the establishment clause finally however it should be noted that the differing results the court reached i n its school prayer and legislative prayer decisions reflect in part an ongoing debate on the court about how the establishment claus should be interpreted engel abington and to lesser extent lee reflect perspecti ve that believes union of government and religion tends to destroy governmen t and to degrade religion and that therefore there must be16 wall of separation between government and religion marsh in contrast reflects perspective that government can act benignly in s upport of religion and more particularly that practices which have become part of the fabric of our society should b constitutionally allowed to continue although the decisions themselves are t necessarily inconsistent these differing perspectives continue to frame the debate on the court and in the society at large on the proper relationship between government an d religion and the p roper interpretation of the religion clauses of the first amendment as long as that debate persists the courts school prayer and legislative prayer decision s seem likely to continue to be lifted up as contradictory
