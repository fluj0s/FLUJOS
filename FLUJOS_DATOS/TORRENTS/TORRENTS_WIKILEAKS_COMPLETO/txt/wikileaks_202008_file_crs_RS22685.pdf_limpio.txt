law does not protect useful articles and copyright protection has been denied to fashion designs because clothing garments have traditionally been viewed as useful articles basic items of necessity having utilitarian valuerather than as artistic creations however chapter 13 of the us copyright act does specify protection for the designs of one category of useful articles the designs of boat hulls hr 20331 the design piracy prohibition act was introduced in the 110th congress by representative delahunt on april 25 2007 substantially similar bill s 1957 was introduced by senator schumer on august 2 20072 the bills would have amended chapter 13 of the copyright act to extend design protection to fashion design as of the date of this report similar legislation has been introduced in the 111th congress g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the copyright act the act defines useful article as an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information 3 if the function of an article is found to be inherently utilitarian rather than exclusively aesthetic or informational then the article cannot be protected under us copyright law although useful articles cannot be protected in and of themselves certain aesthetic or creative aspects of such articles can receive protection designs of useful articles can be protected under copyright law only if and only to the extent that such design incorporates pictorial graphic or sculptural features that can be identified separately from and are capable of existing independently of the utilitarian aspects of the article 4 because pictorial graphic and sculptural works are eligible for copyright protection under 102 of the act5 protection is permitted for aspects of utilitarian article that fall into this category and can be physically or conceptually separable from the utilitarian aspects of the article6 the us copyright office describes this separability test as an extremely limited means of protecting the designs of useful articles as courts have excluded most industrial designs from copyright protection7 1 an identical bill hr 5055

protecting fashion design8 under the concept of trade dress part of trademark law fashion design can be protected in cases where the product has gained reputation among consumers as being identifiable with particular market source9 under patent law design patents could also be potential means for protection10 however commentators have noted the potential shortcomings of each of these approaches11 the design protection for vessel hulls and decks12 in the copyright act is unique specially carvedout area of protection for designs of useful articles chapter 13 of the act provides protection for vessel hull or deck designs for period of 10 years13 such protection is granted if the application for registration of the design is made within two years from the date on which the design is first made public14 design is considered to have been made public when an existing useful article embodying the design is anywhere publicly exhibited publicly distributed or offered for sale or sold to the public by the owner of the design or with the owners consent15 the owner of protected design has the exclusive right to 1 make have made or import for sale or for use in trade any useful article embodying that design and 2 sell or distribute for sale or for use in trade any useful article embodying that design16 if the design protection under chapter 13 were expanded to include fashion designs fashion design owners would be granted the exclusive right to place their designs on the marketplace and to thereby prevent others from copying design and disseminating it without authorization 8 for more information see crs report rl34559 intellectual property in industrial designs issues in innovation and competition by john r thomas 9 see samara bros v walmart stores 529 us 205 2000 holding that product design specifically that for childrens clothing could be protected under federal trademark law if it were found to have acquired recognition among consumers as being associated with particular source 10 see 35 usc 171 11 hearings supra footnote 4 statement of the us copyright office noting that design patents are difficult and expensive to obtain and entail lengthy examination process and that trademark law only protects those product configurations that identify the source of the product while the other aspects are not protected and any trademark protection is only against uses of the design that create at least substantial likelihood of customer confusion 12 vessel is defined as craft that is designed and capable of independently steering course on or through water through its own means of propulsion and that is designed and capable of carrying and transporting one or more passengers hull is the exterior frame or body of vessel

public18 the definition subsection of 1301 first explains what makes design original19 and then limits the definition of useful article to vessel hull20 hr 2033 and s 1957 would have amended the definition of useful article by adding the provision or an article of apparel in order to protect clothing under the act21 to the end of the definition section both bills would have added the definitions for fashion design22 design23 and apparel the definition of apparel is broad encompassing articles of mens womens and childrens clothing including underg arments and outerwear gloves footwear and headgear additionally the term covers handbags purses tote bags belts and eyeglass frames rendering these items eligible for protection

currently specifies 10year term of protection for vessel hulls25 proponents of the legislation assert that threeyear term is sufficient because its purpose is to protect high end haute couture designs when they are first sold at expensive pricesa time when the designs could be vulnerable to copies sold at substantially lower prices26 because trends arise and fade quickly the shorter term is considered sufficient time period for the designer to have exclusive rights27 the 10year protection for vessel hulls would have remained unchanged under the bills 17 id 1301 18 id 1301a1 19 id 1301b1

has been made public during which an application for registration of the design must be filed28 the section refers only to registration for vessel hull design protection hr 2033 and s 1957 would have added to this section window of three months for registration of fashion design after it has been made public29 the purpose of including limited registration period is to require prompt registration of protected designs which gives notice to the world that design protection is claimed30 because the entire term of protection for fashion designs is significantly shorter than that for vessel hulls shorter window for registration of fashion designs is necessary31 the two year time frame for vessel hull registration would have remained unchanged under the bills g11g151g143g155g146g151g144g142g150g142g151g157g561 section 1309 of the copyright act details what constitutes infringement of the design of useful article 32 in addition to violation of any of the design owners exclusive rights under 1308 discussed above it is also an infringement for seller or distributor who did not make or import an infringing article to induce or act in collusion to make or import the article33 seller or distributor can also be liable if design owner asks where the article came from and the sellerdistributor refuses or fails to do disclose its source and orders or reorders the article with the infringing design after being notified by mail that the design is protected34 section 1309 has narrow exception to infringement liability for acts without knowledge it is not an infringement to make have made import sell or distribute any article embodying copied design that was created without knowledge that the design was protected35 hr 2033 and s 1957 would have narrowed this exception by amending the language so that it would constitute infringement if one did not have actual knowledge but had reasonable grounds to know that design protection is claimed36 additionally the bills would have added protection for images of fashion designs as well as for the designs themselves stipulating that an article is infringing if its design was copied from protected design or from an image thereof37 both bills would also have amended 1309 to apply the doctrines of secondary liability to actions for infringement of design of useful article38 doing so would codify the doctrines of secondary 28 17 usc 1310ab 29 hr 2033 s 1957 at 2e1 30 hearings supra footnote 4 statement of the us copyright office 31 hearings supra footnote 4 statement of the us copyright office

earlier s 1957 and hr 2033 are substantially similar in structure and text they differ only in one respect s 1957 would have amended the definition of infringing article provided by 17 usc 1309e to exclude fashion design that is original and not closely and substantially similar in overall visual appearance to protected design41 hr 2033 does not contain similar amendment the original text of

design industry professionals have expressed diverse viewpoints on the need for and desirability of legislation granting copyright protection to fashion design those in favor of protection assert that the copyright law mistakenly views clothing as purely utilitarian in nature and ignores the possibility that fashion design may be form of creative expression deserving of protection 42 proponents also highlight the effects of modern technology on the ease and speed of copying fashion designs pointing to the ability for copiers to easily access images of runway photos posted on the internet43 additionally emphasis is placed on the particular vulnerability of young designers whose names and logos are not yet recognizable in the marketplace and have difficulty promoting their work when it is quickly copied by established competitors44 supporters of the legislation also point to the protection granted to fashion design in other areas of the world45 those against offering copyright protection for fashion design generally point to the success of the marketplace as it is and note that copying is an integral and accepted part of the fashion industry46 they claim that such interference into the fashion market would be harmful because of increased litigation over the standard for infringement47 as result creative production of 39 see eg sony corp of america v universal

copyright protection for fashion design 46 see eg hearings supra footnote 4 statement of david wolfe creative director doneger creative services the absence of copyright in fashion frees designers to
