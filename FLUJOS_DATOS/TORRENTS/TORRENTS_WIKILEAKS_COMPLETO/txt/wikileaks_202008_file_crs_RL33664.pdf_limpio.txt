that the right of the people to be secure in thei r person houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmati on and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized the supreme court has interpreted this language as imposing presumptive warrant requirement on all searches and seizures predicated on governmental authority however the court has carved out excep tions to the warrant requirement when obtaining such would be impractical or unnecessary in crafting these exceptions the court has analyzed the reasonableness of the circumstances that gave rise to the warrantless search during the october 2005 term the court addressed the

unreasonable searches and seizures and requirement that probable cause support each warrant i ssued the issue of reasonableness is generally determined by balancing test that weighs the degree to which the search intrudes on an individuals legitimate expectation of privacy and the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests such as crime prevention in

that parol ee has reduced expectation of privacy which fails to outweigh the states interests in protecting the community finally in united states v grubbs 10 the court addressed th issue of anticipatory search warrants when it found that an antic ipatory search warrant authorizing the search of the defendants residence on the basis of an affidavit stating that the warrant would be executed upon deliver of videotape containing child pornography was supporte d by probable cause consent searches in katz v united states 11 the supreme court stated that warrantless searches are per unreasonable under the fourth amendment subject only to few specifically established and welldelineated exceptions12 one of these exceptions occurs when police obtain voluntary consen t of an occupant who shares or is reasonably believed to share authority over an area generally anyone who has reasonable expectation of privacy in the place being searched can consent to warrantless search and any person with co mmon authority over or other sufficient relationship to the place or effects being searched can give valid consent13 the court has concluded that an individual assumes risk when he or she shareshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33664crs3 14 id 15 415 us 164169171 16 497 us 177 186 17 126 s ct 1515 2006 18 264 ga app 396 590 se2d 834 2003 19 278 ga 614 604 se3d 835 2004 20 495 us 9199

guest over the objection of the guestauthority over an area14 in both united states v matlock15 and illinois v rodriguez 16 the court ruled that consent by cooccupants eliminated subsequent fourth amendment objections to the admission of ized evidence by an occupant who was not immediately present and therefore did not object at the time to the search in assessing the reasonableness of such searches the court looked to the widely shared social expectations which are generally influenced by property law however in georgia v randolph 17 the supreme court found such search unreasonable as it applies to physically present occupant who expressly objects to the search after domestic dispute the wife complained to the police that her husband took their away when police arrived at the house she told them that her husband was cocaine user and there was drug evidence in the home one officer asked the defendant for permission to search the house which the defendant expressly refused that officer then went to the wife for consent to search which she readily gave the wife led the officer to an upstairs bedroom where the officer noticed drinking straw with powdery residue which ultimately proved to be cocaine the police took the straw to the po lice station along with the couple after getting search warrant the police returned to the house and seized further evidence of drug use which was used to indict the defendant for possession of cocaine the defendant moved to suppress the ev idence as the product of warrantless search of his house unauthorized by his wifes consent over hi s expressed refusal the trial court denied the motion ruling that his wife had common authority to consent to the search as established in matlock the georgia appellate court reversed18 and the georgia supreme court affi rmed finding that the consent was invalid because at the time of the warra ntless search the defendant was physically present and had clearly refused to consent to the search19 the us supreme court decided to take the case to resolve split of authority on whether one occupant may give law enforcement effective consent to search shared premis as against co tenant who is present but refuses to permit the search in its 53 decision written by justice sout er the court held that the warrantless search of defendants residence based on his wifes consent to the police was unreasonable as to physically present defe ndant who expressly refused to consent the court built on its previous decision in minnesota v olson 20 wherein it found that overnight houseguests have legitimate expectation of privacy in their temporaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33664crs4 21 126 sct at 1522 22 id at 1523 23 id at 1528 24 id at 1531quarters the court conclude d that if as was found in olson the customary expectation of courtesy or deference is foundation of fourth amendment rights of houseguest it should follow that coi nhabitant should have even stronger claim21 the court found that there is so cietal or common understanding that one cotenant generally has right or authority to prevail over the express wishes of another in reaching its decision the court noted th at there were alternatives available to bring the criminal activity to light for example the cotenant could bring evidence to the police on her own initiative or exigent circumstances could justify immediate action on the polices part if th objecting tenant ca nnot be incapacitated from destroying easily disposable evidence during the time required to get warrant the majority distinguished randolph from matlockrodriguez based on the fact that in randolph the defendant expressly denied consent to search whereas in matlockrodriguez the defendants were silent th court stated in sum there is common understanding that one cotenant generally has right or authority to prevail over the express wishes of another whether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to outsiders22 the court acknowledged that the line drawn between matlock and illinois v rodriguez where the defendants in both cases were nearby but simply not asked for their permission and randolph was fine one nevertheless the court refu sed to require police who have obtained consent from one resident to take affirm ative steps to find out whet her another resident objects instead the court adopted simpler rule that physically present inhabitants express refusal of consent to police search is dispositive as to him regardless of the consent of fellow occupant23 in dissenting opinion chief justice roberts joined by justice scalia cr iticized the courts reliance on its unde rstanding of social expect ations and argued that straightforward application of matlocks assumptionoftheri sk principle should allow police to rely on one residents cons ent over another residents objection the dissenters argued that the majority ru ling provides protection on random and happenstance basis which may protect the occupant at the door but not one napping or watching tele vision in the next room24 exigent circumstances it is general rule that searches nd seizures inside home without warrant are presumptively unreasonable for fourth amendment purposes however this search warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions such as in cases where the exigencies of the situation make the needs of the law

home without warrant when they ve an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seriously injured or imminently threatened with such injury26 this case arose when poli ce officers responded to call regarding loud party at residence upon arriving on the s cene the officers observed two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard27 they entered the backyard looked into the window and saw an altercation taking place in the kitchen the officers testified that they saw four adults attempting to restrain juvenile and that the juvenile struck one of the adults who was then spitting blood the officers announced their presence and the altercation ceased the officers subseque ntly arrested each of the adults for contributing to the delinquency of minor disorderly conduct and intoxication the adults argued that the warrantless entry violated the fourth amendment and the utah courts agreed28 writing for unanimous court chief justice roberts noted that one exigency obviating the warrant requirement is the need to assist individuals who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury29 the petitioners did not take issue with this principle but instead advanced two reasons why the officers entry was unreasonable first they argued that the officers were more interested in making arrests than quelling violence the court noted that the officers subjective motivation was irrelevant30 relying on the courts previous ruling in welsh v wisconsin 31 the petitioners further contended that their c onduct was not serious enough to justify the warrantless intrusion distinguishing the facts in welsh the court responded that the officers were confronted by ongoing viol ence occurring within the home as opposed to mere potential emergency such as the need to preserve evidencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33664crs6 32 126 s ct at 1949 33 id at 1949 34 in addition the court found that there was violation of the knockandannounce rule 35 534 us 112 2005 36 id at 11819 37 id at 120 n6 stating that we do not decide whether the probation condition so diminished or completely eliminated knights reasonable expectation of privacy that search by law enforcement officer without any individual suspicion would have satisfied the reasonableness requirement of the fourth amendment 38 126 sct 2193the court concluded that the officers entry to the home was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances32 given the tumult at the house upon their arrival it was obvious that knock on the front door would have been futile moreover in light of the chaos they observed in th kitchen the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the in jured adult might need help and that the violence could escalate the court c oncluded that nothing in the fourth amendment required the officers to wait until the altercation escalated to the point that another blow rendere d someone unconscious semiconscious or worse before entering33 the court also found that the officers manner of entry was also reasonable since the first announcement of their presence went unheard and it was only after the announcing officer stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again that the tumult subsided that announ cement was at least equivalent to knock on the screen door34 furthermore the court c oncluded that once the announcement was made the officers were free to enter the court noted that it would serve purpose to make the officers stand dumbl at the door awaiting response while those within fought on oblivious to the officers presence parolee status the question of whether search is reasonable under the fourth amendment is generally determined by balancing test that weighs the degree to which the search intrudes on an individuals privacy against the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests in united states v knights 35 the court upheld warrantless search of pr obationer based on reas onable suspicion and his probationary status in doing so th court noted that probationers have diminished expectation of privacy give n that probation is on the continuum of punishments ranging from solitary prison confinement to community service36 utilizing balancing test th court found that probation s earches were necessary to promote legitimate governmental interests of integrating probationers back into the community combating recidivism and protecting potential victims thus outweighing the privacy interests of the probationer however the courts decision in knights did not address the reasonableness of search solely predicated on the probation condition regardless of reasonable suspicion37 in samson v california 38 the defendant was stopped by police officer while

upheld as special needs searches in griffin v wisconsin 483 us 868 87273 1987 the court upheld warrantless search of probationers home conducted pursuant to state regulation the court found the warrantless search appropriate because probations have diminished privacy interest due to the ongoi ng supervisory relationship between the state and the individual that is outweighed by the states interest in adequate supervisionstatus as parolee which the officer knew39 the search subsequently uncovered bag of methamphetamines and the defendant was charged with possession at trial the defendant moved to suppress the evidence arguing that the search violated the fourth amendment the motion was deni ed the california court of appeals affirmed finding that suspicionless s earches of parolees are permitted under california law and reasonable within th meaning of the fourth amendment40 in 63 decision written by justice thomas the court in examining the totality of the circumstances found that the parol ee did not have an expectation of privacy that society would recognize as legitimate41 because on the continuum of punishments parole is closer to prison that probation the court noted that parolee remains in the legal custody of the department of corrections through the remainder of his parole term moreover the parolee signed an order submitting to the condition further the court found that th states interest in reducing recidivism is substantial and warrants privacy intrusions not otherwise tolerated42 the court noted that requiring individualized susp icion would undermine the states ability to effectively supervise parolees43 justice stevens joined by justices souter and breyer dissented arguing that the fourth amendment provides at least some protection to parolees and therefore suspicionless searches by police with sp ecial relationship to the parolee cannot be considered reasonable44 the dissenters argued that this is the first time the court has ever found search reasonable in the ab sence of either individualized suspicion or special needs45 further the dissenters conte nded that the majoritys near equating of parolees to pr isoners was

generally probabl cause is defined as fair probability that contraband or evidence of crime will be found in particular place49 to satisfy the warrant requirement an impartial judicial officer must

fourth amendment requi res that warrant describe with particularity the place to be searched nd the persons or things to be seized53 this limitation safeguards the individuals privacy interest against the wideranging exploratory searches the framers of the constitution intended to prohibit54 in united states v grubbs the court found that an anticipatory warrant55 satisfied the fourth amendments probable cause requirement so long as there is fair probability that the condition precedent to execution will occur and that once it has evidence of crime will be found in addition the court held

was delivered the inspectors executed the warrant and seized the evidence although they provi ded the defendant with copy of the warrant the inspectors did not give him c opy of the supporting affidavit the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that the fruits of the search had to be suppressed concluding that the warrant was invalid because it failed to state the triggering condition56 in an 80 decision written by justice sca lia the court held that the warrant was supported by probable clause and met the fourth am endments requirement of particularity before addressing the merits of the appellate cour ts holding the court declared that anticipatory search warrants are constitutional the court reasoned that there is difference between anticipatory warrants and ordinary warrants as both require magistrate to dete rmine that it is now probable that contraband evidence of crime or fugitive will be on the described premises when the warrant is executed when the anticipatory warrant places condition other than the mere passage of time on its execution the first of these determinations goes not merely to what will be found if th condition is met but also to the likelihood that the condition will be met and thus proper object of seizure will be on the premises described the court reasoned that the occurrence of the triggering condition successful delivery of the videotape woul d plainly establish probable cause for the search moreover the affidavit establishe d probable cause to believe the triggering condition would be satisfied the court also found that the warrant at issue did not violate the fourth amendments particularity requirement because the fourth amendment requires that the warrant particularly describe only two things the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized as suc h the court concluded that fourth amendment does not require that the triggering conditi on for an anticipatory warrant be set forth in the warrant itself justice souter joined by justices st evens and ginsburg wrote concurring opinion to qualify some points specifically to caution that omitting the triggering condition off the face of an anticipatory warrant could lead to several untoward consequences with constitutional significance for example an officer who is unfamiliar with the warrant might unwittingly execute it before the triggering condition has occurred which could result in spoiling the fruits of the search moreover justice souter left open the possibility for reconsideration of this issue should the court decide that the target of warrant has right to inspect it prior to its execution
