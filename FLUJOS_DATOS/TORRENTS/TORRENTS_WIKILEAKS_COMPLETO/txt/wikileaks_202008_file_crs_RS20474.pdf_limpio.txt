the north america free trade area nafta envisioned by the clinton administration as the first concrete step towards creation of an ftaa preliminary nego tiations started in july 1995 chile however shortly thereafter suspended the negotiations pending renewal of us fasttrack negotiating authority in august 1999 even though the administration still lacked fasttrack authority chile proposed to start discussions on bilateral free trade agreement not nafta accession the clinton administration has remained divided on how to respond to chiles proposal some agencies appear concerned that the initiative could divert attention from us multilateral or regional initiatives the second issue focuses on prefer ential tariff treatment for countries of the caribbean and central america these countries maintain that they have been losing trade and investment opportunities to mexico as result of the preferential access mexico has to the us market under nafta on may 18 2000 president clinton signed into lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20474crs3 pl 106200 legislation that contained provisions title ii also known as the us caribbean basin trade partnership act providing benefits for cbi

the measure provides benefits for apparel made with regional fabric the third issue involves movement towards hemispheric free trade nearly four years after the 1994 summit of the americas hemispheric leaders formally launched the ftaa negotiations in 1998 subsequently the negotiations have been slowed by domestic economic and political problems in the hemisphere the continued absence of us fast track trade authority and the attempt to launch new round of multilateral trade negotiations at meeting held in toronto november 34 1999 trade ministers directed negotiators to compile drafts from all

1272 billion in fy2000 and fy2001 emergency supplemental funding for its counter narcotics plan colombia concluded in june 2000 with an appropriation of 1289 billion although the totals are similar congress made significant changes in funding allocations after contentious debate over several aspects of the plan questions at issue were whether substantial assistance to the colombian military accused of aiding rightist paramilitary forces in killings could stem the flow of cocaine and heroin from colombia to the united states and whether military approach to combating illegal drugs would undermine us interests in advancing democracy in february the administration had requested 102 billion for colombia with the remainder for other countries in the region and the

signed into law july 13 2000 the conferees almost evenly split the funding difference large part of which was the senate decision to cut 388 million to purchase 30 blackhawk helicopters that the administration had requested for colombian counternarcotics efforts and instead provide 1185 million to purchase 60 of the less expensive huey ii helicopters another major difference pertained to human rights funding and conditions although the senate almost tripled house funding for human rights programs it attached stiff human rights conditions to much of the aid negotiators opted to provide 30 huey iis and 18 blackhawks and increased human rights funding slightly over the senate level but attached waiver to the senate conditions prepared by nina serafino specialist in international

component of policy consists of support measures for the cuban people including ussponsored broadcasting to cuba and us government support for democracybuilding efforts although policymakers agree on the overall objective of us policy to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island there have been several schools of thought about how to achieve that objective these range from keeping maximum pressure on cuba to removing sanctions in graduated fashion to normalizing relations swiftly and are reflected by the numerous measures introduced in the 106th congress legislative action this year has focused on initiatives to ease restrictions on us food and medical exports to cuba and initiatives to ease restrictions on travel to cuba at the same time there has been legislative action to increase sanctions by conditioning aid to russia on closing the russian signals intelligence facility at lourdes cuba and by making it easier for enforcement of antiterrorism judgments in us courts thereby allowing for the payment of 1876 million 1997 judgment against cuba to be paid from cubas frozen assets in the united states to the families of three us citizens killed
