yacobucci specialist in energy and environmental policy december 23 2008 abstract the establishment of low carbon fuel standard could signiﬁcantly aﬀect fuel supplies and fuel prices however the details of any program are key to determining those eﬀects the stringency scope time frame and ﬂexibility of the program would determine its ultimate eﬀects on both fuel markets and greenhouse gas emissions the development of californias rules could inform policymakers looking to establish federal lcfs however the scope of federal program requiring compliance nationwidewould likely aﬀect the fuel system in ways not comparable to californias experience if more lowcarbon fuel is needed in california supply can be shifted from other parts of the country not under an lcfs if more lowcarbon fuel is needed nationwide higher production andor imports would be necessary if the requirements of low carbon fuel standard get ahead of the necessary supply conventional fuel supply would need to be curtailed or the program would need to be delayed it is likely that the proposals with later time frames would be less disruptive to the fuel supplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40078g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

this way the greenhouse gas intensity of transportation fuels would decrease regardless of the growth in transportation or fuel demand while california has not formally proposed regulations the state air resources board has released drafts of possible regulations several bills were introduced in the 110 th congress to establish similar national lcfs these bills varied based on their target dates

california governor arnold schwarzenegger issued an executive order directing the california environmental protection agency to establish low carbon fuel standard lcfs1 the executive order requires the state of california to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels in the state by 10 by 2020 in october 2008 the california air resources board arb released draft implementing regulations and updated that draft in december 2008 this was one of many actions taken by california in response to california assembly bill ab32 which also requires arb to adopt rules and regulations to achieve the maximum feasible and costeffective reductions in greenhouse gas ghg emissions if finalized the california lcfs would require fuel suppliers to reduce the expected lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from motor fuels based on fuels energy content in this way the greenhouse gas intensity of transportation fuels would decrease regardless of the growth in transportation or fuel demand several bills were introduced in the 110 th congress to establish similar national lcfs these bills varied based on their target dates and required reductions some were standalone bills while others were proposed as part of more comprehensive greenhouse gas legislation none were adopted one was discussed on the senate floor motor fuels face significant regulatory requirements at the state and federal levels for fuel quality content of toxic materials expected criteria pollutant emissions and other properties the establishment of low carbon fuel standardat either the state or federal levelwould add another major regulatory requirement further federal requirement would likely be far more challenging for fuel providers since under state standard lowcarbon fuels would likely be shipped to the regulated states from unregulated states while federal standard could not be met by this sort of product shifting this report analyzes the draft california standards and discusses how those standards might work given that the draft regulations leave many details to be decided later next the report analyzes federal lcfs legislation proposed in the 110 th congress finally the report analyzes what effects an lcfs might have on state and national fuel supplies g25g145g138g157g561g146g156g561g138g561g14g152g160g561g5g138g155g139g152g151g561g8g158g142g149g561g21g157g138g151g141g138g155g141g501g561 transportation is key source of greenhouse gas emissions both nationally and worldwide in 2006 transportation represented roughly 33 of total us carbon dioxide co 2 emissions and roughly 26 of total ghg emissions2 of those emissions combustion of gasoline and diesel fuel in passenger vehicles trucks and nonroad engines account for nearly 90 of total transportation emissionsthe remainder is mostly the use of jet fuel in aviation transportation ghg emissions are essentially function of total vehicle miles traveled vmt the fuel economy of the vehicle 1 governor arnold schwarzenegger executive

emissions generally requires at least one of four approaches 1 decrease total vehicle miles traveled 2 increase the efficiency of fuel consumption 3 decrease the carbon content of transportation fuel andor 4 decrease the rate of release of nonfuelrelated emissions3 low carbon fuel standard would aim to reduce the carbon content variable in the above equation4 there are two basic ways to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels the first method would be to switch to direct fuel substitutes or blending components with lower carbon content for example biofuels with lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions could be blended directly into gasoline and diesel fuel the second method would be to switch from petroleumbased fuels to other alternatives such as natural gas hydrogen or electricity

taken to reduce the carbon intensity of fuel the full lifecycle emissions of the replacement fuel must be considered otherwise vehicle ghg emissions could simply be shifted to another location and could lead to net increase in emissions for example an electric vehicle has zero greenhouse gas emissions but there can be significant emissions upstream at the electric power plant especially if coal is the primary fuel therefore all direct and indirect emissions from every step in the production process and use of fuel should be considered to the extent possible these steps vary widely among fuels and even among different feedstocks for the same fuel for petroleum fuels potential emissions can come from petroleum extraction transport of crude oil to the refinery refining distribution of refined fuel final combustion for electricity produced from coal potential emissions include coal mining and transport and burning the coal at the power plant while the lifecycle emissions from wind electricity may be negligible they could include the production and installation of wind turbines perhaps the most involved and varied fuel lifecycles are those for biofuels potential emissions may come from fertilizer production 3 in most cases the fuelrelated emissions form the majority of transportation emissions 4 californias low carbon fuel standard is part of larger effort to reduce greenhouse emissions from the transportation sector and the economy as whole including 1 vehicle ghg emissions standards that would either increase the fuel economy of new vehicles or decrease the carbon intensity of their use both fuelrelated and nonfuel related emissions and 2 incentives to reduce vmt eg transit subsidies

transport refining andor conversion fuel distribution and combus tion however some or all of these emissions may be offset by the growth cycle of the feedstock plant which required carbon dioxide key question is the effect of indirect emissions which may result from changes in current practices for example if higher biofuel use leads to increased corn production that may displace soybean production if virgin land is then used to grow soybeans the potential release of carbon from that virgin land may be significant valuing the emissions of each step in fuels lifecycle is key to the development of low carbon fuel standard however in many cases there is little or consensus on the amount of emissions from each step especially where biofuels are concerned key questions remain over how to value emissions from land use change especially indirect land use change or whether indirect changes should be considered at all 5

california governor arnold schwarzenegger signed assembly bill ab32 which among other provisions requires the california air resources board arb of the california environmental protection agency calepa to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and costeffective greenhouse gas emission reductions from sources or categories of sources 6 as part of that requirement on january 18 2007 governor schwarzenegger issued an executive order directing calepa to establish low carbon fuel standard reducing the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by at least 10 by 2020 in response to that executive order arb established four lcfs working groups 7 held public workshops and meetings and compiled detailed background information8 on october 10 2008 arb released draft regulations for the program on december 1 2008 arb released an updated draft9 arb plans to have the rule adopted and implemented by 2010 the draft rule would require fuel providers to achieve set average ghg emissions levelwhich would decrease each yearon an energyequivalent basis see table 1 the draft essentially sets up two average requirements one for gasoline and one for diesel fuel all fuels that substitute for gasoline would be calculated in the gasoline average all diesel substitutes would be calculated in the diesel average for example natural gas or electricity used for passenger cars would be counted in the gasoline average any overcompliance with the annual standard would generate 5 in similar vein the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 expanded the renewable fuel standard rfs established in the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the rfs requires the use of renewable fuel in gasoline and other fuels nationwide eisa further requires the use of advanced biofuels with 50 or lower greenhouse gas emissions relative to petroleum fuels as determined by the environmental protection agency epa administrator this advanced biofuel requirement begins in calendar year 2009 however epa has not published draft or proposed rule detailing which fuels will qualify or the methodology for how lifecycle emissions will be calculated 6 state of california california health and safety code division 255 part 4 section 38560 7 lifecycle analysis compliance and enforcement

draft rule is under development and key determinations still necessary include the energy content and average carbon intensity for each fuel energy economy ratios for various fuelvehicle combinations relative to gasoline andor diesel fuel and baseline carbon intensity levels from which the 10 reduction by 2020 would be calculated

term californias lcfs is likely to promote the use of biofuels that can be readily blended into gasoline and diesel fuel however the determination of the baseline and the average carbon intensity values will directly affect the role of biofuels for example the 2010 baseline for the rule will likely incorporate the fact that by 2010 most of californias gasoline is expected to be e10 90 gasoline and 10 ethanol using cornbased ethanol from the midwest or sugar based ethanol from brazil if so then the carbon reductions from that fuel have already been accounted for without significant changes to the fuel supply fuel providers face blend wall which limits gasoline ethanol content to 10 this blend wall is the result of three key factors 5 environmental protection agencys epa implementation of the clean air act which limits the allowable amount of ethanol in gasoline to 10 by volume 13 6 motor vehicle warranties which currently may be voided if owners fuel their vehicles on blends of higher than 10 ethanol14 and 7 manufacturers who supply tanks and pumps to retailers who currently limit ethanol content to 1515 11 ibid p 53 12 potential issue with electric fuel is that most electricity producers generate their electricity from variety of sources and supply that power to the grid it is impossibl to count electrons to see which end user consumed power from one fuel source vs another therefore there may be the potential for electric fuel producers to count all of the electric vehicle fuel they produce as coming from their lowest carbon sources in order to generate the most credits possible for this reason arb might require electric fuel providers to certify their fuel carbon content based on their average fuel mix 13 to increase gasoline ethanol content above this level fu producers would need to petition epa to allow higher blends and prove to epa that the higher blends will not lead to higher pollutant emissions or compromise the durability of vehicle emissions control systems 14 automakers would need to be confident that the higher blend would not compromise the performance and reliability of their new vehicles which would likely require extensive sting further to allow th higher blends in existing vehicles automakers would likely need even more test data 15 similarly to automakers pump and tank manufacturers might need extensive data to update their warranties httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40078g3g561g14g152g160g561g5g138g155g139g152g151g561g8g158g142g149g561g21g157g138 g151g141g138g155g141 g497g561 g21g157g138g157g142g561g138g151g141g561

conventional corn ethanol would need to be replaced by ethanol with lower lifecycle emissions although even this would not be enough to meet 10 reduction unless arb were to certify 100 carbonfree ethanol fuel it is expected that ethanol produced from cellulosic feedstocks eg perennial grasses trees or municipal waste will have significantly lower ghg emissions than gasoline or corn ethanol but the total lifecycle ghg reductions are uncertain and there are currently commercialscale cellulosic ethanol plants on the diesel side there is more potential to blend biodiesel or renewable diesel diesel substitutes produced from vegetable oils and animal fats however the current supply of these fuels is limited to displace 10 of the carbon in californias diesel fuel alone roughly 3 billion gallons in 2006 16 would require all of the estimated us biodiesel production for fy2007 450 million gallons17 assuming 68 reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions18 in the longer term the lcfs is likely to promote the use of various alternative fuels especially natural gas and electricity initial estimates from epa indicate that natural gas could lead to ghg reductions of 20 or more while electric fuel could lead to nearly 50 reduction using the national average fuel mixrelying solely on renewable electricity would lead to even greater reductions the lcfs could also promote the develo pment of fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel however like electricity the primary energy supply for hydrogen will directly affect its ghg profile and current hydrogen supply is dependent on fossil fuels the lcfs is likely to promote various options in the short and long term as opposed to single solution study of californias lcfs by the university of california davis institute for transportation studies its concluded that on the basis of study of wide range of vehicle fuel options we find 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020 to be an ambitious but attainable target 19 g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g4g138g155g155g146g142g155g156g561g157g152g561g11g150g153g149g142g150g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 several potential barriers to implementation of californias lcfs have been expressed by its and others these include limited supply of lowcarbon fuels and in many cases the need to commercialize those fuels infrastructure constraints in delivering those fuels to california and limited number of vehicles to utilize the fuels especially for longerterm solutions like hydrogen or electricity this report will

way consumers can use their existing vehicles and the fuel is one they are familiar with however as noted above on page 5 the e10 blend wall may limit the ability of fuel providers to blend additional ethanol into gasoline there seem to be only two remedies to this situation 8 eliminate the blend wall by successfully petitioning epa to increase the limit on gasoline ethanol content beyond 10 eg e15 e20 or higher and at the same time gain approval of higher level blends under automakers warranties and fuel pump certifications or 9 replace cornbased ethanol in e10 by using ethanol from other sources that have lower carbon intensity which may include ethanol from brazilian sugar or cellulose in addition to blending higher levels of ethanol into gasoline fuel providers could promote the use of e85 in flexible fuel vehicles ffv 20 however ffvs represent small fraction of motor vehicles and it is unclear how many of those ve hicles are registered in california further currently most ffvs are fueled on gasoline as op posed to e85 its and others conclude that for e85 to play significant role in the lcfs both the penetration of ffvs into the california market and the share of those vehicles operated on e85 would need to increase substantially 21 likewise the infrastructure for e85 refueling would need to expandcurrently there are only 13 e85 stations in california and roughly 40 in neighboring states22 other barriers include the need for increased rail andor port capacity to bring ethanol into the state increased tank capacity at fuel terminals to store more ethanol and upgraded storage and delivery systems g7g149g142g140g157g155g146g140g146g157g162g561g14g146g150g146g157g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the key barrier to using electricity to meet californias lcfs is the limited number of vehicles available to use the fuel while there were several models of highwaycapable electric vehicles in the1990s they were mostly available only for lease and most of those have been recalled by their manufacturers currently only one company tesla motors produces plugin electric vehicle that is permitted on the highway and only about 100 teslas have been delivered nationwide 23 the majority of electric vehicles currently in service are neighborhood electric vehicles nevs electric vehicles certified to operate on streets with posted speed limits of 35 miles per hour or lower24 20 an ffv is vehicle capable of running on conventional gasoline an alternative fuel or any mixture of the two although general term for any such vehicle in most cases the term is used to refer to e85gasoline ffvs 21 presumably e85 prices would need to be lower than gasoline on an equivalent energy basis for consumers to prefer e85 therefore e85 subsidies or high gasoline prices might be necessary to promote the expansion of e85 22 us department of energy alternative fuels and advanced vehicles data center alternative fueling station total counts by state and fuel type washington

key difference between national lcfs and that proposed by california is the scope of the program and its effects on fuel supply when implemented the california program will only apply in california presumably increased demand for lowcarbon fuels in california would be met through both increased us production and im ports of lowcarbon fuel and by shifting low carbon fuels from areas of the country not covered by the program in national program the second option fuel shifting would not be possible therefore if domestic production were inadequate to meet the mandate national production andor imports would need to increase to meet the increased demand otherwise total national consumption of conventional nonlow carbon fuels would need to decrease in order to meet the averaging requirement in its analysis of s 2191 cra international found that under 10 national standard in 2020 covering all transportation fuels there would not be enough lowcarbon fuel to offset total fuel demand 26 therefore in cras model total transportation fuel consumption dropped dramatically and motor fuel prices increased roughly 140 above baseline projections in later years they found that this price effect was diminished as more cellulosic biofuel and electricity were introduced into the fuel system27 the magnitude of the price increase is perhaps less relevant than the potential effect of establishing mandate before the fuel is expected to be available to meet that mandate it is likely that the proposals with later time frames would be less disruptive to the fuel supply

potentially face complex mix of lowcarbon regulations this may be more likely if definitions or methodologies for lifecycle analysis differ between the two programs in general lcfs legislation

credits earned in one program can be used for the other or there can be link between the two and covered entity must comply with both programs separately in the proposals in the 110 th congress there was link between the two progra ms forcing fuel suppliers to comply with the lcfs regardless of whether there were more costeffective carbon reductions in other parts of the economy this could effectively result in double regulation for the fuels sector and is one of the factors that led cra international to conclude that the lcfs in s 2191 would result in dramatically higher fuel prices future proposals could allow some flexibility by allowing fuel providers to use limited number of capandtrade credits for compliance with the lcfs and viceversa
