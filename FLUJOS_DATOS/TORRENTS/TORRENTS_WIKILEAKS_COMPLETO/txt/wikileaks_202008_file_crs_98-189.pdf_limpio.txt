the deductibility of the cost of advertising tobacco products be limited or eliminated since advertising is form of speech this raises the question of whether such limitation would violate the provision of the first amendment that congress shall make lawabridging the freedom of speech or of the presshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98189congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congressreceived through the crs web98189 march 4 1998 tobacco advertising the constitutionality of limiting its tax deductibility henry cohen legislative attorney american law division summary under the internal revenue code advertising is ordinarily deductible as business expense 26 usc 1 62 it has been proposed however that the deductibility of the cost of advertising tobacco products be limited or elimin ated since advertising is form of speech this raises the question of whether such limitation would violate th provision of the first amendment that congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press we conclude that it apparently would not as advertising is commercial speech it is not entitled to the same level of first amendment protection as other speech and to make it more expensive by limiting its tax deductibility would apparently not violate t he central hudson test that the supreme court applies in determining whether governmental res trictions on commercial speech are constitutional tax deductions and free speech the supreme court has held that congress is not required to subsidize firs t amendment rights through tax deduction but that first amendment question would arise if congress were to discriminate invidiousl in its subsidies in order to suppress what it deemed dangerous ideas in 1991 the court wrote regan v taxation with representation of wash 461 us 540 1983 stands for the pro position that tax scheme that discriminates among speakers does not implicate the first amendment unless it discriminates on the basis of ideas in that case we considered provisi ons of the internal revenue code that discriminated between contributions to lobbying organizations one section of the code conferred taxexempt status on certain nonprofit organizations that did not engage in lobbying activities contributions to those organizations wer deductible another section of the code ferred taxexempt status on certain other nonprofit organizations that did lobby but contributions to them were not deductible taxpayers contributing to veterans organizations were however permitted to deduct their contributions regardless of those organizations lobbying activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98189crs2 leathers v medlock 499 us 439 450452 19911 regan v taxation with representation of washington 461 us 540 547 19832the tax distinction between these lobbying organizations did not trigge r heightened scrutiny under the first amendment id at 546551 we explained that legislature is not required to subsidize first amendment rights through tax exemption or tax deducti on id at 546 for this proposition we relied on cammarano v united states 358 us 498 1959 in cammarano the court considered an internal revenue regulation that denied tax deduction fo r money spent by businesses on publicity programs directed at pending stat legislation the court held that the regulation did not violate the firs t amendment because it did not discriminate on the basis of who was spending the money on publicity or what the person or business was advocating th regulation was therefore plainly not aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas id at 513 quoting speiser v randall 357 us 513 519 1958 regan while similar to cammarano presented the additional fact tha t congress had chosen to exempt from taxes contributions to veterans organizations while not exempting other contributi ons this did not change the analysis inherent in the power to tax is the power to discriminate in taxation legislatures have especially broad latitude in creating classifications an d distinctions in tax statutes regan supra at 547 cammarano established that the government need n ot exempt speech from genera lly applicable tax regan established that tax scheme does t become suspect simply because it exempts only some speech regan reiterated in the first amendment context the strong presumption in f avor of duly enacted taxation schemes the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that classification is hostile an d oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes on the record in regan there appeared such hostile and oppressiv discrimination we explained that the case would be different if congress were to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such way as to aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas id at 548 but that was not the case the exemption for contributions to veterans organizations applied withou t reference to the content of the speech involved it was not intended to suppress any ideas and there was demonstration that it had that effect 1 because in regan the exemption for contributions to veterans organization s applied without reference to the content of the speech involved the supreme cour t applied rational basis test in upholding the discrimination in favor of veterans organizations it wrote generally statutory classifications are valid if they bear rational relation to legitimate government purpose statutes are subjected to higher level f scrutiny if they interfere with fundamental right such as freedom of speech or employ suspect classification such as race2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98189crs3 leathers v medlock supra note 1 at 447 3 simon schuster inc v members of the new york state crime victims board

of new york 447 us7 557 563 1980 id at 5668 fox supra note 6 at 4769if congre ss were to eliminate or limit the tax deduction for tobacco advertisin g without doing the same for all advertising then it would effectively be interfering with the freedom of speech it would not matter from first amendment s tandpoint that it would make tobacco advertising more expensive rather than directly lim it it because the supreme court has held that differential taxation of first amendment speakers is constitutionally suspect when it threatens to suppress the expression of particular ideas or viewpoints3 statute is presumptively inconsistent w ith the first amendment if it imposes financial burden on speakers because of the content of their speech 4 neverthele ss the speech whose freedom would be limited by limiting the ta x deduction for tobacco advertising would be commercial speech this makes it probable that such limitation would be constitutional commercial speech the supreme court has held that the first amendment notwithstanding its broa d language congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech is t absolute some speech ch as obscenity it does not protect at all other speech such5 as comme rcial speech which is speech that proposes commercial transaction it6 accords lesser protection to than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression7 in central hudson gas electr ic corp v public service commission of new york the court prescribed the test to be used to determine the constitutionality of governmenta l restrictions on commercial speech for such restriction t be constitutional it must meet fourprong test this test asks initially 1 whether the commercial speech at issue i s protected by the first amendment that i s whether it concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and 2 whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting it i s substantial if both inquiries yield positive answers then to be constitutional th restriction must 3 directly advance the governmental interest asserted and 4 b not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest 8 in board of trustees of the state u niversity of new york v fox the supreme court made it easier fo r the government to satisfy the fourth prong of the central hudson test it held that the fourth prong is not to be interpreted strictly to require the legislature to use the least restrictive means available to accomplish its purpo instead the court held9 legislation regulating commercial speech is to be upheld if there is fit between th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98189crs4 id at 480 the court does not eq uate this test with the less rigorous obstacles of rational10 basis review florida bar v went for it inc 515 us 618 632 1995 in other words although restriction on commercial speech need not constitute the least restrictive means to satisfy the fourth prong it must be more than merely rational 15 usc 133511 15 usc 4512 posadas puerto rico associates v tourism

necessarily perfect but reasonable 10 applying the central hudson test the first prong of the central hudson test asks whether the advertising being limited concerns lawful activity and is not misleading tobacco advertising is lawful except on any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the federa l communications commission and we will presume that only nonmisleadin g11 advertising is at issu as misleading advertising is already illegal under 5 of the federal trade commission act12 the second prong of central hudson asks whether the asserted govern mental interest in restricting it is substantial the purpose of limiting the tax deductibility of tobacc advertising presumably would be to increase its cost in order to reduce the amount f such advertisin g in order to reduce the demand for tobacco products in order to reduce the incidence of tobaccorelated illnesses the supreme court has held that th governments interest in the health safety and welfare of its citizens constitutes substantial governmental interest13 the third prong of central hudson asks whether the restriction on commercia l speech directly advances the governmental interest asserted the supreme court s found reasonable the view that restricting advertising directly advances the asserte d governme ntal interest by reducing the demand for the product advertised the cour t14 has also held however that the government must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to material degree with15 respect to restrictions on tobacco advertising that the food and drug administratio n proposed it concluded that tobacco advertising plays concrete role in the decision of minors to smoke and that each specific restriction on this advertising that it is adopting will contribute to limiting its effect and thus to protecting the health of children an d adolescents u nder the age of 18 if this is true then the advertising restrictions would16 apparently satisfy the third prong of the central hudson test the fourth and final requirement of the central hudson test is that there be reasonable fit

eliminating the tax deduction for tobacc o17 advertising would not directly limit tobacco advertising itself it appears likely that i t would be found reasonable means to accomplish the end of reducing smoking viewpointbased discrimination would it constitute unconstitutional discrimination if congress were to limit r eliminate the tax ded uction for tobacco advertising but not for other product advertising or at least for advertising of other dangerous products law review article concedes that elimination of the tax deduction for tob acco advertising may arguably pass constitutional muster under the central hudson test but nevertheless conclude s that it would constitute unconstitutional viewpointbased discrimination the article claims that the court in18 central hudson did not address the i ssue of viewpoint distinctions this type of analysis is therefore inappropriate in the context of the harkin amendment where the restriction19 on commercial speech is contentbased based on this fact the harkin amendment is unconstitutional because the first amendment does not allow the government to single out any form of speech and suppress it because of its content20 the law revie w articles analysis appears confused on this point to say that restriction on advertising is viewpointbased or contentbased is to say merely that i t applies to advertisements for par ticular products that it restricts or imposes additional costs on what one may say in advertisements about particular product or product s rather than with respect to all advertisements viewpointbased advertising restriction s might be contrasted with for example zoning restrictions on billboards that apply to all advertisements regardless of content central hudson contrary to the claim in the law review article did in fact involve viewpointbased discrimination as it concerned regulation that pr ohibited electric utilities from advertising to promote the use of electricity but did not prohibit electric utilities or anyone else from advertising any other products the supreme court declared th e21 regulation unconstitutional but not because it constituted viewpointbased discrimination rather it declared it unconsti tutional because it failed the new test that the court created in that case the central hudson test the central hudson test is the test that th supreme court has mandated for determining the constitutionality of governmental actions that restrict commercial speech whether on the basis of viewpoint or otherwise 22httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98189crs6 continued22 advertisem ents
