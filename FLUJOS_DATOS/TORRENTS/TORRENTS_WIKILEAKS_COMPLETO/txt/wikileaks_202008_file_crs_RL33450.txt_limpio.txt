approaches such as dams levees and channels to modify natures flood hazard areas congress established flood risk financing and land management strategy the national flood insurance program nfip with the passage of the national flood insurance act1 the federal flood insurance program was established in response to mounting flood losses escalating cost of disaster relief to the general taxpayers and as an alternative to federal disaster assistance provided on an ad hoc basis federal flood insurance is currently available to homeowners renters and businesses in 20118 communities that participate in the nfip to meet the cost of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods since 1978 the nfip has grown from 14 million policyholders and 50 billion in risk exposure to almost 5 million policyholders and 900 billion in risk exposure2 most disaster experts would agree that demands on the nfip are not likely to decline as weather related disasters particularly hurricanes are said to be worsening in frequency and severity population continues to grow in floodprone areas and property values continue to rise in the wake of hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in 2005 the nfip faces unprecedented financial and regulatory strains with another severe storm season predicted in 2006 the nations attention has now focused on disaster impacts and costs as well as both the strengths of the nfip in managing and financing the nations flood risk and its weaknesses those concerned about program weaknesses cite the increasing need to borrow from the us treasury premium rate cross subsidies outdated flood insurance rate maps allegations of uneven compliance with mandatory purchase requirements and need to put the program on sounder financial footing

2006 the president signed into law s 2275 the national flood insurance program enhanced borrowing authority act of 20063 to increase from 185 billion to 208 billion the amount that the federal emergency management agency fema can borrow from the us treasury to satisfy contractual obligations under the nfip under current law fema must repay any borrowed funds with interest as it collects premiums some insurance market experts believe fema is unlikely to repay the 23 billion borrowed from the treasury within the next 10 years because they think premium collections over that period will probably be used to pay claims resulting from hurricane katrina and future flood insurance claims and expenses4 the 109th congress is considering additional legislation hr 4973 and comparable senate bill that does not yet have number to modify the nfip to make changes intended to enhance the effectiveness of the program while limiting taxpayer liability for claims overview of hr 4973 and senate

actuarial rates for certain properties and modernizing the nations flood maps under hr 4973 fema would be required to review the nations flood maps and for the first time map the nations 500year flooplains the bill would authorize 300 million to be appropriated for map modernization effort through fiscal years 2007 to 2012 and require fema to maintain and publish an inventory of us levees hr
