countries of the oecd are focusing an increased amount of their attention on developing and newly emerging economies that adopt free market systems as result of this broader perspective the oecd is shifting its emphasis from focusing exclusively on the members of the oecd to assessing the manner in whic h various policy issues affect broad range of countries including the impact globaliza tion is having on world trade wages and industrial development the oecd is organized around three main bodies the council the committees and the secretariat committees are comprised of representatives of all the member countries the overriding committee is the council wh ich has decisionmaking power it is composed of one representative for each mber country generally at the level of ambassador gives guidance to the oecd and directs its work since the work agenda is set by unanimous consent by the council veto by council mber removes an item from the agenda the council meets at the min isterial level once year when foreign finance and other ministers from member countri raise issues and set the priorities for oecd work for the coming year about 200 committees comprised of some 40000 senior government officials from the member countries meet to re view and contribute to work that is conducted by the secretariat in many cases these committees serve as conduits for providing information on work that is being conducted by officials among the oecd member countries on economic issu furthermore the council determines the oecds budget which presently amounts to 470 million the united states which appropriated about 117 million in fy2008 is the largest contributor to the oecds budget the secretariat is comprise d of staff of about 2000 mo stly economists scientists lawyers and other profe ssionals who work to support the efforts of the co mmittees to deliver the work program approved by the council as result the secretariat is organized along substantive areas to mirro r the work of the committees although the structure is flexible enough to handle cross disciplinary studies some of the major areas include employment and bor environment and economic s trade and investment biotechnology agriculture and science public management nd globalization and development parts of the secretariat collect data monitor trends analyze and forecast economic developments while ot her parts research social ch anges or evolving patterns in trade environment agricultu re technology taxation and more in the 1990s the oecd under the directi on of its member countries spearheaded an international agreement to outlaw crimes of bribery and it continues to coordinate efforts that are aimed at reducing the ccurrence of money laundering and corruption also the oecd is pivotal player in prom oting corporate codes of conduct that attempt to develop set of standards for multinational firms that can be applied across national borders in addition the oecd provides vast amount of statistical information and data on the member countries that are made compar able to facilitate co mparison and analysis these data include national accounts economic indicators labor force and employment migration education energy taxa tion tourism and environmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21128crs3 oecd issues the oecd is strong proponent of the vi ew that increasing world economic growth and welfare is best supported by free and open flow of goods services and capital as result it views its own role in this process as that of leading proponent of the benefits of globalization and as force for developing institutions and regulatory structures that can make these benefits available to the oecd members and to developing countries the core work of the oecd committees nd working groups is organized around five main areas in order to provide the memb ers with studies technical knowledge and expertise and to help develop guide lines and codes these areas include trade and investment liberalization work in this area includes promoting the benefits of open markets and analyzing trad as it relates to competition policy the environment labor standards and foreign investment work is also being conducted on the areas of export credit policies elec tronic commerce corporate governance and codes of conduct international taxation pr inciples and the linkages between trade investment and economic development policy reform and development this work focuses on the newly emerging economies of russia and south eastern eu rope where the oecd is attempting to promote peace stability and economic and social progress by achieving economic integration the oecd is attempting to establish standards for fair and non discriminatory treatment for domestic and fo reign investors with the full protection of property rights managing new and ev olving technologies this area focuses on developing the necessary groundwork for the approval adoption and dissemination of new technologies to nonmembers such tec hnologies include biotechnology and related food safety issues public governance national governments face increased challenges coordinating trade and economic issues the oecd is working with national governments to find ways to include broader representation of groups and viewpoints to satisfy public expectations for input into policy issues social protection globalization has created fears that segments of national economies will be permanently displaced the oecd is working with national governments to address the needs of individuals and the member countries to utilize the human resources in each member country issues for congress among some consumer groups there is growing concern over the economic impact of globalization these concerns in turn ar spurring some groups to single out the oecd for criticism as result of the oecds leading role as proponent of free trade open markets and globalization one criticism in particular that is expressed by some groups is the view that the oecd represen ts danger to national sovereignty because they claim it is one among number of inte rnational bodies that exceeds the authority of national governments yet is accountable to one others view the oecd as an economic cartel dominated by the united states and serving mainly the economic andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21128crs4 2 see the oecds crocodile tears at httpwwwflyingfishorgukarticlesoecdtearshtmpolitical interests of the united states2 these groups also argue that the oecd is pursuing free trade and open markets at the expense of the poorest and least developed countries that the pursuit of free market economics worsens further the disparity of income between the richest and the poorest c ountries and that the oecd is promoting the expansion of multinational corporations at the expense of national governments and national economic interests the oecd is independent from any other international organization but it is the creation of its member countries and therefor reflects their interests and views as such it contends that it has hidden or i ndependent agenda of its own but that its agenda is set by its members it also argues that free trade and open markets have proven to be the best route to econo mic development and to higher national incomes there is little doubt however that the united states pl ays leading but not commanding role within the oecd this means that at times the united states carries larger than average portion of the burden for determining the agenda of the oecd and in helping to direct the course of policy developments this also means that the united states is the most obvious target for cr iticism from gr oups that object to the policies or the performance of the oecd the united states plays an active role in the full array of oecd activities in support of the needs of developed countries in the wto negotiations the oecd has pursued analytical research into the impact regional trade agreements are having on the multilateral trading system the agricultural policies of oecd countries the issue of labor mobility the impact of barriers to trade in services and the trade policy implications of changes in the structure of national economies us delegates actively participated in efforts to strengthen competition and antitr ust policies within oe cd countries and to extend and strengthen the oecds antibriber convention in add ition us delegates have supported efforts within the oecd to review national regulatory reform efforts because they argued that targeted regulatory reform especially transparency can benefit domestic and foreign stakeholders alike by improving the quality of regulation and enhancing market openness in 2002 us delegates pressed for greater support for the oecds arrangement on guidelines for officially supported export cr edits which restricts the use of tied aid financing in promoting exports they gained support in 2002 for us proposal to merge and update two agreements that banned tied aid in central nd eastern europe and key countries of the former s oviet union respectively and fo rmally incorporated the new agreement into the arrangement the unite d states also proposed applying the rules governing the use of tied aid to untied aid and formal review of the use of market windows or quasigovernment financial institutions that support national exports but are not subject to multilateral rules us negotiators oppose the efforts by some oecd members to shift the issue of export credit controls to the world trade organization wto because us negotiators believe that consensus favoring controls on export financing would be unlikely since the wto forum would include those very developing countries that benefit the most from export credit subsidies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21128crs5 3 harmful tax competition an emerging global issue organization for economic cooperation and development paris 1998 httpwwwo ecdorgdaffaharm_taxharmfultax_engpdfus delegates have also placed high priority on international investment issues in the oecd as part of the oecds decl aration on internati onal investment and multinational enterprises each oecd member has designated national contact points ncps or the government agencies signated by each country to monitor implementation of the guidelines within their territory the us national contact point is the director of the office of investment affairs the depar tment of state at the annual meeting of ncps in 2002 the participants ag reed to study number of issues including the scope and application of the guidelines the united states also pressed for and contributed to working paper on the genera l treatment and expropr iation obligations in international investment agreements in order to clarify the content of those obligations for arbitrators investors and th international community u s efforts also focused on the oecds high level process on steel to address overcapacity in the global steel market and any marketdistorting practices that contribute to excessive and inefficient steel capacity in december 2002 participants agreed to develop the elemen ts of an agreement for reducing or eliminating tradedistorting subsidies in steel and to explore developing voluntary commitment to refrain from intr oducing new subsidy programs that may maintain or enhance steel capacity the unite d states also supported efforts to establish joint trade capacity building database to assist trade negotiators from developing countries another area of concern for us delegates has been the issue of tax havens during the last half of the 1990s the oecd member countries initiated efforts to curtail the use of tax havens for illicit tax purposes as part of their efforts to curb harmful tax competition3 the oecd member countries defined harmful tax compe tition as attempts to attract foreign investment in financia l and other mobile services by providing preferential tax treatment to such investment through regime that excludes local residents from benefitting from the regime or that limits access to the local market thereby protecting the local market from foreign competition coupled with lack of transparency and lack of effective exch ange of information for tax purposes oecd member countries initiated these efforts becau they were concerned that certain kinds of tax competition for internationally mobile capital were anticompetitive this project has evolved over time the main focus now has shifted to improving the transparency of tax and regulatory regimes and to establishing effective exchange of information for tax purposes us delegates led the efforts to refocus the project on advancing the longstanding policy of promoting the ex change of information for tax purposes the issues of bribery and tax havens ve been major concerns among the oecds members and have prompted certa in changes in us laws international flows of capital and goods and services around the world phenomenon referred to as globalization have grown dramatically over the last decade and are producing significant challenges for the oecd member countries including the united states internationa l flows of capital are the prime mover behind exchange rates and global flows of goods and services and represent the heightened growth of fore ign investment and crossborder business transactions one outcome of this global expansion of business transactions however has been the increased use by multinational corporations and
