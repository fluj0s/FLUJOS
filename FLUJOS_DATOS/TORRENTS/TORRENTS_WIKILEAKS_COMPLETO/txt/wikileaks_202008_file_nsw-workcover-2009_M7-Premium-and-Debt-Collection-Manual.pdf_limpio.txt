premium on which late payment fee h as been charged the payment is to be allocated firstly to an overdue claims excess if applicable premium amount late payment fee charged and debited to the employer bank charges for dishonoured cheques third party legal costs issued on 171201 34 section 6 claim xcess claim excess recovery insurers are responsible for the collection of claims excesses from employers where an employer has overdue claims excesses the insurer must institute collecti on procedures in line with those applicable for outstanding premiums excess amounts not recovered within one calendar month of being debited are to be treated as overdue note s172 late payment fee does not apply to overdue claims excess 61 claims excess offset offset agreement insurers are required to enter into an offset agreement with each category employer and category b employer who elects to pay the claims excess which will allow the insurer the rig ht to offset the excess against amounts to be reimbursed to the employer for compensation paid to the worker by the employer this is to apply in all possible cases insurers are expected to apply the offset provisions in all possible cases this is especially the case for larger employers insurers are expected to ensure an offset arrangement is in place for all major clients offsetting procedures insurers are reminded that claims excesses are also to be offset against any premium credit or refund due to the employer concerned the amount offset is not to exceed the amount of premium credit or refund and therefore place the employers premium account in debit in general the following procedures will apply insurer receives claim for and makes determination of liability insurer advises employer of determination and where liability is accepted advises the employer that they may pay the worker for the time lost in practice employers may well have continued to pay the worker as matter of course insurer processes the claim and issues payment to the employer reimbursing the employer for payments made to the worker less 500 or where the payment is less than 500 that amount issued on 171201 35 insurers are obliged to veri fy that the employer has paid the worker prior to reimbursing the employer the verification that occurs under the existing procedures outlined above is believed to be sufficient for this purpose exceptions will occur where for whatever reason the emplo yer does not make payments to the worker this may occur for variety of reasons for example the worker is longer employed by that employer the employer is longer operating the employer believes the claim is not valid one or the lodgement of c laim was delayed in these circumstances the insurer should make payment direct to the worker and recover the excess from the employer as with existing arrangements it is possible that an employer may make part payment to an injured worker insurers should offset the excess against any reimbursement to the employer and should any excess remain outstanding this should be recovered in the normal way if the excess is not offset debt should be raised against the employer this debt should be raised at the point the payment is made to the worker and should be invoiced to the employer due within 30 days for accounting purposes an excess recovery should be shown in all cases as payment and recovery where an offset occurs both these transactions may be raised together for example if worker is paid 600 in weekly benefits by the employer on behalf of the insurer the insurer should show payments of 600 recovery of 500 and reimburse the net amount of 100 to the employer please note insu rers are not legally entitled to offset excess debts against any claim other than the claim to which the excess relates that is if an excess is generated by claim insurers cannot offset that against payments made on claim b similarly insurers can on ly offset against the employer in question and not for example against related companies within group the legislation also provides that an insurer may offset claims excess debits against any return premium credit on the policy if at the time pre mium credit is raised as result of an adjustment calculation or some other reason the employer has outstanding excess debts the excess debts are to be offset against the premium credit in general if the insurer is offsetting against claim payments it should not be necessary to use this facility where the insurer raises return premium credit the insurer should offset this credit against any claims excess debits prior to reducing any existing overdue premium priority should be given to clearing excess debits insurers should not accede to an employers request for payment of return premium credits if excess debits exist insurers should also not accept an employers request for payment of return premium credits to an associated company or entity within group unless they have written request from the company or entity with the credit position when an insurer offsets excess payments they should provide the employer with statement that indicates issued on 171201 36 the gross payment due to the employer either for the reimbursement of compensation amounts or premium credit in the case of premium credits the correct premium calculation forms form pgph should also be issued the excess amounts due to be recovered the net amount due to the employer in reim bursement of compensation or return premium the net amount due will often be nil these statements should be issued in all cases including where the net amount due is nil but may be issued as part of the normal monthly statement 62 litigation recovery action all excess recoveries over 100 are to be referred for litigation action in line with the collection procedures of overdue premiums this includes any claims excess amounts that may have been previously written off as irrecoverable such excess recoveries are to be referred where possible in conjunction with and as part of recovery action for collection of overdue premiums where there is recovery as result of third party action and premium debt was part of the action the amount recove red is to be allocated as follows unless there is specific allocation requested by the debtor to claim excess to premium debtors ledger third party costs are to be recovered from the employer in the same manner as for premium debts the associate d third party costs net of recoveries are to be charged to statutory funds in accordance to section 8 recovery cost table of the premium and debt collection manual write off of claims excess insurers are authorised to treat the writing off of overdue and irrecoverable excess recoveries in the same manner as irrecoverable premiums this means that when collection procedures have been exhausted insurers can without reference to the workcover write off an irrecoverabl overdue claim excess amount up to 300 per claim provided that the total excess amount debited for that claim did not exceed 300 accordingly there can only be one 1 write off per claim issued on 171201 37 where the amount of claim excess which is considered irrecov erable is more than 300 and the employer is still carrying on business the insurer is to obtain approval from the workcover authority before writing off the claim excess employers in liquidation bankruptcy insurers are hereby authorised to write off claims excesses without limit the difference between the amount owed by the employer and the total of amounts received or estimated to be

separate provisions for specific doubtful debts and general provision for future doubtful debts issued on 171201 48 provision for specific doubtful debts insurer s are required to establish specific provision for 1 all debts regardless of value owed by employers in receivership liquidation administration or bankruptcy and 2 any other debts in excess of 100000 where recovery is considered doubtful where t he debts of group of employers known to be under common control total more than 100000 they should be provided against even if the individual debts are less than 100000 details of each debt included in categories 75 are to be reported on form 7 general provision for doubtful debts the authority wishes to co ordinate the creation of general provision for doubtful debts insurers are to calculate the general provision as follows deduct doubtful debts included in the specific provision from their respective age categories b create general provision equal to 70 of the remaining debtors in the over 6 months category plus 40 of the remaining debtors in the 3 6 months category the general provision for doubtful debts is to be adjus ted quarterly thus the provision for doubtful debts in the accounts of the statutory funds will henceforth have two components specific and general issued on 171201 49 section 8 recoveries third party costs any costs debited to the statutory fund for the recov ery of unpaid premiums and late payment fees are third party costs third party costs include ü litigation costs incurred by either an external third party or insurers own in house litigation action litigation costs include court costs and filing fees ssociated with issuing legal documents for the recovery of unpaid premiums and late payment fees ü payments to external third parties for their services in addition to litigated costs ü disbursements such as asc searches and photocopying etc third pa rty costs form part of the debt and must be recovered from the employer the authority does not authorise insurers or their third parties to waive costs incurred where an employer can be pursued where recovery is not pursued by the insurer any such cost s are to be borne by the insurer recovery of costs the payment of costs for external third party or in house litigation actions from the fund is designed to reimburse insurers and their external third parties in the circumstances where recovery is not otherwise available if third party costs are incurred then these must be charged to and recovered from the debtor the authority does not authorise insurers or their third parties to waive costs incurred where debtor is still operating and able to be pursued if the insurer chooses not to pursue the debtor for recovery of costs either for commercial reasons or because of internal administrative errors or oversight by the insurer or the third party the statutory fund is not to be charged insurers ar directed to maintain adequate records of costs incurred costs recovered and all costs recoverable this area will be closely reviewed and monitored by the authority requests for instructions and subsequent placing of matters on hold effective timing in the debt recovery process is essential the faster the legal process the more likelihood there is of recovering outstanding amounts accordingly insurers are requested to adhere to the following 1 requests by third parties or in house litigation area for instructions are to be responded to within 10 days issued on 171201 50 2 insured should not instruct external third parties or their in house litigation area to place matters on hold for more than thirty days if it is required to be placed on hold for more than thi rty days reasons must be noted and placed on file an example of suitable reason would be the recovery action for an earlier debt is in progress wind up action in progress by another creditor some reasons regarded as unsuitable would be emplo yer has requested that the premium be recalculated on revised wages request for interest waivers or tariffcost of claims appeals business being sold negotiating payment arrangement note should matter not be resolved within the 30 day period then the third party or in house litigation area must proceed with recovery action and advise the insurer accordingly insurers are directed to maintain adequate records of all current matters on hold and the reasons why they are on hold this area will be close ly reviewed and monitored by the authority issued on 171201 51 section 9 measure 3 measure 3 methodology for 20012002 an insurerworkcover working party reviewed measure 3 to determine its relevance and compliance with workcover and insurer goal of m aking each measure as outcome based as possible the working party considered the option of measuring the performance of insurers using cash collected instead of overdue debt as proportion of gwp to be the best option to meet this goal this option was accepted by the insurerworkcover remuneration committee as the basis of measure 3 for 2001 onwards cash collected is matched against the gross written premium and late payment fee processed during the year during the same 12 month period the gross w ritten premium processed during the year includes premium for policies commenced or renewed during the year and adjustments to premiums for policies commenced or renewed during the year as well as adjustments to premiums for policies commenced or renewed during previous years issued during the current period for past period the cash collected and processed during the year is cash received in payment of gross written premium and late payment fees processed for the current year and any previous year the objective of the cash collected methodology is to reach net cash collection figure to measure against gross written premium plus late payment fee that is the net amount of premiums and late payment fees collected less the costs associated with co llecting this cash therefore the cash collected result is to be measure based on what has been processed into the insurers computer system that is the results must be reflection of what has been processed for each employers policy the measureme nt period is july to june inclusive which is consistent with the previous debt ratio methodology year to date totals are to be the sum of the 12 month period july to june for unallocated cash and underwriting credits the measurement will be totals fo r the relevant aging as at 30 june being the end of the 12 month period this is because the refunds total will capture the required amounts throughout the year so that the 30 june as at total will account for any other unactioned cash or underwriting credit for the just completed 12 month period therefore as at the new 12 month period commencing 1 july the total of unallocated cash and unallocated underwriting credits as at 30 june will continue to be accounted for in the new period commencing 1 july as unallocated cash unallocated underwriting credits until refunded or allocated note that net cash referred to in measure 3 does not have the same meaning as net cash defined in other areas of the accounting manual issued on 171201 52 it is anticipated that moving t cash collected performance measure will lead to improved efficiency effectiveness and economies measuring the performance of insurers using cash collected will create equity between insurers as late payment fees and recovery costs now impact on the utcome insurers will have the choice of using third parties negotiating an appropriate third party fee structure specific to their cash collection strategies maximising in house debt collection and when to use the services of third parties it is not w orkcovers aim to simply reduce third party involvement and costs as it does not automatically follow that reducing third party involvement will lead to an improved cash collection ratio the rate of cash collected for each dollar paid to third party is more appropriate indicator of the effectiveness of cash collection activities an increase in third party costs will be acceptable provided that the collection rate cost of recoveries is decreasing liquidation and bankruptcy costs will be excluded from the amount of third party costs to be used to calculate an insurers cash collection ratio there is relaxation in workcovers expectation that all available action is taken to recover overdue debts and pursuing debtors to liquidation andor bankrup tcy must be undertaken where payment of premium is avoided wage audit fees charged to employers insurer guideline 0104 and the fees recovered currently do not form part of measure 3 the charging of wage audit fees are to be reported on form

transferred to the relevant workers compensation policy or to designated suspense account after it has been identified that the cash is for payment of workers compensation premium for this reason the

by external third parties are not counted as cash received until it is cash receipted and processed to insurers computer system reversal of late payment fees the amount of late pa yment fees are net

debited to the insurers debtors ledger and included in the insurers accounts that are not required to be paid by the employer for the relevant 12 month july to june period see section 48 of the current pr emium and debt collection manual for details nb reversal of late payment fees are not the same as waived late payment fees reversal of late payment fees is correcting an error whereas waiving acknowledges that the late payment fees were correc tly charged however the late payment fees are not required to be paid refunds refund cheques or cash refunds processed to insurers computer system for an underwriting credit or overpaymentincorrect paymentdouble payment of premium late payment f ees or third party costs to equal figure on form 311 processed into the insurers system is the date that the refund cheque has been drawn an overpayment or double payment of premium represents an overstatement in the insurers cash received total as it is cash collected which is not payment of premium late payment fees or third party costs the employer has simply paid more money than was required or it could be money in payment of other types of insurances and incorrectly credited to the worker s compensation policy an underwriting credit has the effect of reducing the total gross written premium for any one insurer which would create an inflated cash collected result as equal reduction has been made to the numerator of the ratio until it is either refunded or reaches 1 month old from date processed into insurers computer system consequently in recognition that such transactions would create an unfair advantage in any one insurers results and keeping in line with equity principles these overpayments and underwriting credits must be excluded from the cash received total there are two ways to account for these 1 refunds cheques once unallocated cash has been identified as an overpaymentdouble payment the money must be returned to the employer therefore the total amount of refund cheques processed to insurers computer system for the relevant 12 month july to june period for overpayments are deducted from the cash collected figure likewise once an underwriting credit has been cr eated and thereby reduced the gross written premium denominator in order to qualify the equation these underwriting credits must also be accounted for in the net cash collected numerator therefore the total amount of refund cheques processed to insu rers computer system for the relevant 12 month july to june period for underwriting credits are deducted from the cash collected figure issued on 171201 55 2 alternatively they will simply be accounted for as unallocated cash or unallocated underwriting credits once they reach 1 month up to 2 months old and over refer to unallocated cash and unallocated underwriting credits definitions below as at june year end unallocated cash 1 month up to 2 months and over aged from date processed into insurers computer system unallocated cash is cash receipted and processed to insurers computer system aged 1 month up to 2 months old and over from the date processed into insurers system which is either ü placed onto policy and not allocated to an existing related debt ü or placed to suspense account because it is not known which policy it belongs to ü and has not been refunded therefore if only part of the cash is allocated to an existing debt or refunded then that part which is not allocated is consider ed to be unallocated any cash in suspense account is unallocated as it has not been allocated to policy or to an existing related debt of policy to be allocated means the cash received assumes the same ageing as the debt to which it is being allocated or it has been allocated by way of being refunded unallocated cash includes an overpayment double payment or incorrect payment of premium late payment fees or third party costs unallocated cash could also represent cash for payment of othe r types of insurances which has been credited to the employers workers compensation policy in error consequently until such time as the cash either becomes allocated to another existing debt or refunded or returned to the correct policy it will sim ply form part of unallocated cash this means that unallocated cash will simply roll over into the next performance measure period and treated as such until it becomes allocated or refunded note all cash should be allocated andor refunded as soon s possible but later than one calendar month after the close of the month during which the cash was received by the insurer ie later than 60 days from date processed into insurers system unallocated underwriting credits 1 month up to 2 mo nths and over aged from date processed into insurers computer system underwriting credits such as return premiums or premiums discount scheme discounts processed to insurers computer system which are not allocated to an existing related debt or refun ded and is aged 1 month up to 2 months and over from date processed into insurers system of the underwriting credit therefore if only part of the underwriting credit is allocated to an existing debt or refunded then that part which is not allocated i s considered to be unallocated to be allocated means the underwriting credit assumes the same ageing as the debt to which it is being allocated or it has been allocated by way of being refunded issued on 171201 56 an underwriting credit includes return premiums which is wing to the employer for example due lower actual wages declared consequently until such time as the underwriting credit either becomes allocated to another existing debt or refunded it will simply form part of unallocated underwriting credits this means that the unallocated underwriting credit will simply roll over into the new performance measure period and treated as such until it becomes allocated or refunded net third party costs any costs debited to the statutory fund for the recovery of unpaid premiums and late payment fees are third party costs third party costs include ü litigation costs incurred by either an external third party or insurers own in house litigation action litigation costs include court costs and filing fees asso ciated with issuing legal documents for the recovery of unpaid premiums and late payment fees ü payments to external third parties for their services in addition to litigated costs ü disbursements such as asc searches and photocopying etc this means total third party costs paid and processed to insurers computer system less recovered third party costs that have been receipted and processed to insurers computer system for the relevant 12 month july to june period regardless of when the third party cos ts where incurred third party costs mean costs directly related to activities carried out by external third parties or insurers in house in the cash collection process up to and including the issuing of creditors statutory demand 459e notice and bank ruptcy notice it does not include the costs of collection activity undertaken by insurers direct employees bankruptcy and liquidation costs are excluded from the calculation refer to liquidation and bankruptcy costs below to equal form 721b liquida tion and bankruptcy costs third party costs incurred after the issuing of creditors statutory demand 459e notice and bankruptcy notice that is for winding up or bankruptcy proceedings are excluded from net third party costs to equal form 721b what does unallocated mean all policy transactions whether an underwriting transaction or receipting of cash is aged according to the definitions in the accounting manual that is all cash received is aged from the date processed into insurers compu ter system dpis starting with current it will then move into the following ageing brackets as at each month end should the cash remain unallocated issued on 171201 57 under 1 month 1 month up to 2 months 2 months up to 3 months 3 months up to 6 months and over 6 months when cash is allocated to an existing related debt it will then assume the same ageing as the debt to which it has been allocated all underwriting processing is aged from the date processed into insurers computer system dpis starting with current it will then move into the following ageing brackets as at each month end provided that the underwriting credit remains unallocated under 1 month 1 month up to 2 months 2 months up to 3 months 3 months up to 6 months and over 6 months when an underwriting credit is allocated to an existing related debt it will then assume the same ageing as the debt to which it has been allocated late payment fees are aged from the date processed into insurers computer system starting with curre nt under 1 month 1 month up to 2 months 2 months up to 3 months 3 months up to 6 months and over 6 months the best way to illustrate whether something is allocated or unallocated and how it will be accounted for in the new cash collected measure is by looking at an aged clientpolicy listing report in all the following examples assume july 2001 to june 2002 year premium due for payment is 5 000 using one policy for ease of demonstration example 1 unallocated cash policy w 123xy z current under 1 month 1 mth upto 2 mths 2 mth upto 3 mths 3 mths upto 6 mths over 6 months grand total premium due 5000 august payment 4 000 5 000 sub total 4 000 august total 4000 5000 1000 cash received as at august month end 4000 at the end of august the 4000 received is unallocated because it has not been allocated to the existing debt of 5000 that is it has different aging to the 5000 debt issued on 171201 58 being allocated to policy does not mean allocated it must be allocated to an existing related debt example 2 is an example of allocated example 2 policy w 123xyz current under 1 month 1 mth upto 2 mths 2 mth upto 3 mths 3 mths upto 6 mths over 6 months grand total premium due 5000 august payment 4000 4000 september allocation 4000 sub total 0 1000 september total 0 1000 1000 the 4000 received in august has now been allocated to the debt of 5000 the 4000 is now aged the same as the original debt of 5000 therefore the current aging bracket has now been cleared note the grand total of the policy is the same in example 1 and 2 1000 but the treatment of each transactio n is different example 3 overpayment assume premium due for payment is 5000 policy w 123xyz current under 1 month 1 mth upto 2 mths 2 mth upto 3 mths 3 mths upto 6 mths over 6 months grand total premium due 5000 september payment 10 000 5000 september allocation sub total 5 000 5 000 0 september balance 5000 0 5000 cash received as at september month end 10 000 in example 3 5000 of the 10 000 payment has bee n allocated to clear the debt of 5000 now nil there is still 5000 cash that has not been allocated and thus unallocated cash for september month end is 5000 this 5000 is either to be refunded as it is an overpayment or represents premium posit amount or some other debt see example 4 below issued on 171201 59 example 4 in this example assume the 5 000 payment received in september is not identified as an overpayment and remains unallocated until january 2002 when it is identified as an overpayment and refunded cash received totals for each month are as follows policy w 123xyz unallocated cash over 1 month old october 2001 november 2001 december 2001 january 2002 cash received 7000 8000 9000 11 000 premium due september payment 10 000 10000 10 000 10 000 10 000 september allocation unallocated cash january 2002 refund sub total 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 0 cash received 10 000 7000 8000 9000 6 000 the cash received for the months of october november and december is not affected by the unallocated cash amount of 5000 as unallocated cash amounts are only accounted for as at june year end in january however when the overpayment is refunded the cash collected for january is reduced by 5000 this is in line with the definition and treatment of refunds example 5 in this example assume that the 5 000 payment received in septe mber is not identified as an overpayment and remains as unallocated cash as at june year end policy w 123xyz september 2001 march 2002 april 2002 may 2002 june 2002 cash received 7000 8000 9000 11 000 premium due september payment 10 000 10000 10000 10000 10000 september allocation sub total unallocated cash 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 total cash received 10 000 7000 8000 9000 6 000 as at june year end the 5000 unallocated cash will be over 1 month old and therefore cash collected is reduced by the unallocated cash amount of 5000 issued on 171201 60 example 6 example 6 demonstrates the treatment of unallocated cash from one year end into the next policy w 123xyz september 2001 march 2002 april 2002 may 2002 june 2002 july 2002 cash received 7000 8000 9000 11 000 4 000 premium due may payment 10000 10000 10000 may allocation sub total unallocated cash july 2002 refund 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 0 total cash 10 000 7000 8000 9000 11 000 1 000 the unalloc ated cash amount of 5000 received in may is not deducted from the cash collected total as at june year end because it is not aged over 1 month old however in july of the new 2002 year when the unallocated cash is identified as an overpayment and refunded the refund is then deducted from the july cash collected amount issued on 171201 61 section 10 form 7 accounting manual extract

on ageing of c ash received ageing of underwriting credits and handling of pre debits ageing of cash received cash received is to be aged from the date processed into insurers system dpis however cash received that can be wholly allocated to an existing debt i s to be allocated whereby the amount of cash allocated assumes the same ageing at the time of processing as the debt to which it is being allocated if there is more than one debt then the cash allocated is to assume the ageing of the oldest debit unles s otherwise requested by the debtor and if the cash received exceeds the amount of the oldest debit then the remaining cash is to assume the ageing of the next oldest debit and so forth until the cash received is fully allocated an example of this is whe re payment arrangement is in place and the employer is making monthly payments the net amount outstanding for the debtor concerned is to be aged from transaction date and reflected on the correct line in section 2 of form 71 cash received that excee ds the amount of all existing debts is aged from date processed into insurers computer system and would then form part of unallocated cash until such time as it can be allocated to an existing debit or refunded issued on 171201 64 unallocated cash cash received that ü has been placed onto policy and is not allocated to an existing debt at month end ü or placed to suspense account because it is not known which policy it belongs to ü and has not been refunded is considered to be unallocated and is to be aged f rom date processed into insurers computer system starting

amount is to be shown on line 2b under 1 month of form 71 if still unallocated at the following month end the cash will move to the 1 month up to 2 months age band and so on until the cash amount has been allocated or refunded to the employer c cash received from employers for deposit pre mium payments is to be treated as unallocated until such time as the policy period to which the payment

late payment fees or third party costs unallocated cash co uld also represent cash for payment of other types of insurances which has been credited to the employers workers compensation policy in error consequently until such time as the cash either becomes allocated to another existing debt or refunded it wi ll simply form part of unallocated cash note all cash should be allocated andor refunded as soon as possible but later than one calendar month after the close of the month during which the cash was received by the insurer ie later than 6 0 days from date processed into insurers system issued on 171201 65 b underwriting credits being those credits which are created by an underwriting transaction all underwriting processing is aged from the date processed into insurers computer system starting wi th current under 1 month 1 month up to 2 months 2 months up to 3 months 3 months up to 6 months and over 6 months we have previously advised that underwriting credits should be refunded to the employer within one month of the end of the month i n which the credit appears this in principle is good commercial business practice as there is provision whatsoever for the scheme to pay employers interest on monies of this nature whilst held in the books of accounts of insurers there may however be good commercial business practices for an insurer not to abide with this rule ie the employer has premium instalment falling due within maximum of 2 months from the date of the underwriting transaction therefore underwriting credits which are not llocated to an existing related debt or refunded are unallocated underwriting credits therefore if only part of the underwriting credit is allocated to an existing debt or refunded then that part which is not allocated is considered to be unallocated t be allocated means the underwriting credit assumes the same ageing as the debt to which it is being allocated or it has been allocated by way of being refunded an underwriting credit includes return premiums which is owing to the employer for examp due lower actual wages declared consequently until such time as the underwriting credit either becomes allocated to another existing debt or refunded it will simply form part of unallocated underwriting credits ageing of these entries is to be from date processed into insurers computer system with the amount being aged current at the end of the month in which the transaction was processed and then moving to line 2b under 1 month at the end of the next month and so on until the underwriting credit is

paymentdouble payment of premium late payment fees or third party cos ts to equal figure on form 311 processed into the insurers system is the date that the refund cheque has been drawn an overpayment or double payment of premium represents an overstatement in the insurers cash received total as it is cash collect ed which is not payment of premium late payment fees or third party costs the employer has simply paid more money than was required an underwriting credit has the effect of reducing the total gross written premium for any one insurer which would creat an inflated cash collected result as equal reduction has been made to the numerator of the ratio until it is either refunded or reaches 1 month old from date processed into insurers computer system issued on 171201 70 consequently in recognition that such transactions would create an unfair advantage in any one insurers results and keeping in line with equity principles these overpayments and underwriting credits must be excluded from the cash received total there are two ways to account for these 1refunds cheques once unallocated cash has been identified as an overpaymentdouble paymentincorrect payment the money must be returned to the employer therefore the total amount of refund cheques processed to insurers computer system for the relevant 12 month july to june period for overpayments are deducted from the cash collected figure likewise once an underwriting credit has been created and thereby reduced the gross written premium denominator in order to qualify the equation these underwriting credi ts must also be accounted for in the net cash collected numerator therefore the total amount of refund cheques processed to insurers computer system for the relevant 12 month july to june period for underwriting credits are deducted from the cash colle cted figure 2 alternatively they will simply be accounted for as unallocated cash or unallocated underwriting credits once they reach 1 month up to 2 months old and over refer to unallocated cash and unallocated underwriting credits defini tions below as at june year end unallocated cash aged 1 month up to 2 months and over unallocated cash is cash receipted and processed to insurers computer system that is not allocated to an existing related debt or refunded and is aged 1 mont h up to 2 months and over from the date processed into insurers computer system therefore if only part of the cash is allocated to an existing debt or refunded then that part which is not allocated is considered to be unallocated to be allocated m eans the cash received assumes the same ageing as the debt to which it is being allocated or it has been allocated by way of being refunded unallocated cash includes an overpayment double payment or incorrect payment of premium late payment fees or t hird party costs unallocated cash could also represent cash for payment of other types of insurances which has been credited to the employers workers compensation policy in error consequently until such time as the cash either becomes allocated to anot her existing debt or refunded it will simply form part of unallocated cash this means that unallocated cash will simply roll over into the new performance measure period and treated as such until it becomes allocated or refunded issued on 171201 71 note all cash sho uld be allocated andor refunded as soon as possible but later than one calendar month after the close of the month during which the cash was received by the insurer ie later than 60 days from date processed into insurers system nb the ye ar to date figure is not reported for unallocated cash only the june year end figure is to be reported in the year to date column for the june form 7 return f unallocated underwriting credits aged 1 month up to 2 months and over underwriting credits such as return premiums premium discounts processed to insurers computer system which are not allocated to an existing related debt or refunded and is aged over 1 month old from date processed into insurers computer system of the underwriting credit therefore if only part of the underwriting credit is allocated to an existing debt or refunded then that part which is not allocated is considered to be unallocated to be allocated means the underwriting credit assumes the same ageing as the debt to wh ich it is being allocated or it has been allocated by way of being refunded an underwriting credit includes return premiums which is owing to the employer for example due lower actual wages declared consequently until such time as the underwriting credit either becomes allocated to another existing debt or refunded it will simply form part of unallocated underwriting credits this means that the unallocated underwriting credit will simply roll over into the new performance measure period and treated as such until it becomes allocated or refunded nb the year to date figure is not reported for unallocated underwriting credits only the june year end figure is to be reported in the year to date column for the june form 7 return g net third pa rty costs any costs debited to the statutory fund for the recovery of unpaid premiums and late payment fees are third party costs third party costs include ü litigation costs incurred by either an external third party or insurers own in house litigation action litigation costs include court costs and filing fees associated with issuing legal documents for the recovery of unpaid premiums and late payment fees ü payments to external third parties for their services in addition to litigated costs ü disbursements such as asc searches and photocopying etc this means total third party costs paid and processed to insurers computer system less recovered third party costs that have been receipted and processed to insurers computer system for the relevant 1 2 month july to june period regardless of when the issued on 171201 72 third party costs where incurred third party costs mean costs directly related to activities carried out by third parties or insurers in house in the cash collection process up to and including the issui ng of creditors statutory demand 459e notice and bankruptcy notice it does not include the costs of collection activity undertaken by insurers direct employees bankruptcy and liquidation costs are excluded from the calculation refer to liquidation nd bankruptcy costs below liquidation and bankruptcy costs third party costs incurred after the issuing of creditors statutory demand 459e notice and bankruptcy notice that is for winding up or bankruptcy proceedings are excluded from net third pa rty costs annexure 712 is to be completed for each employer that has incurred liquidation and bankruptcy costs that is costs associated with liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings after 459e notice and bankruptcy notice has been issued the best way to illustrate whether something is allocated or unallocated and how it will be accounted for in the new cash collected measure is by looking at an aged clientpolicy listing report in all the following examples assume july 2001 to june 2002 year premium due for payment is 5 000 using one policy for ease of demonstration example 1 unallocated cash policy w 123xyz current under 1 month 1 mth upto 2 mths 2 mth upto 3 mths 3 mths upto 6 mths over 6 months grand total premiu m due 5000 august payment 4 000 sub total 4 000 5 000 august total 4000 5000 1000 cash received as at august month end 4000 at the end of august the 4000 received is unallocated because it h as not been allocated to the existing debt of 5000 that is it has different aging to the 5000 debt being allocated to policy does not mean allocated it must be allocated to an existing related debt issued on 171201 73 example 2 is an example of allocated example 2 policy w 123xyz current under 1 month 1 mth upto 2 mths 2 mth upto 3 mths 3 mths upto 6 mths over 6 months grand total premium due 5000 august payment 4000 4000 september allocation 4000 sub to tal 0 1000 september total 0 1000 1000 the 4000 received in august has now been allocated to the debt of 5000 the 4000 is now aged the same as the original debt of 5000 therefore the current ageing bracket has been cl eared note the grand total of the policy is the same in example 1 and 2 1000 but the treatment of each transaction is different example 3 overpayment assume premium due for payment is 5000 policy w 123xyz current under 1 month 1 mth upto 2 mths 2 mth upto 3 mths 3 mths upto 6 mths over 6 months grand total premium due 5000 september payment 10 000 5000 september allocation sub total 5 000 5 000 september balance 5000 0 5000 cash received as at september month end 10 000 in example 3 5000 of the 10 000 payment has been allocated to clear the debt of 5000 now nil there is still 5000 cash that has not been allocated and thus unallocated cash for september month end is 5000 this 5000 is either to be refunded as it is an overpayment or represents premium deposit amount or some other debt see example 4 below issued on 171201 74 example 4 in this example assume the 5 000 payment received in september is not id entified as an overpayment and remains unallocated until january 2002 when it is identified as an overpayment and refunded cash received totals for each month are as follows policy w 123xyz unallocated cash over 1 month old october 2001 november 2001 december 2001 january 2002 cash received 7000 8000 9000 11 000 premium due september payment 10 000 10000 10 000 10 000 10 000 september allocation unallocated cash january 2002 refund sub total 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 0 cash received 10 000 7000 8000 9000 6 000 the cash received for the months of october november and december is not affected by the unallocated cash amount of 5000 as unallocated cash amounts are only accounted for as at june year end in january however when the overpayment is refunded the cash collected for january is reduced by 5000 this is in line with the defin ition and treatment of refunds example 5 in this example assume that the 5 000 payment received in september is not identified as an overpayment and remains as unallocated cash as at june year end policy w 123xyz september 2001 march 2002 april 2002 may 2002 june 2002 cash received 7000 8000 9000 11 000 premium due september payment 10 000 10000 10000 10000 10000 september allocation sub total unallocated cash 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 total cash received 10 000 7000 8000 9000 6 000 as at june year end the 5000 unallocated cash will be over 1 month old and therefore cash collected is reduced by the unallocated cash amount of 5000 issued on 171201 75 example 6 example 6 demonstrates the treatment of unallocated cash from one year end into the next policy w 123xyz september 2001 march 2002 april 2002 may 2002 june 2002 july 2002 cash received 7000 8000 9000 11 000 4 000 premium due may payment 10000 10000 10000 may allocation sub total unallocated cash july 2002 refund 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 5 000 0 total cash 10 000 7000 8000 9000 11 000 1 000 the unallocated cash amount of 5000 received in may is not deducted from the cash collected total as at june year end because it is not aged over 1 month old howe ver in july of the new 2002 year when the unallocated cash is identified as an overpayment and refunded the refund is then deducted from the july cash collected amount form 72 721 recovery action referral of debts to
