on scientology lecture given on 26 june 1961 thank you you know give her the applause shes the one thats doing all the work its very funny its very funny she never takes over as d of p anyplace but what they dont stack up pcs in all directions you know and all the cases crack brrrrrrrrr and so forth we havent told people out in the field their cases would be personally supervised by mary sue in the running or we wouldnt be able to hold the course thats thats the truth im not shes just depreciating now because shes running i think the level shes running at the moment is failed depreciated what is this twentysixth of june 1900 and ad 11 okay i want to say word here at first about tactics and strategy with regard to antiscientological activities it might be of some benefit to you to know this after all ive been fighting this war now for eleven years very often without very much help every once in while scientologists tell how reasonable it all is that somebody has casus belli or something of the sort it isnt true our people are trying their best and theyre doing their best and im very proud of them if we had anything at all to hide we long since would have been blown out of the water with various salvos all we had to do is have few achilles heels and we would have had it well we dont have achilles heels so recently the better business bureau of washington dc wrote letter which is the most backwards letter anybody ever heard although many government agencies have tried to get something on this organization none of them have ever been able to turn anything up and can you imagine somebody writing something like this you see and as for lafayette r hubbard who is principal in this particular organization well you can look him up in dun and bradstreet and they just dismissed the whole thing well they used to run an entirely different line of approach they used to say oh they shoot people and kill babies and theyve been well known to throw people off top of st pauls cathedral that is their specialty anything ridiculous or stupid the british that medical association by the way has written letters to its doctors urging them to tell patients how bad we were and so forth weve not had whispering campaigns weve had loudspeaker campaigns going but that type of backfire is inevitable i call your attention to an essay on the circulation of the blood by fellow by the name of harvey who was graduate of the royal medical college of physicians he was i think physician to the crown i think he was everything you could think of and this man dared come up and say the blood beat not because of the tides of the body but got pumped through bunch of tubes and he very carefully carried on lot of experiments this way and promptly the whispering campaigns and so forth which rose up around this were fantastic it tore the whole medical profession to pieces about 1620 or thereabouts tore them all to pieces ripped them up one side and down the other and one doctor was heard to say i would rather err with galen than be right with harvey which i is the most marvelous i think statement ever made in controversy lets go back little earlier short time ago i was standing outside the prison of socrates on pnyx i think the name of the hill is in athens and it rather struck as very peculiar that the story they have about socrates in athens is quite different than the story which we hear about socrates in our own textbooks and of course theres always local information about various things which has sort of verbal tradition when they come on and apparently socrates said that those gods of stone and marble and so forth didnt have much to do with the regulation of the universe that man was basically spirit and so they finally tried him for heresy against the pagan religion of the day and had him drink the hemlock thats the local tradition about socrates its not the story we read in the encyclopedia americana britannica or anything you see but everybody got upset because here was new idea but let show you something today people feel pulse they dont look at the sun to measure the tides of the body they know very well theres body circulation when somebody gets his arm cut they put tourniquet on it got the idea this is very well accepted theory actually it became well accepted dont think these things take long timeit became well accepted theory by about 1628 there was hardly ripple by 1632 in other words this had become an accepted idea but in the first early years of its advance there was an enormous amount of upset now socrates was henpecked and unfortunate in his choice of wives and being so of course the man was emotionally unstable to some degree and worrying all the time that he darent be out talking in the club or the or the groves you see because he ought to be home and he shouldnt be wandering around like this he ought to be making living like honest men do and all this sort of thing but anyway he decided to give it up and he gave it up and the charges of heresy and so forth that followed with his relegation to the prison and all that sort of thing well it is interesting that about quarter of the people of athens that particular night that he was put in jail were standing there with tickets bought on the nearest ship to crete see people all over the place were trying desperately to get socrates who was not under very close arrest his guards were very very happy to turn their backs they were trying to get him simply to walk down to the dock and walk up gangplank and everybody thought that this was what he would do and he didnt he stood around and said well for the principle of the thing i ought to take this hemlock he really made the government of athens guilty because that sort of thing ordinarily you see didnt happen theyd condemn somebody to death and then the fellow would walk out the back gate and over the hills and that would be it it was actually charge of banishment or something of this sort but in his particular case he had so many friends who would have paid his passage who were trying to pay his passage that night who were trying to get rid of his guards who were trying to help him out that they went into total dismay what is wrong with this man well as i say you make wrong marriages and youre liable to get all sorts of repercussions and suicidal impulses so this thing about socrates hasnt anything to do with the price of fish at all fact of the matter is that promptly and immediately everybody in athens practically was talking socratian philosophy and have continued to do so ever since his critique stayed as one of the primary philosophic modes right on up to the time when kant overdid it and this this is new idea however in society not necessarily attended by fatality at all you hear great many martyrs but every time you find yourself martyr you find yourself somebody who is bound and determined you see what happens is well on the whole track you may have been tyrant yourself at one time or another you see and this fellow kept going out in the public square you know saying regulus the third is schnook and he eats herring and he does this just to popularize it so that the populace will eat it and he can collect the duty you see and herring is actually very bad for you and will rot your teeth you know and so on and this fellow kept prowling around and telling people things like this and i dare say that for oh i dont know for maybe months and months and months youd keep getting ahold of somebody or sending some of your police or something like that to go see him and say look just lay off will you you know skip it youd probably offer him free passage to gaul or almost anything you could think of you know and say just go away and get lost and so on and eventually why he just kept saying well kill then if you believe this and you had to you got the idea i mean theres this idea of being so stuck on the idea that you have to get stuck on the spears you see but its perfectly all right to be dedicated to thing but when one consistently fails to advance an idea he feels then that he must commit suicide to fan to further the idea you got the idea in other words its failure to advance the idea which brings about this suicidal frame of mind i imagine if anybody at all around galilee had bought the nicene creed id imagine pontius pilate for for split sesterce would have knocked that whole thing off you know but it was failed idea and he made it stick by proving it with suicide right ive never been in very suicidal frame of mind must be something lacking in my makeup or something of this sort i believe first in making the idea effective i dont believe in the idea that you should fail with an idea you see if youre carrying something forward youre standing for something you shouldnt be ineffective about it you should go forward and carry out the idea the object is not to fail at the idea and then make everybody guilty because they kill you you got this im not putting us in any category of any religious or philosophic lineup im just showing you that new ideas are very often attended with tremendous success although we are taught carefully that people should martyr themselves for new ideas or sacrifice themselves for new ideas and thats to prevent new ideas dont you think would do so rather effectively wouldnt it so if you got enough philosophy abroad whereby that anybody comes up with new teaching or new idea is then martyred if you got that philosophy abroad of course the old ideas are protected and somebody sooner or later socrates or somebody will fall for it you know youll say well this is the thing to do you know i seem to be failing in getting this stuff across so therefore id better commit suicide harvey on the other hand lived to ripe old age revolutionized the whole field of medicine few years later why his worst enemies were patting him on the back saying good boy good boy you remember when i was right in there with you now lets come up to more recent times of course im talking about magnitudinous ideas because its something about which we all know something about lets take fellow by the name of albert einstein of course einstein should have done some of his thinking in private notebook he shouldnt have been writing franklin delano that he could blow up earth which was in effect what he did and then years afterwards worked all he could possibly do and then gathered up all the funds he could gather up to wipe out what he had done with atomic fission he organized organizations societies they maintained offices every place the man old man worked himself into grave through having actually made discreditable creation nevertheless the actual course of history of albert einstein is quite interesting from our viewpoint the man advanced brand new theory of mathematics called relativity there might even be some truth in relativity who knows at one time fellow by the name of something or other in the university of george washington was holding his job as the chair of mathematics simply because he was one of the twelve men in the world who understood the theory of relativity i went in to see him one day to interview him for the college paper i wanted him to tell something about this theory of relativity this fellow einstein was kicking around with and so forth and i never had such sneers contempt or was turned out on my ear quite so fast you see i turned out one on our mathematics department instead mathematics has it come to stay i think was the name of the article you probably dont know the theory of relativity too well you think you have talking acquaintance with it because everybodys dressed it up now so that it fits with modern atomic physics and youll read textbooks and pocketbooks off the bookstalls all about the theory of relativity and so forth actually the theory of relativity is that c is constant you cant go any faster than light it brings up all kinds of wild surmises such as if man went the speed of light he would then be the as big as the universe you see and that time would not exist if you were going at the speed of light i mean its whole bunch of fantasies and fairy tales is what this thing originally was you see well it had mgs equal jaguar squares or something like that as its primary modus operandi and nobody could of course prove this fellow wrong because this c that he keeps throwing into all these equations of quantum mechanics and so forth is not constant the speed of light is not an exact constant so therefore all these equations go little bit wrong so you never can quite prove it its very interesting when they developed the atomic bomb they did not use einsteins theory they put stuff in and out of pile until they found that there was something called critical mass and they thought thats very fascinating and they took it from there and every atomic bomb youve got today was developed empirically none of them were calculated but he led the way and it was new idea and so forth the old man was sorry he did it but what is actually the history of the einstein theory out in the public in 1928 paper was read before the combined societies of mathematics in germany and you can imagine how many people that was the paper was the wildest piece of slander and libel that anybody ever heard and it condemned the einstein theory as the greatest mathematical hoax of all time einstein was in trouble with this theory for years he was practically hounded out of jobs in universities and everybody was on his back and he finally went to princeton and wrote frankie and weve got the atomic bomb thats the history of the einstein theory but lookitthere in spite of the fact that it was discreditable creation the old man died with his boots on and the and the old retainers weeping around the bedside you know why he was actually totally successful theres martyrdom connected with this at all except he was sorry for having developed the atomic bomb now what about many other creations of this character take freudian analysis for instance old man freud he got thrown on his ear by the medical association of his day and they just gave him the heave and they wouldnt have anything to do with him and they just raised the devil down around vienna and it just went on for years and finally about 1894 why he made some startling statement and made breakthrough of one character he announced his libido theory in 1894 and from that time thereon why all was good roads and good weather and look the man would had practically nothing to go on he practically had results he practically had nothing but dreamed up theory and so forth it was terrific i mean that hed go so far but he did have new idea and that is that mans physical ills could be assisted mentally and that was new idea and that was the idea that freud put into the world but the old man died with his boots on surrounded by the old retainers who were weeping to see him go you see sung the world around and very successful this man was very successful man in spite of the fact that just before he died he wrote paper called psychoanalysis terminable and interminable and he had learned that some people go on and on and on and on and on and you cant seem to do much about it the paper and this sort of thing is now woof and warp of our existence and it isnt even true eighteen ninetyfour and he was totally over the top by about 1933 thats very interesting isnt it theres an idea the breadth of the world but dont think the idea in its early stages wasnt fought harveys ideas were fought galen socrates any new idea gets fought thats the nature of man is when he sees something new it threatens change and man is great believer in nochange while he obsessively changes while obsessively alterising everything in view he believes in change and of course thats why he obsesses everything of this character thats why his alteris is so obsessive is because his basic belief is on zero all right now im just talking to you about this just looking coldly and dispassionately whats the chances of scientology of success well weve been told it takes hundred years to get anything done and weve been told all sorts of discouraging tales that its martyrdom that its this that its that its the other thing nah were over the top were over the top but we still get fought and were still in period of being fought and you can be fought with velocity that you are right because then you are terribly dangerous you think of the thousands of philosophies that must have come up since 1950 there must have been just libraries full of books written by people all over the place detailing theories about life where are these books where are they they just dont exist and right now the psychologist is changing his own textbooks and all sorts of weird things are happening in the world the medical profession now will tell you most glibly about prenatals and weve long since forgotten them but the point is is weve made our incursion but we threaten to upset far more than somebodys belief in whether or not the god was of marble or lightning you see we threaten to upset far more than that if youre looking at it in terms of upset the only reason its safe for us to do any of this is because we can undo what we do and mr freud couldnt undo what he did and mr einstein couldnt undo what he did and socrates couldnt undo what he did lets take look at this you see and theyre all kind of sorry for it and they got into suicidal frame of mind but were in very safe channel because we can undo what we did do you know that you can take somebody thats been very thoroughly badly audited and simply run the auditor off and the auditing disappears why do you suppose that i include and will continue to include in any security check theres two reasons questions about overts against myself this seems an odd thing to do actually theres two things one if person has lot of overts against that he thinks is bad he wont get any benefit from scientology thats quite obvious hes got overts against the source thats the thing and you think basically thats the only reason thats there theres another much more subtle reason why you have to keep these overts off the only way you could acquire forceful overwhelming valence called scientology would be by piling up bunch of overts and motivators on it think of it for minute isnt that the way basically you got into any valence youre in so this would be the first time that anyone was going along the track saying all right heres what i say try it out run out dont you realize that so theres overwhelm mixed up in this in the early days people who had been all mixed up with taoism and all that sort of thing they kept telling that we needed tremendous aesthetics you know we needed swinging incense pot and all that sort of thing and these tremendous aesthetics which we were supposed to have something to do with of course palled on in the very earliest stages because ive said you can always overwhelm thetan with aesthetics and we havent the least desire to overwhelm thetan so if you wonder why central organizations dont hire the empire state building or were not flat out to make totally overwhelming ritual of it all dont you see thats all part of the same picture if its true for you its true its not true for you because we have overwhelmed you get the tremendous difference there this is the first time this has happened to man so of course it appears very dangerous and very strange they could understand it if we were simply trying to overthrow the established church established science or established governments then they would understand this and youd probably find that we werent being hard fought oh well oh yes oh those people yeah we understand them revolutionary group revolutionary group one of the things which theyre going to do is blow up buckingham palace and the white house yeah thats what theyre going to do thats right and youd probably find the cops coming around and seeing you being quite chummy im not kidding and understand you but to understand somebody who was basically has evil motives every man who has been overwhelmed by what he considered evil valences asks himself this question whats the pitch whats the pitch whats the pitch hes just totally frantic you know well you audit this fellow and he gets more intelligent and he gets more able and hes happier and he whats the pitch and of course with running security checks all the time on pcs that come up the line whats the pitch well there his question becomes totally unanswerable because were running ourselves out as auditors philosophers teachers or anything else of course if you cant make thetan commit tremendous numbers of overts against you or set him up in situation where he can commit tremendous overts against you and then remove any possibility of his ever running the overts thats the only way you can actually overwhelm him and get him so stamped down with valence that he cant thereafter wriggle you see that so these former efforts were entrapments and this is not an entrapment it is not even total freedom ive even told you occasionally total freedom would be existence without barriers and i think you would find everybody very miserable all right were an incomprehensible factor this is the first time actually highpowered rather selfless philosophy has hit earth which didnt at once demand of its practitioner or in the person who embraces it that he totally subjugate himself utterly and become enslaved by the philosophy dont you see and which didnt say that the originator of the philosophy must then be carried as an imperishable valence from there on to the end of the track and everybody should bow down to this dont you see that alone is incomprehensible amongst the the works of man these are different these are different and these are the differences that man becomes alarmed at because hes certain that if theres this much and you neglect these obvious factors which he sort of senses you neglect there must be some much deeper much more vicious motive mixed up in all of this you see and they can become quite excited and recently some chap out in california took his finger off his pc and probably didnt flatten the process the pc went out and assaulted her husband on the street and had him arrested and tried to have the auditor arrested and signed check over to him the police raided the building and took his emeters and tapes and made the usual mules south ends out of themselves because i like horses and went ramming around madly you see now look at the hysteria look at the hysteria they sent telex to every police department in the state of california about this terrible case which they had just uncovered what terrible case well with good attorney on the job and this thing sorted out and everybody keeping calm about the thing and not fighting it violently but just putting up consistent and continual effective pressure against that particular attack angle and it will not wind up in 30 days i assure you courts are not rigged that way nor will it wind up in 60 days nor 180 days you will still be hearing about this in about three years and there is never any reason to rush anyplace and do anything about characters like that what you do is just put up steady pressure in that particular direction just take the effective actions and let it coast do not become absorbed in it because it is out of terror that the attack is born and people who are in terror make mistakes and all we do is just dont make any mistakes and continue to put up an effective pressure against this sphere and investigate loudly is one of the things we do we have regular modus operandi and these people become more and more terrified because they now begin to feel guilty of an overt act i saw the president of law university who had arrested one time as witness in bankruptcy you see in the united states if youre witness in bankruptcy in federal court you can be arrested because youre liable not to witness you see they even fingerprint you you know its very degrading witnesses in bankruptcies that has to do with money and after all all the money in bankruptcy belongs to the attorneys and the judge and you cant you cant go around you cant go around being witness lightly you see and these fellows the only way they could be coaxed and the judge could be coaxed and everybody could be coaxed was to issue this silly witness in bankruptcy warrant you see thats totally meaningless you know you watch you see an accident happen and in new york city the cops can grab hold of you and put you in jail for three days as consequence accidents and murder happen in broad daylight in new york city and you just ask anybody around you what was going on and they look at you rather searchingly and dont answer and you say is there anything that happened on this corner and the fellow said i wasnt here his twenty cigarette butts littered around his feet you know he wasnt there he just arrived you cant get anybody to interfere in new york city or witness anything in new york city just because of these silly witness rules anyway the president of law school had been employed to obtain this warrant and the chief federal united states marshal i think they have sort of feeling like theyre still western marshals or something they go around with big guns hanging on them and so forth the only trouble is they normally pick people off skid row to have these jobs and its rather incongruous you see and this fellow he was utterly maddogging because he was sure that i had just beaten up two of his marshals actually i hadnt beaten up marshal i had taken the gun away from one and told him how to use it and put it back in his holster because i thought he would get into trouble i explained it to him i said youll get in trouble waving that about and so forth and this is the hammer and this is the trigger and he handed it over to and i said these are the butt plates and theres the ammunition and so forth and slid the cartridges out of the chamber and told him to put them in his pocket and put the gun back dont nobody was picking on him and it was all all right and he did it you think im kidding you but he did it people that walk up to you shaking and nerves with drawn cocked gun you dont you dont monkey with that sort of thing teach him teach them how to use it anyway this was pretty wild this was years and years and years ago it was clear back in 52 anyway these guys began to realize that one they were not dealing with criminal that somebody had told them some lies and they gradually ran up little white flags and they became more and more apologetic and more and more apologetic and in the course of about three or four days finally took down to the court where i was supposed to give my testimony and i sat down and i said yes i knew of this company yes my relationship with this company was so and so i didnt have any money from this company and that was it oh yes and i said i dont even have any money now and that was it and that was the end of my testimony the judge however hed heard some rumors you see that two us federal marshals had been beaten up and so on and he said screaming and i wont blast the microphone but isnt there anything on which i can hold this man isnt there anything you see he had been told by everybody that this fellow had new idea and therefore ought to be shot you see and the federal marshal and the president of the law university ran they did not walk they ran up the aisle to the front of the judges bench and they said your honor this is perfectly decent man youve got the whole idea all wrong and they were just interrupting each other and your honor you dont want this man he didnt have anything to do with that and you have been improperly informed and so forth and this whole thing is mistake and you must let him go right now theres nothing else you can hold him for and theres reason to hold him and they came back and they said you know you ought to do something about it you shouldnt let people say bad things about you like this because this is terrible mistake and they escorted out and took down to my airplane by the way in goldplated limousine as near as they could make it you know and shook my hand and so forth sure was terrible what mistakes people could make namely them so when they run that many overts they get propitiative and when people are in terror they make mistakes now let tell you the denouement of the last attack on scientology through the law courts in washington dc the witness in this particular case would not state would not state that he had not been financed in all of his attacks on scientology by the apa the american psychiatric association and the american medical association this was the one question he wouldnt answer he would answer questions to the effect of yes he had been in jail yes he had been in insane asylums yes he was wanted for this or that crime in various states yes hed answer these questions but he wouldnt answer this one question was his whole attack financed by the american psychiatric association and the american medical association that question he refused to answer now of course in regular trial he would have to answer that question but his witness deposition was simply being taken in open court and he could not be forced to answer all the questions but when he was finally when the whole thing came up for trial he would have to answer those questions now he was attacking us we werent attacking him he was suing us for false arrest he kept calling up the office and doing various things around and about the place having swindled the organization out of about fifteen thousand dollars i took my finger off my dollars for second and there the organizations dollars and there it went and then because he was arrested for pulling this he was arrested in the wrong county or something there are several counties and nobody can quite tell which county is which there at that corner of maryland so they arrested him in the wrong side of some line so therefore he had this fantastic charge of false arrest that he could bring about dont you see look this kept going for nearly three years well there were nerves during all these three years there were people investigating things and calling things up and doing all kinds of things for three years there were people you were hiring attorneys and hiring detectives and listening to reports and so forth for three years the mans name by the way is ettleman and the ettleman case is very much in point three years this goes on every principal in the washington organization was being sued for minimum of hundred thousand dollars cash why you say that ought to make you nervous man thats lot of money three years marilyn and sue and myself and anybody else connected with it everybody was sued for hundred thousand dollars cash as matter of fact the only one that got any satisfaction out of it was susie and she i think knocked the attorney silly he tried to attack in the lobby and i knew better than to hit him it was great temptation you see he was not very big and they were serving warrant you know right in the middle of congress and it was great temptation and i was gripping my hands rather tightly in my pockets so that i wouldnt succumb to it because all he needed you see was an assault charge then he would have had it you see he would have had it made but evidently even he realized it was silly to bring suit against woman for assault mary sue wouldnt have anybody talking to that way and she clobbered him about three times he sort of looked at her like you shouldnt have done it you know wrong attacker well anyhow after all of this nonsense and cops and robbers and everything else that you could think of you see three years worth of it considerable expenses in courts and all that sort of thing finally it comes up the great day for trial the great day for trial has now arrived and ettleman is there spitting as usual and being paid to say this and that and the other thing and everything is all set and raring to go and the judge who should have dismissed it he should have dismissed it two years before because they kept altering the bill on him you see they kept altering the statement of charges ettelmans attorney did and it was very illegal but he still didnt throw it out everything had gone wrong and we were all there that is i wasnt there but the representative of the organization was there marilyn actually was there and our attorneys and all this raised and waiting on the fall of the gavel and we look everywhere in vain but ettelmans attorney has failed to turn up and has forgotten that it was this day that the trial was supposed to be held of course the judge dismissed the case and the attorney houston couldnt even get it reinstated again after three years if you wait them out long enough they sooner or later will make mistake thats all it amounts to if you just go on being effective now the only thing that can be done to scientology organization or scientology personnel is to be worried to point where he doesnt do his job either in an organization or an individual auditor now remember that thats all that can happen to you you can be worried and harassed and upset to point where you are made ineffective and the whole gain of the people who oppose new ideas is then by making one or more organizations or scientologists temporarily ineffective you got it all the time you spend on this of course is lost time and the more you worry about it is lost worrying go ahead and be effective but remember the only thing they will ever gain in the long run they have never yet thrown anybody in the clink you know i mean its just all yippleyapple they never can they never have any evidence its just the amount of time you lose in worrying about it you understand and the amount of dispatch time you absorb and the cost of cables and attorneys you got that thats the whole loss thats all that ever happens it is the lost time of scientologist one or more being rendered ineffective for period of time and being tied up and worried because hes involved in some kind of yickleyackle the way to fool them is go on and be effective with regard to them and go on being effective as scientologist go on being effective in an organization go on running things effectively keeping the show on the road in other words and just dont fall for the only loss that you can be thrown for which is to lose your own time and forward pressure you see and little money one way or the other thats the only thing you can lose well now if you go ahead and concentrate thousand percent and put everything on high high high high emergency priority basis of course all that is wasted motion and action and the more you indulge in it and the more you worry about it the less scientology you get done so its only to that degree that the enemy wins they get negative gain they take one organization or one personnel or one auditor or something and they move him out of the lineup for short period of time and maybe blunt little bit of his enthusiasm because he says the world is an evil place after all and that is the sole thing they can win they cant win anything else and of course if theyre going to play game like this and we have other choice than to play some of this game i always ask myself by the way what game is this that is being played sort it out pretty well find out what game is being played here and then find out if its our game and believe ladies and gentlemen if it is not our game there are marbles of mine lying in the ring there are cricket bats out there on the green that have my name on them they can go ahead and box with their own shadows and climb mythical ropes and do anything they want to do but theyre not playing game with us do you understand but i will go ahead and do the effective things in these effective things you usually get very competent assistance and get it fast force people to accept our assistance that is to say if somebody is being attacked dont let him avoid our help the only time we lose or the only time anybody loses is when they avoid our help you know they say well really i probably ought shouldnt have any help from hco or something like this because its all possibly very bad and itll all wind up bad and they do they lose there have been one or two minor little cases of where they did lose badly or they dont say anything that is at all bright if its totally outside of our perimeter of control something like knucklehead one time down in phoenix keeps going in and saying i practice dianetics i dont practice scientology he wasnt he hadnt practiced dianetics in his whole lifetime he didnt even know how to run an engram the only thing he could be cuffed around for or told not to practice was dianetics so he keeps telling everybody that he practices dianetics we keep telling him for gods sakes shut your mouth tell people you practice scientology he couldnt do that so we couldnt help that man and there was fellow out in australia fellow out in australia around perth and so forth and he wouldnt even accept an attorney he wouldnt accept anything all he got was small fine but he just wouldnt accept thing and we even knew we even knewthings about the person who was bringing the charges and the doctor bringing the charges and so forth that were practically unprintable but very provable and he wouldnt let us enter any of these things nothing like that so we lost in that particular sphere now how much time can be developed by one of these attacks that is how much time can be involved by one of these attacks plenty morale can be shot various things can happen and so forth for instance weve never had days worry really about the government since i told the food and drug administration in washington dc to go fly kite if they knew how if they had intelligence to read book about flying kites and the way i did it is i read their law and i found out that if you manufactured anything that came under their purview then your whole organization was under their authority which is quite interesting that is if we manufactured an emeter they were in charge of all emeters because obviously an emeter is both food and drugs thats the way the law reads that outfit passes psychiatric machines which kill people murders them im not lightly stating it now it does they have shorts in them theyre ineffective electrical equipment completely aside from being shock machine they are badly made and the food and drug administration has purview of those things and they let them go on killing people but thats all right with the food and drug administration but somebody has an emeter they said the emeter was diagnostic therapeutic instrument and it was used to cure people of things and the small current that went through it titillated or agitated the brain and made the brain cells well or something i dont know what they had figured out so we just stopped selling emeters and we stopped selling these dianazene antiradiation bombs because people kept asking for them you know the little pills and we just quit that and the food and drug administration said you shouldnt have done that but i also caused him an enormous amount of work and i imagine our name is an anathema to him because every time i turned around i had him writing letters to senators and congressmen explaining why he was attacking this church the poor man the head of the food and drug administration with all of his administration had to write additional letters all the time we turned them out on robotypes ourselves they all looked like personal letters they werent and then the senator would write him and say what is this and then hed have to write long explanation part of his text was youll remember of course l ron hubbard because hes the one thats had so much publicity in recent years he always included this phrase in his letters to the senators and congressmen they of course would instantly forward his letters to us we just set it up on an administrative line it just went off one two three four we were worrying them to death and then all of sudden when i found this clause in the law that said that they had purview over you if you didnt manufacture anything out of which they had any purview see but if you did manufacture then they could run your whole organization for you so i just said kick these items out of our immediate sales bill and thats why theyre not there anymore and the food and drug administration had to go away and get lost all right and they did because it wasnt our game so my cricket bat was longer lying on the green dont you see and their poor unemployed agents had to wander and go to movies in the afternoon instead of in but the only thing you can lose the only thing you can lose is your time and your equanimity thats all thats all and if you rig it up so these things are not disturbed and you have gone on being effective the whole time and taking very effective steps to handle this all and square this all around and realize fully that theres nothing wastes as much time as the law you see the law has overts against mens time it puts them in jail overt against time overt against time so of course the law has slowed down to point of where to get civil suit tried of having bought package of biscuits at the store which was moldy and youre suing the store that will be heard in two or three years you see thats the way the law goes but because its overts against time it goes this way all right now dont worry for minute about the future health of scientology it is going through these exact periods that every new idea goes through it is actually being fought much less expertly than many things have been fought in the past there are tremendous things which could be done but ive begun to realize that nobody is going to do them so i never bother to provide against them anymore to amount to anything but there are some sleepers back on the track if anybody tried to attack scientology organization and pick it up and move it out of the perimeter or go over the hills with it today this happened to us once why they would find themselves involved in the most confoundedly weird mass of legal well its just like quicksand quicksand its an interesting trick every time they shoot at you on the right side of the horse youre on the left side of the horse and then they prove conclusively youre on the left side of the horse you prove conclusively that youre on the right side of the horse they go mad after while this is what the basic legal structure is furthermore scientology is so fixed up these days that if any one continent shut down the enemy realizes much better than you do because its happened that any area so closed off could be flooded from an exterior source you understand so it doesnt do any good to close any area of scientology out in the whole world and agency exists which could do so you see how that would work they might close them all out in the united states or they might close them all out in england but their apathy comes about at once by the fact that if they closed them out in the united states they would be bombarded from england and if they closed them out in england theyd be bombarded from the united states and in the united states the difficulty is that if they attacked in one state theyd find you operating in another state dont you see that isnt the same corporation that youre attacking you see its all very involved but and this drives by the way the better business bureau berserk they know what they want theyre mainly subsidized by the way by the american medical association theyre always putting out tracts about quack medicines and all this sort of thing they blackmail you and we never buy blackmail is another one of our defensive mechanisms we never pay blackmail drive us to the wall shoot us down but we wont pay blackmail thats it and people realize this and its very upsetting to them so the upshot of all this is is there is an unpleasant side to the business of dissemination and that is the backflash and its very interested backflash but very terrified one it used to be ridiculing backflash but now it isnt there is fear in it there is more than fear in the united states in it i had fellow investigating scientology for the government he was told to by the white house so he didnt dare do anything but actually investigate it finally he was looking more and more whipped and more and more whipped and more and more whipped and he finally picked out one profile showing bottom to the top gain and he said if just this one profile were ever published in the american journal of psychology it would upset the whole field do you realize that and the other fellow says yes well we dont really blame you for keeping it all to yourself and keeping monopoly on it yeah keeping it all to ourselves just let anybody stand still long enough to listen and scientologist will give him the works you know and yet psychology was upset because we kept it all to ourselves at time at time have we ever really faltered now since about 1953 were been going pretty good since 53 up to that time we had corporate control people say what i did before 1953 well what i did before 1953 was try to keep the show on the roads and fight them off singlehanded and after while why we got enough people in line so that it wasnt quite this tough and thats really what happened and now on present time our modus operandi is so well worked out that an attack in one quarter of the united states brings about certain series of actions in an entirely different quarter in the united states and suddenly why the enemy is looking at all kinds of attorneys and looking at various backflashes and now an investigation has been started of the people who were behind this attack on scientology and that investigation will go forward and these people will be very discredited before we get through dont think that this is an entheta operating atmosphere it is not one im trying to tell you what we do to fight back and what we do to keep going and that is to say above all else we keep on doing our jobs and were effective in combating the attack and if you just remember those two factors why youve got it be effective in combating the attack dont let it keep you from doing your job thats the only thing the enemy can win and all else is of consequence frankly not for years has anybody been hurt in one of these attacks not for years and years and years i first laid down the modus operandi of what to do about it various ones have been laid down about 1955 and they have been uniformly successful since that time i havent got any wood to knock on particularly but i do have lot of faith on scientology and scientologists ive got lot of that to knock on and thats good all right well thats long dissertation which you probably feel didnt have too much to do with you but its something for you to look at and realize that you would be as nothing what you would be doing would not even be important if nobody fought you anywhere if nobody disapproved of what we were doing anywhere do you realize it would be like reaching into soundless void think of the thousands of philosophies that must have been developed in all parts of earth by two and half billion human beings in the past eleven years there must have been quite few there have been rivers of books written all of which had new startling and strange ideas none of these are ever fought not one of them and nobodys ever heard of them but we have the enemy aberration ignorance enslavement we have these things on the run and the hallmark of having them on the run is that somebody gets excited about it right now the american medical association i dont know what their mood would be today if you walked in opened the front door and walked in to the receptionist and said im scientologist im sure you wouldnt be unknown they might try to pretend they didnt know you but thats it yes male voice couple of years ago ron man who didnt want his girlfriend processed wrote letter to the american medical association got letter back from their secretary saying these seem to be fine earnest people who are in totally different field from the field of medicine so they give us trouble and we give them none oh is that so male voice right thats how far its gone i wish i had copy of that letter weve just received the surrender papers of the better business bureau male voice good theyre sort of written backwards but theyre nevertheless that but theres the point as you move forward in life and as you move forward across the face of mans thought fields particularly think of the hospitals think of the vested interests think of the utterly wha billions of dollars and pounds that are undoubtedly invested in education and all these different spheres the facilities why i think if you put together all the electrodiathermy machines that wont cure anybody out here in this tenacre park theyd probably make an awfully nice mess of mountain when you think of all this vested interest when you think of the electronic organization when you think of the drug people when you think of all these vested interests think of what theyd lose its fantastic i think theyre being gentlemen about it myself i think theyre so on they eventually will turn over their sword and that will be the end of that but if you werent fought and if you didnt have backflashes and if you didnt hear wild rumors of one character or another running around the field start worrying start worrying right then start worrying because youre not getting through what do you think the highest level of approval of the human race is right now what would it be male voice communicate yeah but when you dont hear any of it know you arent being heard okay well i didnt mean to give you such lugubrious talk on this situation but its been bit on my mind and i thought you might know something about it how we are alert to these things and what we do concerning them and why you dont find tearing myself wrong side out every time somebody jumps up but where you do find this you do find us doing something effective we move in rather rapidly our communication lines are much more rapid than the enemys much more rapid theyre very fast the speed of hcos communication lines is your best guarantee of defense and thats why you must keep the speed of hco lines up they must be rapid and there mustnt be any comm lags on them whether theres anything important going over them or not keep them up because this alone is very discouraging to people very upsetting they think well hear about it in month or two and maybe do something about it when within something like hours after this incident happened anybody who in authority in scientology knew all about it within hours after the thing occurred and of course they just started moving up various artillery units and that sort of thing and lining up things one way or the other and youve got some isolated unit that was making an attack on scientologist and hes going to wonder what the hell cooks after while now of course the backfire is going on the basis that in view of the fact every police agency in california has been informed of this terrible case and these terrible people well naturally theyve made it inevitable that we have to get them investigated thoroughly and so that is happening and the next police report that i expect to come through on this line probably wont be through for almost year but itll be somewhat on the basis of this you remember that case in eureka what case well the case about the scientologists up in eureka you know how they were drugging everybody and so forth well i think this case were into right here in portland which will have something to do with nothing connected with us you see i think its similar to that yeah i think its just similar to that eureka case you remember and theyll be using it as model of comparison of how to subvert an organization you see only we wont be the people they will be saying were bad see itll be somebody else on this thing well those are good things to know im giving talk about it because i see that once in while your judgment can be startled on something like this you hear some fantastic rumor of some kind or another and you say well there must be truth in it couldnt be otherwise the only truth is is were making progress you never get rumors when were being ineffective if were not getting wins on cases and hgcs and academies arent good and that sort of thing you know we never hear thing about us its all of sudden though we go into wild wingding of clearing them left and right and straightening out organizations and so forth and the enemies say oh my god there they go again you see and i use as positive indicator of the strength of central organization whether or not its got any backflash is anybody yelling about it is anybody complaining about it is anybody screaming about it and if there is nobody i say they must all be sitting there doing nothing they cant possibly be getting any results in the academy they cant possibly be getting any results in the hgc they cant possibly be doing blessed thing because nobodys worried but you give big flood of letters coming in from someplace saying those dogs down in sydney are just doing the terriblest things and everything is bad in sydney and sydney is terribly bad oh ill forward it through for information ill even look into it little bit but the basic thing that registers with is somebody in sydney is being effective thats the thing to remember on these things and i received letter today asking to return ken quite rapidly so they could do something about this and im putting it in its proper perspective its much more important that ken finish off some effectiveness you see by withdrawing him from course we immediately make ourselves less effective see california would be less effective you get how wed lose that way in addition to that people have grandiose notion that this is going to take place that something is going to happen nothing is going to happen its going to go on for months and months and months itll leave somebody sitting on the hot seat for months and months and months nineteen sixtytwo will come and go nineteen sixtythree will arrive and still nothing drastic will have happened okay thats the status of rumor thats the status of combat with the society when theres nothing to lean on theres nobody listening if theres nothing flashing back there are ears hearing you nor eyes seeing what you are doing so i dont care how much entheta you stir up just be effective thank you
