division congressional research service the library of congress unmanned aerial vehicles background and issues for congress summary the war on terrorism has put high premium on primary mission of uavs intelligence gathering furthermore the military effectiveness of uavs in recent conflicts such as iraq 1990 and kosovo 1999 opened the eyes of many to both the advantages and disadvantages provided by unmanned aircraft long relegated to the sidelines in military operations uavs are now making national headlines as they are used in ways normally reserved for manned aircraft conventional wisdom states that uavs offer two main advantages over manned aircraft they are considered more costeffective and they minimize the risk to pilots life however the current uav accident rate the rate at which the aircraft are lost or damaged is 100 times that of manned aircraft uavs range from the size of an insect to that of commercial airliner dod currently possesses five major uavs the air forces predator and global hawk the navy and marine corpss pioneer and the armys hunter and shadow other key uav developmental efforts include the air force and navys unmanned combat air vehicle ucav navys vertical takeoff and landing uav vtuav and the broad area maritime surveillance uavbams and the marine corpss dragon eye and dragon warrior the services continue to be innovative in their use of uavs recent examples include arming uavs predator hunter using uavs to extend the eyes of submarines and teaming uavs with strike aircraft and armed helicopters to improve targeting in the past tension has existed between the services efforts to acquire uavs and congressional initiatives to encourage consolidated dod approach some observers argue that the result has been less than stellar track record for the uav however reflecting the growing awareness and support in congress and the department of defense for uavs investments in unmanned aerial vehicles have been increasing every year dod spending on uavs has increased from 284 million in fiscal year 2000 to 21 billion in fy2005 congressional considerations include the proper pace scope and management of dod uav procurement appropriate

have been referred to in many ways rpvs remotely piloted vehicle drones robot planes and pilotless aircraft are few of the terms that have been used most often called uavs they are defined by the department of defense dod as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry human operator use aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely can be expendable or recoverable and can carry lethal or nonlethal payload ballistic or semiballistic vehicles cruise missiles and artillery projectiles are not considered uavs by the dod definition1 drones differ from rpvs in that they are designed to fly autonomously uavs are either described as single air vehicle with associated surveillance sensors or uav system uas which usually consists of three to six air vehicles ground control station and support equipment the military use of uavs in recent conflicts such as iraq 2003 afghanistan 2001 and kosovo 1999 has opened the eyes of many to the advantages and disadvantages provided by unmanned aircraft uavs regularly make national headlines as they are used to perform tasks historically performed by manned aircraft uavs are thought to offer two main advantages over manned aircraft they eliminate the risk to pilots life and their aeronautical capabilities such as endurance are not bound by human limitations uavs may also be cheaper to procure and operate than manned aircraft uavs protect the lives of pilots by performing the 3d missions those dull dirty or dangerous missions that do not require pilot in the cockpit however the lower procurement cost of uavs must be weighed against their greater proclivity to crash while the minimized risk should be weighed against the dangers inherent in having an unmanned vehicle flying in airspace shared with manned assets there are number of reasons why the employment of uavs has recently grown navigation and communication technology is now available that wasnt available just few short years ago some say that the services socalled silk scarf syndrome of preferring manned aviation over unmanned has diminished as uavs entered the mainstream although only recently procured in significant numbers by the united states uavs have had centuryold history in aviation first included in janes all the worlds aircraft in 1920 uavs were tested during world war i but not used in combat by the united states during that war however it was not until the vietnam 1 joint publication 102 dod dictionary of military and associated terms crs2 war that uavs such as the aqm34 firebee were used in surveillance role the firebee exemplifies the versatility of uavs initially flown in the 1970s it was modified to deliver payloads and flew its first flight test as an armed uav on december 20 20022 the israeli air force pioneered several uavs in the late 1970s and 1980s that were eventually integrated into the united statess uav inventory us observers noticed israels successful use of uavs during operations in lebanon in 1982 encouraging thennavy secretary john lehman to acquire uav capability for the navy interest also grew in other parts of the pentagon and the reagan administrations fy1987 budget requested notably higher levels of uav funding3 this marked the transition of uavs in the united states from experimental projects to acquisition programs one of the uavs acquired from israel pioneer emerged as useful source of intelligence at the tactical level during operation desert storm pioneer was used by navy battleships to locate iraqi targets for its 16inch guns following the gulf war military officials recognized the potential value of uavs and the air forces predator became uav on fast track quickly adding new capabilities4 debuting in the balkans conflict the predator performed surveillance missions such as monitoring area roads for weapons movements and conducting battle damage assessment operations in afghanistan have featured the air forces global hawk as well as adding new mission for predator that allows the uav to live up to its name armed reconnaissance there are currently five major uavs in the us inventory the navy and marine corpss pioneer the air forces global hawk and predator and the armys hunter and shadow uavs reflecting growing awareness and support in congress for uavs investment in unmanned aerial vehicles has increased annually the fy2001 investment in uavs was approximately 667 million while the fy2003 funding totaled over 11 billion dollars the pentagon has asked for 16 billion in procurement and development funding for fy2006 with much more planned for the out years congresss role in uav development has been one of strong encouragement tempered with concern taking proactive stance in uav program management congress has in the past directed the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality between the services uav programs congress has also expressed concern that dods growing enthusiasm may well lead to situation in which there is clear path toward the future of uavs and so has required dod to submit 2 jefferson morris northrop grumman modifies bqm34 firebee to drop payloads aerospace daily

available from author on request 4 jim garamone from us civil war to afghanistan short history of uavs american forces information service defenselinkmil april 16 2002 crs3 uav roadmap5 in some instances congress has advocated more aggressive approach to fielding uavs for example in 1996 the house armed services committee hasc supported legislation directing dod to weaponize both the predator and hunter but dod opposed the initiative6 the scope of congresss support and confidence in uav technology can be gleaned from prediction in the report accompanying the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 which stated that within ten years onethird of us military operational deep strike aircraft will be unmanned7 congressional considerations in recent years the pace of uav development has accelerated and the scope of uav missions and applications has expanded how should these efforts be managed so that they are costefficient effective and interoperable in its eagerness to deploy uavs does dod risk duplication of effort between various programs are dod uav acquisition plans responsive to congressional direction investment priorities could change as the introduction of uavs into the us inventory shifts the balance between manned and unmanned capabilities congress as part of its defense oversight responsibilities may assess dods current uav efforts to verify that they match up with new investment goals and strategies conventional wisdom states that uavs are cheap or costeffective is this true today how do uav costs compare to manned aircraft costs uavs have traditionally been used for reconnaissance and surveillance but today they are being employed in roles and applications that their designers never envisioned the unanticipated flexibility and capability of uavs has led some analysts to suggest that more if not most of the missions currently undertaken by manned aircraft could be turned over to unmanned aerial platforms and that manned and unmanned aircraft could operate together congress may have to contemplate the replacement of significant portion of the manned aircraft fleet with unmanned aircraft that have yet to be designed the defining characteristic of uavs is that they are unmanned if uavs are introduced into the force in large numbers might personnel issues arise recruitment and retention is perennial congressional issue that may be receiving increased attention due to the operational stresses associated with the global war on terrorism what impact might wide spread deployment of uavs have on military personnel

congress 2d session senate committee on armed services national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 srept 106292 p141 crs4 industrial base issues also need to be considered if defense companies devote more of their time and expenses to develop unmanned aircraft will the skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design erode those who argue that uavs will replace manned aircraft in the future are not as concerned with the industrial base issue as those who feel manned aircraft will still be needed to combat future threats as us companies compete for business in growing international uav marketplace concerns about the proliferation of these systems may grow are steps required and if so what might they be to control the spread of uavs as part of its defense and foreign policy oversight congress may examine whether balance must be struck between supporting legitimate us exports and curbing the spread of uav technologies to dangerous groups or countries pace of uav acquisition and scope of missions or applications undeniably uavs are being developed procured and fielded in growing numbers the diversity of designs and applications is also accelerating considering this growth many in congress may wish to evaluate the management of uavs are uavs being developed fast enough are they being developed too fast has dod developed an appropriate plan and structure for incorporating uavs into future military capabilities uav programs range from the combat tested pioneer hunter predator and global hawk to the not yet tested the air force and navys unmanned combat air vehicles sizes and ranges of uavs also vary greatly the wasp micro uav at 8 inches long has combat radius of 5 nautical miles while the global hawk at 44 feet long the size of medium sized corporate jet has combat radius of 5400 nm figure 1 shows the evolution of uavs and demonstrates the recent initiation of several uav programs8 similarly table 1 outlines the total uav inventory9 when compared to the inventory of february 2003which only included five major platforms yeilding an inventory of 163 unmanned aircraft the acceleration and expansion becomes clear the 604 uavs includes many 2nd generation derivatives such as predator b and i gnater and several nontraditional vehicles such as snow goose onyx and neptune 8 for more comprehensive treatment of these uav programs see the current dod uav programs section below 9 note that to avoid accounting issues these inventories do not include small uavs micro uavs or lighterthanair platforms crs5 figure 1 current

the total number of uavs delivered attrition numbers were taken from class accidents reported by each service total uavs delivered for each platform were drawn from the osds uas roadmap 20052030 august 2005 the increase in dods uav inventory appears largely due to the rising demand for uavs to conduct wide variety of missions and to branch out from the typical intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr applications predator b is equipped with strike capability and many predator as have been modified to carry weapons the jointunmanned combat air systems jucas final product will target air defenses missiles artillery air bases and commandandcontrol facilities additionally mine detection border patrol medical resupply and force perimeter protection are increasingly considered as roles for uavs10 dods uav research and development rd funding has also grown for variety of reasons uavs are considered growth industry many uavs are relatively inexpensive to produce and new technology in miniaturization has helped accelerate the development of many uav types rd funding in fy2006 for uavs is more than double the total procurement funding for uavs this suggests that accelerated acquisition of uavs is likely to continue in the future in order to understand fully the pace and scope of uav acquisition comparison between manned aircraft inventories and unmanned inventories may prove to be useful tool figure 2 shows the ratio of manned to unmanned aircraft despite the recent acceleration in uav production manned aircraft still represent 95 of all dod aircraft which suggests that uavs replacing manned aircraft in the foreseeable future is not likely rather uav programs have quite frequently been described as complements to or augmentation of manned aircraft as it appears from statements and internal recommendations the pace of uav production will either continue or accelerate in the coming years when asked to study dods uav programs the defense science board dsb found that the single most important recommendation is to accelerate the introduction of uavs into the force structure11 10 for an more indepth analysis of uav capabilities see role and applications in the later end of this section 11 defense science board study on unmanned aerial vehicles and uninhabited combat aerial vehicles office of the under secretary of defense for acquisition

describe air force plans to grow uav operations in the air national guard and air force reserve as massive introduction of the technology12 former air force chief of staff general john jumper indicated significantly faster pace of production of uavs specifically of the predator when he told the senate armed services committee were going to tell general atomics to build every predator they can possibly build13 these statements raise the question of whether the current and anticipated pace of uav development is appropriate historically congress has chastened dod for what it saw as leisurely rate of uav acquisition and encouraged it to speed up this pace or speed up the incorporation of certain capabilities for example the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 expressed the senates desire that within ten years onethird of us military operational deep strike aircraft will be unmanned14 this goal was seen at the time as very challenging because dod had unmanned deep strike aircraft in 1996 the house armed services committee hasc supported legislation directing dod to weaponize both the predator and 12 david fulghum rapid expansion of uav units

106th congress 2d session senate committee on armed services national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 srept 106292 p141 crs8 hunter but dod opposed the initiative15 some in the 109th congress have advocated increased procurement and application of uavs for nonmilitary roles for example house homeland security committee chairman representative peter king was reported to have said that uavs are underutilized by the department of homeland security and should play larger role in border security16 on the other hand congress has also expressed concern that dods growing enthusiasm may well lead to situation in which there is clear path toward the future of uavs17 some critics have expressed concern that an overly ambitious pace could affect the quality of the end product and the efficiency of the acquisition process fast pace could make congressional oversight much more difficult which could allow uav programs to exceed cost or to stray from the design objective as representative curt weldon cautioned aggressively fielding new types of vehicles and even building more of the same type of vehicle may be premature we must feel confident that we have adequately addressed some of the fundamentals to ensure that unmanned air systems are designed and fielded consistent with the common communications architecture and that common standards are established for operations some services are buying million dollar uavs using operations and maintenance funding that has never been specifically authorized for uavs and for which appropriations have never been made other services are leasing uav services for combat operations using operations and maintenance accounts and some services have effectively reduced congressional oversight by establishing uav projects within multibillion dollar multiproject aggregated program requests 18 the global hawks ambitious pace may be an example of the dilemma representative weldon described 2004 government accountability office gao report cites crowded production schedule and aggressive funding strategy as one reason for the immaturity of several critical technologies for the global hawk program19 the report indicates that deceleration of pace possibly even temporary halt in production must be coupled with management changes in order to preserve the quality and efficiency of the global hawk development process many in dod and in congress may argue that the pace is appropriate and the global 15 hearing of the tactical air and land forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee fiscal year 2004 budget

vehicles changes in global hawks acquisition strategy are needed to reduce program risks gao 056 november 2004 crs9 hawks problems are exceptional they could argue that the rapid rate of production of the hunter in the past and the predator currently are evidence that fast pace can be extremely efficient and produce high quality aircraft while supporting uav programs in general and even challenging dod to pursue uavs more aggressively many in congress appear to want assurances that taxpayer dollars are being well spent for example section 142 of the fy2006 defense authorization act hr 1815 h rept 10989 p123 would preclude procurement of new unmanned aerial vehicle systems by the military services without the written approval of the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics uav management issues in addition to establishing acquisition pace and scope of application one crucial congressional task may be to determine whether dods administrative processes and lines of authority within the acquisition process are effective for uav development and acquisition the management of dods development and acquisition programs has received heightened attention in the 108th and 109th congresses the air forces attempt to lease 100 kc767 tanker aircraft and many aspects of the armys future combat system fcs have focused congressional scrutiny on the mechanics of dods acquisition process20 because uavs are acquired by all four of the military services and the us special operations command and because uavs appear to be acquired at an accelerated rate and for growing list of applications it appears that great potential exists for duplication of effort this leads many to call for centralization of uav acquisition authority to ensure unity of effort and reduce chances for wasteful duplication of effort on the other hand if uav efforts are too centralized some fear that competition and innovation may be repressed another management issue pertains to cost uavs are developed and procured through the same acquisition system as manned aircraft and they appear to suffer from similar cost growth once viewed as cheap alternative to manned aircraft or even poor mans airforce some uavs are beginning to rival manned aircraft in cost according to dods most recent estimate the global hawk program will cost 65 billion to purchase 51 aircraft program unit acquisition cost of 128 million per uav the program has seen 194 million in development cost overruns triggering nunnmccurdy breach due to an average unit cost growth of 18 percent per airframe and has prompted appropriators to voice their concern hr 2863 109 119 p17421 20 see for example crs report rl32056 the air force kc767 tanker lease proposal key issues for congress by christopher bolkcom coordinator and crs report rl32888 the armys future combat system fcs background and issues for congress by andrew feickert 21 the nunnmccurdy provision requires dod to notify congress when cost growth on major acquisition program reaches 15 if the cost growth hits 25 nunnmccurdy requires dod to justify continuing the program based on three main criteria its importance to us national security the lack of viable alternative and evidence that the problems that continued crs10 much of uav cost growth appears to be attributable to factors that have plagued manned aircraft programs such as mission creep and inconsistent management practices global hawk costs for example have been driven up by adding multiple sensors which themselves increase cost but also require larger wings and more powerful engines to carry the increased weight which also increases cost originally global hawk was intended to carry one primary kind of sensor at time fleet of these uavs would provide mix of sensors to make global hawk more analogous to the u2 aircraft dod changed the requirement so that global hawk is to carry two or more primary sensors which has increased the uavs price22 originally considered relatively modest uav the joint unmanned combat air system jucas has evolved into large long range aircraft with heavy payload which has increased cost further dod has cut over 1 billion from the jucas budget and has moved management of the program from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa to the air force cutting the jucas budget topline may reduce the total number or aircraft to be procured but can also increase the cost per aircraft changing management responsibility can also contribute to cost growth via lack of coherent direction and changes in requirements and priority the frequent change and realignment of dods organizations with role in uav development illustrates the difficulties of establishing comprehensive uav management system over the years management of uav programs has gone full circle from the military services to navyrun joint program office jpo to the defense airborne reconnaissance office daro and then back to the services under the auspices of osd the jpo was established in 1988 but met criticism in congress in 1992 congress expressed its serious reservations over the management of these uav programs by the joint program office remarkably little progress has been registered during the past five years in this area the conferees believe the secretary of defense should undertake comprehensive review of the joint project office23 the jpo was replaced by the defense airborne reconnaissance office daro created in 1993 to more effectively manage dods disparate airborne reconnaissance programs including uavs daro was disbanded in 1998 amid further criticism of problems redesigns and accidents with the family of systems that 21 continued led to the cost growth are under control hr 1815 pl 10989 sec 802 would amend nunnmccurdy to lower the costgrowth threshold for providing detailed information on problem programs from 25 to 15 percent 22 for more information see crs report rl30727 airborne intelligence

defense authorization act for fiscal year 1993 hrept 102966 p635 crs11 it was formed to develop24 it is unclear whether this criticism was completely legitimate or whether it was generated by advocates of manned aviation who sought to protect these established programs since daros demise there has been single procurement focal point to manage dod uav efforts general oversight authority resides within the office of the assistant secretary of defense for command control communications and intelligence oasdc3i while the military services manage program development and acquisition in an effort to increase joint coordination of uav programs operated by the services the osd established the joint uav planning task force in 2001 the task force which falls under the authority of the pentagons acquisition chief under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics works to help standardize payload development establish uniform interfaces and promote common vision for future uavrelated efforts subsequently the joint uav planning task force has been viewed by many in the defense community as the top rung on the uav management ladder dr glenn lamartin director of defense systems in the osd argued that the joint uav task force was empowered through the joint staff to institute requirements satisfy joint needs and to provide discipline and structure to individual programs25 in order to help common uav vision become reality the task force has through the osd published three uav roadmaps april 2001 december 2002 and august 2005 in spite of the creation of the uav task force congressional concerns with uav acquisition management program duplication interoperability and other issues continued for example in 2002 the house committee on armed services noted the committee expresses its concern about proper program management elsewhere in this report and is specifically concerned that uav programs adhere to the same standards as other acquisition programs26 several other management mechanisms have recently been initiated in addition to the uav task force in 2003 the us joint forces command announced that it would take the lead in conducting experimentation in uav interoperability and flexibility for the joint uav task force27 also in 2003 dod created the uav interoperability working group to pursue jointservice and international cooperation in uav programs to support systems development the joint requirement 24 bill sweetman daro leaves solid legacy journal of electronic defense june 1998 p43 25 glenn lamartin

all uav issues under jrocs purview 29 in what appeared to be move toward further management restructuring reports in the spring of 2005 indicated that osd was considering appointing one of the services as the executive agent and coordinator for uav programs position for which air force actively petitioned30 however in late june 2005 the jroc announced that dod had abandoned the notion of an executive agent in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability31 the first entitled the joint uav overarching integrated product team oipt provides forum for identification and problem solving of major interoperability and standardization issues between the services32 in compliment the joint uav center of excellence coordinates with the oipt to improve interoperability and enhance uav applications through the examination of sensor technologies uav intelligence collection assets system technologies training and tactics33 over the past three years management initiatives to increase system uniformity and interoperability have been equally as numerous as the overall management structure initiatives most recently jroc established two organizations to promote joint coordination of production the constant organizational changes has led to mounting concern over uav management these fluctuations suggest that dod has not yet landed on final uav development and oversight structure to meet the needs of the military instead the recent establishment of the joint uav oipt and joint uav coe have lead many to believe that these bodies are not final solution but step in the right direction the march 2005 testimony by the gao to the house armed services subcommittee on tactical air and land forces most likely played role in facilitating the osds creation of these management groups the testimony criticized dod for the lack of an oversight body to guide uav development efforts and related investment decisions which ultimately does not allow dod to make sound program 28 office of the under secretary of defense acquistion technology ousdat defense airborne reconnaissance office daro uav management and oversight uav annual report fy1997 httpwwwfasorg

would appear that the gao envisioned central authority or body to satisfy this role however dods intended purpose for this oversight body may differ from the gaos concept air force major general stephen m goldfein commander of the air warfare center at nellis air force base nv described the uav center of excellence as onestop shop that takes look at all the possibilities for common operating systems and the best ways to use uavs35 if the intent of these bodies are simply to serve as onestop checkpoints in the uav development process instead of the centralized monitoring and oversight authority envisioned by the gao then questions may arise over where the final management authority resides within these bodies or with each of the services the task of finding adequate answers to these problems may fall on the shoulders of congress in the coming years outside of the current management structure does our defense establishment have an adequate plan or framework for how uavs will fit into the future of us warfighting the joint uav task force released in 2001 and 2002 the uav roadmap and follow up in 2005 entitled the 20052030 uas roadmap for the purpose of providing guidance on the future roles for uavs the technological progress and opportunities for uavs and the potential uav investment needs in march of 2005 prior to the release of the updated uas roadmap the gao called upon the department of defense to establish binding and authoritative strategic plan citing the 2002 roadmap failure to outline the interservice strategic goals for uavs and its lack of clearly defined investment priorities36 the 2005 uas roadmap reiterates its predecessors mandate and scope it states that its purpose is part of an oversight service in which the intent is to give strong guidance in such crossprogram areas as standards development and other interoperability solutions37 furthermore the roadmap neither authorizes specific uas nor prioritizes the requirements it does however identify future windows when technology should become available to enable new capabilities linked to warfighters needs to be incorporated into current or planned uas38 like its predecessor the roadmap only provides guidance and refrains from establishing authoritative blueprint for the future of uav development paths and approaches most likely the discrepancy between the dods approach to the roadmaps authority and the gaos vision of strategic uav plan will generate significant debate in the 34 sharon pickup and michael j sullivan written testimony before the house armed services

investment priorities all four military services the us special operations command socom and the us coast guard are developing and fielding uavs developing coordinated dodwide uav investment strategy appears key to ensuring duplication is avoided and scarce resources are maximized as part of its defense oversight role congress is positioned to arbitrate between competing uav investments or impact dods overarching investment plan several relevant questions seem apparent how is uav cost quantified what is the most effective balance in spending between uavs and manned aircraft how should dod congress and the uav manufacturers balance cost with capability finally what areas of investment are the most important to maximize uav capabilities quantifying and characterizing cost has proven to be complicated task for the members of the uav community yet would need to be assessed in an exploration of uav cost efficiency39 as with most aircraft uav costs can be depicted by different measurements two of the most frequently cited cost descriptions are flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost pauc according to the air forces system command afsc cost estimating handbook an air vehicles flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment sensor payload propulsion mechanics and body design systems engineering program management and allowances for engineering changes and warranties40 in contrast the pauc as described by the government accountability office is the total of all acquisitionrelated appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items which takes into account acquisition cost from previous years that tend to be more than the current year acquisition cost41 the difference between global hawks pauc and flyaway cost demonstrates the wide discrepancy between these 39 uav cost can either be defined by unit cost of an individual air vehicle or by system cost system cost could include one to six air vehicles the sensor package the ground control station and various support equipment acquisition cost is one measure to include research and development and procurement costs but operation and maintenance om cost is another factor costs stated are acquisition costs unless otherwise noted 40 afsc cost estimating handbook series reading ma prepared for the us air forces systems command p 1986 217 41 us government accountability office defense acquisitions information for congress on performance of major programs can be more complete timely and accessible report to the subcommittee on defense committee on appropriations us senate march 2005 gao05182 crs15 cost descriptions global hawks flyaway cost for fy2005 was 641 million while its pauc is 1287 million42 when compared to other aircraft the cost of an individual remotely piloted vehicle can be misleading uavs operate as part of system which generally consist of ground control station ground crew including remote pilots and sensor operators communication links and often other air vehicles unlike manned aircraft such as an f16 these supporting elements are requisite for the vehicles flight43 consequently analysts comparing uav costs to manned aircraft may need to consider the cost of the supporting elements and operational infrastructure that make up the complete unmanned aviation system monitoring or evaluating uav costs can also be complicated by budgeting conventions while uavs can be found in the aircraft procurement air force account in that services budget request documentation the army includes its uav funding requests in other procurement army this account contains broad range of dissimilar items to be procured also because most uavs conduct intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions some portion of their costs are covered in the intelligence budget rather than the dod budget which complicates building complete picture of cost once an adequate and uniform cost comparison mechanism or definition has been established the next step for congress may be to identify an appropriate balance in spending between uavs and manned aircraft as result of the apparent ascension of uavs to permanent position in the uss military aircraft inventory one logical question should be how much should be spent on uavs in relation to manned aircraft if the upward trend in uav funding continues through 2010 as shown in figure 3 dod is projected to have spent upwards of 18 billion on procurement rdte operations and maintenance for uavs from 20012010 this number far exceeds the 35 billion spent on uavs in the preceding decade 42 flyaway cost osd aircraft procurement air force ba 04 other aircraft fy2005 february 2004 high altitude endurance uav item 17 p 4 of 39 pauc osd selected acquisition report

requisite for flight feasibly an f16 needs pilot in the cockpit and littleelse uavs with the exception of the few autonomous flight models require constant intervention and control from ground crew the probability that an f16 could sustain flight without communication from its ground crew is relatively high whereas the lack of communication between the ground operators and the uav yields significantly low probability of sustained flight crs16 figure 3 uav annual funding profile 2952 3200 2845 3000 2800 2600 2249 2166 2400 2074 2200 2000 1631 1800 m ty 1946 1600 1448 1400 1200 1000 800

by uav advocates as one of the advantages offered by unmanned aircraft over manned aircraft however critics point out that the acquisition cost savings are often negligible if one considers that money saved by not having pilot in the cockpit must be applied to the ground cockpit of the uav aircrew operating the uav from the ground control station another cost question concerns personnel do uav pilots cost less to train and keep proficient than pilots of manned aircraft45 so although the air vehicle might be cheaper than manned aircraft the uav system as whole is not always less expensive46 additionally uavs have higher attrition rate and lower reliability rate than manned aircraft which means that the operation and maintenance costs can be higher on the other hand uav ground control stations are capable of simultaneously flying multiple uavs somewhat restoring the advantage in cost to the unmanned system47 congress has noted that while the acquisition per unit cost may be relatively small in the aggregate the acquisition cost rivals the investment in other larger weapon systems48 two studies have addressed the headto head manned vs unmanned cost issue the first cbo study showed that replacing army manned attack helicopters with ucavs would produce significant savings in steadystate procurement costs relative to current plans49 dod also studied the comparative costs of manned vs unmanned aircraft in their uav roadmap 2000 it found that development costs were essentially the same while there was cost savings in procurement costs when an f16 was compared to an unmanned combat aerial vehicle ucav50 assuming that funding balance is struck between manned and unmanned vehicles how then will dod juggle cost with capability the osd has cited this question as one of its most pressing challenges significant concern with some uavs is their rising price tag in march 9 2005 hearing for example members of the house armed services committee tactical air and land forces subcommittee expressed their concern over cost growth of not just hightech uavs like global hawk and jucas but also relatively less technologically ambitious uavs 51 45 for more on personnel

consistently increased the cost of the air vehicle according to former air force secretary james roche52 the inexpensive design of small uav air vehicles like the desert hawk and dragon eye are dwarfed by the cost of the lightweight electro opticalinfrared cameras that make up their payloads on the other end of the size spectrum the rq4 b second generation global hawks sensor payload represents approximately 54 percent of the vehicles flyaway cost which does not include the cost of the increased wingspan that shoulders the extra 1000 pounds of sensor suites53 these costs are increasing due to the basic law of supply and demand growing demand matched with lack of commercial sensor equivalents means that uav sensor producers face little competition which would help keep costs down growing sensor costs have prompted some to recommend equipping uavs with selfprotection devices suggesting those uavs are longer considered expendable consequently there are two schools of thought for uav employment that could help balance cost with capability one is to field many smaller less expensive and less capable uavs controlled through highly interconnected communications network54 one example of this investment approach is the developmental armys future combat system which networks several relatively inexpensive uavs like the raven the shadow and the fire scout with 18 other weapons platforms none of these uavs can individually shoulder all of the air duties required by the system yet the robust communications network is expected to distribute the mission duties to allow each platform to provide its specialized task55 second approach advocates fielding fewer more expensive and more capable uavs that are less networked with other systems such as the autonomous global hawk the global hawk serves as high altitude allinone surveillance platform capable of staying aloft for days at time yet does not operate in concert with any of its fellow uav peers since 2003 programs at both ends of this spectrum have experienced delays and reduction in funding the armys future combat system has experienced delays due to significant management and technology issues similarly the highly capable global hawk and the jucas program have risen in cost and been consumed by apparent management struggles which have prompted funding cuts for both56 52 us congress 107th

starting on p 37 for more information about the global hawk and jucas programs crs20 finally what areas of investment will yield the maximum effectiveness out of these uavs four specific issues stand out as the most pressing interoperability reliability force multiplicationautonomy and engine systems over the past three years of the uav evolution one the most worrisome issues for uavs has been the slow pace of the advancement of interoperability recently acting chief of acquisitions for the department of defense michael wynne declared that the lack of interoperability could be one of the pitfalls that causes dod to fall out of love with uavs unless the matter was resolved soon57 the future plans for uav usage within the framework of larger battlefield operations and more interconnected and potentially jointservice combat systems require uavs to seamlessly communicate between each other and numerous different ground components and to also be compatible with as equally numerous ground control systems the lack of interconnectivity at these levels have often complicated missions to the point of reducing their effectiveness as dyke weatherington head of dods uav planning taskforce noted in 2004 there have been cases where services uav if it could have gotten data to another service another component it may have provided better situational awareness on specific threat in specific area that might have resulted in different measures being taken58 advancing the interoperability of uavs has been critical part of the osds investment plans the department of defense has pushed forward with the establishment of intercommunication between similar uavs as vehicle to help facilitate interoperability among four categories59 first dod hopes to integrate an adequate interface for situational awareness which will relay the objective position payload composition service operator and mission tasking procedure to other unmanned aircraft and potentially to ground elements second payload interface will allow the coherent transfer of surveillance data while the third category the weapons interface will constitute separate transfer medium by which operators can coordinate these platforms offensive capabilities finally the air vehicle control interface will enable navigation and positioning from the ground with respect to other aircraft although the framework for these categories of interoperability has been established the technology has been slow to catch up the house of representatives version of the fy2006 defense authorization act hr 1815 house report 10989 took major step to encourage interplatform communication the members of the house armed services committee included clause that called for the requirement of all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles throughout the services to be equipped with the tactical common data link which has become the services standardized communication tool for providing critical wideband data link required 57 marc selinger wynne warns uav industry about cost networking aerospace daily december 16 2004 p 3 58 michael peck pentagon setting guidelines for aircraft interoperability national

for realtime situational awareness as well as real time sensor and targeting data to tactical commanders60 the 2005 unmanned aircraft systems uas roadmap61 endeavors to take step further it intends to field the common data link communications systems for not only tactical uavs but for all large uavs as well62 if uavs are to achieve the level of interoperability envisioned by the osd the services and industry must will likely need to keep focused on achieving the common data link communications system goal and invest appropriately to facilitate an expedited and efficient development process the finite bandwidth that currently exists for all military aircraft and the resulting competition for existing bandwidth may render the expansion of uav applications infeasible and leave many platforms grounded ultimately the requirement for bandwidth grows with every war the us fights63 the increased use of uavs in the iraq war indicates that remotely pilotted platform and their mass consumption of bandwitdth will require more robust information transfer system in the coming years some sources say that the military currently does not have enough bandwidth to download video and radar images via satellite communications from more than one uav at time in hearing of the house armed services committees subcommittee on tactical air and land forces representative curt weldon noted that while the united states possesses an extensive fleet of uavs many sit on many sit on the ground because there is inadequate bandwidth for them to be used effectively64 as confirmed by an osd official in the same hearing an unspecified number of uavs in iraq and afghanistan are incapable of operations because the information transfer capacity connecting uavs to the ground operators are simply not large enough to manage multiple uavs one program designed to alleviate the bandwidth concern is the transformation satellite communications tsat project dod intends to use the laser and satellite communications system to the provide us armed forces with an unlimited and uninhibited ability to send and receive messages and critical information around the world without data traffic

of the the overall uav system which includes command control communications sensors and often weapons 62 osd uas roadmap 20052030 august 2005 p 75 63 bandwidth is defined as the amount of data that can be transmitted over communications link in fixed amount of time 64 vhearing of the tactical air and land forces subcommittee of the house armed services committee fiscal year 2006 budget request march 9 2005 65 sandra erwin multibilliondollar internet in the sky could help ease bandwidth continued crs22 nicknamed the internet in the sky is expected to be the subject of funding cutbacks and at earliest will be deployed between 2015 and 2016 66 as another interim option dod has testified that more autonomous uav would require less bandwidth since more data are processed on board and less data are being moved67 however it is unclear that autonomy will actually decrease bandwidth requirements since global hawk an autonomous uav is currently the most aggressive bandwidth user one solution to alleviating the bandwidth problem is allowing uavs to be operated from manned standoff aircraft such as command and control aircraft stationing the mission control element of the uav system in another aircraft instead of on the ground would reduce the reliance on satellites for beyond line of sight communication simplifying command and control not only would this help overcome the bandwidth issue but it would also address another potential problem area which is pilot manpower and retention pilots in this case would still get to fly while operating the uav experimentation is currently ongoing in this area with the first step being controlling the uavs sensor payload from the air investment in reliability upgrades appear to be another high priority for uavs in recent years in 2004 the defense science board indicated that relatively high uav mishap rates might impede the widespread fielding of uavs68 the 2005 uas roadmap indicates that uav mishap rates appear to be much higher than the mishap rates of many manned aircraft table 2 shows the number of class mishap per 100000 hours of major uavs and comparable manned aircraft69 65 continued crunch national defense june

of aircraft missile or spacecraft andor fatality or permanent total disability similar definitions for the air force navy and marine corp can be found at their respective safety center websites also note the performance capabilities of the manned versus unmanned vary greatly and may have an impact on the mishap rate additionally the underlying assumption is that the uavs and the manned aircraft will perform the same missions and operate under the same circumstance as the manned aircraft which may not hold for all missions and all platforms for more on military aviation safety see crs report

manned u2 68 f16 41 source dods uas roadmap 20052030 p 75 in its recent uav study the defense science board dsb notes that manned aircraft over the past five decades have moved from the relatively high mishap rate to relatively low rates through the advancement of system design weather durability improvements and reliability upgrades70 it should be pointed out however that the uavs with the exception of predator have total flight times that are significantly less the than the 100000 hours used to calculate the mishap rate most aircraft tend to have much higher mishap rate in their first 50000 hours of flight than their second 50000 hours of flight further some of the uavs in table 2 have flown numerous missions while still under development predator and global hawk for instance were rushed into combat well prior to the aircrafts initial operational capability 2005 for predator and projected fy2006 for global hawk it is unfair some might argue to compare the mishap rates of developmental uavs with manned aircraft that have completed development and been modernized and refined over decades of use the dsbs report also suggests that nominal upgrades and investment arguing even that many uavs will need little change could produce substantial reductions in the uav mishap rates the 2005 uas roadmap proposes investments into emerging technologies such as selfrepairing smart flight control systems auto takeoff and recovery instruments and heavy fuel engines to enhance reliability71 also the incorporation of advanced materials such as high temperature components lightweight structures shape memory alloys and cold 70 defense science board defense science board study on unmanned aerial vehicles and uninhabited combat aerial vehicles office of the undersecretary

also be expected to improve the survivability of uavs in adverse environments72 one of the most attractive and innovative technological priorities in the industry is to enable one ground operator to pilot several uavs at once at the 2003 paris airshow vice president of boeings integrated defense advanced systems mike heinz said we have to reduce operator workload thats been real thorn in our side typically we have had multiple operators per vehicle but where we want to go is multiple vehicles per operator73 currently most uavs require at least two ground operators one to pilot the vehicle and another control the sensors the end goal for uav manufactures and users is to reduce the to 21 operatorvehicle ratio and eventually to elevate the autonomy and interoperability of uav to the point where two or more vehicles can be controlled by one operator if this technological feat is established the advantage of uavs as forcemultiplier on the battle field could provide dramatic change in combat capability many believe that the process of achieving this goal would most likely require significant time and investments as the 2005 uas roadmap notes getting groups of ua to team or swarm in order to accomplish an objective will require significant investment in control technologies with specific reference to distributed control technologies 74 considering the two operator system currently in place for most uavs the logical approach to reaching this technological advancement is to first invest in the autonomous flight capabilities of the uavs so as to reduce the workload for uavs the global hawk and the scan eagle possess significant automate flight capabilities but their degree of actual flight autonomy can be debated due to the uavs need for continuous operator intervention in poor weather conditions the osd quantifies the degree of uav autonomy in on scale of one to ten table 3 shows the osds autonomous capability levels for uavs 72 ibid 73 bill sweetman

by single pilot the uav acl must achieve level of at least eight currently the global hawk which is considered by many as the most autonomous uav presently in service maintains an acl of approximately 25 jucas plans hope to make the combat uav capable of autonomous flight levels of six yet the timetable for this level is fairly far off faa and the uav industry are working with the department of defense in order to facilitate the universal development of see and avoid technology that would allow uav to operate autonomously and avoid approaching aircraft potentially increasing the standard acl for uavs to four additionally interuav communication and the coordination associated with interoperability see interoperability above must match the autonomous flight abilities full automation of sensor capabilities would enable the lone operator to control network of intelligence collecting drones the first steps towards the oneoperatorperseveraluavs advancement are already underway recently the air force evaluated predator upgrade that allowed one operator to pilot up two four uavs75 the multiaircraft control mac system allowed one ground pilot to control the flight plan of four predator uavs during an exercise in which one uav engages target and the other three hover nearby on standby status the next step is to consolidate the tasks of the four mission payload operator each manning the sensors or weapons system on the four predators into one or fewer operators one key area of investment interest may be heavy fuel burning engines the osds 20052030 unmanned aviation system roadmap outlined the development of heavy fuel engine hef in order to replace gasolinepowered internal combustion 75 predators fly first fourship sortie air force print news september 26 2005 crs26 engines as top priority for uav investment 76 heavy fuel refers to diesel or jp8 fuel used by the army and air force77 the defense science board urged dod to take the lead in investing in the rapid development and acquisition of heavy fuel engines for predator shadow hunter and fire scout primarily because of the lack of commercial demand for these engines enrique j enriguez president of the locust usa inc testified that the military has clearly established their need for heavy fuel burning engines for uavs but industry has been slow to respond to this need in the small size range that we are working in the military requirements are in place requiring heavy fuel burning engines however these requirements are being placed on the aircraft developer78 the incorporation of heavy fuel engines onto uavs could help the vehicle to climb faster operate at more lofty altitudes and to reduce the amount of time spent servicing the engine on the ground proponent of heavy fuel engines argue that the integration of heavy fuel engines would not only increase performance capabilities and reduce servicing time but would make the uavs flight system more reliable and significantly reduce operations and maintenance costs furthermore heavy fuel is cheaper and more abundant than the gasoline used in standard internal combustion engines however some drawbacks may exist when applying hfe to uavs the targeted unmanned platforms for this engine are the mediumsized and less complex uavs such as shadow pioneer and predator although the operations and maintenance costs may lessened by the heavy fuel engine the initial acquisition cost is much greater than traditional engines and could burden these relatively cheap uavs with increased production costs furthermore developers are experiencing difficulties in designing an engine light enough and small enough to accommodate the flight requirements of this lighter uav another alternative being considered is modified fuel cell under development by pacific northwest national laboratory supporters of fuel cells note that these devices could double the efficiency of midsized uavs and could reduce the acoustic and thermal signatures of the uavs effectively making them more difficult to detect and target 79 air combat command is sponsoring the project with the idea in mind to use the fuel cells in many of its smaller uavs and expects flight test in 2010 76 osd 20052030 uas roadmap august 2005 p 76 77 httpwwwdarpamilttoprogramsa160_eng_devhtml 78 enrique j enriquez statement to the house armed services committees

23 2005 crs27 uav roles and applications considering the growing abundance of remotelypiloted platforms and the rapid growth of the uav industry some may question whether dod has coherent plan for determining uav roles and applications specifically are uavs being applied to new roles aggressively enough conversely is dod too eager to use uavs are there alternatives that should be considered for their missions under what circumstances does it make more sense to add missions to singlemission uav rather than develop new uav for the new mission traditionally and contemporaneously most uavs are designed and used primarily for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr missions80 some project that isr uavs will be the dominant uav role until at least 201481 isr applications range from multiintelligence high altitude and long endurance missions conducted by the global hawk over iraq and afghanistan or overthehill reconnaissance and sniper spotting performed by the armys raven uav in 2003 100 percent of dods major uav programs five of five programs conducted isr missions82 in 2005 87 percent 12 of 16 major programs are designed for isr missions this two year comparison indicates some diversification of uav missions and rapid growth in overall programs with this rapid growth in isr uavs may come the concern that production of numerous aircraft with the same basic mission could yield unnecessary duplication some contend that dod has had difficult time building joint manned aircraft in the past83 the services desire to optimally satisfy their unique operational requirements have often made them unwilling to compromise and accept an aircraft developed by another service might uav development be equally vulnerable to this dynamic why some in congress have asked for example does the navy require new maritime surveillance uav why cant they purchase the global hawk84 the 80 specialized uavs have been developed and used extensively as decoys decoys are autonomously guided they have been used in numerous conflicts to attract the attention of enemy air defenses while manned aircraft either avoid these defenses or attack them it is anticipated that dod will continue to develop and produce decoys operational goals would include decreasing price and improving abilities to mimic friendly aircraft and thus reduce the ability of enemy air defenses to different between the decoy and the real aircraft 81 steven zaloga unmanned aerial vehicles market overview world missiles briefing teal group inc fairfax va january 2005 82 of the 12 platforms five vehicles predator

capabilities constitutes unnecessary duplication critics of these expanded uav roles often argue that the production of these similar platforms is unnecessary considering that consolidated inventory hypothetically consisting of only the rq4b global hawk the rqmq1 predator and the rq2 pioneer could perform and fulfill the same duties as the expanded inventory however proponents of the more varied platform inventory often argue that these basic performance capabilities cannot alone qualify the necessity of these uavs and that crs30 the variety of uavs reflects the specific need of the mission or userservices and not unnecessary duplication furthermore they argue that landingtakeoff capabilities durability storage requirements and overall cost all play additional roles in determining the necessity of the vehicle in recent years the uavs role in combat missions has significantly increased the first public acknowledgment that uavs were being used for combat operations was in 2002 when predator uav outfitted with hellfire missile attacked and killed several alqaeda operatives in yemen85 now the uav combat landscape has changed the majority of the predator uavs have been equipped with hellfire missiles predator b comes off the assembly line with large array of munitions the maverick ignater fire scout and hunter uavs are undergoing armament evaluations and the jucas program endeavors to create the first uav primarily designed for offensive applications using uavs to deliver airtoground munitions appears inherently useful uavs can loiter over the battlefield to attack emerging targets at risk to flight crew yet uavs are not without limitations while cost and effectiveness comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft must be made cautiously doing so can help determine when using uavs for combat operations is more attractive than using manned aircraft the 2006 actual current year cost for the mq9 predator b is 117 million about onethird the 355 million estimate for the f16 falcon simple payload comparison shows that the f16 can carry approximately four times the payload of the predator b 10750 lbs vs 2500 lbs86 this means that the cost per one pound of munitions delivered is 4680 for the predator and 3302 for the f1687 further the f16 is versatile combat aircraft that can be used to perform many missions that the predator b cannot this may suggest that using manned aircraft for airtoground combat may generally prove more cost effective than using uavs and that he uavs unique combat capabilities may be most valued in niche circumstances such as when manned aircraft would be in extreme danger other missions for which uavs appear useful or are being considered in the nearterm include electronic attack also called standoff jamming or escort jamming and psychological operations such dropping leaflets on the medical side uavs such as the armys shadow have been studied and evaluated for its capability to deliver critical medical supplies needed on the battlefield 85 walter pincus us strike kills six in qaeda the washington post november 1 2002 86 payload based on the maneuvering capability of an f16 flying at 9 g with center

costs rdte costs logistics cost and personnel cost are not factored into this comparison furthermore flight performance and specific combat missions which are critical to the distinction of between these two vehicles are also not factored into this comparison crs31 while uav use in foreign theaters is well established one of the most commonly discussed new mission areas for uavs is homeland defense and homeland security the coast guard and us border patrol already have plans to deploy uavs such as the eagle eye to watch coastal waters patrol the nations borders and protect major oil and gas pipelines congressional support exists for using uavs like the predator for border security during senate armed services committee hearing on homeland defense several members agreed that although it would not be appropriate or constitutional for the military to patrol the border domestic agencies using uavs could carry out this mission88 it appears that interest is growing in using uavs for variety of domestic and often nondefense roles longduration law enforcement surveillance task performed by manned aircraft during the october 2002 sniper incident near washington dc is one example the us department of transportation has studied possible security roles for uavs such as following trucks with hazardous cargo while the energy department has been developing highaltitude instruments to measure radiation in the atmosphere89 the inexpensive vertical takeoff and landing goldeneye 100 uav is expected to serve as mediumrange smallpackage transport and may be affordable enough for local law enforcement use during events of largescale civil unrest90 uavs might also be used in sparsely populated areas of the western united states to search for forest fires following the widespread destruction of hurricane katrina some suggest that uav like global hawk could play roles in consequence management and relief efforts91 also uav advocates note that countries like south korea and japan have used uavs for decades for crop dusting and other agricultural purposes92 not all of these new applications have are uncontroversial uav advocates state that in order for uavs to take an active role in homeland security federal aviation administration faa regulations and uav flight requirements must approach common ground according to faa spokeman william shumann the primary challenge in meeting this common ground is to develop vehicles that meet faa safety requirements if they want to fly in crowded airspace93 the august 2003 announcement that the faa had granted the air force certificate of authorization for national airspace operation signifies the first steps in the reconciliation of these 88 marc selinger sen mccain says predator may be useful for border security

collision avoidance capabilities appears to be critical part in the next step of reaching the uavairspace common ground the faas unmanned aircraft systems working group indicates it will work with the department of defense specifically through the new uav oipt and center of excellence to facilitate safe uav operations and the adequacy of flight requirements95 the schedule for integrating uavs into the national airspace may become contentious february 2004 study by the defense science board found that dod has an urgent need to allow uavs unencumbered access to the national airspace systemhere in the united states and around the world96 in september 2005 it was reported however that nasa planned to cancel funding for access 5 governmentindustry partnership created to facilitate the incorporation of uavs into the national airspace system uav advocates bemoaned this development arguing that disbanding access 5 would severely hamper the forecasted development of uavs and their numerous global applications97 further in the future large uavs could take on the aerial refueling task now performed by kc10 and kc135 tanker aircraft although dod has not expressed plans for exploring the aerial refueling role it appears to some to be mission well suited for unmanned aircraft the flight profiles flown by kc10 and kc135 aircraft are relatively benign compared to many other aircraft and they tend to operate far from enemy air defenses except for operating the refueling boom to refuel air force aircraft the refueling crews primary job is to keep the aircraft flying straight level and at steady speed the global hawks 2001 transoceanic flights from the united states to australia and from the united states to portugal demonstrate the ability of current uavs to fly missions analogous to aerial refueling missions another far more difficult future task could be airtoair combat dod is experimenting with outfitting todays uavs with the sensors and weapons required to conduct such mission in fact predator has reportedly already engaged in air toair combat with an iraqi fighter aircraft in march 2003 it was reported that predator launched stinger airtoair missile at an iraqi mig before the iraqi aircraft shot it down98 while this operational encounter may be baby step on the way toward an aerial combat capability it appears significant aerial combat is often

missile will likely hearten uav advocates who wish to see more aggressive missions for unmanned aircraft are uavs always the preferred platforms for these new roles and applications other options could include manned aircraft blimps and space satellites99 each platform offers both advantages and disadvantages manned aircraft provide flexible platform but risk pilots life some of the countrys largest defense contractors are competing to develop unmanned blimps that may be capable of floating months at time at an altitude of 70000 feet and carrying 4000 pounds of payload osds 2005 uas roadmap includes section on lighterthanair blimps and tethered aerostat platforms which osd indicates to be important for variety of roles including psychological operations spot incoming enemy missiles and border monitoring furthermore these platforms could provide services equivalent to many border surveillance uavs but their decreased dependency on fuel could minimize operations costs one drawback to these lighterthanair platforms is their lack of maneuverability and speed relative to uavs like the global hawk none theless the goal of many major uav manufacturers is to develop an operational system by 2010 that could carry out variety of missions for homeland security100 space satellites offer many benefits they are thought to be relatively invulnerable to attack and field many advanced capabilities however tasking the satellites can be cumbersome especially with competing national priorities the limited number of systems can only serve so many customers at one time additionally some satellites lack the loitering capability of uavs only passing over the same spot on earth about once every three days due to the high costs of space launches uavs like global hawk are being considered for communication relays as substitutes for loworbiting satellite constellations101 recruitment and retention one commonly voiced concern with the pace of uav production is that these remotely piloted planes will replace manned aircraft in large numbers102 critics of mass uav production warn that reliance on unmanned vehicles degrades pilot skills and takes away the tactical flexibility and adaptability that manned aircraft bring to combat operations 99 for more information on blimps airships and aerostats see crs report rs21886 potential military use of airships and

not always been easy for the aviation culture to adapt to flying aircraft from the ground deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz during hearing on transformation stated that not long ago an air force f15 pilot had to be persuaded to forego rated pilots job to fly predator now air force leadership is working hard to encourage this pilot and others to think of piloting uavs as major mission and to become trail blazers in defining new concepts of operations103 the air force has realized the retention implications of requiring rated pilots to fly their uavs104 and has offered enticements such as plum assignments after flying the uav and allowing pilots to keep up their manned flying hours during their uav tour of duty historically many believed that as more uavs were fielded recruitment and retention would suffer because those inclined to join the military would prefer to fly manned aircraft instead of unmanned aircraft this may be the case in some instances the future impact of dods uav programs on recruitment however is more complicated than this argument suggests the recruitment and retention situation varies among the services and for different types of personnel while the army appears to be having some difficulty with recent recruitment the air force and navy are actively trying to reduce their number of uniformed personnel thus reduced enlistments due to increased uav use if that turns out to be the case might not have the anticipated impact105 central question related to the potential impact of increased uav employment on personnel is what qualifications are required to operate uavs currently the air force require predator and global hawk operators to be pilotrated officers other services do not require uav operators to be pilotrated officers this means that in the other services there is competition between manned and unmanned aircraft for potentially scarce pilots many enlist in military service with desire or intention to fly manned aircraft some wish to fly but lack physical qualifications such as good eyesight the increased fielding of uavs may encourage some to enlist because it offers them an opportunity to fly that they may not have had otherwise further those inclined to fly manned aircraft may not be as disinclined to fly uavs as was believed in the past flying armed uavs may be more appealing to these personnel than is flying nonarmed uavs also flying uavs may be an attractive compromise for certain 103 us congress 107th congress 2d session hearing before the committee on armed services united states senatedepartment of defense policies and programs to transform the armed forces to meet the challenges of the 21st century april 9 2002 p10 104 currently the air force is the only service to require rated pilots to fly their uavs 105 for more information on recruitment issues see crs report rl32965 recruiting and retention an overview of fy2004 and fy2005 results for active and reserve component enlisted personnel by lawrence kapp crs35 personnel while it may not confer all the excitement of flying manned aircraft it also avoids many of the hardships eg arduous deployments and potential harm the air force believes that flying uavs from control stations in the united states will be attractive to some reservists and guardsmen who may already be disinclined to experience an active duty lifestyle consistent with flying manned aircraft also not all uavs compete with manned aircraft for pilots those uavs that are pre programmed and operate autonomously like global hawk do not require pilot like the predator and other remotely piloted vehicles the air force maintains that their uavs are more technologically and operationally sophisticated than other uavs and trained pilot is required to employ these uavs most effectively as uav autonomy or command and control matures or if personnel issues for the air force become more troublesome it or congress may decide to review the policy of requiring pilotrated officers to operate uavs increased employment of uavs could potentially boost enlistment in other specialties if they are perceived as being effective in their missions if for example those inclined to enlist in infantry positions perceive uavs to offer improved force protection and cas capabilities over todays manned aircraft these potential recruits may have fewer qualms about the potential hazards of combat industrial base considerations congress is perennially confronted with spate of defense industrial base issues is us industry becoming too dependent on foreign suppliers do foreign competitors get government subsidies that put us firms at competitive disadvantage should congress take steps to encourage or discourage defense industry consolidation should congress take steps to promote competition in the defense industrial base should congress takes steps to protect us defense industries in order to safeguard technologies or processes critical to national defense106 it appears that dods pursuit of uavs presents several interrelated issues relevant to the defense industrial base some are concerned that if uavs are increasingly designed and built funding for manned aircraft programs is likely to wane and the technical expertise required to design and perhaps build manned combat aircraft could erode many point out that the ability to produce world class combat aircraft is distinct us comparative advantage and should be guarded closely others disagree that the pursuit of uavs could harm the industrial base they argue that the joint strike fighter is likely to be the last manned tactical fighter and that the industrial base is naturally evolving toward the skills and processes required to make increasingly advanced uavs those who fear manned industrial base atrophy argue that the future of uavs is overrated and that there will be demand for tactical manned aircraft in the post jsf timeframe in their eyes crucial skills and technologies could thus be lost by concentrating only on unmanned aircraft design possibly causing us dominance 106 see for example crs report rl31236 the berry amendment requiring defense procurement to come from domestic sources by valerie bailey grasso crs36 in tactical aircraft design to wane these proponents point out that uavs have been around for almost century yet only recently became operationally effective and are not likely to replace manned aircraft in the near future107 some disagree and believe that critical manned aircraft design skills are not jeopardized by increased pursuit of uavs because there is considerable commonality between manned and unmanned combat aircraft except for the obvious lack of cockpit unmanned combat aircraft may require stealthy airframes advanced avionics and high performance engines just like manned combat aircraft also major defense contractors have already begun to shift to unmanned aircraft design in order to stay competitive this is because uavs are beginning to play prominent role in warfare as seen in operation enduring freedom in 2001 and operation iraqi freedom in 2003 the same skills and technologies required for building manned aircraft will likely lend themselves to unmanned aviation design as well companies that have lost out in recent aviation contracts such as boeing and the joint strike fighter jsf in 2001 are looking towards unmanned bombers and fighters as prospects for growth108 northrop grumman corp as another example has created new business unit to aggressively pursue uav business109 if boeing were to design manned aircraft in the future the critical skills needed would still be present according to this argument others would argue that maintaining healthy us defense industrial base depends in part on how well us firms compete for the global uav market one survey finds that in 2005 there are 195 different uav programs world wide110 some estimate that global uav expenditures double from 21 billion in 2005 to 5 billion in 2014111 the global market for combat aircraft alone at approximately 125 billion in 2005 dwarfs the uav market but the rate of growth is projected to be much slower peaking at approximately 16 billion in 2013 and dropping to approximately 14 billion in 2014112 thus some would argue that much new business is likely to be generated in the uav market and if us companies dont capture this market share european russian israeli chinese or south african companies will from this perspective capturing this new business and nurturing industrial expertise in uav challenge areas eg autonomous flight control of multiple vehicles command and control communications bandwidth would be an effective way to keep us industry competitive and healthy 107 for more information on the

uav proliferation and export control considerations this apparent and projected global growth of uavs presents the related policy issue of uav proliferation and export controls both the 108th and 109th congresses have held hearings to express concern and explore the policy dimensions of uav and cruise missile proliferation113 uavs and cruise missiles essentially uav with weapon payload are concerns for policy makers for two reasons first because their proliferation appears difficult to control the majority of uav components are indistinguishable from components found in civil manned aviation114 therefore many believe that it is relatively easy to divert legitimate civilian or military exports of aviation technology into covert uav or cruise missile program115 uavs could be accessible to many countries or even nonstate actors hizbollah militants for example have flown uavs over israel and qaeda has used uavs to monitor pakistani soldiers 116 that might not otherwise have access to long range aircraft or ballistic missiles second uav proliferation is concern because if armed they appear to be cost effective weapons it cost much more to effectively defend against these threats than it costs to create the threat117 cruise missiles and uavs it is feared could become the poor mans air force the george w bush administration has expressed concern over the potential military effectiveness of uavs in the wrong hands prior to the beginning of operation iraqi freedom for example both white house and dod officials focused on iraqs uavs and how they could be used to attack neighboring countries with weapons of mass destruction118 foreign companies are increasingly gaining access to key technologies that could make future uavs even more effective 119 policy makers may become particularly mindful of potential 113 see us representative christopher shays holds hearing on missile technology and export controls us house of representatives government reform committee

that could be incorporated in foreign uavs as dod employs uavs more aggressively and as us companies pursue growing body of international business opportunities some in congress may wish to address policy issues related to the potential for uav proliferation and its consequences what steps might be taken to ensure the pursuit by us companies of domestic and international uav export success doesnt lead to the dissemination of critical uav technologies what balance should be struck between supporting legitimate military aid to us allies which may include uavs and concerns about the proliferation of these weapon systems another complicating issue is that uavs when used for isr can be very effective in enabling the discriminating use of military force uavs can help positively identify enemy combatants and reduce the accidental targeting of friendly forces or innocent civilians120 how might overseers weigh the potential benefits of reducing collateral damage versus the potential acquisition of uavs by enemy groups and their use against the united states what revisions might be considered to existing nonproliferation accords such as the missile technology control regime mtcr to more effectively control the spread of uavs and their technology would tighter controls on uavs be detriment to industry121 current dod uav programs this section addresses the program status and funding of some of the most prominent uav programs being pursued by dod and most likely to compete for congressional attention this section does not attempt to provide comprehensive survey of all uav programs nor to develop classification system for different types of uavs eg operational vs developmental single mission vs multi mission long range vs short range one exception is short subsection below titled small uavs the uavs described in this section are distinguished from the proceeding uavs by being manportable and of short range and loiter time these smaller uavs are not currently and are unlikely to be weaponized the services do not provide as detailed cost and budget documentation for these uavs as they do for major uav programs individually these uavs appear very popular with ground forces yet do not necessarily demand as much congressional attention as larger uav programs like predator or global hawk as whole however these small man portable uavs appear likely to increasingly compete with major uav programs for congressional attention and funding 120 gail kaufman evolving uavs force mtcr reconsiderations defense news december 1016 2001 121 for more

in iraq and afghanistan and its multimission capabilities the mq1 predator has become the department of defenses most recognizable uav developed by general atomics aeronautical systems in san diego ca the predator has helped to define the modern role of uavs with its integrated surveillance payload and armament capabilities consequently predator has enjoyed accelerated development schedules as well as increased procurement funding the wide employment of the mq1 has also facilitated the development of several closely related uavs described below designed for variety of missions system characteristics predator is mediumaltitude longendurance uav roughly half the size of an air force f16 falcon at 27 feet long 7 feet high and with 48 foot wingspan it has long thin wings and tail like an inverted v the predator typically operates at 10000 to 15000 feet to get the best imagery from its video cameras although it has the ability to reach maximum altitude of 25000 feet each vehicle can remain on station over 500 nautical miles away from its base for 24 hours before returning home the air forces predator fleet is operated by the 11th reconnaissance squadron out of the indian spring auxiliary field nevada and the 15th and 17th reconnaissance squadrons out of nellis air force base nevada current reorganization efforts will make indian springs the home for all three squadrons122 the cia reportedly possesses and operates several predators as well mission and payload the predators primary function is reconnaissance and target acquisition of potential ground targets to accomplish this mission the predator is outfitted with 450lb surveillance payload which includes two electro optical eo cameras and one infrared ir camera for use at night these cameras are housed in ballshaped turret that can be easily seen underneath the vehicles nose the predator is also equipped with multispectral targeting system mts sensor ball which adds laser designator to the eoir payload that allows the predator to track moving targets additionally the predators payload includes synthetic aperture radar sar which enables the uav to see through inclement weather the predators satellite communications provide for beyond lineofsight operations in 2001 as secondary function the predator was outfitted with the ability to carry two hellfire missiles previously the predator identified target and relayed the coordinates to manned aircraft which then engaged the target the addition of this antitank ordinance enables the uav to launch precision attack on time sensitive target with minimized sensortoshoot time cycle consequently the air force changed the predators military designation from rq1b reconnaissance unmanned to the mq1 multimission unmanned123 the air vehicle launches and lands like regular aircraft but is controlled by pilot on the ground using joystick variants mq9 predator b the mq9 predator or predator b is general atomics follow on to mq1 or predator the goal of the predator b project is 122 elizabeth rees predator squadron ops center to relocate to indian springs inside the air force october 1 2004 123 glenn w goodman jr uavs come of age the isr journal july 2002 p24 crs40 to build upon the strengths of the parent uav and to advance its mission capabilities the result is mediumtohigh altitude long endurance predator optimized for surveillance target acquisition and armed engagement while the bmodel borrows from the overall design of the amodel the newest incarnation is longer by 13 feet in length and 16 feet in wingspan it also features 900hp honeywell tpe 33110 turbo propjet engine which is significantly more powerful than the predator as 115hp propjet engine these upgrades allow the predator b to reach maximum altitude of 50000 feet maximum speed of 225 knots maximum endurance of 32 hours and maximum range on 2000 nautical miles124 general atomics also upgraded the 17inch diameter mts camera gimbal to 22inch mtsb gimbal for extended range surveillance however the feature that most differentiates predator b from its predecessor is its ordinance capacity while the predator is outfitted to carry two 100pound hellfire missiles predator b now can carry as many as 16 hellfires equivalent to the armys apache helicopter or mix of 500pound weapons and small diameter bombs approximately equal to the munitions payload of an f16 additionally raytheon has experimented with miniuav known as silent eyes to be launched from the fuselage of the predator b and to serve as target identifier in supplement to the laser designator125 predator ber mariner the predator bextended range or mariner is less of next generation predator and more of hybrid of the predator b and nasas altair uav also produced by general atomics the mariner was created as result of general atomics pursuit of the navys broad area maritime surveillance bams program contract as an extended range uav the mariner retains the original airframe of the predator but adds the 86 ft wing from the altair and an increased fuel capacity the subsequent combination has yielded surveillance uav capable of altitudes of 50000 feet and flight endurance of 49 hours general atomic has partnered with lockheed martin system and sensors to integrate an exteriormounted maritime radar that will advance the surveillance capabilities of the mariner beyond the standard predator b payload the mariner is expected to compete with northrop grummans global hawk for the bams contract and the vehicles proponents hope that mariner could have flyaway cost as little 19 million per vehicle126 predator c in addition to the mariner general atomics is currently developing third generation predator that uses turbojet engine to fly long endurance high altitude surveillance missions the predator c will reportedly use the fuselage of the predator b but will be similar to northrop grummans global hawk in payload capacity and flight performance

temporary gapfiller for the rq5 hunter when that uav is removed from deployment to be overhauled or modified servicemen in the field have characterized the ignat as downsized version of the predator uav128 this medium altitude longendurance surveillance and reconnaissance platform is also manufactured by general atomic aeronautical systems and evolved as an upgraded derivation of the gnat750 the ignater features nearly the same system payload and performance characteristics as the mq 1 predator with few exceptions the ignater can remain aloft for 30 hour six hours longer than its air force sibling yet it lacks the sar and beyondlineof sight blos capabilities and is engineered for significantly shorter flight radius the army currently owns three ignat vehicles as the result of an fy2004 congressional budget increase for ermp conops development129 two additional vehicles outfitted with satellite communications satcom data links mts sensortarget designators and hellfire missiles are expected to be delivered to the army by the end of 2005 130 according to dod congressional testimony the ignat will continue to augment hunter operations in iraq131 program status predator uavs are operated as part of system which consists of four air vehicles ground control station and predator primary satellite link the actual current year cost in fy2005 for one predator system was approximately 180 million while the current year cost cy05 for predator b system was 468 million132 the air force currently possesses 57 deployable mq1 predators and fields 12 systems the current inventory of mq9 predator bs stands at six vehicles and initial pentagon plans anticipate the number to grow to 46 by the end of fy2011 recent developments have led many to believe that both predators

subsequently aircraft armaments incorporated out of hunt valley md and iai jointly manufactured the pioneer for the navy us marine corp and the us army the uav was often employed in 1991 during operation desert storm for reconnaissance and naval gun spotting missions at the end of fy2002 the navy ended its use of the air vehicle and passed its assets to the marine corps which intends to field the rq2 until either 2010 or until vertical take off and landing uav vtuav is ready for operation135 many believe that pioneer has remained useful during its service life by being durablethe marine corp unofficially refers to the vehicle as old reliableand by undergoing several progressive performance upgrades136 system characteristics at 14 feet long the pioneer is roughly half the size of the air forces mq1 predator uav it can reach maximum altitude of 15000 feet but flies an optimal altitude of 5000 feet above its target the vehicle can achieve flight by rocketassisted takeoff rato catapult launcher or traditional runway takeoff from land or from ships pioneer is maintains flight range of 100 nautical miles the propeller driven sf350 piston engine keeps the uav aloft for up to five hours the pioneer can land on runway or can be recovered using retrieval net when runway is unavailable since 1986 pioneer has flown over 36500 hours in direct support of navy and marine corps operational commanders including more than 7500 flight hours during operation iraq freedom mission and payload the mission of the pioneer is to provide realtime intelligence and reconnaissance capability to field commanders pioneer can be used for overthehorizon targeting surveillance naval gunfire spotting and battle damage assessment its 75 lb payload consists of combined eoir camera other payloads that have been demonstrated include meteorological sensor mine detection sensor and chemical detection sensor program status the navy had planned to retire the pioneer in 2004 and replace it with the vtuav however when it quit that program the navy gave all of its pioneer systems to the marine corps the marine corps hopes keep them flying another 10 years through product

this large uav incorporates diverse surveillance payload with performance capabilities that rival or exceed most manned spy planes the global hawks surveillance achievements in demonstrations and over the battlefield have led many to believe that the rq4a and its successor the rq4b play an important role in the future of isr however the complex task of adding specific intelligence systems to the payload configuration has helped to keep this high altitude long endurance uav from advancing beyond developmental stage despite extensive operational deployment many pentagon officials and congressional members have become increasingly concerned with the programs burgeoning cost and have subsequently slowed development progress until adequate program controls are implemented138 138 for

for as long as 35 hours it can fly to target area 5400 nautical miles away loiter at 60000 feet while monitoring an area the size of that state of illinois for 24 hours and then return global hawk was originally designed to be an autonomous drone capable of taking off flying and landing on preprogrammed inputs to the uavs flight computer air force operators have found however that the uav requires frequent intervention by remote operators139 the rq4b resembles the rq4a yet features significantly larger airframe in designing the bmodel northrop grumman increased the global hawks length from 44 feet to 48 feet and its wingspan from 116 feet to 132 feet the expanded size enables the rq4b to carry an extra 1000 lbs of surveillance payload mission and payload the global hawk uav has been called the theater commanders aroundtheclock lowhanging surveillance satellite140 the uav provides longdwell presence over the battlespace giving military commanders persistent source of high quality imagery that has proven valuable in surveillance and interdiction operations the rq4as current imagery payload consists of 2000lb integrated suite of sensors much larger than those found on the predator these sensors include an allweather sar with moving target indicator mti capability an eo digital camera and an ir sensor as the result of january 2002 air force requirements summit northrop grumman expanded its payload to make it multi intelligence air vehicle the subsequent incarnation the rq4b is outfitted with an opensystem architecture that enables the vehicle to carry multiple payloads such as signals intelligence sigint and electronic intelligence elint sensors furthermore the classified multiplatform radar technology insertion program mprtip payload will be added in order to increase radar capabilities these new sensor packages will enable operators to eavesdrop on radio transmissions or to identify enemy radar from extremely high altitudes future plans include adding hyperspectral sensors for increased imagery precision and incorporating laser communications to expand information transfer capabilities141 the end goal is to field uav that will work with spacebased sensors to create staring net that will prevent enemies from establishing tactical surprise142 in august of 2003 the federal aviation administration granted the global hawk authorization to fly in us civilian airspace which further expanded the vehicles mission potential143 this distinction in combination with the diverse surveillance capabilities has led many officials outside the pentagon to consider the global hawk an attractive candidate 139 jeff morrison usaf longer viewing global hawk as an autonomous system official says aerospace daily december 3rd 2005 140 glenn w goodman jr uavs

senor suite147 government accountability office report in december 2004 noted that the program had increased by nearly 900 million since 2001 and recommended delaying the purchase of future global hawks until an appropriate development strategy could be implemented148 the rising costs of the uav and accusations of air force mismanagement have caused concern among many in congress and in the pentagon as well as facilitating an overall debate on the air forces development strategy149 the conferees of the fy2005 defense authorization bill house report 108767 admonished the air forces management strategy for not using previously authorized funds for counterdrug surveillance evaluation program they noted that the committee suspects the air force used the 180 million set aside in 2001 for the counterdrug demonstration to meet other requirements of the global hawk development program150 as result the conferees recommended cut of 18 million to the presidents rd request for the global hawk the final appropriation bill public law 108335 cut the rd request by six million dollars in june of 2004 the house appropriations committee expressed serious concern over air forces

originally the army in conjunction with the navy explored several different uavs for the tuav program including the nowcancelled rq6 outrider system however in 1997 after the navy pursued other alternatives the army opted for the low cost simple design of the rq7 shadow 200 having reached full production capacity and an ioc in 2002 the shadow has become the primary airborne isr tool of numerous army units around the world and is expected to remain in service through the decade system characteristics built by aai corporation of hunt valley md the shadow is 11 feet long with wingspan of 13 feet it has range of 68 nautical miles distance picked to match typical army brigade operations and an average flight duration of five hours although the shadow can reach maximum altitude of 14000 feet its optimum level is 8000 feet the shadow is catapulted from rail launcher and recovered with the aid of arresting gear the uav also possesses automatic takeoff and landing capabilities the

aerial combat vehicles ucav programs the air forces ucav and the navys ucavn demonstrator program the air force favored boeings x45 for its program while northrop grummans x47 pegasus and boeings x46 competed for the navys project however in june 2003 the pentagon merged the two separated programs in order to establish the joint unmanned combat air systems jucas project under the management of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the objective of the jucas merger was to create flexible offensive network in which the air and ground elements are adapted to meet specific combat mission163 as part of program budget decision pbd 753 in december 2004 darpa was ordered to transfer administration of the jucas resources to air force which will form joint program planning committee with the navy164 while questions surround the direction in which the air force will move the program forward statements from the pentagon have indicated that the program will maintain competitive environment between boeing and northrop grummans vehicles165 system characteristics currently jucas consists of two variants from the navy and air forces previous programs featuring length of 39 feet and wingspan of 49 feet the x45c evolved as an enhanced crossbreed of the two evaluation x45a vehicles darpa inherited from the air force and the boeings experimental x46a submission for the navy program powered by general electrics ge f404102d turbojet engine the x45c is expected to achieve speeds of 450 knots and altitudes of 40000 feet furthermore the x45 can stay aloft for up to seven hours and operate at range of 1200 nautical miles when engineering the x45c boeing experimented with airframe designs that maximized the stealth capabilities of the uav system they landed on the larger arrowhead design which resembles fellow stealth aircraft like the b2 spirit bomber and f117anighthawk as the x45cs competitor northrop grummans x47b an advanced version of the ucavns x47a is nearly as long as the x45c yet possess significantly greater wingspan of 62 feet the increased wingspan in combination with the more powerful pratt whitney f100220u turbojet engine will allow x47b an endurance of nine hours and range of 1600 nautical miles the speed and altitude of the pegasus is expected to match that of the x45c the x47b retains smooth and sleek design optimized for stealth but features folding wingtips that cut down on size making it more suitable for storage aboard an aircraft carrier166 designs are in place for the x 47bs common operating system which is expected to

potential mission and payload initially the separate navy and air force programs envisioned ucav combat missions specific to the needs of the individual services the air force intended the x45s primary mission to be the suppression of enemy air defenses sead and secondary mission of electronic attack warfare168 the navy planned to use its ucav for armed intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance169 the payloads of each vehicle are expected to be tailored to the respective mission both boeing and northrop grummans systems will possess internal weapons bays and will be capable of carrying guided weapons similar to those of conventional strike aircraft the current weapon choice for the x45c and the x47b is the gbu31 joint direct attack munitions jdam both vehicles will feature sars electronic support measure sensor suites esm and ground moving target indicators gmti additionally the x47bs payload will include an oir camera combination in order to augment its surveillance and reconnaissance missions program status since its inception the ucav programs have experienced constant change in administration and organization which many believe will affect the pace of development in 2003 the air force and navys respective ucav projects were combined under the darpa controlled jucas program in order to facilitate interoperability and development synergy in september of 2004 darpa hired the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory as notforprofit integratorbroker in charge of promoting cooperation for common vehicle architectures170 in move viewed by several observers as an abrupt reversal the office of the secretary of defense instructed the air force to take control over the project the subsequent fluctuation of jucas management appears to complicate forecasting of the programs future development of the combat uav has been advanced via the spiral development process171 currently the jucas aircraft inventory includes two x45a air vehicles and one x47a air vehicle osd plans indicate that three x45cs three and the x47bs will be delivered by the end of 2006 operational flight assessments of both vehicles are expected to begin in

developed by aerovironment the pointer is capable of greater flight endurance two hours than most similar small uavs in part due to its relative large wingspan the pointer weighs in at nearly 85 lbs and features 9 foot wingspan which decreases portability when part of system of two air vehicles and ground control unit as result transportation of pointer system requires two personnel192 the batteryoperated uav carries either an ir or daytime eo sensor and has remained valued short range isr asset for the air force and special operations command currently these two organizations own 50 pointer systems and according to osd documentation plan to purchase an additional 50 systems in the near future for oif and oef193 aerovironment is in the process of developing the pointers successor
