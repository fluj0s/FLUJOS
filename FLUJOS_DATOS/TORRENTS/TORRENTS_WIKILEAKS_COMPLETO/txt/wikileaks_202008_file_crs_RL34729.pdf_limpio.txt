peoples republic of china p rc along with security and bilateral trade some us leaders argue that us policies of engagement with china particularly since granting the prc normal trade relations status in 2000 have helped to accelerate economic and soci change and build social and legal foundations for human rights progress in the prc others contend that us engagement has failed not only to produce meaningful political reform but also to set any real change in motion this report analyzes chinas mixed human rights record of the past several years major human rights problems new human rights legislation and the development of civil society legal awareness and social activism it also discusses factors that may help shape tre nds during the next several years in the past decade prc government has attempted to respond to public grievances and popular ca lls for redress while subduing activists who attempt to organize mass protests this approach has produced both incr emental improvements in human rights and allowed for continued serious abuses major ongoing problems include unlawful killings by security forces torture unlawful detention the excessive use of state security laws to imprison political dissidents coercive family planning policies state control of in formation and religious and ethnic persecution tibetans ethnic uighur muslims and falun gong adherents have been singled out for especially harsh treatment this report discusses major areas of concern but does not provide an exhaustive account of all human rights abuses in the prc chinas leadership has addressed ri sing public expectations through combination of economic growth policies and carrotandstick political tactics in so doing however it also has planted seed s of potential change chinas

status quo the urban middle class has begun to engage in narrowlytargeted protests against local government policies following over decade of social unrest among wage laborers and rural residents

of several ongoing developments in chinese politics and society central vs local governments many analysts assign partial blame for human rights abuses in china to local officials one the one hand local nd provincial level misconduct often has complicated or undermined central govern ment efforts at reducing human rights abuses on the other hand much of the problem has arisen from the chinese leaderships unwillingness to institute mo re farreaching reforms and its emphasis on maintaining social harmony although the central government has made some progress in enacting laws aimed at curbing the most egregious human rights abuses it has not created institutions that would help enforce these laws such as checks and balances or direct elections for executiv office beyond the lowest administrative levels nor has it allowed for independent watchdog or advocacy entities or groups such as the press human rights lawyers and activists meanwhile many local governments have experienced revenue shortfalls under th economic reforms of the past two decades thereby reducing their ability to provide public services and driving them into collusive relationships with private developers these conditions have been the source of many human rights abus and mass protests of the past several years the prc leadership thus far has been able to avoid much of the blame in many conflicts related to land seizures public health thr eats environmental pollution and other sources of public anger and protest rather than focusing their attention on larger systemic problems aggrieved citizens generally have blamed corrupt local officials for not acting in accordance with the law while viewing central leaders as wellintentioned beijing ofte n has openly criticized or puni shed local officials and expressed sympathy for aggrie ved residents while allowing police to detain or arrest protest leaders70 the central government has applied flexible approach toward mass demonstrations especially in cases in which the press internet or local television stations have gene rated widespread publicity in favor of the protesters71 some analysts argue that mass pressures

weakened and heavily politicized according to some analysts prc legal and institutional reforms could ultimately provide foundations for far reaching social and political changes by nurturing public consciousness of rights and the rule of law and providing framework for the exercise of political rights and government accountability72 the state still wields disproportionate power against citizens and legal activists and continues to interpret the law arbitrarily in many cases however unlike overt and large scale political movements of the past such as the mocracy movement of 1989 which the prc leadership ultimately viewed as hostile many of todays legal activists have managed to survive in gray area in which narrow aims receive grudging or partial legitimacy from the state73 although some experts suggest that most chinese still do not place much faith in the nations courts other analysts contend that prc citizens have rising expectations that the state will honor basic legal rights according to many reports rising legal awareness and th development of laws have resulted in the growth of legal activity especially since 2004 when the prc government enshrined the protection of

party in 199899 crushed n early all hope for fundamental change while growing opportunities for making money travel academic career development and even policy input have he lped to dampen the urgency of political reform some analysts state that the prc governme nt has coopted most intellectuals91 furthermore many chinese intellectuals reportedly are not as enamored of democracy as they once were for various reasons including the view that western efforts to promote democracy in china may be part of an effort to weaken the prc and pessimistic perspectives on political nd economic developments in other post communist countries such as russia ccording to one analyst since 1989 only tiny group of mostly middleaged and older intellectuals has actively pursued major democratic reform92 new communications technologies the prc governments efforts at censoring the internet have been strenuous and effective but not fully successful in 2008 china overtook the united states in terms of the number of internet users with over 220 million people online despite its revolutionary qualities as communications medium the internet has not opened the floodgates of political discourse in china as some had hoped or envisioned nonetheless the internet has made it im possible for the government to clamp down on information as fully as before despite rise in arrests for political crimes since 2006 these arrests reflect the rise of new generation of dissenters who are increasingly well informed about their scant legal rights and more inclined to spread their views using the internet93 beijing has employed variety of hard and soft techniques and approaches to control online content and behavior including electronic filtering regulation of internet service providers monitoring of internet

an estimated 280000 web commentators many of them university students reportedly are employed by state entities to guide pub lic opinion or steer discussion online95 to some extent the internet has proven to be less of political tool than many observers had expected or hoped althoug h vast areas for cultural and social expression have opened up online those who mine the internet for political information reportedly make up small minority of all users greater political information is available for chinese who use proxy servers which help circumvent government electronic filtering or those who frequent english language sites however according to one study less than 8 of internet users in china access proxy servers sometimes to frequently96 chinese online chat rooms and blogs also have been hotbeds of ultranationalist sentiment many major us online news sites such as the washington post new york times and cnncom are frequently available since the end of the beijing olympics voice of americas website gene rally has been allowed although it is still subject to selective blocking however for many of chinas educated elites who are proficient in english as well as gove rnment officials concerned about political control it is not the availability of foreign news to minority of chinese citizens that is important but rather the ability to foment political change on the basis of such information such ability remains substan tially curtailed finally many chinese internet users support the idea of censorship particularly the gove rnments efforts to ban online pornography

years they were restricted then we saw the emergence of personal web sites and after one or two years they were restricted then we had blogs after year or two they moved to restrict them too i think the internet in china will always find way forward because of tec hnology and other factors i am actually very optimistic102 us efforts to advance human rights in china the united states government has empl oyed comprehensive approach toward promoting democracy human rights and the rule of law in china but its effects likely have been felt primarily along the margins of the prc political system some experts argue that us policies of politi cal and economic engagement with china have created necessary conditions in whic h progress in democracy and human rights can be and to limited but significant extent has been made others suggest that us engagement policies have failed not only to produce political transformation but also to set any real change in motion103 in this context some contend us efforts to promote democracy and human ri ghts especially through quiet diplomacy have been largely ineffectual the bush administration and congre ss have pressured china from without through openly criticizing the countrys human rights record and calling upon the prc leadership to honor the rights guaranteed in its own constitution bring its policies in line with international standards release prisoners of conscience and undertake major political reforms pres ident george w bush has appealed personally to president hu jintao to allow more religious freedom and has met with

prc government see below openly criticizing china some analysts argue that the us g overnment should take principled stands against chinas human rights policies mo re frequently and ope nly while others believe that such methods can undermine hum an rights efforts in some situations the prc government generally has reacted angrily when the us government has publicly denounced its policies or defied its wishes for reasons related to human rights in some cases china has made sm all or token concessi ons in order to help reduce or avoid open us criticism104 some analysts suggest that chinas decision to restart the usprc human rights dialog ue in 2008 was related to the us state departments excluding china from its annual list of worst human rights violators while continuing to harshly criticize its r ecord in other cases beijing has responded to perceived us insults in tit for tat manner some observers surmise for example that the prcs sudden denial of port of call to the uss kitty hawk in november 2007 represented at least in pa rt response to the us legislature awarding the congressional gold medal to the dalai lama the previous month the us government has sponsored resolutions criticizing chinas human rights record at the annual united nations commission on human rights unchr meeting four times in the past decade105 members of congress also have sponsored numerous nonbinding resolutions condemn ing or calling upon the prc government to cease or make improvements to various human rights policies these include the imprisonment and detention of prominent political religious and ethnic figures persecution of tibetans and uighurs l ack of progress in the dialogue between beijing and the dalai ma the crackdown on pol itical voices prior to the beijing

constructive and productive discussions on wide range of i ssues assistant secr etary of state for democracy human rights and labor david kramer told reporters that the talks included the following topics prisoners of conscience freedom of religion the situation in tibet the muslim majority in xinjiang and media and internet freedom106 some observers argue that while such talks help to produce positive atmosphere they result in few if any real changes on the ground for example as the bilateral discussions commenced in beijing gr oup of chinese human rights attorneys were detained as they attempted to meet with two visiting members of congress107 others suggest that while the dialogue may produce limited shortterm results the absence of such dialogue redu ces the overall effectiveness of us human rights policies in china108 rule of law and civil society programs united states foreign operations appropriations for china chiefly have supported democracyrelated programs particularly

in the two decades since the tiananmen military crackdown in 1989 many chinese have come to equate democracy with political instability or view it as harmful to economic growth one analyst suggests
