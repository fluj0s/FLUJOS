strategies can include new technologies redesigned engine enclosures replacement engine components entirely new engines or combination of any of the above on may 4 2000 the european union eu adopted new aircraft noise regulation number 99925 that limits the future operation andor ownership of hushkitted commercial jet aircraft within the eu the regulation restricts the addition of hushkitted aircraft to eu airline fleet registry on the above date and it precludes the operation of noneu hushkitted aircraft not already serving the eu on the above date after 2002 as adopted the vast majority of the aircraft affected by this regulation are of us manufacture the united states opposes the eu regulation on several grounds but has nonetheless attempted to negotiate with the eu on the issue for over year on march 14 2000 the united states filed complaint with the international civil aviation organization icao asking that this international aviation safety and regulatory body take action against the eu as result of its regulation although discussions between the eu and the united states continue it now appears that the issue is at an impasse implementation of the hushkit nonaddition rule could result in congressional action in an earlier response to this issue the house considered legislation calling for an end to british air and air france concorde service to the united states more importantly however congressional action on hushkits might result in much stronger future role for the legislative branch on aircraft noise issues which to this point have been the primarily in the domain of the executive branch for the last 56 years the world aviation system has been remarkably stable in the sense that international rules were known well in advance and airlines and other players in the market place could plan for them the hushkit standoff changes that if the eu can unilaterally decide what the standards are for aircraft noise then other aviation regulations could be opened up for unilateral review and revision while the hushkit situation might blow away over time there are other equally important aviation issues confronting the eu and the us such as aircraft

hushkits noise and international trade aircraft noise became major issue for much of the world with the introduction of the first generation of commercial jet aircraft in the 1950s and 1960s early commercial jets such as the boeing 707 and douglas dc8 revolutionized airline travel but they did so at decibel level that often made those living near airports wish they hadnt been invented responding to growing complaints while taking advantage of improving jet engine technology the department of transportation federal aviation administration faa implemented its first noise regulations in 1969 federal aviation regulations part 36 the international body concerned with aviation safety and regulation the international civil aviation organization icao followed suit by adopting similar standards in 1971 icao annex 16 aircraft noise regulation the international aircraft noise regulatory structure in place today is the result of decisions reached through the icao process these regulations adopted set of aircraft noise standards based on performance the standards referred to by the relevant chapters1 in the icao annex are based on various takeoff landing and other operating performance parameters using noise measurements expressed in decibels chapter 1 aircraft included the earliest commercial jet aircraft mentioned in the preceding paragraph chapter 2 standards were adopted by icao as part of its 1971 actions and include the second generation of commerc ial jet aircraft most notably the boeing 727 boeing 737 and douglas dc9 taking advantage of further improvements in aircraft and aircraft engine technology chapter 3 standards were adopted by icao in 1977 in 1990 icao adopted regulations calling for phase out of all chapter 2 aircraft by 2002 at almost the same time the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 ancapl 101508 called for similar phase out in the united states but required that this occur by december 31 1999 aircraft serving the united states are now all chapter 3 compliant the world fleet will become chapter 3 compliant in 2002 chapter 4 at the time chapter 3 regulations were adopted they were viewed as the best technically possible since then however technology has advanced to the point where many specialists believe it would be possible to move to chapter 4 standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs2 2 pl 106181 title vii section 726 by way of example several of the newest aircraft types in production are very quiet relative to early chapter 3 aircraft such as the mcdonnell douglas md80 series aircraft as result significant number of individuals airports and governments have expressed an interest in moving toward new chapter 4 standard of some sort using the icao process committees within the icao structure have been meeting for some time to discuss the aircraft noise issue but have not as of yet been able to reach consensus as to what noise levels might be acceptable in chapter 4 requirement further there is even less agreement as to how chapter 4 regulation might be phased in airlines heavily invested in recent vintage chapter 3 aircraft are loath to move toward any new noise regime that would jeopardize that investment as will be discussed later in this report the hushkit dispute is directly related to the chapter 4 process and the united states and the european union eu are principal players in an ongoing icao process that could address chapter 4 requirements prior to the the scheduled international phaseout of chapter 2 aircraft in 2002 congress has taken position on this international process the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century fair21pl 106513 provides specific guidance for us participation in the chapter 4 implementation debate by directing us negotiators to consider the competitive needs of united states airlines and aircraft manufacturers and protect them from being disadvantaged by potential chapter 4 regulations2 hushkits why and where common but incomplete definition of hushkit is to characterize it as jet engine muffler instead hushkitting as the process is called involves combination of strategies designed to reduce aircraft noise these strategies can include new technologies redesigned engine enclosures replacement engine components entirely new engines or combination of any of the above the decision to buy hushkits is typically an economic one hushkits can be acquired for couple of million dollars or less whereas new chapter 3 aircraft would likely cost in excess of 30 million which is the entry price for the smallest 100 seat commercial jet aircraft currently available commercial jet aircraft have an as yet undetermined life span that can run into decades depending primarily on usage chapter 2 aircraft as mentioned earlier were still in production into the 1980s so significant number of chapter 2 aircraft have still not completed their potential economically useful lives in terms of noise hushkitted aircraft meet chapter 3 standards but in some cases their performance is near the bottom of the acceptable noise range allowed by chapter 3 standards in the early 1990s all airlines but especially us airlines faced with the phased chapter 2 phaseout requirements of anca had to decide whether to buy new aircraft or hushkit at least part of their existing fleets at the time the airline industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs3 3 baker colin and george alan the next chapter airline business march 2000 p 57 4 commission of the european communities air transport and the environment communication from the commission to the council the european parliam ent the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions brussels december 1 1999 p 5was suffering record financial losses for many carriers especially in the united states the choice of hushkits over new aircraft was relatively easy in addition there was some concern that even if the airlines had the funds the aircraft manufacturing industry was not in position to supply all of the chapter 3 aircraft needed before the phaseout deadlines finally the low fuel prices of the 1990s played role in tipping the economic balance toward hushkitt ing and away from more fuel efficient new aircraft for all practical purposes the majority of aircraft that will be hushkitted already are the vast majority of these are single aisle aircraft like the 727 according to recent information 1634 single aisle aircraft have been hushkitted out of total world fleet of 8500 or so aircraft3 of these hushkitted aircraft 1361 were in service in north america primarily in the united states 186 were in service in europe and the relatively small remainder were scattered throughout other parts of the world in the last few years several major us airlines have ordered significant numbers of new chapter 3 aircraft some of these aircraft are for business growth but large percentage are replacement aircraft for the hushkitted portions of the airlines fleets hence there is an expectation that significant number of hushkitted aircraft will be available in the used aircraft market place in the next few years an exception to much of the discussion to this point is the air cargo industry air cargo aircraft typically fly much less in an average year then their passenger carrying counterparts as result cargo aircraft have much longer nominal life span used aircraft have been very popular with cargo carriers and the economics of hushkitted aircraft are very attractive to many cargo firms because they can buy them for fraction of the cost of new aircraft and fly them for long time fedex for example was major purchaser of used 727s which were subsequently hushkitted the european initiative airport noise issue appears to be an issue of greater public concern in europe than in the united states airport noise in the european discussion is also bundled into ongoing environmental policy discussions about emissions and greenhouse gases whereas in the united states noise has been treated more or less as separate issue european governme nts claim to be under considerable pressure from large populations living near major airports to reduce both noise and emissions by one estimate 15 of the eus population is impacted by aircraft noise4 the environment plays much larger role in the politics of the eu

2000emissions play significant role in the governance of several european nations and are well represented in the european parliament the chapter 2 phase out deadlines notwithstanding the eu felt need to further demonstrate its ability to deal with the noise issue in the near term the eu has been pushing for adoption of chapter 4 standards for number of years through the icao process and concluded that the us was blocking its efforts5 in the eus words in the european community noise around airports is at the heart of increasing tensions air transport activities are threatened by legitimate expectation of people living around airports not wishing to be faced with further deterioration of the noise nuisance the european community considers it necessary to provide reasonable and shortterm answer to legitimate environmental concerns in order to prevent further proliferation of different local rules at individual airports and thereby ensuring continued growth and stable operating environment for all air carriers flying into european airports the socalled hushkit euregulation targets concerns in relation to aircraft noise at and around community airports it foresees the interdiction for community member states to add aircraft to their registers which meet the requirements of icaos chapter 3 only by virtue of recertification these aircrafts are considerably noisier than genuine chapter 3 aircraft and make therefor disproportionate contribution to the noise climate at airports6 europe as mentioned above has very small number of hushkitted aircraft in its domestic fleets and domestic hushkit manufacturing industry there also exists concern within europe that significant portion of the us hushkitted fleet soon to be made excess by new aircraft deliveries would be shipped to the european market against this backdrop hushkitted aircraft appear to have become the target of opportunity for those within europe seeking short term noise relief with limited eu economic and political cost it also appears that some europeans saw the hushkit issue as way to jumpstart the chapter 4 process the eu hushkit proposal in march 1998 the european commission proposed that the european parliament adopt legislation that would ban the addition of hushkitted aircraft into european airline fleets this regulation proposed that these so called nonaddition regulations should become effective on april 1 1999 for noneu states the non addition rule would take effect in 2002 and preclude the use of hushkitted aircraft not already in their fleets as of the earlier date aircraft not complying with these non addition rules would be denied access to european airports at this time the european parliament approved the ban in midfebruary 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs5 7 european union commission takes action to combat aircraft noise ip98251 brussels march 13 1998controversy over the proposal did not arise immediately there seems to have been delay in understanding the potential implications of the eus action in the united states and in us industry toward the end of 1998 however the issue became very visible and us interests responded angrily to the eu action which was viewed as contrary to international aviation regulation in early 1999 the united states attempted to delay implementation of the regulation and at the same time placate the eus noise concerns by suggesting further discussion on chapter 4 standard these efforts were successful at least in part on march 29 1999 the eu extended the deadline to april 29 1999 to allow the possibility of further discussion with the united states the european parliament adopted the rule on april 29 1999 council regulation 99925 implementation of the rule was delayed however until may 4 2000 thereby providing for temporary respite from the potential trade problems engendered by the regulation performance versus design standards the eu regulation has number of features but seems to rest primarily on two basic premises both of which are controversial in the context of existing international regulation the first of these premises is that hushkitted aircraft are not true chapter 3 aircraft in that they were originally certified as chapter 2 aircraft hence in this view these are recertified aircraft which is classification that the eu contends does not exist within the icao regulatory construct that these aircraft meet the noise performance measurement standards in the regulation does not according to the eu mean that they have to accept them as chapter 3 aircraft this is irrespective of the fact that the eu has at times acknowledged that these aircraft meet international standards although such retrofitted aircraft formally comply with the eu legislation directive 9214eec and the most stringent international noise standards chapter 3 they produce for comparable types of aircraft much more noise than genuine chapter 3 aircraft7 the second premise of the eu regulation is its applicability to hushkitted aircraft having low bypass engines with bypass ratio of less than 30 the eu believes that these aircraft are inherently noisier then the more modern high bypass ratio engines on true chapter 3 aircraft in addition the eu views low bypass engines as environmentally unfriendly because of their higher levels of emissions by using the bypass ratio standard the eu seems to be creating noise regime based on engine design standards rather then the performance standards detailed in icao regulations the eu does not appear to dispute this charge directly ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs6 8 european union aircraft noise the hushkits press information pack brussels march 12 1999 p 3 9 ibid p 9 10 washington letter on transportation in brief hushkits nowhere fast again february 28 2000 p4the eu contends that bypass ratio data is an effective tool for distinguishing noisier hushkitted aircraft and that the data itself is scientifically sound8 the eu further argues that use of bypass ratios does not discriminate against us manufactured aircraft and hushkits but applies to certain eu produced aircraft as well finally the eu argues that while bypass ratios may not be specifically mentioned in the icao regulations they have been used elsewhere to identify noisier aircraft regardless of the eus statements however reading of its own documents shows that most of the hushkitted aircraft with bypass ratios of less than 30 are of us manufacture9 opposition within the eu surprisingly to some airbus does not support the eu regulation10 airbus is concerned about how the regulation might disrupt the existing international aircraft noise regime it is concerned primarily that its airline customers want certainty that is that they will be able to use their aircraft to their fullest economic potential without fear that the actions of one nation or group of nations might interfere with this goal omega air of ireland is engaged in the installation of hushkits on boeing 707 aircraft for the air freight market and has been for some time the eu regulation would essentially end the firms ability to participate in this market omega has taken legal action against the eu regulation and has received legal judgements in its favor from both the irish high court and the english high court both of these courts have found that the eu hushkit rule is inconsistent with icao regulations and that provisions of the eu rule may be at odds with eu law as result both national courts have referred the case to the european court of justice for resolution the us policy response the united states believes that the eu is creating an aircraft noise regulatory framework that is at odds with international rules on noise reduction agreed to by the international civil aviation organization icao and that the eu is rejecting the provisions of the chicago convention that have governed international aviation since 1944 as written by the eu its legislation applies almost exclusively to aircraft and aircraft engines produced in the united states as mentioned earlier all major aircraft engine hushkit producers are us firms all european airbus aircraft are chapter 3 certified there are also major european hushkit producers as result thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs7 11 european union united states at impasse

done at chicago on december 7 1944 before the council of the international civil aviation organization icao under the icao rules for the settlement of differences doc 77822 march 14 2000 17 punited states believes the legislati on is discriminatory and could cause serious economic damage to us firms in the period since april 1999 the united states and eu met often to try to find some common ground on the hushkit issue in march 2000 it was rumored that the eu and united states were in fact close to settlement the details of which were not specifically known for whatever reason these negotiations foundered throughout 1999 and into 2000 us aviation interests sought formal filing by the united states to icao seeking relief from the eu actions as long as the united states felt that it could achieve resolution through negotiation it held back from this filing on march 14 2000 believing negotiations were going nowhere the united states filed disagreement under icao article 84 provisions the eu has reacted to this filing with regret the eu has more or less stated that it cannot reach any accommodation with the united states unless the united states withdraws its icao action the united states has countered that it is unwilling to drop the filing without some firm action on the part of the eu the result of this situation is the current stalemate in which the us icao filing has gone forward and the eu has implemented its regulation 11 the united states article 84 filing on march 14 2000 the united states filed motion with icao under article 84 of the convention on international civil aviation better known as the chicago convention seeking relief from the eus regulation12 the us case is based on several specific premises including but not limited to that the eu has adopted noise standard that does not comply with icao regulations that the eu has adopted policy that discriminates against aircraft on the basis of nationality of registry and that the impact of the eu regulation has disparate impact on us interests specifically the united states contends that the eus adoption of design standard for noise regulation is completely at odds with the performance standards called for in icao regulations the united states in its filing contends that some of the elements in the hushkit regulations are inconsistent for example there are new chapter 3 aircraft in service with the same bypass ratio precluded by the regulation that are not subject to it the united states believes that the eu regulation clearly discriminates on the basis of the national registry of an aircraft to wit hushkitted aircraft already in servicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs8 as part of an euowned airline fleet are not subject to the regulation and foreign aircraft subject to the nonaddition rules are also clearly identified in effect the eu has created system that can deny access to its markets without regard to the performance of the aircraft such system in the us view clearly conflicts with the chicago convention provisions that countries not create regulations for noise or other aviation activities that discriminate on the basis of nationality finally as discussed in the next section the eu regulation is written in such way that almost all of its adverse economic consequences will fall on us firms from the us perspective the selection of design standard on product not produced in the eu is unfair in its distribution of economic harm and benefit for example the value of hushkitted aircraft that cannot be sold or flown into the european market is likely reduced at the same time hushkitted aircraft with legal access to the european market will at least hold its value and could under some circumstances become more valuable the icao investigation is supposed to last 90 days at the end of that period the united states hopes that icao will provide it with some remedy to the eu regulations potential complication for the us filing however is that the eu itself is not member of icao all icao members are countries hence any redress that might be granted to the united states would apply to the icao member nations of the eu there is also therefore some question about how the icao mechanism can be used to deal with an eu rulemaking economic damage the us aerospace industry has consistently estimated that the eus regulations have cost us industry approximately 2 billion the majority of this sum is for lost hushkit sales to chapter 2 aircraft smaller but nonetheless significant component of this estimate is the decrease in value of already hushkitted aircraft restricted from the eu market by the nonaddition rule the eu and others in the hushkit debate believe that this estimate is overblown and us industry has provided few specifics as to how the 2 billion figure was derived nonetheless it would be difficult to believe that the eu regulation is not capable of inflicting significant economic harm to an industry that has been unexpectedly deprived of access to potentially important market there are many factors that influence the value of used aircraft including age use condition original cost and fuel efficiency the eu hushkit regulation in and of itself may not be the reason that particular aircraft might or might not be sold in the world market the fact is that the used aircraft market is already devaluing older commercial jet aircraft and restricted eu market place cannot but reduce the options of those seeking to sell their aircraft owners of older stage 2 or hushkitted aircraft need to consider this carefully as operating airworthy aircraft b727s b737s and dc9s are worth 2 million to 3 million but as candidates for disassembly the same aircraft falls below 1 million chiefly the salvage value of the engines in the next several years owners whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs9 13 time to face reality mba aviation oracle january 2000 p 19are retiring their remaining b727s b737s and dc9s are going to have to face this fact most of the older aircraft will have value except for parts13 the congressional response there is significant congressional support for the us position on this issue several members of congress have indicated their desire for the administration to take an even stronger position on the dispute for example several members supported an icao article 84 submission well before the administration decided to submit it althoug h congress has yet to complete any specific legislative action on hushkits it has created framework for further action the house acted first on the issue when it passed hr 661 bill to direct the secretary of transportation to prohibit the commercial operation of supersonic transport category aircraft that do not comply with stage 3 noise levels if the european union adopts certain aircraft noise regulations on march 3 1999 the only aircraft that fits this definition is the concorde and its only regularly scheduled routes are between new york and london and new york and paris the bill is viewed by its supporters as way to retaliate for the eu regulations if they are implemented similar bill s 405 was introduced in the senate but not considered on september 27 1999 the house passed resolution hconres 187 that calls on the clinton administration to use all reasonable means to preclude eu implementation of its hushkit ban the senate had approved similar resolution as part of its version of the fy2000 commerce justice and state appropriation s 1217 section 212 the resolution is supported by the us aerospace industries association aia but was opposed at that time by the clinton administration which hoped to ameliorate the situation through further negotiations in addition the aviation subcommittee of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure held hearing on the issue on september 9 1999 witness testimony and the statements of members overwhelmingly opposed the european position hushkits in the context of useu aircraft trade for some members of congress the administrat ion and some in the us aviation industry the dispute about hushkits is part of much larger debate about how the eu appears to support and promote its commercial aircraft industry and more specifically its large aircraft manufacturer airbus industrie in this view the eu hushkit regulations are an element of broader eu policy to give its aircraft industry leg up in the world market or in the words of an executive of us aircraft engine manufacturerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs10 14 comments attributed to ruth

coming from subcontractors stateaid which is limited to onethird of the projects total cost by bilateral agreement would be used to assist the airbus partner firms boeing does not perceive that an adequate market exists to develop an aircraft of this size and is instead studying possible stretches of its 747 aircraft airbus has not yet officially launched the a3xx but is expected to do so later this year some observers believe that the level of stateaid needed for this project would likely violate 1992 agreement on government support for civil aircraft between the united states and the eu in addition to the hushkit and new aircraft disputes there has also been trade friction between the united states and the eu on issues such as aircraft certification especially regarding longrange overwater operation of two engine jet aircraft representative william lipinski ranking minority member of the house aviation subcommittee of the committee on transportation and infrastructure has taken lead role in promoting the view that europe has more on its mind than airport noise in bringing up the hushkit issue at this time the evidence is clear europe is engaged in concerted effort to protect and promote its aviation industry at the expense of the us aviation industry the us government must send clear message that the united states is serious about protecting its aviation industry against unfair unilateral trade actions to begin with it is critical that the us government enforces its rights under international trade agreements we must use all the tools provided by gatt wto icao and other international forums to fight unfair european actions such as unilateral trade restrictions and illegal subsidization practices the us must act quickly and decisively when faced with such intolerable action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs11 16 feldman joan m stalling for time air transport world april 2000 p 47 17 eu hushkit ban could impede stage 4 discussions faa says aviation

congress could follow through on legislation already passed in the house and put an end to british air and air france concorde service to the united states this would deprive the concorde of its only regularly scheduled markets and relegate the aircraft to an unknown longterm fate more importantly however congressional action on hushkits might result in much stronger future role for the legislative branch on aircraft noise issues which to this point have been the domain of the executive branch the eu has pushed much harder for chapter 4 determination in the last half decade than has the united states there are some individuals who perceive the eus hushkit regulations as partial payback for what they view as us obstructionism on adopting chapter 4 standard16 there has been some speculation that the eu hushkit initiative was actually an attempt to jumpstart the chapter 4 process the continued presence of the hushkit debate however may be having negative effect on the eus goal of nearterm chapter 4 decision there is growing us view that it will be hard to separate the two issues as part of the icao process17 the airport noise and capacity act of 1990 anca mentioned earlier in this report as the basis for us phaseout of chapter 3 aircraft also contained prohibition on new airport noise regulations affecting specific aircraft noise restrictions in exchange for date certain move to an all chapter 3 us fleet the eu hushkit regulation contains similar provision european airports already impose host of differing operating restrictions on hushkitted aircraft such as curfews and european airports also impose different ial landing charges on noisier aircraft practice that is not permitted in the us airports even in the us are not enamored with hushkitted aircraft and put pressure on governments to limit their operation it appears that european airport operators have played significant role in formulating the eu hushkit regulation it would also appear that these same airports are well positioned to take action on their own to possibly price hushkitted aircraft out of their respective markets regardless of the long term outcome of the hushkit dispute it should be pointed out that not everyone views the hushkit dispute as an important issue morten byer agnew firm that specializes in the valuation of commercial jet aircraft believes that the market for hushkitted aircraft especially at the moment is quite small18 they also believe that the eus fear that large number of hushkitted aircraft would be added to the eu or noneu fleets serving european markets is overblown with large numbers of chapter 3 aircraft on order worldwide it seems unrealistic to expect that the demand for hushkitted aircraft would increase significantly at the same time httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30547crs12 in the spring of 2000 the united states and the eu are essentially locked into their respective positions by national political considerations given the current environment it seems unlikely that either side is in position to make the first move to reach settlement on the issue the icao process seems likely therefore to run its course if the united states wins its filing it is unclear as to how icao could provide suitable remedy for hushkit industry that has already sustained noticeable economic damage if the eu prevails it is quite possible that the actual road to chapter 4 as mentioned above will become more tedious as each side cautiously considers its long term political and economic needs for the last 56 years the world aviation system has been remarkably stable international rules were known well in advance and airlines and other players in the market place could plan for them now the eu may have opened pandoras box if just little with its hushkit regulation if the eu can unilaterally decide what the standards are for aircraft noise then it isnt far stretch to consider other aviation regulations that could be subject to the whims of national political expediency while the hushkit situation might quiet down over time there are other equally important aviation issues confronting the eu and the united states such as aircraft trade with the hushkit spat as backdrop these areas of dispute become potentially more volatile
