emeter reads and arc breaks lecture given on 17 july 1962 6207c17 shsbc170 shsbc170 renumbered 189 17 jul 62 emeter reads and arc breaks this tape was included in the solo cassettes as well as in both the old and new level 3 cassettes 65 min clearsound checked against the old reels omissions marked begin lecture applause thank you well i just gave all the instructors infraction sheets so you should be very cheerful they get on this stuck flow you know they keep giving them out and giving them out and they get to point where if you dont give them few why theyll snap terminals well good to see you few of you look like youll survive great percentage and this is what this is the 17th audience 17th 17th july ad 12 first lecture saint hill special briefing course we have three new students here this evening john morrised stand up and long time fcdc dofp wayne rowar and somebody whose been in telexes from london since lord knows when nicki mendoza okay well nothing much to talk to you about tonight youre all straightened out on everything and got it all taped and im glad to see that im glad to see that as soon as you get some glasses and some magnifying glasses theres some possibility theres some possibility that your focal distance can coincide with the point of the needle so dont despair dont despair mary sue had speed flash system going they teach them how to read in the united states these days with flash system you throw shutter and it gives you hundredth of second two words at hundredth of second and youre supposed to be able to read those in that hundredth of second and so forth and everybody flunked it so were making some progress were making some progress at least we know now people cant see thats development all right lets look at something very banal something you know all about you can relax your mind lets look at the subject of meter reading and arc breaks relationship between model session june 23rd ad 12 as amended amended by the havingness being dropped out of the beginning rud gives us weapon which exposes all else as soon as we use that model session and repetitive rudiments repetitive beginning rudiments and repetitive prepchecking weve actually stripped the technology down to very easy and very positive performance its very easy to do these things theyre not involved youre not worrying about having to form what questions youre not worrying about this and that actually there are plenty of forms around to give you zero questions for this pc and that and you yourself dreaming up what might be wrong with the pc can also dream up lists of zero questions for some particular pc which you should be able to do and the culmination of all that is the eradication of technical variables and theres nothing there in the model session or its procedure or anything connected with what you are doing verbally and so forth with the pc that is open to very much question oh you can argue around as to whether or not you get in the end the middle ruds by repetitive check or by fast check before you check the zero and you can contend that if the middle ruds were clean then you shouldnt have to recheck the zero which you should do you should recheck the zero always lot of questions can come up but frankly none of these things are capable or susceptible to arc breaks capable of arc breaking pc or susceptible to creating arc breaks its smoothed out to such point that performance done oh relatively indifferently would leave pc improving gaining coming on up the line and it exposes the simplicity of this existing technology also the simplicity of routine 3ga theres nothing complicated about 3ga exposes just one thing and thats meter reading you take all of these constants and you find out that you do them fairly well you see you dont have to do those perfectly to get result you should be able to do them perfectly you should be able to put on good show but you shouldnt have to do them perfectly you see in order to obtain result i mean the technology is very powerful that particular approach to auditing is very powerful and it leaves to view only one potential error tr 4 in one form or another theres tr 4 phenomenon connected with the meter and the meter if poorly read or only once in while read wrong operates to throw tr 4 out in the session see the pc has present time problem and the auditor looks straight at the needle and says after hes said do you have present time problem do you have present time problem do you have present time problem and it got to that point where the pc says thats it and then he looks at the meter and he says do you have present time problem and the thing falls off the pin and the auditor says do you agree thats clean see misses the read out goes tr 4 see thats out the window bang gone why well the pc has an answer which the meter hasnt acknowledged as far as he can see remember hes looking at the back of the meter and as far as he can see the meter has not acknowledged it he then can start to get mad at the meter but usually he isnt sufficiently clear thinking or directive enough to get mad at the meter he doesnt quite know what hes getting mad at and so he usually assigns the cause of his upset to something else this assignment to something else all the time is of course why what meter does in session if misread has been obscured for so long of course the meter did perfectly good tr 4 but the auditor interpretation or failure to read the meter does bad tr 4 and you get the same thing as though the pc had originated and the auditor didnt get it so therefore youve hung the pc with missed withhold similarly the pc sits there do you have present time problem the auditor says do you have present time problem do you have present time problem do you have present time problem finally the pc says thats it uh thats it and the auditor looks at the meter and he says ill check that on the meter and says do you have present time problem and honest its falling at an even rate you know that disturbance of any kind whatsoever and it just keeps on falling at this even rate there is absolutely change to the needle whatsoever and the auditor says whats that whats that what was the problem what is the problem and the pc says well there isnt any problem and the auditor says ive got read here see pc says what could it be and then he says well i havent got problem and by this time the needle is reading an arcbreak characteristic so he just says do you have present time problem bang the meter goes you see every time bang you see do you have present time problem bang do you have present time problem bang see he cleaned clean and the only way hes going to get this off now is to ask if hes missed withhold the random rudiment sometimes the pc doesnt interpret it just like that if you were to say has my asking this question upset you and he answers it and says yes yes it sure has the read would then come off and itd be clean again you see now whats this all about whats this all about basically only one thing is occurring and its an old law which has been pretty well obscured however through the years and has not come up much with importance the importance has never really been assigned to this its been cruising around inside of scientology technology for ages and ages and ages and that is you mustnt acknowledge lie actually you get yourself in trouble every time you acknowledge lie you accept lie as the truth that makes you fool guy rushes up to you and he says the whole of central downtown has just burned down and its all up in smoke and 1655000 people have been killed and you say oh good heavens good heavens good heavens how terrible how awful or faint away or something like that not stopping to realize that there arent 1655000 people in the town or in the whole state for that matter and he says hohohohohohoho good joke good joke youre fool haha now whats this all about very simple prime postulate lets start learning to interpret things from routine 3ga that makes your clears and theres not much question about that in fact theres question about it the only time weve seen them held up is when the exact original specifications of routine 3ga were not rigorously slavishly and fantastically closely followed for some reason or other when i sat down to write the four lines out for routine 3ga i scribbled them out as the potential and i thought this will probably have to be varied for pc after pc and you know the only pcs that have gone clear are those who have exactly been run on those exact lines the first four i wrote you get any variation on it your needle will stick tone arm goes up everything goes to hell thats sort of an oddity its an oddity in the first place the goal was probably originally framed in amharic or lingua spacia or something like that you know and to hit the semantics of it right dead on the button and have that the only one that leads to free needle is quite remarkable ill give you the datum although this isnt lecture about it its want who or what would want exact statement of goal who or what would these are not in sequence who or what would not want exact statement of goal who or what would oppose what is it the participial form the ing form of the goal and who or what would not oppose the ing form of the goal and it just has to be that it isnt anything else you cant say the goal soandso who or what would want the goal something or other something or other thats the way its working out i mean its fantastic and this makes it look very silly lets get the goal not to eat pie who or what would not want not to eat pie is the wording of the line there is other wording who or what would not want not to eat pie makes sense to the pc beautifully and who or what would oppose not eating pie see thems the words thems the magic words and lets take this silly shift of pronouns to kill myself lets say is the goal see who or what would want to kill myself auditor sits there and reads to the pc all right any more items here who or what would want to kill myself its fantastic i mean you cant say to kill yourself you cant change the goal that much so you can apparently horse it around all you want to to agree with the english professors and miss clearing thats apparently the magic code on this sort of thing and its doubly upsetting because you miss all the right items and they become missed withholds then so the tone arm goes up and sticks and everything goes up and messes up and so forth and the session is hell to run and cant hold the pc in session you drive home in your mercedes and feel like going off the curve but its just nothing but the slavish followingin of those lines well i expect someday therell be an well find an exception to it it isnt true just because i sat down and wrote those four lines as the first lines has nothing to do with it but nothing else has ever brought free needle were up to about nine now and they all go free on those wordings and on any other wording they dont go free all right i just interject that 3ga is demonstration of the similarity of construction between reactive bank and universe and youve got the common denominator of the construction of something the universe is formed by prime postulate which then alterised makes matter energy space and time maybe someday you can amuse yourself by speculating what that prime postulate might be if enough of you hit it why the earth will start getting spongy but dont let that scare you go ahead and run it out if you get that tough and that strong you could always mock up another one couldnt you anyway the pc has basic purpose or goal and this is indistinguishable from prime postulate he makes them at different stages of the track as he goes along but he hasnt made too many and therefore you get your prime postulate as being the basic building block of reactive bank its the goal its the basic purpose and so forth so that if you have section of the reactive bank of the last trillion years or something like this or some strata of the reactive bank actually it doesnt go exactly plotted against time it goes kind of differently it goes fundamentally how basic is the basic purpose see and thats sort of liable the first time to skim off what looks like the basic part of the whole time track in actual fact youve got though the basic purpose has occurred before earlier track and thats all sort of condensed in and its become part of this cycle so your basic purpose isnt something you can plot back on the emeter and find and blow you see i wont go into any ramifications of that particularly but theres this postulate see now the prime prime postulate would be the basicbasic of the goal or purpose on which everything else would be stacked youre not going to get it the first crack out of the box so dont worry about it you just take what you can get on goals list now the keynote of the formation of mass and spaces and everything else connected with the bank that is the reactive bank the keynote of it is alteris and then the alteris suppresses down into notis now you see the postulate is an is and then you get an alteris and then you get notis then you get the formation of matter energy space and time contained in the bank now that is the most succinct brief correct workable demonstrable statement of the structure of the reactive bank and man and also in the field of the physical sciences is the most direct and correct statement of the formation of the universe its demonstrable in other words the human mind merges simultaneously with the universe see youve got the parallels of their construction and evolution in other words the field of the mind is now on parallel with your scientific sciences because of course there is the field of the mind and then there is the universe not as everyone tends to believe first there is the universe and then some fleas come along and light on it and develop their mental aberrations it does not go this way it goes quite the reverse and you have thetans and they develop reactive banks and then you get as result of this the formation of universes the old technical data from way back ones own universe and the environmental universe and all that sort of thing now thats quite important thats important data for any being to actually discover this data or start using it is fantastic see because its totally in violation of mass its in violation of energy its in violation of space in violation of time so on youre not supposed to do that slaves of the world succumb you know youre not supposed to fly in the teeth of this kind of thing you find out information like that how would people like the pope and so forth make their coffee and cakes see i mean be pretty grim lot of unemployment would result you know think of chain manufacturers bankrupt them look at political contracts for the constructions of jails and prisons up in smoke percentage for the politicians ruinous terribly revolutionary doctrines here see now you want to know what starts the downward spiral on this sort of thing and how it gets denser and denser and denser is the acceptance of an alterisness as the fact now that is actually and basically what thetan knows way down deep that he must not do and what every thetan that ever got himself in trouble has done he knows he must not accept an alterisness of the fact as the fact he gets nervy when he starts to suspect this and if he accepts too many of them he goes into an overwhelm hes overwhelmed by lies and therefore people who buy oh i dont know lets take the worship of the god wuggywug or something like that hes made out of mud and sticks in the middle of the venusian jungles or something and this god muggymug and if everybody protests this god enough and protests the lie enough and if the priesthood of muggymuggy is sufficiently brutal and overwhelmish and if they can collect to themselves enough overt acts you see its very very important theyve got to collect motivators see get other people to commit overt acts against the god muggymuggy see and everybody commits more and more overts against muggymuggy and after while of course gets totally overwhelmed by the god muggymuggy you see and after that you dont get sane course of evolution from that point of acceptance of the god muggymuggy see you get zealotism fanaticism atheism everything that happens from that point tends to be chaotic see because they have fought an untruth see theyve fought an alteris of the facts muggymuggy did not make the venusian mud see but thats the prime declaration of the religion of muggymuggy oh muggymuggy thou who hast madeth the mudeth see these birds used to get out in the morning and storm around and wake everybody up long before they were supposed to get wakened developed fast days nobody was supposed to eat you see games conditions games conditions and so forth and before you ate dinner why you were supposed to go out and heap some mud on your plate in respect to muggymuggy you see these things thetans didnt like to do so of course they would get protesting against muggymuggy and then this untruth would overwhelm them i use that quite deliberately because it has been religion which has been the strongest arguments and the strongest mechanisms which have brought about an alterisness of the mind and form have been religious mechanisms you might even say its religious universe and they get protested against most strongly and thetans get overwhelmed by them the most easily and so on this just isnt my bigotry talking one way or the other i listed it out the other day it burned holes in the paper and then found out that i felt the same way about it afterwards very interesting the facts here are creation assignment of and you notice muggy muggy created mud and some or youve got somebody like kali the goddess of destruction or something like that but they have something to do with cycle of action the great popular gods see and its all an alteris kali had nothing to do with creating anything and neither did muggymuggy see thats the alteris is the assignment of who created it so that naturally is the biggest alteris that you could make is the alteris of source so therefore thats what the most powerful overwhelms succeed the most powerful protests and of course theyre in the field of the seventh and eight dynamic and well its not for nothing that every year there were hundred thousand christians killed in alexandria during the early days of christianity that sounds impossible see but yet the rosters and records do contain that fact in any single year there were more christians killed in alexandria by christians than there were in all of the roman purges its interesting see they protested harder amongst themselves than they ever really protested against anything else and thats because theyre wrapped up in lie see theyre wrapped up in an alterisness of the fact of creation and its hard to talk to you about this because even as i speak some people hearing this are still so enthralled in their overwhelm and protest along these particular religious lines on the seventh and eighth dynamic that they say oh god listen to what terrible blasphemy and that couldnt be true you know it starts off all the alteris on an automaticity in their head and they say well hes just antithis and antithat im not anti anything except like any other rightminded thetan im kind of antialteris this is your most fruitful source then of lies and commotion would be anything that had to do with creation and you introduce an erroneous assignment of creativeness or actually less strongly any part of the cycle of action misassign see who created it say something else created it and youll get randomity all out of proportion to everything heres kick for you sometime go into an art museum and look at rembrandt and point out to your companions in loud voice particularly during an exhibition whitetie exhibition or something like that point out to your companions in very loud voice the wonderful work done by picasso and man youll have riot on your hands theres other people standing around they will come over and they will correct you and they will argue with you and they will look at you with terrible contempt theyll become very misemotional about the whole thing the guards and that sort of thing are liable to come up and start trying to eject you or all kinds of unlikely things will occur you know you look at the cavalier or something like that and you say now that actually is very excellent example of picassos brown period and go on and hold forth in great dissertation or go over to the royal festival hall or some such area the music hall and start talking outside when you hear oh theres something by mussorgsky you see and you say now thats by stephen foster youll get upset alterisness of the source of creation is the most fruitful source of upset and commotion because of course it itself is the father of all chaos if theres any chaos in the universe or any lack of order it will be found by reason of misassignment of who created it were liable to get so little upset on the subject of founders of countries and that sort of thing well we say george washington the founder of his country see well nobody will much argue with you you dont get in much of stink i bet you could sit around for hours in the states in various popular and public places and say george washington founded you know his country you could go on and do this and do this and do this and nobody would ever do anything they never say anything it was generally accepted to be fact and it more or less is fact you see and youre going to get commotion thats all well if you said marco polo founded the united states of america people would simply think you were insane but if you came almost on the truth see and said alexander hamilton founded the united states of america and was its first president you know everybodys brains would go kind of creak creak you see its not you know he was at least alive at the same time so its recognizable alteration the truth of the matter is that probably anything wrong with the united states right now its george washington now youll get an argument about that because its so much accepted to be truthful otherwise see the guy tore up the minutes and records of the constitutional convention they were never published he made sure they were burned nobody has been able to interpret the cockeyed constitution since and they keep changing it and changing it you know and trying to amend it and wondering what people meant by it and so forth and nobody can find out because they threw it all away see thats fact you know there were do you know there were minutes of the constitutional convention ever published and i dont think it was until way into the nineteenth century sometime or another that somebody released book on his demise which gave something i think hed been the secretary of the convention he gave some of the data and you got an operating machine now called constitution which nobody is supervising and its starting to alteris and itself was an alteris and its kind of going out of hand and nobody can quite make any sense out of it and the citizens have less and less liberty but they dont quite know what to do about it you see back in 1905 somebody changed the constitution said the poll tax could not any longer be charged thats what it used to say well they wiped that out so now they can charge income tax everybody is fined for making living and all kinds of wild things proceed you see from this point well of course there were records to say why they had this you know there were none of the arguments as to why this existed or was put in by the constitutional convention you see arguments were available to anybody to refute this proposed amendment to the constitution about 1905 see heres missing data of some kind or another and heres george well what did george stand for what did he mean what did he want everybody was perfectly happy at the time of the revolution they were perfectly interested in him they thought he was nice guy everything was fine everybody believed him the only reason the revolution got anyplace at all was because of george terrific figure of man this guy had the country in his grip actually he had to protest many times against becoming king of the united states see everybody wanted to make him king he said we dont know what his basic purpose was see we dont know what the basic purpose agreed upon by all the founders of the united states was we read the propaganda which issues from their writings give you some kind of an idea the united this is not quite political but the united states naval academy issues the letters of john paul jones and this is the most flagrant example i know of their booklet on the letters of john paul jones is what they want every midshipman to become and frankly they make bunch of clowns out of them because theyve excerpted all these letters the true letters of john paul jones without anything cut out of them show you very lively sort of bird who was all over the ship all the time and believed in all kinds of things and was very enterprising and fantastically energetic and who had many opinions and who believed naval officers should have opinions and all kinds of things you see that have now been carefully cut out of the letters before theyre published for the budding young naval officer in return we get the stark patriotic statement you see we dont get that you ought to teach midshipmen to dance see thats all missing theres an alteration here see theres an alteration to the goal or the basics or the fundamental now he was the founder of the american navy i wont say anything particularly against the american navy theres reason to it exists but if i see one more ensign become admiral fattened on the letters of john paul jones excerpted im afraid ill be impolite to him i have been known to have been impolite to him already because he isnt true see he isnt real theres something missing reason to analyze whats missing but basically the fundamentals of his education have been alterised the things which he ought to know and understand arent there and that alone would break him down into sort of an apathy he would sort of smell the missingness in there see he would see theres something he didnt quite understand or wrap his wits around and therefore he would never really spring fullarmed into sailor of war you see thered be something restraining his going forthness hed tend to solidify right in his tracks you could expect him then to be rather defensive rather unimaginative perhaps little frightened and very very careful of what he did wheres the bold sea dog that you normally think of as ruler of navy you see well hes not to be found hes got fantastic alteris on his educational line everybody thinks well you should teach these boys to do this and to do that and you should teach them some more of this and you should teach them some more of that and some more of this and alteris it and alteris it and alteris it and when we get all through well have it all alterised and itll all be wonderful youll find itll just get more solid more apathetic and more quit basic purpose alterised creates mass but similarly it creates degeneration of tone inevitably creates degeneration of tone now some of you think once in while that i have alterised in scientology and dianetics far too much well if you think that hard you dont recognize that were running independent of the sequence of time were running backwards track in other words were cutting into the most fundamental fundamental that we can cut into regardless of the continuous forward progress of time you see and were swimming against the time stream in actual fact all right we suddenly come up with this and on isolation of importances discover that were back in 51 52 you see basic purpose you know basic postulate whats the prime postulate of the universe book one book one actually december 1949 not even 50 is basic purpose in book one see isolation of important materials and shedding off the unimportant materials and occasionally going down culdesacs occasionally getting into blind turns you know and say what are we doing here wonderful example is 3d criss cross i received cheerful dispatch saying after weve trained all of our students here to do 3d criss cross is it all right for them boy they had an air letter going out of here so fast its edges were charring dont do 3d criss cross man why well it actually came just before i found out about prime postulate you see so you do 3d criss cross line or anything like prehav line see thats the ridge that i ran into just before i found prime postulate see i thought you could go on and list enough interesting things happened about listing to demonstrate that listing was quite process but it also demonstrated that it makes hell of lot of difference what you list and you mustnt list anything at random and you must never list wrong goal because it just adds more alteris to the bank so 3d criss cross was actually alterising the pcs goal unless oh god million to one chance that he should have his goal in one of the lines ten million to one all right so weve been in little culdesacs and that sort of thing but note i pull out of them in an awful hurry and cut to more fundamental fundamental and youre in the happy state right now of being on plateau of this particular character that is just the data of late spring and early summer 1962 see and it makes package all by itself and youll get this special checksheet that contains the bulk of it and ive just issued policy letter for staff training around in central organizations which with few more items added is just the last few weeks of development is all that contains and thats their staff training checksheet and nothing else see and you unfortunately picking up gae possibly think to yourself that you are being victimized by being put on this special checksheet and it probably hasnt been pointed out to you that you all have to pass this checksheet anyhow and naturally if you get gae theres time for you to study on the checksheet so youre not really being assigned the checksheet because you got gae youve all been assigned the checksheet whether youre going on auditing or not thats modernization but its plateau youve hit it suddenly and i havent put up very many electric light bulbs and that sort of thing around or fired off many rockets but im at point where what am i going to write for bulletins see interesting state for to be in so im refining bulletins and reissuing the bulletins and today did you policy letter 17 july on the exact prepcheck for listing goals or lines its nice prepcheck its all for its all the slotted lines you put the pcs name at the top of it and then you just run the prepcheck down you make out form every time you do prepcheck see just line after line slot after slot and you get each one of those nulled and turn it over and get the rest of those things nulled and youve done listing prepcheck and yesterday did your goals prepcheck how do you check out goal it just does it on this form and so forth oh i suppose well go along little while and find out that theres some other button we ought to add to the thing and reissue the prepcheck thats about where you stand now because you stand at the pinnacle of success see it is happening and im not making any allowance at this particular time of whether you find it easy to learn how to do this or not im making allowance for this whatsoever im just saying well you can learn it im not just throwing it off but because i dont know any other road around it see i know way to proof the technology up so that you will longer have to run an emeter see i dont know how to do this i tell you how far away we are on research i am actually researching some sort of technology that if you kicked off from earth or it billiardballed under atomic fission or something like that you wouldnt have to make an emeter in order to clear somebody see thats the echelon of research i have just entered into and then improvement research improving the thing or this very highflown what the hell do you do about that oh i dont know i might crack it and i might not all scientologists have slight anxiety of what if i kick the bucket how much of the information would i pack along with see they all have this so what im really trying to do is make out the information package you take along with you but theres about where we stand now as far as alteris is concerned weve done this incredible thing of while going forward on the time track weve run the fundamentals back all right now were at fundamental that runs out everything weve put on the time track you see anything developed in scientology or in dianetics is now runoutable by the exact technology which you have it runs itself out rather easily it can be put together in other words all right so much for that unless you follow some such operating pattern as this you then cant backtrack this terribly complicated thing called structure matter energy space time whether reactive mind or universe you cant backtrack this terrific complexity to sufficient simplicity to be able to do something about it you see well thats what weve done weve brought it back now and we find out great surprise surprise to too you see whats wrong with it the pcs goal that isnt whats right with the pc thats whats wrong with him see george washington is not what is right with the united states its what is wrong with the united states see that was pretty weird its complete whizzer weve had whizzer run on us you see this guy goes on being loyal being loyal being loyal being loyal and he goes on being lot of other things and he doesnt know what hes doing wrong hes doing something wrong and hes caving in and falling on his head and unable to do his job and betraying everybody and eventually we sort out his goal and we find out its to be loyal see that was probably the goal of benedict arnold if the individual is longer able to adequately do something its probably his goal if he isnt happy about doing this thing see you got goal to harpoon whales well youll always be thinking about harpooning whale and always missing or unable to find boat or find whales or something itll be the one thing that kind of makes you sigh and that you retreat from see lot of things haywire about this its very dangerous to tell you this because its slightly invalidative of your goal you see but nevertheless i have to tell you its the truth of the thing now let us consider the goal finite truth now it isnt completely true that the goal is everything that is wrong with the person what is really wrong is the alterisness of that goal if the person never alterised the goal he would probably be all right you see now you can say whats wrong with him is his goal but its little bit too short statement whats wrong with him is the alteris of his goal the alteration of his goal the departures from his goal line his inabilities to commit this goal to action see that is what gives him his bank but you strip the goal out from underneath all this and the bank disappears and you find out he didnt need the goal in the first place which is all quite interesting well consider that goal then finite truth you probably dont think so but this is still lecture on arc breaks and tr 4 its finite truth it was truth to this pc it was actually self postulated truth and it never got acknowledged but all around him lies got acknowledged and this baffled him and if you listen to thetan for while youll find out really all hes protesting is the fact that lies get acknowledged but truth doesnt see if you listen to him for while thats really all hes talking about whatever else hes saying or however hes putting it whether in the demosthenian oratory and logic or matter how colorfully or how dully or how whinishly or how meanly or how grandly he is putting it thats what he is saying he is saying truth never gets acknowledged and lies always get acknowledged some woman comes in and she says and i lost my husband and there i was good homebody and i was sitting there doing everything i was supposed to do you see and so forth and he left for this little flirt that would never cook and would never do anything you see and youll hear her going on and on along this particular line in some shade of gray of this argument she the wife you see was not acknowledged and she was true wife but this flibbertigibbet that he ran off with you see well he bestowed his whole fortune on her and she was nothing but cockeyed lie see and you just look over these various things and you can generally trace through an argument these threads the protest of the acknowledgment of lies and the failure to acknowledge truth and that is the basis of thetans misemotion these are the principles above his goal in back of his goal and around on which all thetans operate there are exceptions to this they all operate on these same buttons you press chord major and you get chord major and therefore when you say to thetan in session i am not acknowledging or taking up the truth he gets upset and thats cleaning clean read and when you say to thetan that hes got something he hasnt got he gets upset or that when he hasnt got something hes got he gets upset because youre doing an alteris of the facts hes got present time problem you read the meter and tell him he doesnt have one hes upset its violation of the true state of affairs see youre acknowledging lie here and not hitting the true state of affairs so the thetan doesnt have present time problem and you tell him hes got one once more youre acknowledging lie and failing to acknowledge truth and he gets upset and theres nothing makes thetan get more upset than that its alterisness and there you get into all kinds of wild messes with thetan now do you see how prime postulate has connection here and how it is definitely and intimately involved with reading the wrong meter read see you just hit right to the middle of his thetanesque soul with dagger of betrayal see hes got present time problem you tell him he hasnt got one you didnt acknowledge him did you all right he hasnt got present time problem you tell him hes got one everything goes to hell from there on he gets very upset because thetanesquely he now wants to convince you of the truth of the situation hes trying to impress you with the truth of the situation from that time he then becomes the living crusader of truth capital t sword in one hand torch in the other you know you havent got pc from this point on you have crusader for truth and how do you get into that state well its very simple you just miss meter read you clean clean or wrongcall reaction you get reaction and say theres reaction you get clean and say theres reaction all you got to do is twist these two points and you longer have pc youve thrown him right into his most turbulent areas of action he is now demanding that you do not acknowledge untruths he is now crusading on the basis that we mustnt have more alteris than we already got because its put us in the position we are in youve stepped all over his scientological corns if hes an auditor perhaps but you dont have to have trained scientologist to have this mechanism you go out and you get yourself some raw meat and the fellow sits down and says ive got ulcers all right lets say for fun that he hasnt got ulcers lets say for fun what really is the trouble with him is every day he drinks insufficiently fermented wine and it upsets his stomach and gives him indigestion see and he knows this he doesnt even have to know it up on the surface of his mind you see hes got it all set and he sits down and he says ive got ulcers and you say all right good fine thank you very much you got ulcers all right hmhm well very good now the best thing for us to do for you is to give you some peptobismol or barium meal and so forth and well treat these ulcers and if they dont get better well operate on them hell be mad as hell at you and you wont quite be able to figure out hey whats going on here see guy comes in he has one tenthousandth of an inch of tissue left before perforation see of the ulcer see hes just on the verge you know he can still walk around and hes got ulcers to all intents and purposes man and he comes down and he sits down and he says i havent got ulcers and you say i agree with you perfectly you havent got ulcers and boy he will be mad at you thats why you mustnt treat illnesses because theyre all lies guy comes in says i have sore throat i have sore throat i have sore throat you run something on him and the ridge moves yes his throat is sore that is statement of truth but he says i have cold if he means by that he is being attacked by virus or germs or something of the sort and this is not the case you can get yourself all involved in an arcbreaky situation by making him gargle very interesting wonder the medical profession has to have law to support them do you see this is under the heading of acknowledging the lie and ignoring the truth guy comes in and says he hasnt got ulcers you say ill audit you fine make sure you do so if you say so he comes in and he says i havent got ulcers actually it is just some pains that i get from drinking too much ketchup and you say good i will audit you you enter into the field of what is laughingly called diagnosis youre in trouble but oddly enough as close as you can diagnose is guessing what he has done and running it out as an overt and of course it mustnt be forced on him that he has done it if he hasnt because now youre really in trouble you dream up zero question how about blowing up railway depots hes never been near one in his life and then insist that he find the overt oh man that session is going to go round and round and round youre going to be in trouble all the way all right now during the war he was lightbomberforce bombardier and he was specialist in blowing up railroad stations in fact hed go out practically every night and blow up another railroad station see and you say have you ever blown up railroad station thats null we will go on to the next question well everything kind of goes whirry and wheely in his skull the cogs start to mismatch and boy he gets mad he gets upset he gets misemotional because of the same mechanism he has blown up railroads it isnt that youve failed to discover something about him its just that it isnt true see youve said all right you havent blown up railroad stations when he has or youve said all right youve blown up railroad stations when he hasnt either way youre acknowledging lie and failing to acknowledge the truth and youre on the direct line of thetans favorite protest through the ages and out of this you get an arc break and thats what an arc break is it is an abandonment of truth and an acceptance of lies and after that you got trouble so when you misread meter youve hung the pc with one or the other thats why you got to be able to read meter every time and never miss because every time you miss youve entered into the session the thetans favorite boogeyman the acknowledgment of lies and the ignoring of truth and you have just entered this into the session and after that he blows his stack and he doesnt really know why his eyeballs keep going out foot in his face and snapping back into the sockets you see but he knows hes upset and its the most fundamental upset there can be since out of that upset comes the whole construction and reversely the whole destruction not only of universes but of his own reactive bank and youve hit right on the primary principle of construction of the reactive bank and of the universe and youve hit right on why it is that way and he doesnt like it being that way and you have made the session agree with all of the slave tricks that have ever been pulled on him so therefore he has to protest against you and up to that moment you were his friend that was going to get him out of all this and now youve pulled the trick that got him into all this you see youve acknowledged the untruth and you have failed to acknowledge the truth and that was the trick that got him into all this in the first place so he doesnt want to be in there again so he tries to get out of that session sometimes very loudly so thats why meter reading has to be 100 percent and thats why there is substitute for good meter reading and thats why in procedure you can occasionally flub misread question do something like that your tr 0 will go out or something like that and you dont upset the session to any great degree at all but brother you just miss that one read it reacted and you said it was clean you have taken bayonet and slashed clear back to the beginning of time with this pc and restimulated every protest hes had for two hundred trillion years so you get violence of course you can learn how to read meter perfectly dont worry about it it is doable all i wanted to show you is the mechanism of what happens when you misread meter and how that compares with 3ga and how your session and sessioning now is totally lined up with the actual principle of the mind you are doing now what the mind is doing youve got it exactly paralleled and so therefore you can spot any error that you commit and the error is merely in that field but the pc protest now is the most fundamental protest that thetan can make in session because you are doing exactly in session the parallel of what the mind has been doing and therefore you are at extreme truth this whole session youre running extreme truth and that pc can feel it he knows youre running extreme truth and then carelessly you introduce the needle that didnt react and you say it did you introduce the needle that reacted and you said it didnt and into that extreme truth you introduce this untruth and after that youve got hell to pay thats why pcs arc break and thats the direction that you have to take to repair sessions you have to repair these introductions of untruth okay thank you end of lecture _
