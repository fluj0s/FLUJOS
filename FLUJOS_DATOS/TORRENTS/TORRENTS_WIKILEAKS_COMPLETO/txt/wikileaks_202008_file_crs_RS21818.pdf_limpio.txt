gaining independence after the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 uzbekistan has been led by its former co mmunist leader islam karimov it has made little or progress since then in democratization market re forms and respect for human rights and has regressed in some areas acco rding to many observers the world bank reports that the quality of life for most of the population of twentyfive million the largest of any state in central asia has improved little or deteriorated in terms of healthcare education housing and income the karimov government has moved harshly to stifle dissent by jailing and torturin g thousands of alleged political opponents and islamic extremists according to the state departments country reports on human rights practices for 2003 uzbekistan has suffered several terrori st attacks in recent years aimed at overthrowing the karimov government in 1999 car bombings occurred in tashkent the capital several hundred susp ects were detained and seve ral dozen were convicted on charges of belonging to the islamic moveme nt of uzbekistan imu terrorist group in late 1999 and late 2000 islamic extremists led by the imu launched attacks against kyrgyzstan and uzbekistan but were repe lled another expected attack in 2001 was presumably preempted in part by the imus focus on assisting qaeda and talibanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21818crs2 forces in fighting against usled coalition forces the activities of the imu and other terrorist groups based in afgh anistan were disrupted by coalition forces according to the state departments patterns of global terrorism 2002 but kyrgyzstani and other observers have warned that the imu and othe r groups recently may be regaining strength recent developments series of bombings and armed attacks began in uzbekistan on march 28 2004 and continued through april 1 in the bukhara region west of the capital of tashkent large explosion occurred at house where bombs were being made killing dozen or more reportedly hundreds of pounds of ingredients for explosives as well as islamic extremist literature were discovered there during the night police apprehended suspect carrying several bombs in tas hkent and two police posts in tashkent were attacked on the morning of march 29 two suicide bombers blew themselves up at the chorsu bazaar where some antikarimov protests had occurred in past weeks one of the suicide bombers apparently targeted group of police at the bazaar killing or injuring about dozen some of these police may have been involved in the reported beating death of an aged shopkeeper the previous day th attacks continued on march 30 with car bombing at police checkpoint and an arme d siege between militants and police near residence of president karimov just north of taskhent reportedl killing about two dozen people on the night of march 31april 1 spect in tashkent tried to elude police and hid in house where after siege he blew himself up another explosion in the bukhara region occurred on april 1 which uzbek official s attributed to relatives of the bomber who was killed in the explosion on march 28 in response to the attacks uzbekistan cl osed its borders cancelled public events and closed schools in tashkent and booste d the number of checkpoints and police patrols reportedly many people stayed home or left tashkent uzbekistans tightly controlled media prevented most independent news and the government released little information on the attacks the dearth of news appeared to contribute to apprehension among many citizens the main sources of information were russian and foreign broadcasts president karimov asserted in nationally televised interview on march 29 that the attacks were aimed against his government in order to cause panic among our people to make them lose their trust in the polic ies being carried out and to obstruct our work fbis march 30 2004 doc cep155 he suggested that evil terrorists had coordinated and pl anned the operations for months and claimed that they were directed from abroad to investigate the ttacks he announced that he had formed commission composed of officials from the inte rior police ministry national security service and procuracy he also stated that he had mobilized similar commissions in all regions districts and towns and called on neighborhood groups and citizens to unite like fist to prevent these acts from spreading some believed that karimov appeared to sanction the torture of susp ects by asserting that the att ackers would be brought into the light if need be by pulling their ears russian newspaper alleged that uzbek police already enraged by being targeted d been given permission to use force against suspects kommersant april 1 perhaps responding to international cr iticism karimov on april 7 stated that he had cautioned his security forces to stop indiscriminate detentions ap april 7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21818crs3 prosecutorgeneral rashidjon qodirov on april 9 announced that preliminary investigation had shown that hizb uttahri r ht an islamic f undamentalist movement ostensibly pledged to peace but banned in uzbekistan in league with the imu and other terrorists had carried out the attacks dismissing views that ht was pacific he asserted that seized documents indicated that its goal was the forcible overthrow of the karimov government and the establishmen t of caliphate he alleged that secret ht cells had been operating since 2000 and received instructions and financing from foreignbased emir whom he would not identify he reported that large caches of improvised explosive devices chemicals for bombs firearms and ammunition d been discovered in the tashkent and bukhara regions and that seized computer f iles indicated that some ht members had received training in pakistan and other countries he assured uzbeks that over 1000 people had been interrogated nd that several dozen had been formally charged with involvement in the attacks he stated that the government had made use of extensive lists it had compiled of suspicious individuals to screen several women were arrested in early april after they protested against the rearrest of their husbands who had been released from prison on amnesty but presumably were still on the lists in the wake of the bombings the uzbek branch of hizb uttahrir allegedly issued statement on april 2 accusing the government of having launched new crackdown on the group after defense secretary donald rumsfeld vi sited tashkent in late febr uary 2004 nonetheless it denied that its members had retaliated by attacking the government on april 9 previously unknown islamic jihad group claimed responsibility for the attacks justifying them as blows against an infidel uzbek government that tortured and imprisoned muslims implications for uzbekistan theories about the causes of the attacks in uzbekistan center around strikes against authority by disgruntled citizens perhaps supported by internati onal terrorist groups or coup attempt by part of the ruling elite some observers w ho view the attacks as signs of disgruntlement suggest that some po litical opponents or religious muslims who feel they are not able to worship freely may be targeting their perceived oppressors and committing suicide to draw attention to their plight other observers attribute the attacks to anger over unrelenting poverty or the recen t tightening of border controls over trade that harmed the livelihoods of many people uzbek activist surat ikramov the head of the independent human rights initiatives group in tashkent reflected these views by suggesting on april 6 that the apparent targeting of the police was protest against the regime pakistani journalist ahmed rashid likewise suggested on april 1 that the attackers may have intended to publicize their cause and gain adherents on the other hand exiled opposition erk party head mohamma d solikh while deploring the attacks argued on april 3 that the attackers may have been hoping to trigger nationwide revolt against the repressive karimov some obser vers speculate that such plan may have been foiled in part when the explosion in bukhara on march 28 prematurely exposed it solikh and some other political and religi ous opponents of the government even have speculated that the government arranged the attacks in order to justify new crackdown uzbek officials insisted that the attacks were orchestrated from abroad arguing in part that suicide bombings were unusual in uzbekistan however instances of self immolation are not unheard of these usually involve young women in personal distresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21818crs4 but one case in february 2004 in western uz bekistan when police taunted man even after he set fire to himself to protest their extortion may have helped spur the recent attacks against police according to some observers uzbek foreign minister sodiq safoyev and other officials also argued that the attacks represented international terrorism aimed at governments that support coa lition actions in iraq and afghanistan one variant of the theory that elite gr oups may be battling for political power centers around karimovs alleged illness and contention between the ministry of internal police affairs and the ministry of national security according to this theory one elite group or another may have ta ken advantage of the attacks if not tacitly supported them in order to undermine comp etitor for power or to seize power in case the attacks triggered popular uprising however there is as yet little evidence that major personnel shifts within the government are occurring the aftermath of the attacks has witnesse d tighter censorship of media and other increased human rights abuses according to some observers they note that the government tightened limits on foreign media reporting and particularly criticized russian reporting that might be more accessible to uzbeks they warn that by blaming ht karimov may aim for even harsher repression of religious and political dissidents prisons already contain nearly 6000 alleged members of ht and others punished for religious and political reasons accord ing to the state departments country reports on human rights practices for 2003 evidence of new repressi on included ikramovs report on april 6 that largescale detentions ppeared underway including of whole families the nongovernmental organization human righ ts watch on april 14 condemned alleged arbitrary arrests and torture by uzbek secu rity forces in the wake of the attacks most countries and international organiza tions have appeared to sympathize with uzbekistans efforts to apprehend the attackers and few publicly have criticized alleged abuses of human rights during these efforts more generally uzbeki stans reform failures led the european bank for reconstruction and development to announce on april 6 that it would sharply limit its lending to uzbekistan it cited th failure to register opposition political parties the continuing torture of detainees and prisoners media restrictions and inadequate payments to cotton farmers implications for us interests according to the state department uzbekistan is key strategic partner in the global war on terror and consistently suppor ts us foreign policy goals however it also states that uzbekistans poor human rights record complicates bilateral relations congressional presentation for foreign operations for fy2005 in her testimony on april 8 to the commission on terrorist attack s upon the united states national security advisor condoleezza rice emphasized that pr e911 administration initiatives included increasing counterterrorist aid to uzbekistan major us c oncerns in the wake of the violence in uzbekistan include increased instability that could affect the security and future of the coalition base at karshi khanabad k2 reduce coalition access to afghanistan by air or ground transport and he ighten the danger of the leakage through or from uzbekistan of sovietera weapons of mass destruction wmd technology or knowhow before the attacks the washington post march 25 had reported that the administration might be evaluating kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan for longterm access to military facilities for em ergency training and stagin g by rapidreaction forceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21818crs5 the attacks in uzbekistan might affect th is evaluation during his february 24 2004 visit to uzbekistan defense secretary donald rumsfeld stated that there were plans for permanent us bases in central asia but that issues of us basing strategy worldwide had been discussed including po ssible operating sites where the united states and coalition countrie s could periodically and in termittently have access and support the us government eschewed early judg ments about the attacks but seemed to defer to uzbekistans view that international terrorists threatened the peace after the first bombings on march 29 the white house c ondemned the loss of life and vowed to cooperate with uzbekistan nd other partners in the gl obal war on terror to defeat terrorists wherever they hide and strike the us embassy on heightened alert status as result of earlier threats suspended some operations the state department issued new public announcement on march 30 warning us citizens that the imu qaeda and the eastern turkistan islamic movement remained active in the region and that the groups have expressed antius sentiments and may also attempt to target us government or private interests in uzbekist an on march 30 secretary powell called the uzbek foreign minister and offered us aid in the investigation of the attacks the state department on march 31 seemed to downplay reports of police abuses during the terrorist investigation by stating that weve got to balance the need for respecting rights liberties and the rule of law nd moving decisively against rror but also added that it doesnt need to be an eitheror propositi on president bush phoned karimov on april 2 and reportedly offered condolences to the vi ctims of internationallylinked terrorism and also stressed that the search for the ttackers should comply with the rule of law the united states russia and the regional states have raised concerns that the attacks in uzbekistan could have implications for wider destabilization in central asia such concerns were discussed at regula r meeting of the usrussia working group on counterterrorism on march 31 april 1 with the russian emissary stating that the attacks illustrated the need for closer us russian antiterrorism cooperation the two sides issued statement calling for the central asian states to create financial action task force to combat money laundering that finances terrorism th central asian rapid reaction antiterrorism forces formed by th commonwealth of independent states cis apparently did not respond to the attacks but the cis antiterrorism center announced that it would study the suicide bombings for future prevention russian president vladimir putin reportedly will discuss enhanced antiterrorist coopera tion with the visiting uzbek president in midapril after the attacks in uzbekistan the kyrgyz government stepped up arrests of ht members heightened concerns in the united states that authoritarianism in uzbekistan could be contributing to the growth of islamic extremism as channel of dissent led some policymakers to call for cutting aid that might bolster the regime however other concerns about wmd pr oliferation led the administration at the end of 2003 to waive restrictions on most antiterrorism aid to uzbekistan under authority provided by the national defense authorization act for fy2003 pl 107 314 the ad ministration indicated that uzbekistan d not satisfied congressional requirements to respect human rights as contained in sec1203d6 of the cooperative threat reduction ctr act of 1993 pl 103160 making the waiver n ecessary ctr funds have been used in uzbekistan to dismantle s ovietera chemical weapons re search facility and eliminate active anthrax spores at former test s ite other ctr aid helps keep uzbek weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21818crs6 scientists employed in peaceful research research reactors uranium mines and milling facilities in uzbekistan also pose proliferation concerns after the attacks in uzbekistan the state department stressed th need for continued us strategic engagement and pointed out that secretary rumsfelds recent february 2004 visit had not only involved security coope ration but also his call for the creation of multiparty democracy the state depa rtments performance plans for fy2004 and fy2005 envisage raising uzbekistans levels of democratization and respect for civil liberties as scored by freedom house hum an rights organization but these goals appear elusive according to some observers these observers argue that as long as the united states gives substantial assistance to uzbekistan it will ignore calls for democratization financial times april 1 the washington post april 1 also warned that if karimov perpetuates his police st ate with us support the country would continue to breed terrorists and that antiamericanism among uzbeks would increase congressional concerns about human rights conditions in uzbekistan have been reflected in legislation and other action in fy2002 congressional conferees directed the state department to assure it that defense and financial aid was t being used by the uzbek government to violate human righ ts hrept 107345 hrept 107593 in fy2003 and fy2004 congress forbade freedom support act assistance to the central government of uzbekistan unless the secret ary

planned freedom support aid to uzbekistan for fy2004 is 36 million of which some portion may need to be reprogrammed from central government to civil society or other areas if determination of progress is not possible the state department must also soon termine whether uzbekistan is making progress in implementing religi ous freedom reforms under provi sions of the international religious freedom act of 1998 pl 105292 the act calls for range of possible diplomatic or economic sanctions against countries of par ticular concern that have been designated as hostile toward minority or nonapproved religions and do not reform alternatively the president may wa ive action on national security grounds among other congressional ac tion delegation visited uzbekistan in early april 2004
