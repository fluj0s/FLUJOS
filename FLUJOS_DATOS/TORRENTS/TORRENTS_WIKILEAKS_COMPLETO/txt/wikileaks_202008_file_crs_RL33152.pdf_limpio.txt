through the 1960s congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment key legislative option to ddress this concern was the declaration of national environmenta l policy advocates of this approach argued that without specific policy federal agencies were neither able nor inclined to consider the environmental impacts of their actions in fulfilling the agencys mission the statute that ultimately addressed this issue was the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa 42 usc 43214347 signed into law by president nixon on january 1 1970 nepa was the first of several major environm ental laws passed in the 1970s it declared national policy to protect the environment and created council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the president to implement the national policy nepa required that detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment the detailed statement would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement eis with an initial absence of regulations specifying implementation procedures and agency authorized to enforce the law federal agencies reacted in different ways to nepas requirements some had difficulty complying with the laws eis requirements as result litigation that served to interpret nepas requirements and enforce agency compliance began almost immediately in addition to questions of procedure eg how when or why an eis must be prepared another question was how the environmental policy goals of the act should be implemented or enforced the courts ultimately decided that nepa is procedural statute with twin aims requiring agencies to 1 consider th environmental impacts of their proposed actions and 2 inform the public that they the agencies considered environmental concerns in their decisionmaking process in that capacity nepa has become primary mechanism for public participation in the federal decisionmaking process as it has been implemented most agenci use nepa as an umbrella statute as such nepa forms framework to c oordinate or demonstrate compliance with any study review or consu ltation required by other envi ronmental laws the use of nepa in this capacity can lead to confusion the need to comply with another environmental law such as the clean water act may be identified within the framework of the nepa process but nepa itself is not the source of the obligation theoretically if the requirement to comply with nepa were removed compliance with each applicable w would still be required this report discusses nepas history its provisions and the evolution of its implementation it also pr ovides an overview of how agencies

the 1960s little formal consider ation was given to the potential impact of human activity on the environment be ginning in the late 1950s and into the 1960s the public became increasingly aware of and concerned about those impacts during that time members of congress debated the need for national policy on the environment and for an executivelevel council or committee that could provide advice to the president on environmental policy issues the statute that ultimately addressed these needs was the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa 42 usc 43214347 signed into law by president nixon on january 1 1970 nepa was the first of several major environm ental laws passed in the 1970s it declared national policy to protect the environment to implement its policy nepa requires federal agencies to provide detailed statem ent of environmental impacts subsequently referred to as an environmental impact statement eis for every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation nd other major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment the act also created the council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the president among other duties ceq provides oversight of nepas implementation in 1978 ceq was au thorized by executive order to issue regulations applicable to all federal agencies regarding the preparation of eiss however ceq was not authorized to enforce those regulations as it was subsequently interpreted nepa is procedural statute with two primary aims first it obligates federal ag encies to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of an action before proceeding with it second it ensures that the agency responsible for the action will inform the public what the action is and that it has considered envi ronmental concerns in its decisionmaking process in this capacity nepa has become one of the primary mechanisms through which the public is able to participate in the federal decisionmaking process as procedural statute nepa does not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns above others instead nepa requires only that the agency assess the environmental cons equences of an action nd its alternatives before proceeding if the adverse environmen tal effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated the ag ency is not constrained by nepa from deciding that other benefits outweigh th environmental costs and moving forward with the actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs2 1 ceq is charged with providing oversight and guidance to agencies with regard to eis preparation the environmental protection agency epa is required to review and comment publicly on the environmental impact s of proposed federal activities including those for which an eis is prepared epa is also the official recipient of all eiss prepared by federal agencies however neither agency has enforcement authority with regard to an agencys environmental review requirements most agencies use nepa as an umbrella statute that is framework to coordinate or demonstrate compliance with any studies reviews or consultations required by any other environm ental laws the use of nepa in this capacity can lead to confusion the need to comply with nother environmental law such as the clean water act or endangered species act may be identified within the framework of the nepa process but nepa itself is not the source of the obligation theoretically if the requirement to comply with nepa were removed compliance with each applicable law would still be required unlike other environmentre lated statutes individual agency has enforcement authority with regard to nepas environmental revi ew requirements1 this absence of enforcement authority is sometimes c ited as the reason that litigation has been chosen as an avenue by individuals nd groups that disagree with how an agency meets nepas mandate or ei s requirements for given pr oject for example group may charge that an eis is inadequate or that the environmental impacts of an action will in fact be significant when an agency claims they are not critics of nepa charge that those who disapprove of federal project will use nepa as the basis for litigation to delay or halt that project others argue that litigation only results when agencies do not comply with nepas procedural requirements environmental groups often refer to nepa as the magna carta of environmental law they view it as an essential tool to help agencies plan and manage federal actions in responsible way by requiri ng policymakers and project sponsors to consider the environmental impli cations of their acti ons before decisions are made environmental groups also vi ew the nepa process as an important mechanism in providing the public with an opportunity to be involved in agency planning efforts critics charge that the law creates complicated array of regulations and logistical delays that stall agency action

public concern about the environment in the congressiona l debates that ensued key legislative option considered was the declaration of national environmenta l policy such policy would require all federal agenci whose actions were often seen as significant sources of pollution to adhere to certain environmen tal values and goals advocates of national policy argued that without specific environmental policy federal agencies were neither able nor inclined to consider the environmental impacts of their actions in fulfilling the agencys mission debate also existed regarding the creation of an executivelevel board or council that would gather information regarding the state of the environment and provide environm ental policy advice to the president background and legislative history for at least 10 years before nepa was enacted congress debated issues that the act would ultimately address the act was modeled on the resources and conser vation act of 1959 introduced by senator james murray in the 86th congress that bill would have established an environmental advisory counsel in the offi ce of the president declared national environmental policy and required the preparation of an annual environmental report2 in the years following the in troduction of senator murrays b ill similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and congresss potential responses to perceive d problems in 1968 joint housesenate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the senate committee on interior and insular affairs senator henry jackson and the house committee on science and astronautics representative george miller to discuss the need for and potential means of implementing na tional environmental policy in the colloquium some members of congress expre ssed continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment governor laurence rockefeller participant in the colloquium stated before the joint committee we do not have clearly stated national attitude toward the environment in the areas of civil rights education full em ployment and number of others the congress of the united states has set forth clearly understood national policy this lack of overall national policy has been reflected in recent action of the courts in reversing decisions of administrative agencies on the grounds that they did not give sufficient consideration to environmental factors clearly these agencies need better guidelines3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs4 4 congressional white paper on national policy for the

of environmental policy and s 1752 8 dr caldwell is professor of public and environmental affairs at indiana university and was staff consultant to the senate committee on interior and insular affairs on national policy for the environment 19681970many of the concepts and ideas draw n from this colloquium would ultimately form the basis for the bills that would become nepa for example in discussing new approaches to government senator jackson argued that new approaches to environmental management were required and he urge d the colloquium to provide thoughts on possible actionforcing proce sses that could be put into operation4 the discussion of actionforcing processes to implement national policy provided the seeds of the idea that would eventually become the requirement to prepare an environmental impact statement the bills that would become nepa were intr oduced in the senate and house in 1969 by senator j ackson and representative john dingell5 in introducing the senate bill senator jackson stated that its purpose was to lay the framework for continuing program of research and study which will insure that present and future generations of americans will be able to live in and enjoy an environment free of hazards to mental and physical wellbeing6 to accomplish this end the senate bill authorized federal agencies to conduct investigations and gather data on environmental issues the bill also tablished council on environmental quality to analyze and study the information gathered and to advise and assist the president in the formulation of national policies the senate committee on interior and insular affairs held hearing on the proposed bills7 in april 1969 during the hearing the concept of creating some actionforcing mechanism as means of implementing national environmental policy was again discussed one of the witn esses to provide testimony at the hearing was dr lynton caldwell8 an interchange during the hearing between dr caldwell and senator jackson is considered by some as the point at which the provision behind the environmental impact statement requirement was introduced following are relevant excerpts from that testimony dr caldwell i would urge

within the proposals an evaluation of the effect of those proposals upon the state of the environment senator jackson i have been concerned with the inadequacy of the policy declaration in the bill i have introduced obviously this is not enough it does however provide predicate from which to launch at discussion as to what is required and how we should proceedwhat is needed in restructuring the governmental side of this problem is to legislatively create those situations that will bring about an actionforcing procedure the departments must comply with otherwise these lofty declarati ons are nothing more than that9 senator jackson further discussed th potential of broadening the policy provision in the bill to stipulate general requirement applicable to all agencies that have responsibilities that affect the environment in doing so the senator stated that he was trying to avoid recodi fication of all the statutes10 after the senate hearing senator jackson introduced amendments to the senate bill11 included in the amendments was declaration of nati onal environmental policy another amendment included require ment that all agencies of the federal government include in every r ecommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment finding by the responsible official that the environmental impact of the proposed action has been studied and considered12 emphasis added in july 1969 the senate pa ssed its version of nepa s 1075 without debate and amendments offered in septembe r 1969 the house passed its version hr 12549 by 372 to 15 the following december the conference committee subsequently reported out version containing various additions and compromises in particular in conference the requirement for all major federal actions to be preceded by finding on environmental impacts was changed to the requirement that detailed statement on environmental impacts be prepared the detailed statement would later be referred to as an environmental impact statement eis also included in conference was the requirement that certain federal agencies other than the one preparing the eis be re quired to review the detailed statement it is unclear from the legislative history whether congress intended for the eis requirement to become the central element of nepa compliance that it has however in addition to discussions rega rding the need for actionforcing provisions to enforce the environmental policy the legislative history includes statements regarding the need for federal agencies to consider the impacts of their actions in discussing the relationship of the propos ed legislation to existing policies andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs6

with legislative mandate and responsibility to consider the c onsequences of their actions on the environment13 in late december after minimal debate both the house and senate agreed to the conference report on january 1 1970 pr esident nixon signed nepa into law in the more than 30 years since passa ge of nepa congress has amended the law only to include minor technical changes14 however within year after nepas passage section was added to the clean air act 42 usc 7401 et seq that affected the way nepa is implemented to further clarify agencies responsibilities with regard to public involvement in th nepa process in december 1970 congress added 309 to the clean air act15 provisions of 309 made explicit that the administrator of the newly formed envi ronmental protection agency

concerning alternativ uses of available resources20 this requirement is not limited to actions that require an environmental impact statement section 103 of nepa directs all federa l agencies to review their existing statutory authority administrative regu lations and policies and procedures to determine whether any deficiencies or inconsistencies w ould prohibit full compliance with the purposes and provisions of the act21 after conducting this review the agencies are directed to take necessary measures to make their policies conform with nepas intent nepa also states that its

evolution of nepas implementation nepa is declaration of policy with actionforcing provisions not regulatory statute comparable to other environmental laws intended to protect air water wetlands or endangered species24 it establishes the basic framework for integrating environmental considerations into federal decision making however the law itself does not provide details on how this process

with nepas provisions at all as result litigation to enforce agency compliance with nepas mandate began almost immediately in addition to questions of procedure eg how when or why an eis must be prepared another question ultimately to be determined was how the environmental policy goals of the act should be implement ed or enforced the courts and ceq played significant roles in determining how those questions were answered and consequently how nepa was ultimately implemented the role of the courts in implementing nepa almost since nepas enactment the courts have played promin ent role in interpreting and in effect enforcing nepas requirements25 beginning almost immediately and continuing into the early 1980s the courts emphasized agency compliance with nepas procedural eis requirements but did little to delineate specific compliance requirements connected to the substantive environmental policy goals in 1983 the us supreme court clarified that nepa has twin aims first it places upon an agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of proposed action second it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process congress in enacting nepa however did not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other appropriate consider ations rather it required only that the agency take hard look at the environmental consequences before taking major action congress did not enact nepa of course so that an agency would contemplate the environmental impact of an action as an abstract exercise rather congress intended that the hard l ook be incorporated as part of the agencys process of deciding whether to pursue particular federal action26 this specification of nepas twin aims and the hard look re quirement are often cited by both federal agencies and envi ronmental advocates to articulate nepas mandate in 1989 the us supreme cour t reiterated that ne pa does not mandate particular results but simp ly prescribes process27 if the adverse environmental effects of proposed action are adequate ly identified and ev aluated nepa does not constrain an agency from deciding that other values outweigh the environmental costs the court further clarified that other statutes may impose substantive environmental obligations on federal agencies but nepa merely prohibits uninformed rather than unwise agency action28 in addition to determining the substantiv versus procedural question the courts have determined many specific procedural elements of nepa compliance for example for individual actions courts ve ruled on agency interpretation of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs10 29 executive order 11514 protection and

section below the role of ceq in implementing nepa authority to promulgate regulations to implement nepas provisi ons was not expressly included among the duties and responsibilities give n to ceq under nepa however shortly after signing nepa president nixon issued an executive order authorizing ceq to issue regulations for the implementation of the procedural provisions of the act29 the executive order directed ceq to velop regulations that would be designed to make the environmental im pact statement process more useful to decision makers and the public and to reduce paperwork and the accumulation of extraneous background data in order to emphasize the need to focus on real environmental issues and alternativesand require impact statements to be concise clear and to the point and supported by evidence that agencies have made the necessary environmental analyses the executive order also directed federal agencies to hold public meetings and promote public involvement in the nepa process the executive order did not extend to ceq the authority to make these regulations legally binding on federal agencies therefore they would serve as only guidance for compliance during the 1970s ceq continued to issue guidelines that addressed the basic requirements of eis prepara tion ceq left nepa imple mentation largely to the discretion of federal agencies which were to use the ceq guidelines to prepare their own procedures still many agencies were slow to do so with many initially arguing that nepa did not apply to them30 during the mid1970s frequent complaints were raised regarding the delays that the nepa process was perceived to cause in the decisionmaking process some observers attributed these problems to l ack of uniformity in nepa

nepas procedural requirements ceq regulations do not list specific type s of projects that have significant environmental impacts or definitively define significantly instead the regulations require agencies to determine the significance of projects impacts on caseby case basis based on its context and intensity47 determining the context of project i nvolves analyzing the significance of its impacts to society as whole an affected region affected interests or the locality48 sitespecific project may require analysis of the local significance of the project whereas programmatic action may have nationwide significance the degree of significance may depend on factors such as th location and scope of the project for example the impacts of sitespecific project on 1 acre of 2000acre wetland may be insignificant compared with project that affects 1 acre of 2acre wetland intensity refers to the severity of pr ojects impacts factors used to assess an impacts intensity must be determined on casebycase basis however ceq specifies the following minimum factors that must be evaluated environmental impacts that may be beneficial and adverse the degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety unique characteristics of the geographical area such as proximity tohistoric or cultural resources pa rk lands prime fa rmlands wetlands wild and scenic rivers or ecologically critical areas the degree to which the effects on the quality of the humanenvironment are likely to be highly controversial in this context controversy relates only to the interpretation of the environmental effects of project not to the potential controversy or unpopularity of the project as whole the degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or i nvolve unique or unknown risks the degree to which the action may establish precedent for future actions with significant effects whether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts the degree to which the action may adversely affect resources listedin or eligible for the national register of historic places or may cause loss or destruction of significant scientific cultural or historical resources the degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangeredor threatened species or its

projects pursued by that agency further to adequately determine an impact s intensity input from other agencies may be needed for example if highway will cut acr oss prime farmland the department of transportation dot may need assistance from the us department of agriculture usda to determine the intensity of the projects impacts because degrees of impact must be evaluated to determine project

proposed action for some actions it may not be readily apparent that environmental impacts will be significant some projects clearly have little or significant impact but they still require an agency to demonstrate that the level of impacts was considered to account for this variability ceq regulations establish the following three classes of action which determine how compliance with nepa analysis is documented actions requiring an eis when it is known that the action will have significant environmental impact actions requiring an environmen tal assessment ea when the significance of environmental impacts is uncertain and must be determined actions that are categorically excluded those which normally do not individually or cumulatively have significant effect on the human environment the requirement to produce an eis is probably the most familiar element of nepa compliance however actions requiring an eis account for small percentage of all federal actions proposed in

interest of the public or the environment further they argue that blaming the environmental compliance process for project delays is misplaced one argument is that federal pr ojects may be delayed because resource agencies required by law to participate in the compliance process are overburdened and not sufficiently f unded staffed or equipped to meet the demand causes of project delays attributed to the nepa process delays attributed to the nepa process fall into two broad categories those related to the time it takes to complete required documentation and delays resulting from nepa related litigation in the past particularly in the years after nepa was implemented the preparation of nepa documentation played role in delaying individual federal actions however there is little data available to demonstrate that nepa currently plays significant role in delaying federal actions this lack of data is attributable to the fact that other than the department of energy and very recently dot federal agencies do not routinely maintain information on the time it takes to complete the nepa process therefore gathering accurate data on how long it takes to preparehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs29 82 see council on environmental quality 2005 litigation survey available at httpceqehdoegovnepanepanethtm 83 see council on environmental quality

nepa documentation is generally done concurrently with preliminary project desi gn if project undergoes specification changes those alterations may necessitate modifications to the nepa documentation consequently the time to complete the nepa process may be extended the perception that nepa results in extensive delays and additional costs to the successful delivery of certain federal pr ojects can be magnified when compliance with multiple environmental laws and regulations is required see the use of nepa as an umbrella statute section above the sometimes extensive reviews documentation and analysis required by agencies such as the army corps of engineers the us fish and wildlife serv ice the coast guard and epa as well as various state regulatory and review agen cies add further to the perception that extensive delays are related to the nepa process such delays may actually stem from an agencys need to complete permit process or analyses required under separate statutory authority eg the clean water act or endangered species act over which the lead agency has authority litigation is probably the most often cited cause of neparelated project delays although this may have been the case in the past the total num ber of neparelated cases in the past 10 years has been small especially when compared with the total number of federal actions re quiring some environmental review under nepa for example in 2005 total of 118 neparela ted cases were filed of those 43 resulted in an injunction the majority of cases were filed against two agencies the usdas forest service with 50 cases files and the department of the interiors bureau of land management with 12 cases files82 the main reason that plaintiffs filed suit was because they believed that the eis or ea was inadequate eg information was incomplete or the document did not sufficiently analyze the cumulative or indirect effects of an action nepa litigation began to decline in th mid 1970s and has remained relatively constant since the late 1980s83 this trend may be due in part to improved agency compliance with promulgated regulati ons and improved agency expertise in preparing required documentati on however another factor may be the decrease in the number of federal actions funded by congress that w ould be defined as major federal actions under nepa84 although litigation has decreased agency concern regarding the threat of litigation may still affect the nepa process particularly for complex or controversial projects in addition to ceq regulations and an agencys own regulations

interpretation when preparing nepa documentation in an attempt to prepare litigationproof eis ceq has observed that such an effort may lead to an increase in the cost and time needed to complete nepa documentation but not necessarily an improvement in the quality of the documents ultimately produced85 studies into nepas effectiveness and causes of delays in the past 10 years numerous surveys and reports conducted by both public agencies and private organizations have studied the effectiveness of the nepa process they sought to determine issues such as how the nepa process is implemented at individual agencies whether the nepa pr ocess delays project implementation and if so how those delays ma be addressed and nepa mo re effectively implemented in 2004 survey of staff from the depar tment of defense the department of the interior and the forest service sought to determine the degree to which the nepa process slowed decision making and delayed projects86 the survey identified the following primary reasons for project delays decision maker changes in the project court challenges to project poor documentation that needed to be redone changes in or additions to project alternatives compliance requirements of th endangered species act depending on the agency responding fact ors outside the nepa process were identified as the cause of delay between 68 and 84 of the time in 1997 ceq published study to determine nepas effectiveness and methods to improve its implementation87 study participants included individuals and organizations that were knowledgeable about nepa and could be characterized as both supporters and critics of nepa ge nerally participants felt that nepas enduring legacy was that it provided fra mework for collabora tion between federal agencies and those who will bear the nvironmental social and economic impacts of agency decisions however they also felt that nepa often takes too long and costs too much agencies make decisions before hearing from the public documents are too long and technical for many people to use and training for agency officials is inadequate at times participants felt that critical elements of efficient nepahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs31 88 ibid p 19 89 ibid p 18 90 the nepa task force report to the council on environmental quality modernizing nepa implementation september 2003 and co mments documented by the task force are available at httpceqehdoegovntfindexhtmlimplementation included the extent to which an agency integrates nepas goals into its internal planning processes at an ear ly stage and provides information to the public the study found that the extent to whic h the public is involved in the decision making process also influences the poten tial for litigation the study also found that some states citizen groups and businesses believe that certain eas are prepared to avoid public involvement ie because public meetings are not always required for eas the preparation of an ea rather than an eis is reportedly the most common source of conflict nd litigation under nepa88 the study further found that nongovernmental organizations ngos and citizens viewed the nepa process as oneway communication process skepti cal that their input was effectively incorporated into agency decision making and hypothesizing that their involvement was often solicited after decisions regardin g actions and alternatives have already been made citizens also reported being frustrated when they were treated as adversaries rather than welcome participants in the nepa process citizens reported that they often felt overwhelmed by the re sources available to project proponents and agencies as consequence litigation may be seen as the only means to affect environmental decisions significantly89 the most comprehensive recent study of the nepa process was conducted by ceqs nepa task force in 2002 ceq formed the task force to review nepa implementation practices nd procedures and to dete rmine opportunities to improve and modernize the process the task fo rce interviewed federal agencies reviewed public comments literature and case studies and spoke with individuals and representatives from state and local govern ments tribes and interest groups in 2003 the task force released report of its findings and recommendations90 in compiling its research the task fo rce received more than 739 stakeholder comments those comments reflected current issues and challenges to nepa implementation with regard to delays in and the effec tiveness of the nepa process large percentage of comments were directed at factors related to nepa analysis and documentation requireme nts and to the role and eff ects of litigation according to ceq many respondents expre ssed belief that the gene ral requirement to provide adequate analysis had been taken to an extreme that documents had become too timeconsuming and costly to produce and that the resultant analysis paralysis forestalled appropria management of public lands and ultima tely left the public distrustful and disengaged the stakehol ders felt this was brought on by vague requirements that were open to considerable interpreta tion and therefore an easy target for litigation because the requireme nts were vague those commenters further felt that agencies were not sure how much analysis would be considered adequate by the courts resulting in pr essure to produce morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs32 91 robert smythe and caroline isber nepa in the agencies 2002 report to the natural

fo r change were directed to the ceq nepa task forcein contrast other respondents felt the analysis paralysis scenario was misnomer these respondents believed that agencies often predetermine the outcome of the planning process that they often fa il to consider other reasonable alternatives and that the analysis agencies provide is often inadequate to support the management plan they propose these commenters felt that the environmental effects of proposed actions are often inadequately considered particularly the cumulative effects that agencies rely on inadequate or outdated data and that agency research is not held to the same rigorous standards as research in other fields particularly in terms of scientific reference and peer review moreover they felt that agencies are sometimes intent on following predetermined course of action and ignore concerns submitted by the public with regard to the role of litigation number of respondents felt that litigation only results when agencies do not comply with nepa requirements some felt that it is only through litigation that concerned parties can get agencies to recognize their concerns and give serious attention to the environmental effects of their proposed actions one issue discussed in the task force report was challenges faced by agencies with regard to budget training and staffing constraints this issue is discussed in more depth in report cited by the task force that was prepared by the natural resources council an envir onmental conservation organization that report surveyed 12 federal agencies to determine how they implemented the nepa process91 included in the report was finding that due to budget and staff constraints most agencies nepa offices lack an ongoing national tracking system to monitor the numbers and types of nepa documents that their agency is preparing or has completed also the report found that agencies we re unable to document their nepa workload calculate average preparation times or costs show trends in these factors over time or respond objectively to assertions th at excessive time or money is being spent on complying with nepas requirements the absence of such information the report asse rted leaves agencies in weak position to respond factually to or critically evaluate ad ministrative or legislative proposals to streamline the nepa process see discussion below efforts to streamline the nepa process some members of congress have expressed concerns that project delays are the result of inefficient interagency coordination required for large complex projects as result variety of recent bills include provisions intended to str eamline the nepa process although not defined in any legislative proposal the term streamlining is broadly used to describe legislative or administrative procedures intended to expedite the nepahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs33 92 the term streamlining is also used to refer to administrative or legislative actions intended to expedite the process of complyin g with other environmental requirements such as permitting in this report use of the term refers only to efforts to expedite the nepa process 93 see the council on environmental qualitys number of eis filed with epa by federal agencies for 2006 available at http ceqehdoegovnepanepanethtmprocess92 it usually refers to process or procedures to better coordinate federal state tribal or local agency action wh compliance with multiple environmental laws regulations or execu tive orders is required in 2006 most agencies filed fewer than 10 eiss93 just over 63 of all eiss were filed by six agencies usdas fore st service 144 dots federal highway administration 66 the department of th interiors bureau of land management 42 and national park service 34 the army corps of engineers 56 and the department of energys federal energy regulatory commission 32 it may not be surprising then that many streamlining ac tivities involve actions sponsored by those agencies for example what follows are bills enacted since the 108th congress and selected types of projects for which streamlining provisions have been included the healthy forests restora tion act of 2003 pl 108148 hazardous fuel reduction project s on federal land see crs report rs22024 wildfire protection in the 108th congress by ross w gorte vision 100century of aviation

of 2007 pl 110 114 water resources projects undertaken by the army corps of engineers streamlining provisions are unique to the class of projects at issue however most include some or all of the following elements the designation of specific projects as categorical exclusions the designation of specific agency as the lead agency for allclasses of certain actions eg delegation of dot as the lead agency for all highway or transit proj ects requiring review under nepahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs34 direction to the lead agency to develop coordinated environmental review process to ensure early coordination and cooperation among federal state tr ibal and local agencies required to participate in project delegation of specific authority to the lead agency such as theauthority to establish deadlines for cooperating agencies specify projects purpose and need or specify project alternatives delegation of certain federal authority to state or local agencies eg the authority to determine whether certain classes of projects may be categorically excluded from nvironmental requirements direction to the lead agency to develop dispute resolution procedures if agencies reach an impasse in the nepa process streamlining proposals have generated great deal of controversy among interested stakeholders eg agency representatives industry groups and environmental organizations most st akeholders agree that the process for complying with environmental requirements applicable to complex federal projects can be implemented more efficiently how that should be done and the degree to which it is necessary have been the s ubject of considerab debate some stakeholders such as industry represen tatives who would like to see projects implemented more quickly argue that the authority of lead agencies must be strengthened to reduce delays caused by disagreements among agencies they also contend that lead agencies should have the authority to set and enforce deadlines with regard to the cooperating agency decisi onmaking process environmental groups are concerned that by speeding up the compliance process and strengthening lead agency authority concerns of the public or cooperating agencies will be minimized or ignored in effect rubber stamping lead agency decisions further some environmental groups contend that strea mlining is thinly veiled attempt at weakening environmental prot ection and reducing public par ticipation in the federal decisionmaking process for more information about streamlinin g the nepa process see crs report rl33267 the national environmental policy act streamlining nepa by linda luther conclusion nepa is procedural statute that ong with ceq and individual agencies regulations specifies procedures that mu st be followed in the federal decision making process it imposes requirement other than to require agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their actions before proceeding with them and to involve the public in that process it does not dictate what the decision must be more specifically it does not require the agency to select the least environmentally harmful alternative or to elevate nvironmental concer ns above others the role the courts have played in nepas implementation is arguably more pronounced compared to many other envir onmental laws because of several unique factors these include the initial lack of binding regulations applicable to the eis preparation process the absence of an agen cy authorized to enforce its requirements and nepas requirement to i nvolve the public in the decisionmaking process withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33152crs35 regard to the latter when members of th public oppose project or feel that their opinions are not given sufficient weight th eir involvement may result in turning to the courts to halt the project until their concerns are addressed during the past 35 years interested stakeholders have challenged the adequacy of nepa documentation and agency compliance with nepa in court and in some instances used nepa litigation to try to halt or sl ow projects to which they were opposed as result the progress of some fede ral projects was slowed however particularly in the past 10 15 years the number of projects affected by neparelated litigation is very small also unlike other environmental laws nepa itself cannot stop project altogether this does not mean that during the course of neparelated lawsuit an agency may not decide to abandon given pr oject or project alternative as policy statute nepa supplements other statutes c onsequently agencies often are required to comply with provisi ons of other state tribal and federal environmental requirements before they can proceed with given action this requirement can lead to confusion when pr ocedures to comply with other laws are integrated with nepa compliance and it can give the impression that nepa alone is responsible for the time it takes to obtai n the appropriate aut horization or approval for federal project although stakeholders disagree about the extent to which nepa currently halts or delays federal actions few disagree th at agencies can improve their methods of nepa compliance many elements of recent legislative proposals intended to streamline nepa compliance already exist in ceqs regulations those include integrating nepa early in the planning process integrating nepa requirements with other environmental require ments eliminating duplica tion with state and local procedures swiftly addressi ng disputes with other agencies and establishing appropriate time limits on the eis process debate is likely to continue with regard to if or to what degree furthe r streamlining may be accomplished selected references bear dinah nepa
