exports of fiber yarn and fabric to trade preference regions see crs report rl32895 textile exports to trade preference regions by bernard gelbbackground to avoid confusion over the meaning of the words textiles and apparel it may be helpful to note that textiles can include apparel in some contexts but more technically it refers to yarn andor fabric and some times endproducts such as bed linen towels window curtains tarpaulin tent s etc apparel means cl othing and usually excludes footwear as will be the case in this report also the terms region and regional used in this report refers to the central amer ican countries and the dominican republic the current trade preference program fo r caribbean countries begun as the caribbean basin initiative cbi is one of three regional programs that congress has enacted to ease us trade terms on imports of goods especially apparel and other textile endproducts to spur economic growth in poorer regions of the world2 textile and apparel production us ually play large role in early industrial development us textile and apparel manufacturers have been losing us market share to developing countries at least since the 1960s to provide markets for u s yarn and fabric producers the trade preference programs for the most pa rt require usmade yarn andor fabric to be used as inputs for textile and apparel endpr oducts made in designated beneficiary countries for them to qua lify for trade preference the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa3 as amended is the main legislation for the caribbean program with respect to textiles and apparel cbtpa expanded the cbi preferential arrangements and as later amende d extended through fy2008 preferential treatment for impor ts of selected apparel items the uscentral americandominican republic economic relationship changed dramatically under cbtpa crea ting an environment in which businesses forged strategic partnerships in the increasingly complex regimen of textile and apparel manufacturing in paradigm of coordination components ar routinely produced in countries other than where the endproduct is asse mbled endproducts are produced mainly for export and all are in close touch with each other with respect to us yarn and fabric producers the cbtpa appears to have been successful us domestic exports of fiber yarn and fabric to cbtpa countries which had been rising at least since the mid1990s increased sharply in 2001 and have risen further since then although not as rapidly such exports jumped 80 between 2000 and 2001 and rose 68 between 2001 and 2004 roughly similar pattern holds for most of the individual major fiber yarn and fabric categories as defined in the harmonized tariff schedule hts exported to cbtpa c ountries with cotton fiber and cotton woven fabric and knitted and crocheted fabrics recording the st eepest gains in 2004 these two categories combined accounted for two thirds of us fiber yarn and fabric exports to cbtpa countries exports of special woven tufted and other produc ts in hts chapter 58 doubled between 2000 and 2002 but have since declined table 1 4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22150crs3 table 1 us exports of fiber yarn and fabric

by bernard gelb 6 those countries must provide reciprocal treatment for usproduced inputs under their free trade agreements with other drcafta countries and b agree to certain textile verification procedures on the other hand even though caribbean producers exports of apparel to the united states have been rising table 2 those producers have been losing share of the us apparel market in percentage terms to asian countries because us imports of apparel from there have risen even faster drcafta provisions and objections drcafta would eliminate duties on nearly all originating textiles and apparel retroactive to january 2004 in general to qualify as originating all processing after fiber formation eg yarn spinning fabric production and assembly would have to occur in signatory country or be specified in th agreement in the section setting out the rules of origin through change in tariff classi fication the rules of origin for apparel generally apply only to the component that provides the garment its essential character5 thus major difference between the gene ral criterion for originating in drcafta and the one in cbtpa is that components of textile or pparel product under dr cafta could be made in the region as well as in the united states whereas for the most part they have to be made in the united states under cbtpa also there are number of qualifications and exceptions to the drcafta general criterion including the following while ge nerally requiring that inputs from yarn forward be made in signatory countries fi ber forward is required in some cases the origin of collars cuffs and invisible linings would not be considered in determining whether an item of apparel qua lifies as originating wove n goods made in canada or mexico would qualify as originating subject to quantity limitations and with twopart proviso6 in the cases of few quantita tively important products only one transformation eg from yarn to fabric w ould be needed to qualify as originating textile or apparel good c ontaining one or more of lengthy list of fibers yarns and fabrics considered to be in short supply in the ited states would be treated as originating regardless of the origin of such components for the first 10 years of the agreement the united states would give preferential tariff treatment to limited quantity of cotton and manmade fiber apparel assembled in nicaragua that do not qualify as originating and for the first two years the united states would provide preferential tariff treatment to limited quantity of tailored wool apparel assembled in costa rica that is not originating consequently there have been objections to great extent owing to concern about china which has increased its share of the world and the us apparel markets greatly in recent years for example us companies and workers see the allowance for drcafta countries to use regionallymade components as directly and indirectly damaging to us textile pr oducers indirectly because th ey fear lax enforcement that will allow chinesemade com ponents to effectively enter the united states duty free illegal transshipment similarly critics assert that the special provisions for nicaraguahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22150crs5 7 written submission to the itc by robert du pree vice president may 11 2004 as reported in the us international trade commission report cited in footnote 9 8 us international trade commission uscentral americadomi nican republic free trade agreement potential economywide and selected sectoral effects usitc publication 3717 august 2004 p 28 and 32and costa rica and the leeway to use mexican or canadi an components will result in chinesemade materials entering the united states duty free critics say many chinese made goods already are smuggled into mexi co it is obvious why the exceptions for collars cuffs and invisible linings in dete rmining whether an ite m of apparel would be originating is meeting objections on the other hand drcafta contains safeguard provision specifically for textile and apparel goods applicable during transition period if as result of the reduction or elimination of duty imports of good from another signat ory country increase to the extent that there is serious damage or threat thereof to the domestic industry the importing party may increase or reimpose the duty to specified level impact assessments and industry positions perhaps most important to us dominican republic and central americana textile and apparel producers in asse ssing the potential impact of drcafta is how great any alleged potential illegal chinese inroads in legitimate drcafta trade would be however at this point it is unknown with respect to legitimate tr ade while it is widely be lieved that chinese producers generally have cost advantage over drcaf ta producers the latter have the advantage of geographical proximity that confers lowe r transportation costs and faster turnaround at least with respect to shipping time and given that chinesemade goods still are subject to tariffs the expanded dutyfree access to the us market that drcafta would provide would help drcafta produ cers thus apparel makers in the dominican republic and central america see drcafta as potential help in their competition with chinesemade goods given the option in the agreement for com ponents to be made in nonus signatory countries the option to use mexican and ca nadian components and other provisions us yarn and fabric producers would tend to benefit less than drcafta producers from the advantages cited above abstracting from the china issue the national council of xtile organizations estimated that drcafta would incur annua l losses to the us industry of 10 18 billion7 the us international trade commission itc said that drcafta is likely to result in moderate increase in us imports of textiles apparel and footwear from the cadr region but the increase in us imports of these goods from all sources is likely to be small as cadr goods are likely to displace imports from ot her countries the itc also estimated that drcafta is likely to result in small increase in us exports of textiles apparel and footwear to the cadr region and have negligible impact on us output or jobs8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22150crs6 9 american apparel and footw ear association letter to president george w

american free trade agreement april 13 2005 on the whole us apparel manufact uring companies favor approval of dr cafta while the agreement provides regional apparel producers more flexibility in obtaining materials and other components than allowed under cbtpa us apparel makers see greater advantage in changing th present unilateral preference program to permanent reciprocal economic partnership that by streng thening the economies of the region will maintain their stability and foster predictability for us businesses also they say it help determine whether impor ted garments are made in central america and the dominican republic using us inputs or in some other area of the world using somebody elses inputs9 reflecting the portions of the industry that are more heavily represented in their memberships us textile manufacturing trade associations have differing opinions of the agreement thus the national council of textile organizations and the national cotton council support drcafta10 the yarn spinners in the former group and the various segments of the cotton industry see continue d or even expanded opportunity arising from drcaftas provisions given the yarn forw ard requirements albe it partial and the limited cotton producing capacity of the regiona l countries the american manufacturing trade action coalition and the national textile association oppose drcafta11 with greater representation of fabric producers they see the provisions of the agreement allowing apparel made from regionallyproduced fabric to qualify for dutyfree entry into the united states as potentially diminishing their market in the dominican republic and the five central am erican countries most us textile and appa rel importers which include retailers support approval of drcafta they expect lower prices to result from the agreement enabling them to compete better with goods obtained elsewhere andor sell greater quantities to consumers as consequence of lower prices unite here major union representing xtile and apparel industry workers among others opposes the agreement unite here sees drcafta as potentially costing us jobs moreover drcaftas rules unite says are designed primarily to facilitate and protect foreign investment by large multinational corporations these rules unite adds would make large corpor ations more mobile and less accountable to local communities and governments dramatically shifting the balance of power away from democratically elected governments and towards private companies and increasing the bargaining power of empl oyers visàvis their workers12
