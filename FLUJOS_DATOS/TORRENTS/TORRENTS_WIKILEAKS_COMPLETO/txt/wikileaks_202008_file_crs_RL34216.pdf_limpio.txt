consequently rais additional revenue1 proposals in the 110th congress to require brokers to report adjusted basis on publicly traded securities sold by individuals are examined in this report basis reporting can help clarify the actual amount of capital gains and thus the tax revenue from such gains may rise if capital gain s have been under reported basis is the amount taxpayer uses to determine the cost of acquiring an asset which is used to determine the assets capital gain or loss2 the original cost may have to be altered in order to calculate the appropriate adjusted basis for tax calculations for example the original cost of purchase of stock would be adjusted upwards to account for brokerage fees the internal revenue service irs defines the tax gap as the aggregate amount of true tax liability imposed by w for given tax year that is not paid voluntarily and timely3 the irs defines the true tax liability for any given taxpayer as the amount of tax that would be deter mined for the tax year in question if all relevant aspects of the tax law were correctly applied to all of the relevant facts of that taxpayers situation4 for the 2001 tax year irs estimated that the gross tax gap was approximately 345 billion5 after enforcement efforts and late payments this gross tax gap was reduced over severa l years by an estimated 55 billion to equal net tax gap of 290 billion as reported in 20076httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34216crs2 7 us code title 26 section 6045 and b 8 us code title 26 section 6045 c 9 for an overview of tax gap and tax enforcement issues see crs

2007 p 1current law requires brokers to report annually the na address and gross proceeds of each sale by taxpayer to the irs brokers are also required to report this information to each customer7 the term broker includes dealer barter exchange and any other person who for consideration regularly acts as middleman with respect to property or services8 an individual taxpayers gain or loss is the difference between the amount r ealized on the sale of property and the adjusted basis because brokers are curren tly not required to report adjusted basis to the irs there is thirdparty reporting of adjusted basis consequently the ability of the irs to verify the amount of capital gains and losses reporte d by individuals is limited brokers would incur significant costs in reporting adjusted basis but taxpayers would be relieved of the often substantial costs of calculating adjusted basis to determine capital gains and losses fro m the sale of securities according to the irs thirdparty reporting increases voluntary tax compliance9 for tax year 2001 the government ccountability office gao found that an estimated 84 million out of an estimated 219 million taxpayers or 38 with securities transactions misreported their securities gains and losses10 gao calculated that the most frequent reason for this misreporting of securities gains and losses was the inaccurate reporting of basis of securities sold11 the issue of reporting basis is complicated by the following current computation rules if taxpayer has acquired stock in cor poration on different dates or at different prices and sells or transfers some of the shares of that stock and the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred is not adequately identified the shares deemed sold are the earliest acquired shares the firstinfirstout rule if taxpayer makes an adequate identification of shares of stock that it sells the shares of stock treated as sold are th shares that have been identified taxpayer who owns shares in regulate d investment company ric generally is permitted to elect in lieu of the spec ific identification or firstinfirstout methods to determine the basis of ric shares sold under one of two average costbasis methods described in treasury regulations12 proposal to report basis was included in the presidents fy2008 budget and is discussed in this report the senate finance committ

return of capital distributions for example on the taxpayers basis in those securities22 the proposal would relieve some taxp ayers from making these calculations concerning basis because brokers would be required to provide this information to customers when securities are sold23 some brokers particularly brokers with large portf olios currently provide information about adjusted basis to cust omers other brokers provide partial information or information concerning basis to their customers some brokers may incur additional expenses in mee ting the proposals reporting requirements24 the irs would incur significant costs from altering or creating new forms processing data including matc hing data and storing data25 because the proposal would only apply to publicly traded securities if the cost of compliance is passed onto taxpayers some taxpayers may shift part of their assets from publicly traded securities to other securities and assets some taxpayers may prefer to acquire assets not subject to the requirement th at brokers must report basis information to the irs26 the proposal provides few details about which taxpayers and securities would be subject to reporting requirements27 senate finance committees proposal the senate finance committee drafted pr oposal which is almost the same as the proposal in the presidents budget that brokers be required to report basis to the irs and customers for publicly traded securities one of the advantages of analyzing this draft proposal is the availability of extensive testimony and background documents provided by witnesses at the committees hearing on the proposalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34216crs6 28 senate committee on finance proposal to impose basis reporting requirements for publiclytraded securities june 29 2007 p 3 29 ibid p 4 30 ibid p 5 31 views of selective witnesses before the nate finance committees hearing are presented in the appendix description the senate finance committee descripti on of its draft proposal included the following excerpts the proposal provides that in every ca in which broker is required under section 6045a to file with the irs return reporting customers gross proceeds with respect to any applicable security that broker is required to include in the return the customers adjust ed basis in each applicable security and information necessary to determine the customers holding period in that security the broker also is required to include this information in the statement required to be furnished to cust omer under presentlaw section 6045b presentlaw penalties for failure to comp ly with the requirements of section 6045 also apply to failures to comply with the new basis and holding period reporting requirements the proposal applies to applicable securities acquired by purchase or by other means such as gift or inheritance28 under the proposal every broker that transfers an applicable security to another broker must furnish to that other broker written statement with information necessary to enable that othe r broker to comply with the new basis and holding period reporting requirements the proposal imposes new reporting requirements when actions undertaken by issuers of applicable securities affect the basis of those securities29 the proposal applies to securities acquired after the date that is 18 months after the date of enactment30 legislative implications of witnesses testimony numerous implications for drafting legisl ation to report basi s could be derived from the testimony of witnesses from finance associations at the senate finance committee hearing31 some issues were raised by more than one witness first several witnesses stated that fficient time should be allowed for brokers to implement the requirements necessary to report adjusted basis this time period may be approximately two years after treasury regulations have been written witnesses emphasized that some financial intermediaries would have to develop new systems to report basis and other intermediaries would have to reprogram existinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34216crs7 systems from treasurys perspective additional time to implement the reporting of basis would result in lost tax revenue second two witnesses maintained that the flexibility in the methods of reporting basis should be maintained currently taxpayer may use the firstinfirstout rule or the specific identification rule taxpay er who owns shares in mutual fund may use either of these rules or one of two averagecostbasis methods many mutual funds report basis to their customers usin g an average cost method from the irs perspective requiring the use of one standa rd rule such as fir stinfirstout would expedite the use of cost basis data for irs matching purposes third two witnesses believed that filin g requirements should be prospective based on the date of purchas or brokers should not be held accountable for errors in data on current and prior reports of ad justed basis many brokers do not have records concerning basis and must rely on customers or third parties for information fourth two witnesses expressed oppos ition to extending gross proceeds reporting and thus adjusted basis reporting to corporate customers because the secretary of the treasury already has the authority to extend gross proceeds reporting to corporations without legi slative action if corporations are significant source of noncompliance fifth one witness stated that the volume of transfers of securities would preclude paper transfer system providing brokers with data to calculate adjusted basis hence an electronic system would be necessary another witness maintained that electronic transmission of transfer data should be allowed as an option sixth two witnesses argued that the treasury should have broad authority to implement legislation requiring the reporting of basis these witnesses maintained that the legislative language in the nate finance committees draft proposal did not address many issues such as the reporting of gifted and inherited securities and the reporting of options transactions congre ss could specify many of these issues in legislative language which would re sult in congressional preference being implemented and reduced need for treasury discretion in writing rules seventh two witnesse s maintained that the deadline for filing 1099 statements should be delayed by two weeks which is addressed by s 636 the reduce wasteful tax forms act of 2007 these witnesses ar gue that the senate finance committees proposal would cause such an enormous incr ease in the yearend processing costs for brokers and custodians that the tw week delay would be necessary proposed legislation in the 110th congress two bills were introduced in the 110th congress that focused on requiring broker reporting of customers adjusted basis in securities transactions these bills hr 878 and s 601 had almost the exact sa wording and the

securities cove red securities are generally stock debt commodities derivatives and other items as specified by the treasury secretary which are acquired in the account or transferred to the account managed by the broker the provision applies to stoc k acquired after january 1 2009 and after january 1 2011 for all other instruments this proposal is estimated to raise 427 billion over 10 years 33

or ss is longterm or shortterm longterm capital gains are taxed at higher rate than shortterm capital gains every broker that transfers to another broke r covered security would be required to furnish

addressed effectively finally the flex ibility the current law provides to mutual funds and their shareholders to comput cost basis under any available method firstin firstout fifo specific id entification and average cost in the case of fund shareholders must be maintained we recognize that allowing this flexibility will limit the use of cost ba sis information for internal revenue service

do not pr ovide any cost basis information38 mutual fund provides cost basis information to ll of its shareholders because the fund managers do not have or ca nnot have access to the necessa ry information or are not confident that the information is accurate39 the ici maintains that mutual funds would need sufficient lead time to program their systems to provide cost basis information to all of their shareholders in all circumstances40 the date applicable to basis reporting should be the later of december 31 of the calendar year that ends more than 18 months after the date of

proceeds reporting to corpora tions and can exercise this authority without legislative action if corpor ations are significant source of noncompliance 2 the secretary of the treasury should be granted broad regulatory authority to implement the new reporting requirements and to provide safe harbors uniform adjusted basis calculation rule s simplifying assumptions and limited exceptions if justified 3 the new reporting regulations should be effective for securities acquired 18 months after treasury regulations are finalized rather than 18 months after date of enactment brokers ca nnot develop or modify their basis reporting systems if they do not know the rules they must follow 4 the definition of applicable security should be clarified 5 s 636 the reduce wasteful tax forms act of

its concerns about the senate finance committees basis reporting proposal48 the clearing house states that the pr oposal requires financial institutions to report gross proceeds with respect to s ecurities sold by corporate customers49 the clearing house states that corporate customers of brokers and financial institutions have generally been exempt from gross proceeds reporting requirements the reason is that timing and accounting differences woul d result in mismatches in gross figures being reported to corporat customers and the irs50 hence the clearing house states that the cost to implement gross proceeds and basis reporting on payments to corporations will be prohibitive with fo reseeable benefit to the internal revenue service or the corporate customers51 the clearing house maintains that financial institutions and brokers would be unable to report adjusted basis and holding period information for certain securities such as foreign securities and securities purchased as part of dividend reinvestment program52 the clearing house argues that the proposals requirement that persons transf erring securities to broker provide that broker with written statement which includes data to calculate adjusted basis is inefficient burdensome unmanageable and susceptible to error53 the clearing house believes that the volume of transfers of securities would preclude paper transfer system and necessitate an electronic system54 the clearing house represents large banks that do not collect and send basis or holding period data to their customers hence these large banks would have to develop necessary information systems which would be time consuming in addition large banks are currently integrating multiple information reporting systems consequently the clearing house advocates an effective date for compliance with the proposal of either three years after the da of the passage of the law or two years after the finalization of re levant treasury
