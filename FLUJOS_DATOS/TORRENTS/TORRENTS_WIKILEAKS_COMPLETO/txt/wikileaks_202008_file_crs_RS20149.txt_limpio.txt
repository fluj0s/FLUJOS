and turkey as justification for military intervention in kosovo these two eastern mediterranean neighbors have difficult bilateral relations their overarching goals for kosovo are similar but their views of natos military campaign differ greece opposes natos approach for reasons based on history culture competing foreign policy goals and public opinion its sympathies lie with the serbs turkey

the flames will spread eventually key us allies could be drawn into the conflict the us allies he referred to are nato partners greece and turkey greekturkish relations greece was the first part of the turkish ottoman empire to seek independence in the early 19th century since then relations between greeks and turks have often been strained the two countries were on opposite sides in the balkan wars of 191213 and congressional research service the library of congress crs2 in world war i although both joined nato in 1952 bilateral relations did not reflect their new alliance crises developed over cyprus twice in the 1960s and in 19741 in recent years differences over sovereign rights in the aegean sea have provoked tensions and in 1996 brought the two neighbors to the brink of war2 athens continuing veto of european union eu financial aid for turkey and its contribution to the eu decision to deny turkey membership candidacy caused bilateral relations to deteriorate further they worsened in february 1999 after it was discovered that greece had secretly sheltered turkeys most wanted man abdullah ocalan leader of the separatistterrorist kurdistan workers party pkk at its embassy in kenya turkish officials accused greece of being terrorist state while athens referred to its assistance to ocalan as humanitarian and regretted his capture views of kosovo crisis the overarching greek and turkish views of the kosovo situation are strikingly similar they both favor peaceful resolution of the crisis maintaining the territorial integrity of yugoslavia and the inviolability of regional borders reinstating kosovos autonomy and protecting kosovar albanian human rights both condemn ethnic cleansing their views on the nato military operation however differ sharply greece us officials overlook greeces ambivalence when talking about the united views of the nato alliance3 greeces perspective and policy derive from its history culture other foreign policy goals and public opinion greece has historical ties with fellow orthodox serbs who fought with it against the ottoman turks in the balkan wars 191213 and were greeces allies in two world wars it is especially worried that kosovo might lead to another wider war former foreign minister theodoros pangalos and his replacement george papandreou worked for peaceful resolution of the kosovo crisis greece initially opposed natos use of force without security council mandate later however prime minister costas simitis said that if nato decided that there was reason to get mandate then greece would not oppose nato operations against yugoslavia4 greece has gone along with nato decisions and simitis has tried to convince his countrymen that this policy is in their national interest the simitis government is operating under many constraints in particular it fears that lost investments trade and tourism resulting from prolonged kosovo crisis could prevent its achieving european monetary union emu membership in 2001 it already has revised economic growth projections for this year downward by 5 observed drop 1 see crs issue brief 89140 cyprus status of negotiations updated

at over 600 million then there is the political dimension simitis had been weakened politically due to popular opposition to his economic austerity program aimed at emu membership and mishandling of the ocalan episode although simitis retained his partys leadership at congress in march the conclave disclosed intraparty fissures moreover the public press and orthodox church have condemned natos bombing of serbia and complicate matters for him polls have indicated that over 95 of the public opposes the nato operation anti nato antius demonstrations have been widespread communist demonstrators have temporarily blocked allied military shipments and troops bound for the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom from leaving the port of thessaloniki terrorists have bombed government and business sites belonging to nato members including the united states orthodox archbishop of athens and all greece khristodhoulos claimed that the west hates the orthodox people5 while president costas stephanopoulos observed the entire serbian people which is bravely and proudly struggling for its rights has our sympathy6 many in parliament have criticized the government for going along with nato and some want it to denounce nato paradoxically polls now indicate that the public increasingly approves of the governments statesmanship and that simitiss popularity is rising turkey the ottomans defeated the serbs at the battle of kosovo in 1389 at the cost of sultans life the turks remained in the balkans into the 20th century they have great affinity for and kinship with ethnic groups in the region which the ottoman empire converted to islam foreign minister ismail cem said kosovo is part of our history we share common culture history and faith with the kosovar albanians and turks we have pursued very serious policy in order to prevent kosovo from turning into another bosnia both in bosnia and kosovo turkey sought for the traces of our history not to be erased7 while it favored peaceful resolution to the crisis ankara holds milosevic responsible for what it considers the need to use force in addition turks especially the influential military are loyal to nato with the eus rejection nato is their main organizational link to the west president suleyman demirel has stated that nato must succeed in kosovo8 military role in kosovo turkey turkey is fully participating nato

station us fighters and tankers at airbases in western turkey and on may 17 confirmed that its planes were bombing yugoslavia if nato decides that they are necessary turkey would consider committing

albania greece greece decided not to veto natos use of force but it is not participating in military operations greece has allowed nato to use its ports and fuel lines and greek destroyer is on nato patrol duty in the adriatic sea foreign minister papandreou indicated that greece would provide facilities for the passage of forces to invade yugoslavia10 greece has allowed turkish humanitarian aid flights to use its airspace and would permit transit of peacekeeping forces but it denied transit by turkish fighter aircraft and supply planes greek troops assist refugees in albania and the fyrom greek medical group was the first nongovernmental humanitarian aid organization that belgrade allowed into kosovo greece said that it would contribute to unmandated peacekeeping force if all sides including yugoslavia agree11 greece abstained from voting when the european union imposed an oil embargo on yugoslavia but opposed ship inspections and questioned the legality of possible maritime blockade it also abstained from eutelsat vote to end serbian television use of european satellite greece may have disrupted nato plans to build up forces in the region via the port of thessaloniki by requesting that military personnel and equipment cross its territory from 10 days before until 10 days after june 13 european parliament elections in order to free police for tasks related to the vote prospects of wider conflict wars can have unpredictable consequences and events may occur during the kosovo conflict that could destabilize greekturkish relations at present however despite their difficult history and differing views of the crisis neither greece nor turkey believes that it would be drawn into the conflict against the other over kosovo the greek and turkish foreign ministers met with their balkan counterparts on march 19 just days before the start of the bombing and called on yugoslav president slobodan milosevic to accept the rambouillet agreement since hostilities broke out they have consulted by telephone primarily on humanitarianrefugee issues greece prime minister simitis told european union eu summit that he disagreed that this development could lead to conflict with turkey and said greece is stabilizing force in the area there is reason for anyone to fear that there will be implications with turkey he concluded mr clintons view is not justified by any means12 government spokesman dimitris reppas said that mistaken spillover scenarios did not help ease regional tension13 the greek ambassador in washington made demarche to the state department

president stephanopoulos sarcastically observed that he had never thought that way to avoid possibility of war between greece and turkey would be the bombing of serbia14 other politicians such as coalition for the left and progress leader nikos costantopoulos wondered whether president clintons statement revealed wider destabilizing us plan15 nonetheless prime minister simitis acknowledged that refugees are not just humanitarian issue but political one that could destabilize the region16 he expressed concern that the economies of albania and the fyrom cannot survive the disruptive effects of the refugee influx greece has increased humanitarian aid for the fyrom and albania as well as yugoslavia and lobbied the eu on the issue conflict spillover might occur if many kosovar albanian refugees are settled in southern albanian regions inhabited by albanians of greek ethnicity and clashes ensue17 greece might aid its kin and turkey might aid the albanian government18 however athens resolved earlier albeit less momentous differences with tirana over greekalbanian rights by diplomacy which would continue to be its preferred course of action in another scenario refugees might attempt to enter greece which would repel them by military force prompting turkish forces to aid the albanians greece has secured its northern border with 1000 additional police and while incidents may occur it is unlikely to use force systematically to repel refugees greece hosts over 400000 albanian immigrants and must be sensitive to their possible reaction to the illtreatment of refugees however greece fears resolution that would create an independent kosovo heralding greater albania which would further destabilize the region and could provoke wider war some suggest that greece has territorial designs on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia based on the early 20th century balkan wars but this analysis does not reflect modern greeces selfimage as european state satisfaction with its borders homogeneity and lack of desire to import the fyroms ethnic woes or poverty greeces objection to the fyroms name choice stemmed from concerns about the latters improbable irredentism with respect to northern greek territory not from its own turkey since 1923 the turkish republic has attempted to follow the precept of mustafa kemal ataturk its founder peace at home peace abroad thus turkey did not intervene militarily in bosnia or in the armenianazerbaijani conflict despite public demand19 while turkish officials disagreed with president clintons spillover theory they were charitable in their reaction to it defense minister hikmet sami turk said that the us president simply wanted to point out possible developments20turkish foreign minister ismail cem

nato and fights nato and i dont expect that such situation will happen21 turkey has welcomed kosovar refugees and does not view them as potential problem some 6000 early arrivals were housed with relatives or in reception centers and tent city was erected for the 20000 more other implications greece prime minister simitis told his people that greece continues to cooperate with nato and the eu to avoid being marginalized22 he has emphasized political solution the postwar period and humanitarian issues aims for the day after include security democratization and economic development foreign minister papandreou has traveled widely among nato members russia china and yugoslavia to resolve the conflict he and his czech counterpart developed peace plan to augment that of the g8 industrialized states its centerpiece is 48hour bombing pause intended to spur diplomatic efforts toward security council resolution23 greek officials also are concerned about how their kosovo policy might affect relations with the united states including the us role in resolving the cyprus issue and regarding greekturkish disputes in the aegean and about possible longer term popular alienation from the us they are apprehensive that proserb stance might lead the united states to favor turkey simitis has suggested that greece wants to prevent turkey from using the crisis to enhance its role in the eastern mediterranean and balkans24 greece also wants to avoid perceived proserb position that could detrimentally affect relations with neighboring albania whose ethnic kin are the victims of serb violence turkey turkey hopes to benefit from being reliable ally of the west and humanitarian in the current crisis and to have nato allies compare its conduct favorably with that of greece defense minister turk even suggested that turkeys contribution might serve as an impetus for eu membership25 foreign minister cem has sought more active role in nato decisionmaking however turkey has discovered that european and american opponents of the nato campaign are drawing analogies between the plight of the kosovar albanians and that of the turkish kurds critics question why the alliance had not acted over the years to defend the kurds among other oppressed ethnic groups if it could now intervene to protect the kosovars the kurdistan workers party pkk has been waging an insurgency aimed variously at autonomy or independence in southeast turkey since 1984 and turkeys abuses of kurdish civilians human rights in its counter insurgency activities have been criticized by many including the us state department turkeys insistence on yugoslavias territorial integrity is probably due at least partly to its insistence on its own 21 anatolia march 25 1999 22 reuters april 5 1999
