individual tax cuts will be more likely to be spent if they go to lower income individuals making the tax rebate for lower income individuals likely more eﬀective than several other tax cuts there is some evidence that tax cuts received in lump sum will have smaller stimulative eﬀect than those reﬂected in paychecks but this evidence is uncertain while temporary individual tax cuts likely have smaller eﬀects than permanent ones temporary cuts contingent on spending such as temporary investment subsidies or sales tax holiday are likely more eﬀective than permanent cuts sales tax holidays may however be very diﬃcult to implement in timely fashion the eﬀect of business tax cuts is uncertain but likely small for tax cuts whose main eﬀects are through cash

stimulus in recent years and fiscal stimulus adopted in february 2008 includes rebates and accelerated depreciation for businesses pl 110185 some were included in stimulus tax cut legislation in 20012003 and some of the debate centered on the effectiveness of alternatives among the tax cuts discussed at that time were tax rebates targeted towards lower income individuals speedup tax rate reductions for higher income individuals temporary sales tax holiday temporary payroll tax holiday temporary investment stimulus corporate tax cuts primarily repealing the alternative minimum tax and dividend reductions the 2001 tax cut included rebate and the final version of the 2002 tax cut bill included temporary investment stimulus president bush proposed accelerated rate cuts and dividend relief in his stimulus package for 2003 proposals such as rebates were made by democratic leaders although the economy recovered from the recession issues of fiscal stimulus arose again in the 109 th congress in the wake of hurricane katrina the recently passed tax stimulus included rebates for both low and middle income individuals and temporary bonus depreciation for businesses presidentelect obama has proposed middle class tax cuts of 500 for singles and 1000 for families other components of obamas tax plan include business and targeted tax cuts but it is not clear whether they would be part of stimulus package effectiveness of tax cut for short run stimulus purposes is judged by the extent to which the tax cut increases private demand either consumption or investment spending tax cut that is saved will have short term stimulative economic effect or long term one if the cut is financed by deficit since increased private saving would be offset by decreased government saving thus in general tax cuts received by individuals will not be successful as short run stimulus if they lead to additional saving and tax cuts received by firms will not be successful unless they lead to spending on investment or lead quickly to spending on consumption by shareholders the following four propositions can generally be supported by economic theory and empirical evidence 1 individual income tax cuts directed at lowe r income individuals will likely have larger effect than cuts directed at higher income individuals other things equal this distributional effect suggests that the most effective tax cut would be rebate which is not only flat amount but specifically directed at lower income individuals who did not have tax liability while payroll and sales taxes are more concentrated among moderate and lower individuals than the normal income tax they are largely proportional taxes and the bulk of them w ill still go to middle and higher income individuals most income tax cuts actually exclude the bottom 20 of the population who do not pay income tax unless they are refundable as with the february 2008 cut tate reductions enacted in 2001 are concentrated among the upper part of the income distribution as are dividend and capital gains tax reduction flat dollar reduction if refundable would be more concentrated on lower and middle incomes than tax cuts that reduce rates or allow deductions 2 there is weak empirical evidence that lump sum tax cut is less likely to be spent than one received in small increments eg through wi thholding this effect could make rebate less effective than alternative individual tax cuts if it were not for the distributional evidence however the distributional effect is more solidly grounded in economic theory and is based on more concrete and extensive empirical evidence 3 certain types of temporary tax cuts are likely to be more effective than permanent ones while in other cases they are less effective the most important illustration of this effect is temporary investment subsidy but it could also apply to temporary sales tax holiday or any s

limited duration otherwise temporary cuts are likely to be less effective than permanent ones 4 corporate tax cuts that do not make new investments more profitable are unlikely to have much effect on investment or consumer spending especially when the economy is in recession and the effect of corporate rate cuts is likely small the remainder of this report provides summary of the evidence and economic reasoning supporting these propositions before discussing these propositions however it is important to note the differences between model where individuals consume based primarily on current income compared to those where individuals consume primarily out of permanent lifetime income because much of the empirical analysis focuses on this issue optimal lifetime consumption models imply that consumption is based on permanent income and suggest very little will be spent out of transitory income because it has little effect on permanent income thus temporary tax cut which is the normal mode of fiscal stimulus would be ineffective extensive empirical investigation has rejected this permanent income model in its pure form and suggests that consumption responds to permanent and current income proposition 1 tax cut directed at lower income individuals should have larger effect on spending than one directed at higher income individuals data show that the fraction of income saved rises as income rises for example the saving rate in the top 1 of the income distribution is over 10 times the rate in the lowest 20 and is almost three times the average this pattern is far too pronounced to be accounted for by business cycle reasons and cannot be explained by life cycle patterns and thus itself implies departure from the permanent income model of consumption 1 saving rate that rises across incomes could be expected even in permanent income model if each individual has th same permanent saving rate at any time some individuals may be earning lower than average amounts and others higher than average amounts thus the transitory income would unde rstate permanent income in some cases and overstate it in others since more individuals with unusually low incomes would fall into the lower groups and more with higher incomes into the high groups some pattern of rising saving rates is expected but empirically the effect is far too large to be explained by this phenomenon which can be examined by looking at variations over time for an individual rising saving share with income could also arise from life cycle reasons typically income is low in the early years of life rises during the working career and falls at retirement if individuals want consumption to be smoother than income they will save less when they are young and old and have lower incomes and save more in the middle when they have higher incomes however when examining the data we find that age does very little to explain saving behavior and the patterns of rising saving rates with income persist within age groups aside from these empirical observations there are theoretical reasons to expect that lower income individuals are likely to spend more of an additional dollar of income than do higher income individuals especially in the case of temporary tax cut which is the kind of cut normally associated with fiscal stimulus they may have lower lifetime saving rate because social 1 see martin browning

during instances of bad luck eg disability or old age and because they are less likely to wish to leave bequests indeed for some meanstested programs assets can disqualify an individual from coverage they may have less information with which to optimize over time and if they save at all simply have target amount at least in the short run so that addition income is spent including temporary income increases finally they are more likely to be subject to liquidity constraints that is to prefer to spend more than their earnings and not be able to because they cannot borrow and have assets indeed permanent income theories suggest that for temporary tax cut tax cuts for nonliquidity constrained individuals may have virtually effect while tax cuts for liquidity constrained individuals will be largely spent 2 proposition 2 tax cut provided through lump sum payment may be less likely to be spent than one which shows up in wi thholding but the evidence is weak this differential effect which would not occur in permanent income model was pointed out by the congressional budget office cbo in its studies of the effectiveness of alternative tax cuts3 cbo referred to comparison of results from two st udies that examined the effect of income tax refunds and of expected rate cuts from preannounced tax cuts of the early 1980s4 both studies rejected the permanent income model suggesting some spending effects from transitory tax cut but larger effects were found for the rate reductions there are however two reservations about compar ing these two events to gain insight into the effects of lumpsum tax cuts versus tax cuts reflected in paychecks over time first to the extent that individuals use overwithholding as means of forcing themselves to save one would not expect spending to rise when the refund is received even though it might rise when an unplanned rebate is received thus finding smaller amount of spending out of refund than out of tax cuts reflected in pay checks may not be very meaningful secondly the model assumes that 2 an extensive literature has addressed these issues they are related to the empirical rejection by and large that consumption is solely determined by permanent income as occurs with rational optimizing models of consumer behavior in perfect capital markets as reviewed in brown and lusardi cited above these empirical tests generally find smaller marginal propensity to consume than is indicated by long run economywide savings rates but nevertheless one far above zero some economists have suggested that heterogeneity among consumers is responsible that is that some individuals behave according to the rational optimizing model while the consumption of others is closely affected by current income there is evidence that liquidity constraints play an important role in addition to the review in brown and lusardi above see n gregory mankiw the saversspenders theory of fiscal policy american economic review vol 90 may 2000 pp

insurance and differing propensities to consume across individuals journal of monetary economics vol 36 november 1995 pp 301327 however positive results are not universally found including results in

security taxes both in the american economic review vol 89 september 1999 pp 947958 and 959973 nicholas souleles consumer response to the reagan tax cuts forthcoming journal of public economics studies that have not found effects however have generally excluded or underrepresented low income individuals who are most likely to be liquidity constrained in addition the souleles study may be flawed if overwithholding is used as form of forced savings by low and moderate income individuals and the parker study may be flawed if there are unmeasured seasonal differences in spending by wealth

cuts would be received if there was some uncertainty however the fact that spending did not increase until the tax cut was actually received may partially reflect not the failure of the permanent income model but the lack of certainty about receipt of the cut if differential does indeed exist this effect could make the payroll tax cut and sales tax holidays more effective than rebate however these lump sum effects would have to be offset by the distributional effects discussed in proposition i and supported by considerable empirical evidence for that reason it would be difficult to conclude that payroll tax holiday would be more effective than rebate directed at low income individuals in addition some evidence on the 2001 tax rebate suggested that large fraction of that rebate was spent 5 proposition 3 certain types of temporary tax cuts may be more effective than permanent ones in general the permanent income modeling of consumption even when it does not hold in pure form suggests that temporary tax cuts will be less effective than permanent ones presenting something of dilemma because tax cuts motivated for fiscal policy reasons need to be temporary if they are not to hamper long term growth however temporary tax cuts that depend on spending rather than receiving income are likely to be more effective in the short run than permanent ones during period of slack employment payroll or individual income tax cut is simply temporary windfall which can be spent at any time without any further consequence for the size of the tax cut but if the tax benefit is triggered by spending temporary tax cut will be more effective just as temporary sale tends to induce large response the most common example is the investment tax credit or similar subsidy such as temporary partial expensing of investment but the same would be true of temporary sales tax holiday note that while this feature may make temporary tax cut more effective than permanent one it does not mean that the stimulus is more effective than other alternatives when all factors are considered most evidence suggests that investment subsidies have small effect on investment and that the temporary investment subsidy enacted in 2006 was not very effective 6 and it may be particularly difficult to induce investment even with temporary subsidy when excess capacity exists while firms benefit from the temporary subsidy they lose the benefit of delaying cash outlays if investment is insensitive to these cost effects subsidy directed at increasing consumption may be more effective even if the latter is not the type where the temporary nature provides benefit in the case of the sales tax holiday versus other individual cuts there may be substantial implementation lag in arranging the sales tax holiday since sales taxes are imposed by the states and fiscal stimulus may be applied at the wrong time moreover the anticipation of the holiday should be contractionary that is pre announced future temporary spending subsidy is initially contractionary 5 david johnson jonathan parker and nicholas s souleles household expenditures and the income tax rebates of 2001

more profitable would not have much effect corporate rate cuts are less effective than investment subsidies one proposal considered in the past was repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax with refund of existing credits such change does not necessarily make new investment more profitable indeed it is possible that new investment may be subject to higher tax burdens under the regular rates than under the lower rates in the amt economic theory suggests that the investment decision should be driven by its expected profitability tax decrease not associated with that profitability should have effect on investment rather tax decrease which increases firms cash flow is more likely to be spent on reducing debt or paying out dividends both choices would not expand aggregate demand7 similarly corporate rate reduction which largely benefits existing capital would have modest effect compared to stimulus directed at new investment there is potential constraint however if the firm does not have access to outside capital or finds outside capital excessively costly cash flow might have an effect on investment this effect would be likely however to be focused on small firms and most of the amt is paid by large ones there is some empirical evidence of positive relationship between firm investment and cash flow however interpreting this evidence with respect to the effectiveness of corporate cash flow as stimulus to investment spending during an economic contraction is hampered by two important reservations first in most cases cash flow is correlated with the productivity of investment and investment growth and investment may be responding not to cash flow but to investment outlook secondly even if there is so independent effect of cash flow in normal circumstances then whether an increase in cash flow would induce firm to make new investments during periods of excess capacity is doubtful 8 in any case choice that is more focused on investment such as an investment subsidy would have more pronounced effect than one that is not general corporate rate cuts are less likely to be effective than investment subsidies because they have smaller bangforthebuck because much of their cost is windfall that only affects cash flow and not the return to new investment since even temporary investment subsidies do not appear to have worked effectively corporate rate cut would be expected to have small effect g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy jgravellecrslocgov 77829 7 it is possible that knowledge of tax cut could induce stockholders consumption or that cash flow translated into dividends would do so but this
