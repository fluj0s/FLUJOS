rfa of 1980 requires each agency to develop plan for the review of its existing rules that have or will have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities agencies are required to review any new rules within 10 years of their publication as final rule and to provide an annual federal register notice of rules they have designated for review within the next 12 months the unified agenda of federal regulatory and deregulatory actions is intended to be compendium of agency rulemaking actions within the next 12 months therefore the number of section 610 notices in the unified agenda should provide some indication of the extent to which agencies are conducting the required lookbacks under the rfa it appears that agencies are carrying out relatively few section 610 reviews several agencies have consistently indicated that they plan to issue dozens of rules each year with significant impact on small entities but have published few if any notices of section 610 reviews in the unified agenda the rfa gives agencies significant amount of discretion to decide which rules are covered by the review requirement there also appears to be substantial confusion or disagreement among the agencies regarding what section 610 requires thereby limiting its effectiveness for example some agencies said the statutes underlying their rules had significant impact on small entities not the rules themselves so they did not have to review them under section 610 in july 2007 gao reported that agencies frequently initiated regulatory reviews on their own and those reviews were more effective in bringing about changes to rules than mandatory review requirements like section 610 the poor implementation history of section 610 of the rfa offers number of valuable lessons for current advocates of even broader lookback reviews for any such process to work congress faces the challenge of clearly specifyi ng what rules should be reviewed and how the reviews should be conducted also some means of tracking the reviews congressional or executive branch oversight and meaningful enforcement mechanism appear important to improving the implementation of the lookback requ irement otherwise agencies are unlikely to conduct many more reviews than have occurred pursuant to section 610 legislation has been introduced in the 110 th congress hr 4458 that addresses some of the issues regarding the implementation of the rfa and section 610 reviews this report will be updated when additional information about section 610 or broader lookback reviews become available

interest groups have suggested that congress require agencies to reexamine their existing regulations to determine whether they are still needed or can be made less burdensome1 one model that has been suggested fo r such regulatory lookbacks is an expansion of requirement already in place in section 610 of the regulatory flexibility act rfa of 1980 5 usc 601 612 section 610 of the rfa is the only crosscutting statutory requirement that federal agencies reexamine certain rules after they have been issued2 specifically subsection 610a of the rfa requires each agency to develop plan for the review of its existing rules that have or will have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities section 601 of the rfa defines small entity as including small businesses small governmental jurisdictions or other small organizations the section 610 review plans were to require agencies to review all existing rules within 10 years of the effective date of the statute january 1 1981 and require any new rules to be reviewed within 10 years of their publication as final rule according to the rfa the purpose of the reviews is to determine whether the rules should be continued without change or should be amended or rescinded to minimize their impact on small entities subsection 610c of the rfa requires agencies to provide an annual federal register notice of rules they have designated for review within the next 12 months in essence subsection 610c is an advance notice requirement designed to facilitate public input into reviews of existing rules although this statutory lookback requirement has been in place since 1981 it is still difficult to determine with any degree of certainty whether agencies are consistently implementing it however it appears that agencies are carrying out relatively few section 610 reviews one reason why so few reviews are done is that the act gives agencies significant amount of discretion to decide which rules are covered by the review requirement there also appears to be substantial confusion among the agencies regarding what section 610 requires thereby limiting its effectiveness this report examines those issues and their implications for future regulatory reforms but begins with brief background discussion of the rfa itself

agencies must prepare regulatory flexibility analysis at the time proposed and certain final rules are issued the rfa requires the analysis to describe among other things 1 the reasons why the

october 4 1993 requires covered agencies not including independent regulatory agencies to periodically review their significant regulations to determine whether they should be revised or eliminated however the results of those reviews have not been very impressive see us general accounting office regulatory reform agencies efforts to eliminate and revise rules yield mixed results gaoggd983

significant alternatives to the rule that would accomplish the statutory objectives while minimizing the impact on small entities however these analytical requirements are not triggered if the head of the issuing agency certifies that the forthcoming rule would not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities the rfa does not define significant economic impact or substantial number of small entities thereby giving federal agencies substantial discretion to determine when the acts analytical requirements are initiated 3 also the rfas analytical requirements do not apply to final rules for which the agency does not publish proposed rule4 judicial review of agency compliance with certain provisions of the rfa is available to small entities including section 610 section 612 of the rfa requires the small business administrations sbas chief counsel for advocacy to monitor and report at least annually on agencies implementation of the act 5 the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office has examined the implementation of the rfa several tim since its enactment and recurring theme in gaos reports has been lack of clarity in the act and resulting variability in the acts implementation for example in 1991 gao reported that each of the four federal agencies that it reviewed had different interpretation of key rfa provisions6 in 1994 gao again reported that agencies compliance with the rfa varied widely from one agency to another and that agencies were interpreting the statute differently 7 in 2000 report on the implementation of the rfa at the environmental protection agency epa gao concluded that the agency had broad discretion to determine what the statute requiredeven when epa concluded that rule costing more than 5000 small businesses more than 5000 each did not have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities8 gao reported that in the two and onehalf years after the enactment of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act sbrefa of 1996 which was intended to strengthen the implementation of the rfa epa certified that 96 of its proposed rules would not have significant impact on small entitiesnearly 20 percentage points higher than in the two and onehalf years before sbrefa was enacted two of epas program offices pesticides and solid waste said all 46 of their proposed rules published during this period would not have significant impact on small entities 3 agencies also have discretion regarding other requirements built on this determination for example section 212 of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act sbrefa requires agencies to publish one or more compliance guides for each final rule or group of related rules that triggers the rfa if an agency certifies rule as not having significant impact on small entities compliance guide need be developed see us general accounting office regulatory reform compliance guide requirement has had little effect on agency practices gao02172 december 28 2001 4 many agencies are apparently aware of this limitation the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office estimated that in more than 500 final rules published in 1997 the agencies specifically stated that the rfa was not applicable or that regulatory fl exibility analysis was not required because the action was not preceded by proposed rule see us general acc ounting office federal rulemaking agencies often published final actions without proposed rules gaoggd98126 august 31

clarifying the acts requirements andor giving sba or some other entity the responsibility to develop criteria for whether and how agencies should conduct rfa analyses in 2001 gao testified that the promise of the rfa may never be realized until congress or some other entity defines what significant economic impact and substantial number of small entities mean in rulemaking setting9 in 2002 gao testified that the implementation of the rfa was still problematic and raised even more questions about how the statute should be interpreted 10 for example in determining whether rule has significant impact on small entities should agencies take into account the cumulative impact of similar rules in the same area should agencies consider the rfa triggered when rule has significant positive impact on small entities gao went on to say the following these questions are not simply matters of administrative conjecture within the agencies they lie at the heart of the rfa and sbrefa and the answers to the questions can have substantive effect on the amount of regulatory relief provided through those statutes because congress did not answer these questions when the statutes were enacted agencies have had to develop their own answersand those answers differ if congress does not like the answers that the agencies have developed it needs to either amend the underlying statutes and provide what it believes are the correct answers or give some other entity the authority to issue guidance on these issues 11 similarly in 2006 gao testified that the full promise of rfa may never be realized until congress clarifies key terms and definitions in the act such as substantial number of small entities or provides an agency or office with the clear authority and responsibility to do so 12 gao said congress might wish to review the procedures definitions exemptions and other provisions of rfa to determine whether changes are needed to better achieve the purposes congress intended also gao said attention should be paid to the domino effect that an agencys initial determination of whether rfa is applicable to rulemaking has on other statutory requirements such as preparing compliance guides for small entities and periodically reviewing existing regulations under section 610 on the other hand other observers have indicated that the definitions of these terms should remain flexible because of significant differences in each agencys operating environment for example the sba office of advocacy said that definition could or arguably should be devised to apply to all rules given the dynamics of the economy and changes that are constantly occurring in the structure of smallentity sectors13 in august 2002 president george w bush issued executive order 13272 which was intended to

reports on the implementation of the rfa have only occasionally mentioned section 610 of the statute however in april and may 1992 sbas chief counsel for advocacy sent letters to the heads of at least 83 executive departments and agencies requesting that they provide information on their implementation of section 610 of the 55 agencies that responded 13 said they had published the required plan for the review of their rules the remaining 42 respondents indicated that they had not done so most often saying that none of their rules had significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities in 1994 the chief counsel told gao that sba did not follow up with these agencies because sba had authority to compel agencies to plan for or conduct review of their rules 15 in february 1998 the house committee on small business held hearing on the implementation of section 610 of the rfa16 in general the witnesses indicated that few section 610 reviews had been done and the reasons for this lack of action varied for example one witness said certain agencies had effectively written themselves out of portions of the rfa by indicating that their interpretative rules are not covered by the act or by defining small business in such way that the act was not triggered

are conducting the required lookbacks under the rfa gao used the unified agenda to examine the implementation of section 610 of the rfa several times and each time concluded that its implementation appeared flawed for example in april 1997 and february 1998 gao reported that relatively few agencies had entries in the november 1996 and october 1997 editions of the unified agenda that they characterized as section 610 reviews18 also where present the agencies entries frequently did not meet the specific requirements of subsection 610c in april 1999 gao examined the april 1998 and november 1998 editions of the unified agenda and again reported that few regulatory agencies indicated that they were conducting section 610 reviewseven among agencies that indicated they issued large number of rules with significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities 19 for example of the 61 federal departments and agencies with entries in the november 1998 unified agenda only eight agencies indicated that they were reviewing rules under section 610 and most of them were reviewing only one or two rules each several of the agencies with section 610 review entries had indicated in 20 successive editions of the agenda that many of their regulatory actions would have significant economic impact on small entitiesthereby strongly indicating that they would need to review many of their rules under section 610

gao said it could not definitively determine whether more rules should have been reviewed under section 610 or which rules because authoritative database existed delineating 1 the final rules that agencies determined would have significant impact on small entities or 2 the rules for which section 610 reviews had already been conducted also gao determined there were significant differences of opinion among federal agencies regarding the acts requirements or misunderstandings of those requirements for example subsection 610c requires agencies to publish notices in the federal register of rules that have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities some agencies eg epa indicated that this language required review of any rule that had such an impact at the time the final rule was promulgated ie any rule for which they had prepared final regulatory flexibility analysis in contrast other agencies eg the department of transportation said that the impact of rules can change dramatically over 10year period and said they interpreted the statutes use of the present tense have to mean they must review rules that have such an impact at the time the agency conducts the review under this reading of the statute agencies cannot rely on their previous determinations 18 us general accounting office regulatory flexibility act agencies use of the november 1996

to determine their current economic effect on small entities20 other agencies eg the department of health and human services said they believed they had met the public notice requirements of subsection 610c by simply listing rules in the unified agenda that they believed would have significant impact on small entities department officials said they subsequently understood that interpretation was wrong still other agencies eg the small business administration said they had not done any section 610 reviews at the time of gaos study because they had reviewed and revised all of their rules in the mid1990s as part of the clinton administrations regulatory reform initiative therefore they argued the agencies had rules more than 10 years old that had not been reviewed notably gao examined sbas announcements of these reviews and concluded that they did not meet the requirements of the rfa at meeting at gao in february 2000 regulatory agencies raised number of other issues regarding the interpretation of the rfas section 610 lookback requirement that have affected its implementation for example some agencies indicated that they had established high threshold for what constituted significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities by designating few of their rules as having that level of impact the number of rules from those agencies that were subject to reexamination was small some agencies said their rules often only implemented the requirements in the underlying statutes therefore they considered the underlying statutes to have significant impact on small entities not their regulations so they believed that few of their rules were subject to section 610 similarly some agencies said that while the actions of states and other parties implementing certain federal rules eg health standards would likely have significant impact on small entities the federal rules themselves would not have that impact other agencies indicated that it was unclear whether amending all or part of rule within the 10year period provided in section 610 would restart the clock if so they said agencies could prevent any lookbacks simply by making changes to their rules at least once every 10 years still other agencies questioned what was considered rule under section 610 for example if federal register provision amended an existing part in the code of federal regulations cfr they said it was unclear whether the agency should review the cfr part as whole within 10 years or only the portion that was amended by the federal register provision 20 because dot interprets the rfa in this manner for the past 10 years it has been systematically reviewing all of its rules to determine their curre nt impact on small entities

therefore it was unclear whether agencies have improved their implementation of section 610 or whether the same basic pattern is evident using the same methodology that gao employed crs examined agencies implementation of the review requirement during calendar year 2004 the unified agendas published in june 2004 and december 2004 each contained more than 4000 entries eg notices of forthcoming proposed rules and final rules from more than 60 regulatory agencies in each volume the agencies indicated that about 400 of the regulatory actions identified in those entries could have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities as table 1 indicates the agencies with the largest number of such entries were the federal communications commission fcc the securities and exchange commission sec the small business admi nistration sba and the departments of commerce doc health and human services hhs agriculture usda transportation dot and labor dol those eight departments and agencies accounted for about 90 of the regulatory actions in the agendas that the agencies expected to trigger the rfa the same departments and agencies also indicated they issued many rfarelated rules when gao did its study examining the unified agendas from 1988 through 199821 therefore it would be reasonable to expect that since they indicated that they intended to issue large number of rules each year with significant effect on small entities those same agencies would need to reexamine large number of rules each year under section 610 t able 1 ag encies announced f ew

reviews the n umbe r of section 610 reviews does not include ent ries noting the comple tion of reviews or rulemaking as s ociated with those reviews however as table 1 also illustrates the june 2004 edition of the unified agenda contained only 35 notices of upcoming section 610 reviews and the december edition contained only 3122 some of the agencies that indicated they planned to issue the most rules affecting small entities had either section 610 notices doc sba nd sec or had only one or two such notices hhs and fcc gao reported the same pattern for the same five agencies in its 1999 report 23 therefore if the unified agenda really is the compendium of forthcoming regulatory activity that it purports to be it appears that agencies are still not conducting many reviews under section 610 of the rfa in fact the number of section 610 reviews that federal agencies conduct each year is actually much less than the above table suggests all but four two from dol and two from dot of the 31 section 610 notices listed in the december 2004 edition of the unified agenda were previously listed among the 35 notices in the june edition likewise all but nine of the 35 notices in the june 2004 edition had been listed in the december 2003 edition of the agenda the same type of overlap exists with regard to the number of rules expected to have significant impact on small entities for example of the 38 usda entries in the december 2004 edition of the unified agenda with an impact on small entities all but six were in the june 2004 edition of the agenda overall though if the unified agenda is valid general indication of agencies activities in this area it appears that agencies are reviewing less than 10 of their rules with an impact on small entities

conducted in terms of impetus mandatory or discretionary and purpose varied among agencies gao reported that mandatory requirements were sometimes the impetus for reviews but agencies more often exercised their own discretionary authorities to review regulations the main purpose of most reviews was to examine the effectiveness of the implementation of regulations but agencies also conducted reviews to identify ways to reduce regulatory burdens and to validate the original estimates of benefits and costs gao also said that the processes and standards guiding reviews varied across agencies and the impetus and phase of the review process for example while almost all agencies had standards for conducting mandatory reviews only about half of the agencies had such standards for conducting discretionary reviews the extent of p ublic involvement varied across review phases with the public having relatively more of role in the selection process for discretionary reviews gao also reported that discretionary reviews more often resulted in changes to rules and related documents than mandatory reviews among other things gao recommended that agencies incorporate various elements into their policies and procedures to improve the effectiveness and transparency of retrospective regulatory reviews and that they identify opportunities for congress to revise and consolidate existing requirements g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g143g152g155g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g152g155g162g561g20g142g143g152g155g150g561 the failure of section 610 of the rfa to get many agencies to review the impact of their existing rules on small entities offers number of valuable lessons for current advocates of even broader lookback requirements in general the drafters of any regulatory review legislation should be sure that the requirements for review are clear in terms of which rules need to be reviewed and how the reviews are to be conducted giving agencies the discretion to decide which rules meet certain broad criteria for review appears in many cases to be an invitation for the agencies to declare that few if any of their rules meet that threshold clearly many of the problems associated with the implementation of section 610 are traceable to problems associated with the rfa as whole agencies have substantial discretion to certify rules as not having significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities agencies that so certify all or most of their rules eg epa would never even appear in listing like table 1 of agencies that issue large number of rules that require reexamination under section 610 it is ironic that sbrefa statute intended to strengthen the rfa may have had the unintended effect of making fewer rules subject to the rfas analytical requirements including section 610 one way to address this problem in the context of any new statutory lookback requirement could be to eliminate agency discretion entirely and require the agencies to review all of their existing rules or all rules they had issued within set period of time prior to the enactment of any review requirement eg within the past 10 years however these sorts of allencompassing reviews would likely be very difficult and timeconsuming for the agencies to conduct also most of the thousands of final rules that agencies issue each year are routine or administrative eg bridge opening schedules or air worthiness directives and are not likely to be the type of rules considered burdensome or in need of reform by the public one way to make such comprehensive review requirement more manageable could be to require agencies to review all final rules that both the office of management and budget omb and the agencies considered

year or major under sbrefa about 70 final rules each year26 however even this approach would include some rules that are somewhat ministerial in nature eg major rules establishing migratory bird hunting seasons or medicare reimbursement rates omb or some other entity outside of the regulatory agencies could be authorized to waive the review requirement for such rules another approach could be to solicit suggestions from the public regarding the rules they believe should be reviewed however some would argue that this approach is already underway the regulatory right to know act section 624 of the treasury and general government appropriations act of 2001 required that omb report on recommendations for reform in response to that requirement omb has been asking the public to nominate rules that they believe are in need of review initially omb asked the public to suggest rules that could be rescinded or changed to increase net benefits to the public in response omb received 71 suggestions from the public subsequently though omb broadened the request to include revisions that would increase net benefits by either eliminating or modifying existing rules or by extending or expanding existing regulatory programs in response to that request omb received 316 suggestions from the public and referred those suggestions to the agencies for their consideration 27 omb is continuing to obtain suggestions from the public regarding rules in need of review whichever approach is taken federal agencies experience with section 610 of the rfa suggests that congress be as clear as possible regarding it s expectations for these reviews for example congress faces the challenge of clearly indicating what should be considered rule to be reviewed eg an entire cfr part or only certain provisions that are changed through federal register notice whether any burden that is associated with rules underlying statute or subsequent implementation by state governments or other parties should be considered part of the rule and whether any revisions to rule would restart the clock for any requirement that rules be revised within particular period of time also in order to permit the public to be involved in these reviews and to permit tracking of which rules are still in need of review agencies could be required to post their upcoming and completed reviews in the unified agenda or on the agencys website as result congress and the public would know which rules were required to be reviewed which ones had been reviewed and which ones were still in need of review

mechanism to any generalized lookback requirement either throug h the budget eg withholding some portion of the appropriations of agencies that have not carried out the required reviews by including

effects of rule on small entities as well as any indirect effect which is reasonably foreseeable and results from such rule section 4 of the bill would make several changes to the rfas requirementsadding new analytical or reporting requirements and adding to the level of detail in existing requirements for example whereas the rfa currently requires an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to contain description of the reasons why the agency action is being considered and succinct statement of the objectives of and legal basis for the proposed rule hr 4458 would require detailed statement describing those elements section 5 of hr 4458 would amend section 610 of the rfa and establish new requirements for the periodic review of rules specifically within 180 days after enactment the bill would require agencies to publish in the federal register and on their websites plan for reviewing all existing rules that the agency heads determine have significant economic

determine if they currently have significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities and could not simply rely on their previous determinations when the final rule was published in the federal register enactment of this change may result in substantially more section 610 reviews but with concomitant increase in time and effort required by federal agencies still unclear however is what would constitute rule under this requirement eg only the provision published in the federal register or the entire code of federal regulations part that the provision amended also because the legislation does not clarify what constitutes significant economic impact on substantial number of small entities federal agencies would appear to continue to have great deal of discretion to decide when those reviews would need to be conducted g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 curtis w copeland specialist in american national
