policy resources science and industry division summary the world trade organization wto mini sterial conference held in geneva from july 21 to july 29 2008 failed in its ttempt to resolve the remaining outstanding issues in the doha round negotiations prior to the collapse of talks negotiators had neared agreement on modalities framework specific formulas and timetables for reducing tradedistorting farm support tariffs and export subsidies that would significantly lower allowable spending limits for certain types of us domestic support eliminate export subsidies and allow us agricultural products wider access in foreign markets according to the latest draft of modalities and the current market outlook us domestic farm program outla ys would appear to fit within proposed tighter limits without substantial modificati on however us trade offi cials had expressed concern that proposed modalities included too many ex ceptions for foreign importers to ensure an adequate balance between us domes tic policy concessions and potential export gains the issue on which the ministeria l eventually foundered was proposed special safeguard mechanism ssm that would llow developing countries like india and china to impose tariffs higher than nego tiated tariff rates bound rates if imports surged absent an agreement on the ssm the trade negotiations collapsed whether or when doha round negotiations would continue is uncertain this report reviews the current status of agricultural negotiations for domestic support market access and export subsidies and their potential implications for us agriculture it will be updated if events warrant introduction wto multilateral trade nego tiations have been ongoing since november 20011 the negotiations referred to as

agriculture in the wto policy commitments made under the agreement on agriculture by randy schnepfwhere new disciplines are being negotiated in three broad areas domestic agricultural support programs export compe tition and market access often referred to as the three pillars of the agreement on agriculture doha round negotiations have attempted to maintain balance across the three pillars by simultaneously achieving concessions from exporters and importers alike in the form of tighter spending limits on tradedistorting domestic support elimination of export subsidies and new di sciplines on other forms of export competition and expansion of market access by lowering tariffs increasing quota commitments and limiting the use of import safeguards and other trade barriers2 domestic support the wto categorizes domestic support programs by the degree to which they distort price formation in agricultural markets wt member countries have agreed to specific spending limits on the most highly marketdistorting domestic programs amber box programs while allowing member countri the ability to intervene in national agricultural policy by shifting their support to amsexempt categories such as the green box3 in addition certain marketdistortin g programs are exempted from spending disciplines under special circ umstances the blue box c ontains marketdistorting but productionlimiting programs while the minimis exclusions one at the individual product level the other at the aggregate level comprise mark etdistorting policies that are deemed benign because spending outlays are small relative to countrys overall agricultural sector in general wto tr ade negotiations have emphasized tightening spending limits on the most highly marketdistorting domestic programs while capping and reducing spending under the blue box and minimis exclusions tighter spending limits in aggr egate and for specific products the current draft modalities propose cutting trad distorting domestic support simultaneously across three levels see table 1 for details first spending limits for each categ ory amber box blue box and the two minimis exclusions would be reduced substantially second within each of these categor ies additional constraints would apply to support for any individua l product ie productspecific limits third global spending limit referred to as the overall trade distorting domestic support otds encompassing the four categories of amber box blue box and the two minimis exclusions would be established at level substantially smaller than the sum of

laborde and w ill martin international center for trade and sustainable development ictsd june 2008inconsistencies between its wto commitments and current us farm policy authorized by the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 the degr ee of changes to us farm policy needed to comply would likely hinge on market conditi ons if relatively high price environment continues as projected by usda and most mark et analysts then us amber box outlays could easily fall within the new limits with only modest changes however if market prices were to return to vels substantially below support levels then amber and blue box outlays could escalate rapidly and threaten to exceed spending limits4 many market analysts have also expressed concern that high revenue guarantees set by formula under new revenue support program average crop revenue option acre could lead to largerthanexpected outlays if market prices were to weaken substantially in the future but such an outcome would depend on the participation rate in acre which is still unknown revisions to the us dairy program under the 2008 farm bill appear likely to dramatically reduce annual dair price support as notified to the wto dairy program changes coupled with reclassification of th ccp as blue box c ould provide additional flexibility in accommodating the tighter am ber box limits however two commodities sugar and cotton could pose problem s in meeting productspecific ams bounds sugar was given higher loan rates in th 2008 farm bill while for cotton the draft modalities would impose larger more immediate cuts to allowable domestic support in addition cotton would confront much tighter blue box support limit market access formula tariff cuts the main approach to cutting tariffs in the modalities agreement is tiered approach based on the principle that higher tariffs have higher cuts developed country tariff cuts would range from 50 to 66 or 73 but subject to an overall 54 minimum average cut the cuts are made from lega lly bound rates which could be substantially higher than rates actually applie d the range for developing countries would be twothirds of the equivalent tier for deve loped countries subject to maximum average cut of 36 leastdeve loped countries and socalled small and vulnerable economies would be exempt from any tariff cuts very recent new members of the wto also would be exem pt from new market access commitments table 2 tiered formula tariff cuts developed countries developing countries tier current tariff reducti on current tariff reduction bottom 0 to 20 50 0 to 30 333 lower middle 20 to 50 57

formula cuts some products would have smaller tariff cuts because of flexibilities that are provided for in the draft text foremost of these is the designation available to all countries of sensitive for limited number of products developed countries could design ate 4 or 6 to be negotia ted of products as sensitive and would apply tariff cuts that are onethird onehalf or twothirds of the modalities proposed formula tariff cut developing countries coul d designate 53 or 8 of products with the same deviations from formula cuts c ountries that choose to designate products as sensitive would have to pay for the designation with expanded market access under tariff quota where quan tities inside the quota are charged lower or duty and the above quota tariff is determined according to the reduction formula the larger the deviation from the modalitiesproposed formula cut the greater would be the amount of inquota market access eg th maximum amount of inquota access would be 4 or 6 of domestic consumption if the full twothirds deviation is applied developing countries could so exempt some products from full formula tariff cuts by designating some products as special ie products deemed essential for food or livelihood security or rural development safeguards the draft modalities identify two options for the special agricultural safeguard ssg whereby countries can reimpos tariffs if because of an import surge certain price or quantity triggers are met for developed countries the ssg would either be eliminated or the number of products eligible would be reduced developing countries could continue to use the ssg in addition the text provides for new special safeguard mechanism ssm that developing countries could apply to protect producers of special products when imports surged implications for the united states in general us agricultural exports would gain greater market access primarily in other developed countries recent study suggests that application of the tiered formula would reduce the average applied agricultural tariff faced by us agricultura l exporters from 187 to 91 in the absence of sensitive and special product flexib ilities and from 187 to 132 when such flexibilities are in effect5 although the sensitive produc t designation would limit the market access opportunities somewhat the num ber of such produc ts would be limited also the higher tariff protecti on afforded by sensitive product st atus is partially offset by new or expanded quotas access talks gridlock on ssm proposals in contrast to potential market access gains under proposed tariff cut modalities india and china proposed modality for the ssm that would allow developing countries to impose tariffs 15 above bound rates if imports surged 10 above average trade levels the us counterproposal was for higher ssm trigger of 40 above average trade levels and tariff increases that would not exceed existing bound rates according to ustr the modality proposed by india and china would reduce existing market access for exam ple ustr estimated that 10 trigger would have enabled china to invoke the ssm in eight of the last ten years for soybeans and india to restrict trade in six of the last nine years for palm oil httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22927crs6 export competition export subsidies the draft modalities on export competition would require developed countries to eliminate export subs idies by 2013 developing countries would have until 2016 all existing wto commitment s concerning food aid technical and financial assistance in aid programs to improve agricultural productivity and infrastructure and financing of commercial imports of ba sic foods would be unaffected by the elimination of export subsidies export financing governmentsupported export financing would be limited by maximum repayment period of 180 days and would have to be selffinancing that is returns must cover all costs export fina ncing includes direct financing support direct credits refinancing or intere st rate support export credit insurance or reinsurance and export credit guarantees governmenttogovernment credit agreements and other forms of government support such as deferred invoicing and foreign exchange risk hedging international food aid all food aid transactions would be needsdriven fully in grant form not tied directly or indirectly to commercial exports of agricultural or other products and not linked to mark et development objectives countries would refrain from providing inkind food aid which could ve an adverse impact on local production or could potentially displace commerc ial sales food aid cash or inkind provided during an emergency would be put in safe box nd be subject to more lenient disciplines monetization sale for cash of inkind food ai d would be subject to stricter disciplines implications for the united states elimination of agricultural export subsidies has been longstanding objective of us trade policy the 2008 farm bill repealed legislative authority for the export enhancement program eep historically the largest us agricultural export subsidy program the draft modalities would require the elimination of the dairy export incentive prog ram deip much smaller export subsidy program that was reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill the united states has already made changes in its export credit guarantee programs in response to an adverse decision in wto cotton case the intermediate guaran tee program gsm103 has been eliminated riskbased interest rate determination has been established and the 1 cap on origination fees has been lifted to meet requirements laid out in the draft modalities the term for gsm102 shortterm guarantees six months to two years would have to be limited to six months to meet the selffi nancing criterion in the draf t modalities add itional interest charges or fees could be required conf orming to doha round modalities for food aid could entail some changes in us programs the future of doha round negotiations following the collapse of the ministerial wto member countries reiterated their commitment to completing the round for agricultu re as well as for nonagricultural market access nama and services the nama and agriculture negotiating chairpersons will issue status reports of the progress made in the july 2129 2008 ministerial these reports would not have the standing of moda lities but would only reflect the state of play including differences on issues that emerged during the ministerial consensus has yet emerged as to resumption of doha round negotiations
