reverse chronological listing of us supreme court decisions addressing claims that government entity has taken private property as that term is used in the takings clause of the fift h amendment sca ttering of related non takings decisions is also included under the takings clause courts allo w two very distinct types of suit condemnation occurs when government or private entity formally invokes its power of eminent domain by filing suit to take specified property upon payment to the owner of just compensation by contrast taking action our topic here is the procedural reverse it is suit by property holder against the government claiming that government c onduct has effectivel taken the property notwithstanding that the government has not filed formal condemnation suit typical taking action complains of severe regulation of land us though the takings clause reaches all species of property real and personal ta ngible and intangible the taking action generally demands that the government comp ensate the property owner just as when government formally exercises eminent domain the supreme courts takings decisions r each as far back as 1870 and are divided here into three periods the modern pe riod from 1978 to the present is defined by the courts effort to make its indicia for regulatory takings more explicit with uneven success and to develop ripe ness standards in the preceding period 1922 to 1978 the court first announced the regulatory taking concept that government regulation alone without appropriation or physical i nvasion of property may be taking if sufficiently severe during this time however it proffered little by way of regulatory takings criteria in the earliest period of takings law 1870 to 1922 the court saw the takings clause as protecting property owne rs only from two particularly intrusive forms of government action outright appr opriation and physical invasion regulatory restrictions were tested against othe r legal theories and generally upheldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97122contents i takings law today penn central 1978 to the present 3 ii the dawn of regulatory takings law pennsylvania coal co 1922 to 1978 1 1 iii appropriations and physical takings only 1870 to 1922 1 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97122takings decisions of the us supreme court chronology once in the constitutional wings the takings clause of the fifth amendment today stands center stage debate on the proper balance between private property rights and conflicting societal needs is complete without it the reasons for the takings clauses ascendancy are clear starting with the advent of comprehensive zoning in the early twentieth century federal state and local regulation of private land use has become pervasive beyond comprehensive zoning recent decades have seen explosive growth in the use of historic preservation restrictions openspace zoning dedica tion and exaction conditions on building permits nature preserves wildlife hab itat preservation wetla nds and coastal zone controls and so on in the supreme court the appointment of several conservative justices since the 1970s has prompted ne w scrutiny of governme nt conduct visavis the private property owner as result the court since the late seventies has turned its attention toward the takings issue with vigor clarifying some issues and raising new ones through the 1980s and 1990s property owner plaintiffs sc ored several major victories by and large the substantive doctrine of takings shifted to the right recent decisions however have moved the analytical fra mework in more governmentfriendly direction though it is too soon to discer n whether this signals lasting shift by way of background the fifth amendm ent of the us constitution states nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation until the late nineteenth century th is clause was invoked only for condemnation the formal exercise by government of its eminentdomain power to take property coercively upon payment of just compensati on in such condemnation suits there is issue as to whether the property is taken in the fifth amendment sense the government concedes as much by filing the action the only question typically is how much compensation must be paid beginning in the late nineteenth century the supreme court gave its imprimatur to very different use of the takings cl ause when the sove reign appropriated or caused physical invasion of property as when government dam flooded private land the court found that the property had been taken just as surely as if the sovereign had formally condemned th erefore it said the propert owner should be allowed to vindicate his constitutional right to compensation in suit against the government in contrast with condemn ation actions then such takings actions have the property owner suing government rather th an viceversa hence the synonym inverse condemnation actions the key issue in takings acti ons is usually whether given all the circumstances the impact of the g overnment action on particular property amounts to taking in the constitutional sensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97122crs2 1 pennsylvania coal co v mahon 260 us 393 1922 2 125 s ct 2655 2005in 1922 in the most historically important taking decision1 the supreme court extended the availability of takings actions from government appropriations and physical invasions of property to the mere regulation of property use this critical extension opened up vast new legal possi bilities for property ow ners and underlies most of the supreme court s takings decisions since 1922 this report compiles only supreme court decisions addressing issues unique to takings inverse condemnation

chronological orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97122crs3 i takings law today penn central 1978 to the present in 1978 the supreme court ushered in the modern era of regulatory takings law by attempting to inject some coherence into the ad hoc analyses that had characterized its decisions before then in penn central transportation co v new york city the court declared that whether regulatory taking has occurred in given case is influenced by three principal factors th economic impact of the regulation the extent to which it interferes with distinct in most later decisions reasonable investment backed expectations and the characte r of the government action after penn central ad hocery in judicial taking determinations emphatically still remains but arguably is confined within tighter bounds the courts many takings decisions since penn central have developed the jurisprudence in each of its main areas ripeness takings criteria and remedy as for takings criteria the court nnounced several per taking rules in the two decades after penn central see eg loretto and lucas though more recently it has again been extolling the multifactor casebycase approach of that decision see palazzolo
