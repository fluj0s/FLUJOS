policy resources science and industry division pesticide law summary of the statutes summary this report summarizes the major statutory authorities governing pesticide regulation the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra and section 408 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca as well as the major regulatory programs for pesticides text relevant to fifra is excerpted with minor modifications from the corresponding chapter of crs report rl30798 environmental laws summaries of statutes administered by the environmental protection agency which summarizes more than dozen environmental statutes this report will be updated at the beginning of the first session of each new congress or sooner if congress enacts law that substantively changes statute congress enacted the original version of fifra in 1947 but revision in 1972 is the basis of current pesticide policy substantial changes were made in 1988 and again in 1996 the 1996 fifra amendments were contained in the food quality protection act fqpa which also amended the ffdca congress first required limits on pesticide residues on raw food in 1954 amendments to the ffdca limits were required for food additives including pesticide residues in processed foods in the 1958 ffdca amendments in the 1996 ffdca amendments congress established new standard of safety for pesticide residues in food both raw and processed maximum residue levels set by epa must ensure with reasonable certainty that harm will result from pesticide exposure fifra requires the us environmental protection agency epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the united states through registration and labeling of pesticide products the sale of any pesticide is prohibited in the united states unless it is registered and labeled epa is directed to restrict the use of pesticides as necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on people and the environment taking into account the costs and benefits of various pesticide uses in addition fifra requires epa to reregister older pesticides based on new data that meet current regulatory and scientific standards pesticides manufactured solely for export do not require registration for pesticides to be registered for use in food production ffdca section 408 authorizes epa to establish allowable residue levels called tolerances that ensure that human exposure to pesticide residues in food will be safe foods with pesticide residues above the tolerance or for which there is tolerance established may not be imported or sold in interstate commerce pesticide may not be registered under fifra for food use unless tolerance for that pesticide and food has been established under ffdca fifra directs epa to make public any data submitted to support registration application if epa registers the pesticide but certain data are protected as trade secrets and other registrants may not use the same data to support registration applications for similar pesticides for period of 10 years epa continues to evaluate the safety of pesticides after they are registered as new information becomes available pesticide registration may be canceled or amended if epa determines that current use may cause unreasonable adverse effects contents introduction 1 overview 1 history of federal pesticide law 2 fifra 2 ffdca 3 registration of pesticide

statutes the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra1 governing the sale and use of pesticide products within the united states and the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca which limits pesticide residues on food in interstate commerce including imports this report defines key terms provides brief history of the federal pesticide laws and describes key provisions of the laws including the pesticide registration process and how it interfaces with food safety requirements in addition this report lists several references for more detailed information about the acts and two tables cross reference sections of the us code with corresponding sections of the acts the report is descriptive rather than analytic highlights key provisions rather than providing comprehensive inventory of the acts numerous sections and addresses authorities and limitations imposed by statute rather than the status of epa implementation or other policy issues other crs products address current pesticide issues including crs report rl32218 pesticide registration and tolerance fees overview by robert esworthy overview there are an estimated 18000 pesticide products currently in use2 these generally are regulated under fifra but approximately 5800 pesticide products used in food production also are regulated under the ffdca as discussed below fifra requires epa to regulate the sale and use of pesticides in the united states through registration and labeling3 pesticides are broadly defined in fifra section 2u as chemicals and other products used to kill repel or control pests familiar examples include pesticides used to kill insects and weeds that can reduce the yield and sometimes harm the quality of agricultural crops ornamental plants forests wooden structures and pastures but the broad definition of pesticide in fifra also applies to products with less familiar pesticidal uses for example substances used to control mold mildew algae and other nuisance growths on equipment in surface water or on stored grains are pesticides the term also applies to disinfectants and sterilizing agents animal repellents rat poison and many other substances 1 fifra also is known as the act of june 25 1947 2 james l beech us epa office of pesticide programs personal communication november 20 2006 3 exceptions are noted in 40 cfr 15220 15225 and 15230 crs2 fifra directs epa to restrict the use of pesticides as necessary to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on people and the environment taking into account the costs and benefits of various pesticide uses the act prohibits sale of any pesticide in the united states unless it is registered and labeled to indicate approved uses and restrictions it is violation of the law to use pesticide in manner that is inconsistent with the label instructions epa registers each pesticide product for each approved use for example product may be registered for use on green beans to control mites as seed treatment for cotton and as treatment for structural cracks in addition fifra requires epa to reregister older pesticides based on new data that meet current regulatory and scientific standards establishments that manufacture or sell pesticide products must register with epa facility managers are required to keep certain records and to allow inspections by federal or state regulatory officials for the 600 or more pesticides ie active ingredients registered for use in food production the ffdca section 408 authorizes epa to establish maximum allowable residue levels called tolerances that ensure that human exposure to the pesticide ingredients in food and animal feed will be safe4 safe tolerance is defined as level at which there is reasonable certainty of harm from the exposure under ffdca foods with residue of pesticide ingredient for which there is tolerance established or with residue level exceeding an established tolerance limit are declared unsafe and adulterated such foods cannot be sold in interstate commerce or imported to the united states pesticides may not be registered under fifra for use on food unless tolerances or exemptions have been established under the ffdca history of federal pesticide law table 1 and table 2 summarize the history of fifra and ffdca respectively fifra federal pesticide legislation was first enacted in 1910 it aimed to reduce economic exploitation of farmers by manufacturers and distributors of adulterated or ineffective pesticides congress did not address the potential risks to human health posed by pesticide products until it enacted the original 1947 version of fifra the us department of agriculture usda was responsible for administering the pesticide statutes during this period however responsibility was shifted to the epa when that agency was created in 1970 broader congressional concerns about long and shortterm toxic effects of pesticide exposure on people who applied pesticides applicators wildlife nontarget insects and birds and on food consumers subsequently led to complete revision of fifra in 1972 the 1972 law completely replaced the original 1947 law and is the basis of current federal policy substantial changes were made in 1988 pl 100532 1996 pl 4 ingredients in pesticide products are categorized as active or inert active ingredients are those that are intended to control the pest while inert ingredients are used to deliver the active ingredients effectively to the pest inert ingredients often are solvents or surfactants and often comprise the bulk of the pesticide product some inerts are known to be toxic and some are known to be harmless but epa lists most in the category inerts of unknown toxicity crs3 104170 and 2004 pl 108199 the 1988 amendments focused on accelerating the reregistration process the 1996 amendments facilitated registration of pesticides for special socalled minor uses reauthorized collection of fees to support reregistration and required coordination of regulations implementing fifra and the federal food drug and cosmetic act 21 usc 321 et seq the 2004 amendments known as the pesticide registration improvement act pria modified the types and amounts of fees that epa could collect to support its activities the pesticide registration improvement renewal act or pria 2 pl 11094 enacted october 9 2007 reauthorized and revised these fee provisions which would have expired at the end of fy2008 see table 3 for listing of current provisions in fifra authorization for appropriations for fifra expired on september 31 1991 although appropriations bills have continued to provide funding to implement the law authority provided by fifra to epa to issue and enforce regulations is for the most part permanent and is not affected by the lack of authorization table 1

was established by pl 92516 which completely replaced by amendment the original 1947 legislation ffdca the original federal food drug and cosmetic act of 1938 ffdca established the structure of the current law with respect to food safety and possible contaminants it required the food and drug administration then part of the us crs4 department of agriculture to set maximum residue levels tolerances for unavoidable poisonous substances in food congress acted to protect consumers from pesticide residues on food in 1954 by adding new section 408 to the ffdca it directed fda to set residue tolerances for all pesticides in raw agricultural commodities congress expanded the requirement for tolerances in the food additives amendment of 1958 which added section 409 directing fda to set tolerances for food additives including pesticide residues in processed foods section 409 also forbade the addition to food of any additive including pesticide residue if it was found to be potential cancercausing agent this provision is referred to as the delaney clause in 1970 authority to establish tolerances for pesticide residues was transferred to the newly formed epa fda now in the department of health and human services retained responsibility for enforcement of tolerances in food that is imported or sold across state boundaries in 1996 congress substantially revised requirements for pesticide residue tolerance setting in the food quality protection act fqpa the fqpa redefined terms so that pesticide residues in processed foods were longer regulated as food additives and therefore longer were subject to the delaney clause the fqpa also established new safety standard of reasonable certainty of harm from exposure to pesticides see table 4 for listing of current pesticiderelated provisions in ffdca the act of july 22 1954 authorized such sums as may be necessary to carry out this ffdca section 21 usc 346b table 2 federal food drug and cosmetic act section 408 and amendments codified generally as 21 usc 346a year act public law number 1938 federal food drug and cosmetic act act of june 25 1938 1954 federal food drug and cosmetic act act of july 22 1954 amendments 1958 food additive amendments of 1958 pl 85929 including the delaney clause 1996 food quality protection act of 1996 pl 104170 source congressional research service registration of pesticide products when pesticide manufacturers apply to register pesticide active ingredient pesticide product or new use of registered pesticide under fifra section 3 epa requires them to submit scientific data on toxicity and behavior in the environment epa may require data from any combination of more than 100 different tests depending on the potential toxicity of active and inert ingredients and degree of crs5 exposure to register pesticide use on food epa also requires applicants to identify analytical methods that can be used to test food for residues of active ingredients certain inert ingredients and their breakdown products and to determine the amount of residue that could remain on crops as well as on or in food products assuming that the pesticide product is applied according to the manufacturers recommended rates and methods based on the data submitted epa determines whether and under what conditions the proposed pesticide use would present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment if the pesticide is proposed for use on food crop epa also determines whether safe level of pesticide residue called tolerance can be established under the federal food drug and cosmetic act tolerance must be established before pesticide registration may be granted for use on food crops if registration is granted the agency specifies the approved uses and conditions of use including safe methods of pesticide storage and disposal which the registrant must explain on the product label fifra requires that federal regulations for pesticide labels preempt state local and tribal regulations use of pesticide product in manner inconsistent with its label is prohibited epa may classify and register pesticide product for general or for restricted use products known as restricteduse pesticides are those judged to be more dangerous to the applicator or to the environment such pesticides can be applied only by people who have been trained and certified individual states and indian tribes generally are responsible for training and certifying pesticide applicators fifra section 3 also allows conditional temporary registrations if 1 the proposed pesticide ingredients and uses are substantially similar to currently registered products and will not create additional significant environmental risks 2 an amendment is proposed for additional uses of registered pesticide and sufficient data are submitted indicating that there is significant additional risk or 3 data requirements for new active ingredient require more time to generate than normally allowed and use of the pesticide during the period will not cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment and will be in the public interest fifraffdca coordination epa has long coordinated pesticide registrations for food uses under fifra with tolerance setting under the ffdca the food quality protection act of 1996 fqpa public law 104170 codified this policy thus if epa revokes residue tolerance under ffdca it cancels the fifra pesticide registration for that food use similarly if pesticide registration for use on food crop is canceled epa also cancels the residue tolerance for the food however just as fifra allows continued use of remaining pesticide stocks after registration is canceled ffdca allows continued commerce in commodities legally treated with pesticide thus epa does not immediately revoke the tolerance for the pesticide residue when it cancels the corresponding registration crs6 tolerance setting any person who has registered pesticide may petition epa proposing establishment of tolerance or an exemption for that pesticide to permit its use on foodrelated crops5 tolerance petitions must include information about pesticide application rates measured concentrations of pesticide residues on the food after the pesticide has been applied according to directions on its label and safety of pesticide use on food crops the ffdca requires epa to respond to each petition by establishing tolerance or exempting the pesticide from the requirement if the pesticide will not leave residues above an established safe level epa will register the pesticide for use on that food product and set the tolerance level by issuing regulation epa tolerances for pesticide residues preempt state and local restrictions on food if the state and local restrictions are based on lower residue levels states may petition for an exception if the epaset residue level threatens public health the ffdca section 408 as amended requires epa to assess safety in terms of total exposure to the pesticide that is to the concentration of pesticide allowed by the tolerance together with all other dietary and nonfood exposures for which there is reliable information as well as to other pesticides that have the same toxic effects on people quantitative standard of safety is established by law but the committee on commerce noted in its report on the bill that became the fqpa that epa should continue setting standards to ensure safety as it had in the past the committee expects that tolerance will provide reasonable certainty of harm if the administrator determines that the aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue will be lower by an ample margin of safety than the level at which the pesticide chemical residue will not cause or contribute to any known or anticipated harm to human health the committee further expects based on discussions with the environmental protection agency that the administrator will interpret an ample margin of safety to be 100fold safety factor applied to the scientifically determined observable effect level when data are extrapolated from animal studies6 in determining safe level the ffdca directs epa to take into account many factors including available information on dietary exposure to pesticides among infants and children fqpa strictly limited the nature and influence of benefits considered in tolerance setting under section 408 of the ffdca as amended section 408 allows epa to maintain or modify existing tolerances but not to establish new tolerances at higher than safe residue levels only if the pesticide use avoids other greater risks to consumers or is necessary to avoid significant disruption in domestic production of an adequate wholesome and economical food supply such higher tolerance levels may be set only for pesticides that are potential carcinogens or have some other health effect for which there is known level of exposure at which harm is anticipated known as nonthreshold effect the 5 that is use on food crops animal feed crops or food products directly eg grains fruits or vegetables after harvest 6 us house of representatives committee on commerce food quality protection act of 1996 hrept 104669 part 2 104th cong 2nd sess 1996 p 6 crs7 higher tolerance level allowed for such pesticide residues must be safe for infants and children as well as with respect to health effects for which there is known threshold that is level below which exposure is known to be harmless the higher cancer or other nonthreshold risk posed by the tolerance on an annual basis may not be more than 10 times the risk at safe level of exposure and not more than twice the risk of safe level over lifetime for nonthreshold effects the house commerce committee provided additional guidance for establishing level of residue that should be considered safe in the case of nonthreshold effect which can be assessed through quantitative risk assessment such as cancer effect the committee expects based on its understanding of current epa practice that tolerance will be considered to provide reasonable certainty of harm if any increase in lifetime risk based on quantitative risk assessment using conservative assumptions will be greater than negligible it is the committees understanding that under current epa practice epa interprets negligible risk to be oneinamillion lifetime risk the committee expects the administrator to continue to follow this interpretation7 the safe standard applies to both raw and processed foods and requires epa to consider cumulative and aggregate exposure to pesticides in food drinking water air and consumer products congress directed epa to reevaluate all existing tolerances against this standard before august 2006 ffdca directs the fda in the department of health and human services and usda to monitor pesticide residue levels in food in interstate commerce and to enforce tolerances through their food inspection programs usda is responsible for inspecting meat and poultry fda inspects all other foods states also may monitor pesticide residues in food sold within their jurisdictions public disclosure exclusive use and trade secrets fifra section 3 directs epa to make the data submitted by the applicant for pesticide registration publicly available within 30 days after registration is granted however applicants may claim certain data are protected as trade secrets under fifra section 10 if epa agrees that the data are protected the agency must withhold those data from the public unless the data pertain to the health effects or environmental fate or effects of the pesticide ingredients information may be protected if it qualifies as trade secret and reveals 1 manufacturing processes 2 details of methods for testing detecting or measuring amounts of inert ingredients or 3 the identity or percentage quantity of inert ingredients companies sometimes seek to register product based upon the registration of similar products relying upon the data provided by the original registrant that are publicly released this is allowed however section 3 of fifra provides for 10 year period of exclusive use by the registrant of data submitted in support of an original registration or new use in addition an applicant who submits any new 7 ibid crs8 data in support of registration is entitled to compensation for the cost of data development by any subsequent applicant who supports an application with that data within 15 years of its submission if compensation is not jointly agreed upon by the registrant and applicant binding arbitration can be invoked reregistration most pesticides currently registered in the united states are older pesticides and were not subject to modern safety reviews amendments to fifra in 1972 directed epa to reregister approximately 35000 older products in order to assess their safety in light of current standards the task of reregistering older pesticides was streamlined by reviewing groupings of products having the same active ingredients on generic instead of individual product basis for fooduse pesticides epa evaluated pesticides eligibility for reregistration at the same time the agency reassessed the tolerance for that pesticide under the ffdca the fqpa required epa to reassess pesticides posing the greatest risks first many of the 35000 pesticide products were not reviewed and their registrations were canceled because registrants did not request reregistration at least 14000 products are longer in use nevertheless the task for registrants and epa was immense and costly to accelerate the process of reregistration congress in 1988 amendments to fifra imposed 10year reregistration schedule to help pay for the additional costs of the accelerated process congress directed epa to require registrants to pay reregistration and annual registration maintenance fees on pesticide ingredients and products the 1996 amendments to fifra extended epas authority to collect maintenance fees through fy2001 exemptions from or reductions in fees were allowed for minoruse pesticides public health pesticides and small business registrants congress extended authority for fees annually through appropriations legislation after fy2001 until the omnibus appropriations legislation signed january 23 2004 pl 108199 modified the types and amounts of fees that epa could collect potentially through fy2008 the 2004 fifra amendments pria reauthorized collection of annual maintenance fees to support registration designated portion of those fees for the review of inert ingredients and extended the deadline for completion of reregistration pria directed epa to complete reregistration eligibility decisions reds for pesticides with food usestolerances by august 3 2006 and to complete reds for all remaining nonfood use pesticides by october 3 2008 the reregistration process will continue for several years after that date as explained on the epa reregistration website after epa has issued red and declared pesticide eligible for reregistration individual enduse products that contain the pesticide active ingredient still must be reregistered through this concluding part of the process known as product reregistration the agency makes sure that the risk reduction measures called for in reds are reflected on individual pesticide product labels in some cases the agency uses memoranda of agreement or other measures to include risk reduction measures on pesticide labels sooner before product reregistration is crs9 completed epa plans to complete the last product reregistration decisions several years after the last reds are signed8 epa authority for administering these fees would have expired at the end of fy2008 but it was extended by the pesticide registration improvement renewal act or pria 2 pl 11094 enacted october 9 2007 effective retroactively to the beginning of fy2008 through fy2012 pria 2 also made some technical revisions primarily modifications to the fee payment process and an expansion of the range of categories of pesticide registration licensing activities subject to fees special review epa continues to evaluate the safety of pesticides after they are registered as new information becomes available fifra requires registrants to report promptly any new evidence of adverse effects from pesticide exposure if evidence indicates that registered pesticide may pose an unreasonable risk epa may initiate special review of available information to reevaluate the risks and benefits of each registered use fifra also authorizes epa to require registrants to conduct new studies to fill gaps in scientific understanding to assist risk assessments as result of special review epa may conclude that registration is adequate needs amendment or should be canceled canceling or suspending registration if special review or reregistration evaluation finds that registered use may cause unreasonable adverse effects epa may amend or cancel the registration9 fifra also allows registrants to request cancellation or amendment of registration to terminate selected pesticide uses requesting voluntary cancellation sometimes reflects registrants conclusion that the cost of additional studies is not worth the expected benefit that is profit from sales if the registration would be maintained if registration is canceled for one or more uses of pesticide fifra does not permit it to be sold or distributed for those uses in the united states although for specified period of time us farmers may use remaining stocks and commerce may continue for commodities that were legally treated with the pesticide fifra allows registrants to appeal an epa decision to cancel registration an appeal initiates lengthy review process during which the product may continue to be marketed however if there is threat of an imminent hazard during the time required to cancel registration fifra authorizes epa to suspend registration suspension orders which also may be appealed stop sales and use of the pesticide in the event of suspension and cancellation fifra section 15 directs epa to request an appropriation from congress to compensate anyone who owned any of the pesticide and suffered any loss due to the suspension or cancellation the registrant of the 8 epa pesticide reregistration facts october 26 2006 httpwwwepagovoppsrrd1reregistrationreregistration_factshtm visited november 20 2006 9 registrations also may be canceled under other conditions for example if data are not submitted in response to epas request for additional information to maintain registration or if registrant fails to pay the maintenance fee crs10 suspended and canceled product is responsible however for all of the transportation and disposal costs and most storage costs use of unregistered pesticides fifra also allows for unregistered use of pesticide products in special circumstances section 5 allows experimental use permits for purposes of research and to collect data needed to register pesticide section 18 allows emergency exemptions from the provisions of fifra to be granted to federal or state agencies for example if there is virulent outbreak of disease that cannot be controlled by registered products in addition section 24c permits states to allow additional uses of federally registered product to meet special local needs enforcement generally epa has the authority to enforce fifra requirements however fifra section 26 gives states with adequate enforcement procedures laws and regulations primary authority including inspection authority for enforcing fifra provisions related to pesticide use epa is authorized by section 27 to rescind states primary enforcement responsibility if it is not being carried out fifra section 11 authorizes epa to form cooperative agreements with states giving them the responsibility for training and certifying applicators of restricted use pesticides states also may initially review and give preliminary approval to applications for emergency exemptions and special local needs registrations although under some conditions fifra allows epa later to deny stateapproved applications section 9 authorizes inspections by epa and authorized state officials of pesticide products where they are stored for distribution or sale section 13 authorizes epa to issue orders to stop sales and to seize supplies of pesticide products civil and criminal penalties for violations of fifra are established in section 14 while section 15 provides indemnity payments for end users distributors and dealers of pesticides when registrations are suspended and canceled federal district courts are authorized in section 16 to review epa final actions and omissions when action is not discretionary people adversely affected by an epa order may file for judicial review of the order following hearing but fifra does not authorize citizen suits against violators export of unregistered pesticides fifra does not give epa the authority to regulate domestic production for export of unregistered pesticides even if us registration has been canceled for health or environmental reasons however fifra does require exporters to prepare or pack pesticides as specified by the purchaser and in accord with some of the fifra labeling provisions for example exporters must translate warning information into the language of the destination fifra also requires exporters of unregistered pesticides to obtain the purchasers signature on statement acknowledging that the pesticide is unregistered and cannot be sold in the united crs11 states epa is required to notify governments of other countries and international agencies whenever registration cancellation or suspension of any pesticide becomes or ceases to be effective in the united states table 3 major us code sections of the federal insecticide fungicide
