debate without also rejecting the bill amendment conference report motion or other matter it has been debating1 senator can make nondebatable motion to table an amendment and if majority of the senate votes for that motion the effect is to reject the amendment thus the motion to table cannot be used to conclude debate when senators still wish to speak and to enable the senate to vote for the proposal it is considering only the cloture provisions of rule xxii achieve this purpose there are several stages to the process of invoking cloture first at least 16 senators sign cloture motion also called cloture petition that states we the undersigned senators in accordance with the provisions of rule xxii of the standing rules of the senate hereby move to bring to close the debate upon the matter in question to present cloture motion senator may interrupt another senator who is speaking when the motion is presented the clerk reads it the cloture motion then lies over until the second calendar day on which the senate is in session for example if the motion is filed on monday it lies over until wednesday assuming the senate is in session daily if the motion is filed on friday it lies over until tuesday unless the senate was in session on saturday or sunday the senate votes on the cloture motion one hour after it convenes on the second calendar day after the cloture motion was filed and after quorum call has established the presence of quorum the time for the cloture vote may be changed by unanimous consent and the required quorum call is routinely waived the presiding officer presents the cloture motion to the senate for rollcall vote at the time required by rule xxii even if the senate had been considering other business between the time the cloture motion was filed and the time for voting on the motion arrives the majority required to invoke cloture is threefifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn or 60 votes if there are vacancies in the senates membership however invoking cloture on measure or motion to amend the senates rules requires the votes of twothirds of the senators present and voting or 67 votes if all 100 senators vote senators who wish to offer amendments to bill or amendment on which cloture has been invoked must submit their amendments in writing before the cloture vote takes place firstdegree amendments which propose to change the text of bill or committee amendment in the nature of substitute must be submitted in writing to the journal clerk when the senate is in session but later than 100 pm on the day after the cloture motion is filed seconddegree amendments which propose to amend firstdegree amendments must be submitted at least an hour before the senate votes on cloture 1 this report was written by stanley

that is pending before the senate or on the unfinished business it is not in order except by unanimous consent to invoke cloture on bill before the senate has agreed to consider it on the other hand there is limit on the number of times that the senate can vote on motions to invoke cloture on bill amendment or other matter it is considering if an amendment has been offered to bill the senate may invoke cloture either on the bill or on the amendment sometimes senators prefer to invoke cloture on an amendment instead of bill because after the senate invokes cloture it may consider only amendments that are germane this germaneness requirement applies to amendments that are pending at the time that cloture is invoked as well as to amendments that senators offer after the senate has voted for cloture thus if the senate invokes cloture on bill the pr esiding officer immediately rules on whether any pending amendment is germane if the amendment is not germane it is not eligible for further consideration if the senators who wish to expedite passage of bill also support pending amendment to the bill they cannot invoke cloture on the bill without also killing the amendment they support their alternative is to ask the senate to invoke cloture on the amendment not on the bill doing so protects the amendment from becoming subject to the germaneness requirement after the senate agrees to the amendment however it may be necessary for the senate to invoke cloture second time on the bill as amended for additional information see senate rule xxii and riddick s senate procedure
