mission stuart jones reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary egis chief omar soliman told ambassador and visiting codel led by senator george voinovich december 31 that he is optimistic progress will be made on israelipalestinian negotiations however soliman was concerned with continuing israeli criticism of egyptian antismuggling efforts he was worried that the egyptians would not be able to work out an arrangement with the israelis for hajj pilgrims to return to gaza on iran soliman said that the usgs release of the national intelligence estimate had altered the calculus through which arab states are interacting with iran on iraq argued that the iraqi government needed to amend its constitution and that prime minister malaki should not deal with the iraqi people in sectarian way end summary 2 s soliman led off the new years eve meeting by telling the codel that the region is at special critical juncture egypt is americas partner sometimes we have our differences but egypt will continue to provide the usg with its knowledge and expertise on the critical regional issues such as lebanon and iraq the israelipalestinian conflict remains the core issue soliman contended peaceful resolution would be big blow to terrorist organizations that use the conflict as pretext for this reason president mubarak is committed to ending the israeliarab stalemate 3 s soliman applauded the administrations efforts commenting that annapolis had given hope and begun process the timing is right for progress based on four factors first the pa leadership is moderate and willing to negotiate second hamas is isolated and politically cut off in gaza third the israelis are ready for peace soliman assessed that the goi coalition is broad and strong and larger than rabins coalition of the midnineties fourth arab states are ready to see an end to the struggle 4 s soliman stressed that egypt stands ready to help the us effort the goe knows both the palestinians and the israelis and knows the obstacles to peace soliman recommended two steps be taken first both the israelis and palestinians must be pressed hard to sign an agreement which the us and international community could endorse to be implemented at the proper time second the us should insist that phase one of the roadmap should be completed before the end of 2008 5 s israelipalestinian conflict soliman opined that the palestinian authority was ready to sign an agreement but that establishment of state may take between 13 years while hamas is isolated politically and unable to stop an israelipa agreement it remains entrenched in gaza and it was unclear to soliman how long that would last at one point in the discussion soliman seemed to imply hamas may remain in control of gaza for more than year at another juncture he told senator voinovich that if negotiations proceeded briskly hamas may be forced to cede power in gaza in 34 months the bottom line for hamas according to soliman is that they must be forced to choose between remaining resistance movement or joining the political process they cannot have it both ways he said 6 s palestinian training soliman reiterated goe willingness to train and support palestinian security forces he claimed that the goe had training facilities ready but that he was waiting for an answer from us security coordinator general keith dayton note we have advised soliman that initial training of palestinian security forces will take place in jordan and that we will revisit the option of training in egypt this spring end note he continued that the goe would keep pressure on hamas but will maintain lowlevel contacts with hamas egypt he said wants hamas isolated the qassam rocket attacks must stop when they do stop the goe will ask israel to meet quiet with quiet 7 s border issues senator voinovich asked soliman why the israelis continue to report problems with egypts antismuggling efforts soliman said that the israelis do not complain to him directly and that goigoe cooperation and exchange of information continues he was at loss as to why israeli politicians continue to criticize egypt publicly the goe would like the usg to be included in the goigoe lawio discussions but the israelis continue to object they dont want witness in the room soliman said nevertheless soliman was willing to turn the page we have short time to reach peace we need it we need to wake up in the morning with news of terrorism explosions and news of more deaths we want everyone happy that is the egyptian dream 8 s syria congressman turner asked if iran andor syria might be play spoiler role soliman answered that syria wants desperately to halt the united nations special tribunal on the hariri assassination at the same time the sarg is ready to negotiate with the israelis and soliman believed that the goi also is ready syria soliman said can be induced to play constructive role but added that there are guarantees however on syrian performance 9 s nie regarding the usgs national intelligence estimate of irans nuclear program soliman was concerned that many in the arab world were recalculating their position vis vis iran based on an assumption that the nie represented usg policy shift soliman said the egyptians are working to correct this misimpression among arab states we tell the arab world dont be happy with the nie and dont warm up to iran we know that the united states will never allow iran to have nuclear bomb 10 s iran soliman said that iran remains significant threat to egypt it continues to influence shiaa in iraq and the gulf iran is supporting jihad and spoiling peace and has supported extremists in egypt previously if they were to support the muslim brotherhood this would make them our enemy he said the goe continues to press the iranian regime to turn over extremists given safe harbor in iran this issue he said will remain an obstacle to improving egyptianiranian relations soliman met with iranian former nuclear negotiator ali larijani earlier in the week larijani was in egypt on weeklong private visit 11 s iraq soliman said he remains concerned that the maliki government in iraq is not representing all iraqis ie the sunni population the goe has urged maliki not to deal with the iraqi people in sectarian way and to amend to constitution to allow greater sunni representation in addition the iraqi government must remove militias from the ranks of the army and police in the long run soliman did not think that the decrease in violence would be sustainable absent these two steps in addition iranian influence is problematic soliman said that the goe had worked to reconcile 21 clans and tribes in iraq with good results and that this kind of efforts had to continue he assessed that both sistani and sadr were practical men and able to be dealt with 12 u delegation composition senator george voinovich roh congressman mike turner roh congressman steve pearce rnm congressman
