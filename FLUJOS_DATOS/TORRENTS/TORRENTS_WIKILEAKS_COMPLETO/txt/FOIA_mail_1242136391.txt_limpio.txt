from peterthorne peterthornemetofficegovuk to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re crutem4 date tue 12 may 2009 095311 0100 phil i cant believe that people think it remotely reasonable behaviour to send that sort of crud theyd never say that to your face i guess their home is just that much more cosy and impersonal cash would need spending in fy0910 as i understand it but someone for six months assuming they could start this sept could be route forwards it would be good paper for them careerwise hadsst3 is in first draft form im not sure what papers you assume will arise i think we were thinking of developing hadsst3 and crutem4 seperately but in joined up way and publishing as separate papers and then doing paper that covers combination to hadcrut4 and perhaps for example da sensitivity to error model assumptions peter on tue 20090512 at 0943 0100 phil jones wrote peter below is one of three emails i got last night following new thread on ca ill ignore them and wait for the foi requests which we have dealt with before i did send an email to thomas stocker alerting him up to comment 17 these are all about who changed what in various chapters of ar4 i expect these to get worse with ar5 anyway back to the matter in hand im planning to come down to see ian simpson probably on june 1 ill get back to david on this later today weve done some of what you aim for weve sorted out the new canadian wmo numbers and have extra data for australia and nz in australia comes in by email once month ill have to find new contact in nz now jim salinger has been sacked but its only small country iran is pretty good the us is the large bit of work the us already has better station density than almost anywhere else so the effort wont make much difference but it is probably worth doing as it would reduce errors even if noone understands them glad you got the poor paper to review soon we will be adding data for the greater alpine region 32 sites which go back to 1760 these data all have adjustments for screen issues prior to about 1880 this makes summers cooler by about 04 deg c and winters about the same similarly we will also add load of stations for spain again with screen biases in there is probably more we could add for european countries but again it is likely to make little difference except to lower errors the real issue is south america and africa we have the whole argentine network but this is only digitized back to 1959 and the data we had wasnt that bad anyway problem in south america is brazil africa is ok in few countries but poor in many we could add loads in china issue with all this is that most of the additions wouldnt be available from whenever we stop we can probably do the us in real time like australia weve also been trying to add in the precip for many of these extra stations not the alpine countries and spain there is timing issue as i understand hadsst3 wont be available to be merged with until it is successfully reviewed so need to consider this as well final issue is people here were ok for most of 2010 for all we have good student finishing phd by sept who wants to stay so couldnt really do anything till then cheers phil dear mr jones as uk tax payer from the productive economy could you please explain why you restrict access to data sets that are gathered using tax payer funds eg crutem3 can you believe how embarassing this is to uk tax payer putting up with your amateurish non disclosure of enviromental information for reference httpwwwclimateauditorgp5962 refers to your absymal attitude to public data although this is just the latest in an embarassing set of reasonable requests from cru who the hell do you think you are there will of course be an foi on the back of this regards ian at 0854 12052009 peterthorne wrote phil there may be some money this fy substantial sums management here are casting around for ideas as its to be spent this fy its largely going to be consultant work as we never have cats chance in hell of recruiting on that timescale what resource do you think we could contract from cru you harry others for doing crutem4 which i would maintain had two aims 1 rescue and incorporation of recent data im pinging ncdc too to see what they could do visavis collating and sending the nonwmo us stations and other data you may not have their bilats may have sig extra stations for iran aus canada etc 2 more robust error model that led to production of set of equi probable potential gridded products hadsst3 will do simnilarly so we could combine to form hadcrut4 equiprobable this error model determination would ideally be modular so that we could assess how wrong our assumptions about the error would have to be to matter and what error sources are important for our ability to characterise the long term trend trivially these will be the red noise i know but then most people seem blind to the trivial sadly the hadcrut3 paper clearly started well down that path but recent paper i had the displeasure of reviewing on my way back from wmo shows its poorly understood deliberately so in this particular case we have meeting thursday if it passes muster there well put it to decc and see what happens promises this would mean wed have hadcrut4 which would be hadsst3 crutem4 each with more data and better error models well before ar5 which seems sensible mr fraudit never goes away does he how often has he been told that we dont have permission ho hum oh i heard that fraudits santer et comment got rejected thatll brighten your day at least teensy bit peter peter
