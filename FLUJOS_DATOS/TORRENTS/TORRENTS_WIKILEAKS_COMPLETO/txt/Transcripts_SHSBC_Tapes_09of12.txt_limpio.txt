has preclearsound versions of these tapes please check the others and post differences statement of purpose our purpose is to promote religious freedom and the scientology religion by spreading the scientology tech across the internet the cof abusively suppresses the practice and use of scientology tech by freezone scientologists it misuses the copyright laws as part of its suppression of religious freedom they think that all freezoners are squirrels who should be stamped out as heretics by their standards all christians moslems mormons and even nonhassidic jews would be considered to be squirrels of the jewish religion the writings of lrh form our old testament just as the writings of judaism form the old testament of christianity we might not be good and obedient scientologists according to the definitions of the cof whom we are in protest against but even though the christians are not good and obedient jews the rules of religious freedom allow them to have their old testament regardless of any jewish opinion we ask for the same rights namely to practice our religion as we see fit and to have access to our holy scriptures without fear of the cof copyright terrorists we ask for others to help in our fight even if you do not believe in scientology or the scientology tech we hope that you do believe in religious freedom and will choose to aid us for that reason thank you the fz bible association shsbc9 renum 9 7 jun 61 points in assessing points in assessing lecture given on 7 june 1961 based on clearsound only thank you i was going to say i can always tell when somebody is mad at they dont come to my lectures that happens to be coordinated fact you know that people who dont havent attended my lectures in the past in central organizations eventually squirreled in some fashion odd peculiar so i always look around to see whos there you know its my security check all right now this is the 7th of june isnt it audience right uhhuh marcabian intelligence report date something or other did you hear about the marcabians who had to pdh the thedeans who had to in order to make frank sullivan safe for democracy anyhow ah its wonderful life all right now i lectured to you yesterday on hcob june 5 1961 processes allowed tried to give you some very fast general coverage concerning it and this bulletin was issued to you today this bulletin is based totally and completely on what we have found people would do and what people can do and they can do these and although i can tell you innumerable ways to punch buttons on cases innumerable ways to become aesthetically telepathic about cases read their facsimiles and all kinds of weird things like this it doesnt happen that over the last eleven years people have uniformly been able to duplicate this so as result we have techniques and technologies and we have taken it all down out of the beautiful esoterics of esoteria and have got it well situated now into the ponderous clank of something that can be totally understood and duplicated okay the trick of communication in dianetics and scientology is the interesting trick back of all the tricks that is the one thing that has been the most difficult and is probably the greatest achievement other people might look at other things but learning how to get things understood is one of the most difficult things without developing large vocabulary we could easily do this by inventing eighteen dictionaries and the 8000 new terms you have to learn as medical student and so forth and weve got somewhere around 400 terms that are 472 terms i think include all of the oddball ones we dont even use in common usage i think scientologists vocabulary probably isnt over about 75 or 80 words that are completely strange and peculiar and have their own meanings but once you define these words once these words are defined people look at them and realize there was such word see so weve had to make something that sounds like english you see then mean something and its very odd as soon as i get out the dictionary which im doing i do that between 700 am and 705 on my schedule i must have an overt on buzz saws though i did get to bed for couple hours sleep this morning and i more than closed my eyes than farmer jones opened up on buzz saw and you know he is perfectly tuneless on the thing he cant play it worth darn so he has now got another black mark in his book and our books and factually not for that reason at all everybody is being very fed up because they open up his book now and they find nothing but total black pages you know hes run out of black marks but trying to communicate to him for instance anything about anything is very good example heres an actual example you try to explain what the situation is all about you draw blank you draw complete blank but he responds like mad to processing even anything as corny as touch assist i ran an engram on him one day standing out in the front drive the odd part of it was his hand recovered and everything else hed been kicked by cow in milk pail and at first he thought the milk pail had kicked him he didnt know when it happened he couldnt locate when it occurred it was sometime between breakfast and supper he didnt know at what moment what had happened he had clue and he was having rough time and his hand was all crippled up and he couldnt milk so i stood him out here in the front drive and ran out bad hand he became rather pathetically curious afterwards as to what we were doing theres language to talk about it you see thats the trouble you have you see the nolanguage barriers its the nolanguage barrier these words do not exist in the language because the understanding didnt exist in the language now words are based on agreedupon understandings and english is johnnycomelately language most of these postulates hadnt been made or thought of for the last 200 trillion years youre going to express them in english people dont even know these principles however you tell him definition of word carefully using oh i dont know using twenty thirty words something like that definition of word he doesnt latch onto the word rapidly because the concept is brandnew to him and hes rather stonied by the definition this is something thats never occurred to him before he can sense the truth of it something is going ding ding ding thats true you know thats true you know but he cant quite grasp it and while hes still in the throes of grasping this recognizing there is truth there if you threw right on top of it condensation of your explanation and his cognition in just the few letters contained in one word youve almost collapsed the track on him dont you see he has to realize the principle before he can take the word you got that it goes reversewise child has to find out that the stove is warm before he begins to understand what warm stove means dont you see now on thought level they have to understand the concept well this is almost like processing it used to be fellows would read the axioms and read things about it and get all sorts of cognitions and you know dianetics evolution of science we have numerous cases of people in hospitals having been given this or finding it and just reading the book and throwing back the covers and getting up and sliding into their shoes much to the horrors of the nurse and leaving and never being sick again what did this it was basically resurge of hope that there was some understanding of all this dont you see but it was the understanding alone so the understanding operates as processing you got it it operates that way its clarifications well until you have somebody who has wrapped his wits around some of the principles so that he isnt still going let see are all men bad are all men good i wonder if all men are good all men are bad there probably is two different kinds of people theres the good people and the bad people i knew nut one time that used to say well there are two kinds of people there are happy people and unhappy people and youre an unhappy person and then she would add gloomily and im happy person see she had this all worked out and if you all of sudden shoot something in and say people are thetans and theres the overtmotivator sequence and what they do to others why they think is done to them boy youve just fired philosophic salvo of fleet intensity see wham you know and everything is reverberating from horizon to horizon you see and you say now do you get the word overtmotivator sequence oh you dont understand the word yet well youre stupid and in training people they actually have to learn the principles before they learn the words thatll make this dictionary rather interesting reading because they look at the word and theyre perfectly willing to commit that to memory and then they read the definition and the fleet salvo reverberates from horizon to horizon and they say what word was that what word was that you know you know thats submerged thats gone what are we connected with what planet is this you know that kind of thing and then they finally come around and they say they look at it again and then they look at it again and then they run into it with familiarity and then they get more and more familiar with it and then all of sudden they know the word see they can package it because the understanding of it is so easily understood that it is thoughtwise transmittable you got the idea until that time they cant learn vocabulary now you can do anything you want to to teach people how to learn vocabulary but you run against the principle of the communication of the idea that is packaged in the word and these ideas have not been familiar to man all right doing that in relatively simple way might look complicated to people simply because their basic difficulty is trying to grasp some principle and they havent got good idea of what an overtmotivator sequence is and every time they try to face it you know it sort of blows the words overtmotivator sequence they become meaningless and what they havent done is grasp the principle of the overtmotivator sequence it is not that they havent grasped the word they could spout the word parrotfashion but they cannot understand this other principle dont you see see what were connecting up when were training people actually we know would have sounder method of educating somebody than teaching him the principles of scientology under the guise of teaching him the vocabulary of scientology got the idea they couldnt help but have repercussion all right now similarly the operational actions which we undertake apparently are liable to shortness of understanding or misunderstanding therefore what will be done and what can be done by person in scientology by scientologist is monitored by what he can easily understand and what he is willing to perform and you have that right here and this is quite triumph this hcob june 5 now to nontrained person this bulletin would probably be gobbledygook because it doesnt explain too much here its dependent on other publications you see it says cchs well of course weve been through the ropes and we know what the cchs are but that wouldnt mean anything to oh i dont know menninger presuming hes still alive cchs oh must be something made up something made up you say its repetitive thing its actually control communication and havingness when you apply control you obtain communication which gives the preclear havingness and it is method of entrance on cases which is rather infallible and thats what cchs mean look where youd leave menninger see he wouldnt be around there thats all in the first place youve enunciated to him principle that psychiatry if it had any teeth left would give them all if they had formula by which they could actually bring back some sanity see they havent got that so youve thrown him this formula and control to him is electricshocking people and communicating with people is electricshocking people and havingness to him is electric shock or psychosis so it adds up to him well control communication itll drive people crazy get the idea his adjudication you see how hed arrive at the point where itd drive people crazy because his havingness is psychotics this is all the havingness the man has obviously see so control thats electric shocking people and communication thats electric shocking people because he knows you cant see and havingness well thats electric shocks and psychosis oh psychosis you can have psychosis so that if you ran the cchs on anybody youd drive them crazy and they electricshock people because it drives them crazy you see youre baffled because you dont realize that youre dealing with shortcircuited thinking you know therefore you do it fact equals fact equals contrary fact so you dramatize it so youre not even in that case dealing with thinking as the im not berating these people im merely saying there couldnt be any thinking because theres bulletin after bulletin that they themselves put out continually saying that surgery and electric shock do nothing but harm people and they go right on ordering them and doing them you see so that it must be shortcircuited thinkingness so youre not penetrating at that level at all now how are you going to penetrate you say to this fellow all right now look joburg processing check that is series of questions which are asked the person to obtain from them data which they ordinarily have not handed out and right away menninger says ah catholic church see thuthup so we now have the fact that we are driving people crazy by using the mechanisms of the catholic church you get how you get nothink out of this this would be the nothink well its very interesting to see how these things add up but they are not gobbledygook to you because youve experienced great many of these things experienced them all the only thing you possibly havent experienced is being clear and you possibly have not seen clear floating needle as matter of fact i told an auditor in hgc london the other day that they ought to take the pc around and show the auditors clear free floating needle and i got into the most oddball yippetyyap you ever heard of why because this is an unfamiliarity were in zone of unfamiliarity and even the despatch was misinterpreted it caused great deal of randomity this despatch the pc got hold of it and interpreted it that i had was forcing upon her the concept that she was clear the auditor must have interpreted it similarly because never showed it this clear floating needle type needle to any of the other auditors the only thing i wanted them to do if anybody had cared to read the thing the only thing i wanted them to do was to be able to look at floating needle nobody had ever seen one up there see and this is floating needle and it was wonderful opportunity for somebody to see floating needle instead of that pc is arc broke and it has to be run in the next session look at the randomity that suddenly developed here pretty wild you know you say auditors i want you to show floating needle pc has an arc break auditor doesnt go anywhere near anybody pc has present time problem the auditor is mad at because ive upset the pc see pc was haunting hco shouldnt have been watching things coming in over the telex oh wild well look thats the only thing on this bulletin that the auditors in london wouldnt have fair familiarity with at this stage and it caused randomity got it so it takes little while to develop an understanding of things right you shouldnt be teaching somebody above their zones of reality really but you can reach them with processing and they then do gain subjective reality on the thing and you can reach them in numerous ways dont you see and you actually could teach them bunch of these philosophiclevel principles and then theyd get even get vocabulary if they got subjective grasp on these things but its an auditing process it blows enturbulation off the case and while it is blowing off the case the case feels confused so the instant reaction of menninger is this is terribly confusing i havent got anything to do with it i had psychiatrist reading dianetics and he was rushing out every few minutes and putting the electrodes on somebody and coming back in and he says yes yes ive looked at this book ive this book came in the other day it came in the other day and i looked at it and ive looked it over and ive reported it to the association i think its disgraceful and he says im horney i said well what philosophy do you follow in your psychoanalysis he says im horney man myself im horney man and he rushed out and strapped and shocked somebody else and came back in again and he says im horney man and i said well i saw it while he was gone i saw the book horney karen horney so i said well what is horney what is the horney offshoot of freudian analysis and so on he says i dont know i never read it itd be different if i was telling you that for gag but actually thats totally factual unbelievably true he was horney man but hed never read anything by horney i dont know how do you get it telepathic i think theyd call it probably freudianly telepathic emission something like that if you keep book on shelf long enough why you get it by contagion or something maybe some years later he expected as long as the book sat on the shelf why he would become all of sudden imbued with its characteristics well anyway none of this bulletin to scientologist is apparently incomprehensible and the only place scientologist gets in trouble out in the field and untrained is in doing goals assessments and trying to run sop goals he can run into too many things now for instance weve just run into one on case today case was apparently flat on level on the cases terminal apparently flat but wasnt wasnt couldnt have been because the case was still worried about the level well we were running the principle of running the rock slam out of the needle rather than running the motion out of the tone arm and now question enters is this right i mean is it right just to run the rock slam out or should you actually flatten that level but nevertheless this case does not answer the problem because this case might have had present time problem not detected by the auditor or after the rudiments were checked out suddenly had present time problem see the rudiments sort of boost the cases reality and all of sudden the case realizes it has present time problem so now doesnt get rock slam you see the process isnt biting actually their mind is on something else so the auditor thinks it is flat tone arm motion reduced in other words by reason of rudiment out and the tone arm moving so little that the auditor would be brought to the conclusion that it was flat i would be brought to the conclusion it was flat reading the report dont you see so we go off and assess for another level and then we come back and find the rock slam there 100 percent because some ptps have been handled on the pc in other words we have this odd adjudication that we can put on running terminals and that is that if pc has rudiment out level can look flat which isnt and you can put that down in your book because weve just discovered it and proved it out factually because when we went back to this level two levels have been run since but the case was bogging and in patchup of cases on general run of prehav and on patchup of cases in general of general run of the terminal of the goal if case isnt making much progress you had better go back thats why you must keep your auditors reports this is the way to patch one up is go back and pick the earliest level run and that might not have been flat and flatten the level and come on up to the next level after that and flatten that because that will now probably be unflat in other words youve got to flatten every level now that youve left unflat and all levels will tend to be unflat since the level you left unflat you got it so you must keep your reports the case apparently bogs well the case had ptp and an arc break or something like that and it wasnt detected and for that reason the tone arm ceased to move and you say the level is flat and its not and you run few more levels and all of sudden the case is having more and more ptps and more and more obsessed with upsets and problems and so forth well the way to patch that up is to go back and review the tone arm figures on each level that was run at its end see get the end run review the last twenty minutes of every process level that has been run on the pc okay and pick the earliest one that you suspect may not be flat got it and to be on the safe side pick the earliest one that you suspect but you could there could be little bit later one that you might suspect more but you wouldnt quite be able to decide well if you couldnt quite decide it usually will be quite obvious to you but if you couldnt decide well go back and pick the earliest candidate and run it because theyll flatten off rather quickly you got it now take all the motion out of the level this time just run it down to point of where it just grinds to brakesmoking halt hm now what else would you do to patch it up well if youve done good goals assessment youve got the hidden standards you know the person always looks and finds out if his right ear is longer burning so he knows the process is working this is the standards lots of people have these standards and these standards are actually present time problems of magnitude of long duration and youre running case with pt problem that has hidden standard see well why run this now you would do much better to use what it says here about handling problems of longtime duration under routine 2 second page problems of long duration now we mean by problem of long duration years or within this lifetime the problem must have existed for years or in this lifetime otherwise its pt problem its less than year its only months or weeks hours minutes seconds its present time problem of short duration these are simply artificial labels to give you an order of magnitude so the difference between present time problem of short duration and present time problem of long duration are quite important to you because you handle present time problem of short duration always in the rudiments only dont take it into prehav or into processes or anything like that just put it into the rudiments and the rudiments processes that are supposed to be run in the rudiments will handle it and you shouldnt do any more about it than that but present time problem of long duration which means more than year and less than lifetime this lifetime see you do terminal assessment just like you were doing goals assessment and you just keep hammering and hammering and hammering and running and running and its not something you do in twenty minutes the way ive been getting it in auditor reports well we did terminals assessment for the present time problem of long duration and then we assessed for the level and we immediately got to running it and you look up at the assessment and its five minutes oh five minutes how interesting you mean you could get list of all terminals which might be involved in this problem and do an assessment by elimination in five minutes oh yes like hell you could youre looking at couple of sessions man lets get real this person has hidden standard his right ear he knows whether processes are working because his right ear doesnt burn but when his right ear is burning why then he knows process isnt working you had case go through hgc london very short time ago who had some kind of peculiar thing of some kind it was something as unlovely i think as if you will excuse vaginal discharge and when this lessened the process was working and when it got increased the processes werent working and everything was being barometered by this rather fantastic action now thats nothing against anybody youd have to find that out oh look there is something connected here that is real to the pc it must be more real to the preclear than the preclears case by automatic definition because the pc uses it as an indicator for his case so that this thing must then be substitute for his case you got that i mean substitute for the case thats why you must know about hidden standards in other words the hidden standard is more real to the pc than any case or life difficulties he is having because he tries to find out if it is functioning or not functioning hes sort of packing an emeter around on the side of his head dont you see you got the idea well his attention obviously this is merely problem of attention there hasnt been lecture by the way on attention and dispersed attention attention units and so forth since i think something ridiculous like the end of june 1950 at the elks hall in it was must have been someplace in new jersey elizabeth mmmm the elks hall in elizabeth new jersey there was whole hour lecture at that particular time on the subject of attention units and how they are trapped in the bank and the individual is running only on 1 percent or 2 percent of the theoretical 100 percent of attention available to him because his attention is pinned down in other places of the bank you see well thats very very interesting to us today to all of sudden have this old one suddenly leap into view fullarmed see because here it is here it is youre working with it right now youre assessing for goal to find out where the person has most of his attention youre assessing for the terminal and immediately the goal would disintensify that you find the terminal really because of course the attention is really fixed on the goal because it is fixed on the terminal and the second it gets fixed on the terminal youve rather unfixed it on the goal so the goal will read less after youve been assessing terminals little while all right your next point here is that if the pc has his attention on burning right ear well for heavens sakes its practically total computation sitting right there on the side of the pcs head so what do you do you say what is it now has that been have you worried about that for some time you say well what would have to happen to you for you to know that scientology works that is the cute question the pc always answers up and they give you some of the most remarkable answers you ever heard in your life well to know that scientology really works my daughter would have to get over her hives oh come on this persons attention isnt even on himself but nevertheless that is the answer well now has your daughter having hives been problem to you for long oh well yes specialists take him up to pennsylvania take him up to wyoming and weve gone down south weve gone practically every place weve imported special bees to sting her and followed the very best directions we possibly can she still has these hives and we keep rubbing pickle juice into them all the time and every night i have to get up five times night and rub pickle juice into her hives so that she can sleep and this has been going on for some years and i actually feel guilty about it myself you see because one day she walked up to the stove when she was just little child and she did and i spilled onion juice all over her well now ever since that time i think shes had these hives hey what better indicator do you want you say something about the problem and your pc goes off like small firecracker see like string of ladyfinger firecrackers you know pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pc real interested yap yap yap yap yap yap brrrrrr yap yap yap yap yap yap where do you think their attention is attention is on daughters hives so to clear this pc you have to get her daughters hives out of the way but you get her concern as pcs attention off of these hives if the hives cure up its totally coincidental but they might now heres the hidden standard and this hidden standard keeps more people from getting released or cleared than any other single thing i know of except withholds see so its just junior in rank to withholds for holding people up and holding cases up you know and actually the present time problem is right on the goals chain always is otherwise it couldnt be problem of long duration its somehow connected with it so if you scrape the top off the case assesses much more rapidly thats the least that would happen and you might find yourself thoroughly straight on the goals line if you did very good assessment youve shortcircuited the whole thing and this is running like bomb and after youve run three levels on this presenttimeproblem terminal of long duration you assess the thing very carefully and you dont find the prehav scale live on dozen levels oh coo you must be straight on the pcs line and it didnt take you seventytwo hours to do the assessment it took you more like about five so you get the values of hidden standard its something to pay attention to something very interesting besides being terribly amusing ill swear i have heard some of the weirdest statements that homo sap has ever made im sure when i talk to them about hidden standards what would have to happen for you to know that scientology worked oh well well confidentially whenever ive been processed i see whether or not my right foot ticks and if it stops ticking then i know were on the way but if it starts ticking i know were off you get the most interesting answers now you say what else you dont ever ask this but ive can pursue the question line in other directions and it becomes practically ridiculous you say what else do you use this right foot for you wouldnt ask that in processing but you get the most fascinating answers they sometimes use it to find out if people are mad at them what the weather is going to be whether or not the food is going to agree with them whether or not theyre going to be sick you know in epilepsy the fellow always knows certain feeling when hes going to have fit see and he knows if he gets certain condition hes going to have fit well they use these hidden standards the same way they know theyre going to have some bad luck well the nervous stomach for instance fellows nervous stomach turns on he knows hes going to have some bad luck he knows theres some bad luck coming up one way or the other he uses his stomach to measure the future you find all sorts of people this is the most common one now what would have to happen for you to know that scientology works well my nervous stomach would have to turn off oh you say your nervous stomach would have to turn off well very interesting how long have you had this nervous stomach well ever since i was child well now does it ever turn off in processing has anything ever turned it off in processing i keep watching it then all of sudden brrrrrr yap yap yap yap and this auditor and that auditor and we ran this and we ran that and we did this and we did that and the other thing and so on and so on and so on and this stomach stomach stomach stomach stomach stomach stomach see hidden standard hidden standard hidden standard you got the idea well its almost an assessment when you strike the fire on the pcs interest see hes going to be insession on that man is that pc going to be insession well hes already willing to talk to the auditor about it hes already interested in it so his attention must be parked around there someplace now the mistake we have made is not assessing this nervous stomach we can ask all sorts of embarrassing questions such as whose stomach is it we can do presession 38 type terminal search you can do all sorts of things with this thing they thats the who or what who and when whats wrong and who had that trouble and when did he have it it sometimes knocks the whole problem out just discovering this but now instead of running presession 38 type of operation on it it is faster action but more not always faster action but more certain you know in the interests of certainty is to do terminals assessment by elimination on this somatic on this standard item is it his ear is it his head whose head whose ear you got the idea and we just whose might it be and pc guesses about this thing and it might be this ones and it might be that ones and it might be an you just write all those names down you see it might be his inner ear so you say inner ear and it might be his lobe you know and you write down lobe and it might be his aeroglopis and you say his what dont challenge it what you want to find out is how to spell it its his aeroglopis and thats the mechanism that lets air in and out of the ear and you never even knew it existed neither does medical science nobody has ever known this one before but the pc you see and youll find that the reason this line of questioning is so intriguing is because of course you have hit the primary source of individuation on the pc this is the one that makes him different from everybody its sort of he knows who he is hes the one that has an earache so hes different than everybody else so its the least duplicated area of the bank so of course itll fire off as an automaticity because its most out of communication and therefore most out of control so locating the hidden standard and assessing it by elimination by which you get long list of terminals oh i dont know somebodys nervous stomach you ought to wind up with list of terminals of something like two hundred something like that big well ever since weve started doing goals assessments on highly therapeutic level it is nothing for people to come up with 546 goals and then come up with 546 terminals on that one goal this takes some time and it takes some doing you dont do assessments in part of session and then get the show on the road because youre usually wrong i should talk to you about something in assessments thats just occurred to i mentioned it to one auditor short time ago and used the phrase and its never been used before but it certainly is something that you should know something about its called cognition surge and it can throw your whole assessment awry its cognition surge and this is the source of most of the charge you get on the bank it isnt when youre going over whole bunch of goals and that sort of thing and the individual all of sudden says well what do you know i have always wanted to shoot magpies and i dont even know what they are the emeter will react rather violently its cognition surge its release of electrical charge that goes along with the person having cognition and if you watch an emeter carefully often when theyre having cognition real cognition you will get marked fall well when youre assessing and you ask for another terminal the person sometimes all of sudden says hah what do you know airplane pilot of course see and you get steep fall that has nothing to do with anything really but the fact that hes cognited that he might have had something to do with airplane pilots and this is what its falling on its sort of on the assoc possible association and youll get mad drop now another thing when youre sometimes assessing for level which is more common the individual all of sudden realizes that there is such thing as fighting wasps this has just never occurred to him before see and you do youre reading along youre reading the assessment and youre saying it says fighting scrapping knifing burning and so forth all right now right about the time youve entered in this line you say fighting and you get great big drop on the needle and you say boy with that much drop that must be it i wont assess any further and have you just pulled bloomer because it says fighting and drops like mad and thats why you always do them at least twice you see once up and once down and the next one burning scrapping burning now you come back over the list again and it says fighting and it is just as dead as mackerel and you say well that is the most peculiar thing how was it so hot when now its so cold well you read cognition surge the person its whaddaya know there is possibility of some time or another fighting wasp you know haha what do you think of that incredible nobody could possibly fight wasp i always have known that and heres the idea but its funny thing of ive never thought of this idea before dont you see it isnt the terminal level that you should run it is simply the fact that he had an idea at that instant when you come back over it again its flat theres nothing disappears off meter faster sometimes when you assessing terminals you will find that terminal after terminal in turn pick up the cognition surge and it only lasts for about five or ten questionings on the terminal it just this fellow has never thought of himself as having been even remotely connected with being rocket jockey this is not possible connection dont you see and not being possible connection of course you get tremendous blauw bang thud at the idea of being connected with rocket jockey but it doesnt have anything to do with the fact that the terminal is rocket jockey got the idea cognition surge actually occurs when an associated terminal or associated level to the one youre looking for blows off rather violently and this happens during assessments of goals terminals and levels and when you get disassociation all of sudden the guy all of sudden gets rid of that one your meter will react and your meter wont react again and the source of probably most bad assessments or most assessment errors is when the d of p sets the guy down it falls off the pin and they say thats the terminal its not the terminal that was the charge terminal made leaving see now you ask him again about the same terminal and you get little flip and you ask him again about it and man is it gone but sometimes terminal will look terribly hot for about twelve recounts just look hotter than pistol and the pc is getting interested in it but the pcs interest is not because he is that terminal or is being that terminal but because that terminal is blowing he has just never inspected the fact that his unknown terminal was connected with this now known terminal well the inspection of this will give you an emeter reaction but its very shortduration reaction thats why on goals terminal you grind them out by elimination that is why on the terminal assessment you grind them out by elimination and pt problem of long duration you always grind out by elimination because youll just get nothing but cognition surge after cognition surge after cognition surge after cognition surge and its the one thats left you want because all of these things youve entered already random area you got goal fast you see which is actually to do something about only were not quite sure what or to learn lessons from burning right ear you see and youre in this brrrrrrr area and so you get all sorts of fireworks on the meter you know and terminals blow and ideas and he remembers people he never heard of before dont be too surprised if you get couple of hundred terminals and by the time youve got them all assessed he says what burning ear see dont be too surprised if this occurs you get how you do this pt problem of long duration now after youve got the terminal and you do assess it on the prehav scale you of course now run it the same way you do goals terminal you just run the levels flat but they run flat awfully fast so your twentyminute rule doesnt apply you kind of have to watch the needle and you still can leave one unflat by the way have to go back and pick it up various things have to be done have to retrack your steps thats the only other thing i know of in here that you probably dont know didnt know how to do i hope you know some more about it now is the assessment for this because i noticed most flubs at the present instant are now being made in assessing and running present time problems of long duration and the flub just stems from these things they dont make terminal list and they dont do assessment by elimination and they grab too quick at these cognition surges got em all right once more i didnt ask you for any questions today some of you are now going to have terrible withholds okay is there any fast one anybody really has to know before session tomorrow all right thank you very much good night end of lecture
