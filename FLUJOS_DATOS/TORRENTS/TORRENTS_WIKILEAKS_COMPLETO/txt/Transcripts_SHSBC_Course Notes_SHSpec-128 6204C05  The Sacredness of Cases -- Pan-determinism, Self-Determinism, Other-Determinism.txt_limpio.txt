6204c05 shspec128 the sacredness of cases pandeterminism selfdeterminism otherdeterminism why is your case sacred if it is sacred dont attack preserve protect survive now we understand theetieweetie case to theetieweetie case everything is sacred his attitude is mustnt attack it mustnt be attacked must protect preserve survive this attitude especially applies to his case that is the only reason anyone ever has for results in processing the secret of this universe is that it is sacred universe and shouldnt be attacked it is too sacred this puts every poor thetan who comes into it on shouldnt attack which has the result of putting attack on automatic there are three states of mind 1 pandeterminism one can control or attack or whatever one chooses on ones own choice on either side of the situation this gets into bad repute when it is confused with shady control 2 selfdeterminism this carries with it the idea that the other side of the group or situation is bad 3 otherdeterminism this nuts he is never for himself he is always for the other guy in any argument he is reasonable he will defend whatever you attack he claims to be impartial but he is not he is for whatever you are against all kinds of conflicts arise with pandeterminism over how you will continue it people generally dont continue it but slop off into selfdeterminism politics is based on the inability to choose successor benevolent monarchy is ideal for example except for that problem any form of politics is only necessary because you cannot guarantee that good successor will follow benevolent monarch so existing forms of government are all out of pt in the future good king would be pandetermined but people cant guarantee that if he died they would get another one so they have to become specialists or fascists or whatever when government cant guarantee that you wont get choice of government by civil war you have an unstable government this is what sank the roman empire for the next thirteen hundred years you got the divine right of kings lineal succession etc this all resulted from the failure of the roman republic this is essentially asking the ge to take over the rule otherdeterminism is hard to see because it is lower scale mockery of pandeterminism this person is never selfdetermined always otherdetermined such person is not for himself if everybody is against you then you must be against you also otherwise you are out of agreement with the whole universe this is the first level of case that will give you trouble since he is not for himself being appealed to to run out his engrams to benefit himself wont have any effect all cases at various parts of the track get stuck in one of these phases periods of illness demonstrate this phenomenon people who are under heavy attack or heavy responsibility can get into it easily leader in war gets otherdetermined partly because of overts committed during the war the state of mind can differ for different areas of life and different activities only in the area where person is consistently otherdetermined do you have persistent somatic he is attacking himself so he can have somatic when we get to the point where the whole individual is pandetermined selfdetermined or otherdetermined we have chronic states of sanity 3dxx terminal can be in one of several different states 1 pandetermined you wont find it because it will never have hung up 2 selfdetermined it will be somewhat troublesome and part of gpm 3 otherdetermined it will nearly whip you because you can never help the pc in the vicinity of the otherdetermined valence people are most likely to keep and protect otherdetermined valences that are totally against their best interests it is difficult to move person on the track near one of these because every time you hit them they survive and the pc doesnt the pc is always the loser the pc will get very reasonable about the terminal he appears pandetermined and helpful but he is actually being otherdetermined it doesnt stop there when you get into that area the terminal will attack the pc this accounts for the selfdestructive impulse in man death wish as in freud the world operates on the idea that everyone else is on kick of selfpreservation but they are not some are on succumb to an auditor or organization they look to be executioners we only get in trouble when we refuse to fill the complementary role the thing to do when someone goes around slandering the organization is not to sue him for slander but to present him with confession and an award of damages for having slandered all legally drawn up present it to him and he will go ahead and sign it and you can execute it in court the guy has only one enemy himself if you keep worsening the deal in legal matters he will eventually settle up in auditing dont make the prepcheck questions easier make them tougher since the pc will only buy things that make them think they are bad succumbing person in this state will make things worse than is actually true he will admit to more things than he has actually done when prepchecked this is the best stuff to audit since he is nuttiest where he is otherdetermined he is also hard to audit insofar as he is trying to succumb he will convert whatever you give him in the way of help into motivator otherdeterminism is successful sacredity an otherdetermined person has agreed 100 that certain valence or identity is something that shouldnt be attacked otherdetermined valences have as their least common denominator shouldnt attack and must be preserved if you wanted to be perfectly safe in this society what would you be your answer is sacredness item anything that you cant attack becomes an otherdeterminism never selfdeterminism to some degree all 3dxx items are otherdeterminisms and the whole gpm itself is an otherdeterminism that is seeking to destroy the person who has got it sacredity is trap if you operate on the principle of dont speak evil of the dead dont attack the dead you are essentially saying dont asis the dead and what you get is bank stacked up with the dead when you operate on the principle dont be mean to communicate with the sick you get sick this is the result of the idea that sickness is sacred anything sacred is safe and mustnt be attacked it is very attractive to become such thing and thetans do valence is sacredity shouldnt attack shouldnt really look at shouldnt comm with therefore you get more and more otherdeterminism the most sacred of all the pcs items will be the one of highest otherdeterminism and the one that is most destructive of the pcs own selfdeterminism if it cant be attacked it cant be controlled or reached havingness it cant be communicated with or defeated so it will completely determine the pc it will overwhelm him it is dangerous it is sacred so that is the key to the gpm the person is it while it destroys him it slaps the guy back with somatics every time he puts his head up or tries to be anything other than this otherdetermined valence
