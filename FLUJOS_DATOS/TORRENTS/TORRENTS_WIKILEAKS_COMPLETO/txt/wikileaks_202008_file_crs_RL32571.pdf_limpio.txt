cotton program summary in late 2002 brazil initiated world trade organization wto dispute settlement case ds267 agains t specific provisions of the us cotton program on september 8 2004 wto dispute settlement ds panel ruled against the united states on several key issues in case ds267 the ruling was upheld on appeal to the wtos appellate body ab on march 3 2005 key findings included 1 us domestic cotton subsidies exceeded wto commitments of the 1992 benchmark year thereby losing the protection afforded by the peace clause which had previously shielded them from substantive challenges 2 the two major types of direct payments made under us farm prog rams production flexibility contract payments of the 1996 farm act and the di rect payments of the 2002 farm act do not qualify for wto exemptions from reduction commitments as fully decoupled income support and should therefore c ount against the peace clause limits 3 step 2 program payments are prohibited s ubsidies 4 us export credit guarantees are effectively export subsidies making th em subject to previously notified export subsidy commitments and 5 us domestic support measures that are contingent on market prices have resulted in excess cotton production and exports that in turn caused low international prices and resulted in serious prejudice to brazil the ab recommended removal of the p rohibited subsidies by july 21 2005 and the serious prejudice resulting from ac tionable subsidies by september 21 2005 when the united states failed to meet these deadlines brazil claimed the right to retaliate against 3 billion in us exports to brazil based on the prohibited subsidies and 1 billion based on the actionable subsidies the united states requested wto arbitration on the reta liation amounts however in mid2005 the united states and brazil reached procedural agreement to temporarily suspend both arbitration proceedings the case was resumed in august 2006 when brazil requested wto compliance panel review whether the united states had fully complied with the march 2005 ruling on d ecember 18 2007 the compliance panel ruled that the united states had not fully complied with the march 2005 wto ruling against certain us cotton support programs on june 2 2008 after an appeal by the united states wto appellate body upheld the december 2007 compliance panel ruling that the united states had not fully complied with earlier wto recommendations the ruling against the united states could necessitate further us farm program changes or if further changes are forthcoming clear the way for brazil to request wto authorization for retaliatory trade sanctions the ab ruling must first be adopted by the wtos dispute settlement body within 30 days of the rulings release then the united states and

states re ported cotton production valued at over 20 million the united states is the thirdlargest producer of cotton in the world behind china and india in recent years the united states has been exporting an increasing share of its annual production due in large part to decline in domestic mill use see figure 1 us exports as share of production have averaged 67 since 2001 up from 40 average during the early 1990s the united states is the worlds largest cotton exporter since 2001 us exports have accounted for nearly 39 of world cotton trade us prominence in global markets coupled with

dispute_settlementwtodispute_settle ment_listingsasset_upload_file376_5598pdfbrazils wto case against the us cotton program brazils case was broadly written and touched on almost every aspect of us commodity programs although the focus wa s on the six principal claims described below along with the wto dispute settle ment panel finding of september 8 2004 and appellate body ab ruling of march 3 20057 claim 1 peace clause violation brazil claimed that the united states was longer exempt from wto disput proceedings under the socalled peace clause article 13 of the wtos agreement on agriculture aa because us domestic and export subsidies to its co tton sector were in excess of its 1992 benchmark level8 prior to its expiry in january of 2004 article 13 exempted domestic support measures that complied with the aas requirements from being challenged as illegal subsidies through dis pute settlement proceedings as long as the level of support for commodity rema ined at or below the benchmark 1992 marketing year my levels9 brazil argued that us cotton subsidies were about 2 billion in my1992 compared with over 4 billion in my2001 therefore brazil argued that the united states was longer in compliance with the requisite conditions and could longer seek prot ection under the wtos peace clause rule in response us trade fficials argued that wto mbers agreed to the peace clause recognizing that agricultural subsidies could not be eliminated immediately and needed under certain conditions to be exempted from the subsidies and countervailing measures s cm agreement and gatt 1994 subsidies disciplines as result us officials argued that the words exempt from actions as used in article 13 of the aa were of overarching importance and precluded not only the taking of legal steps to obtain remedy as brazil has argued but also the taking of legal steps to establish claim10 furthermore us trade officials argued that the immunity granted by the peace cl ause was still important since even if country was longer in compliance with the peace clause it was incumbent on the complaining party to prove there had been injury see claim 5 below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32571crs8 11 wto annex 2

agency fact sheet direct and countercyclical pa yment program wild rice fr uit and vegetable provisions february 2003 at h ttp wwwfsausdagovpas publicationsfactshtmlfav03htmfinding 1 the panel found and was upheld by the ab that brazil had successfully discharged its burden to show that us domestic cotton support measures during my1999my2002 which averaged 328 billion were in excess of wto commitments of 20 billion during my1992 see table 3 as result us domestic cotton support measures lost the protection afforded by the peace clause which had shielded them from substantive challenges in the past this occurred in part because under finding 2 production flexibility contract and direct payment outlays were include d with other commodity program outlays and evaluated against peace clause limits table 3 comparison of us domestic cotton support in accordance with article 13bii million my1992 my1999 my2000 my2001 my2002 total 20127 34044 24293 41442 31403 source united states subsidies on upland cotton report of the panel wto wtds267r sept 8 2004 p 157 claim 2 us direct payments do not qualify for exemption from reduction commitments as d ecoupled income support brazil claimed that two types of us payments pr oduction flexibility contract pfc payments made under the 1996 farm bill and direct payments dp made under the 2002 farm bill failed to fully meet the conditions for decoupled income support in annex 2 of the agreement on agriculture and shoul d therefore be counted against the us peace clause domestic support benchmark limit the united states considers both pfc and dp programs to be consistent with wto language for exempt domestic support th at has or at most minimal trade distorting effects or effects on production11 as result the united states notifies both the pfc and dp outlays as green box where they are not subject to any limits furthermore the united states argued strongly against including such minimally distorting noncommodity specific paymen ts in evaluating whether the united states has met or exceed ed its peace clause limits finding 2 the panel found and was upheld by the ab that us payments made under the pfc and dp programs because of the prohibition on planting fruits vegetables and wild rice on covered program acreage12 do not qualify for the wtos green box category of domestic spending the green box contains only non distorting program payments and is not s ubject to any limit instead they should be counted as domestic subsidies directly affecting cotton production ie distorting and be included with other commodity pr ogram outlays to evaluate whether the united states has met or ex ceeded its peace clause limitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32571crs9 13 only prices for middling m 1332inch upl and cotton

at http www fasusdagovexcredits defaulthtm 15 for list of commodities eligible for xport credit guarantees see usda foreign continuedclaim 3 the step 2 program functions as an export subsidy brazil argued that step 2 payments made under the us cotton program functioned as export subsidies and were inconsistent with us wto obligations regarding export subsidies as specifi ed under the scm agreement step 2 payments were part of special cotton marketing provisions authorized under us farm program legislation to keep us upland cotton competitive on the world market step 2 payments were made to exporters and domestic mill users to compensate them for their pur chase of higher priced us upland cotton under the 2002 farm act the step 2 payment rate for the 20022005 marketing years was calculated as the difference between the pr ice of us upland cotton delivered cif cost insurance freight in northern eu rope and the average of the five lowest prices of upland cotton delivered ci f northern europe from any source13 the united states argued that step 2 pa yments were part of its domestic support program since they were targeted to domestic cotton users as well as exporters as result step 2 payments were notified to the wto as amber box tradedistorting domestic support payments and not as export subsidies consequently us trade officials contended that step 2 payments were not subject to any limitations placed on export subsidies finding 3 in its finding the panel considered step 2 program payments to eligible exporters separately from payments to domestic users payments to exporters were found to be contingent upon export performance and therefore qualified as prohibited export subsidies in violation of wto commitments payments to domestic users were found to be contingent on the use of domestic over imported goods and therefore qualified as prohibited import substitution subsidies the ds panel finding was uphe ld by the appellate body claim 4 us export credit guarantees function as export subsidies brazil claimed that the favorable terms ie the interest rate and time period that countries have to pay back the financing provided under us export credit guarantee programs gsm 102 gsm103 and the supplier credit guarantee program scgp14 were effectively export subsidies inconsistent with the wtos aa and scm agreements further the subsidy effects of export credit guarantees applied not only to cott on but to other eligible commodities15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32571crs10 15 continued agricultural service usda amends commodity eligibility under

wtds267r p 348diius trade officials argued that the us export credit guarantee programs were consistent with wto obligations furthermore the united states asserted that article 102 of the aa reflected the deferral of disciplines on export credit guarantee programs contemplated by wto members to the next wto multilateral negotiating round the doha round finding 4 the panel found and was upheld by the ab that us export credit guarantees effectively functioned as export subsidies because the financial benefits returned by these programs fa iled to cover their longrun operating cost16 furthermore the panel found that this pplies not just to cotton but to all commodities that benefit from us commod ity support programs and receive export credit guarantees as result export cr edit guarantees for any recipient commodity are subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments for that commodity this refers to those us export subs idies under the export enhancement program eep and the dairy export incentive program deip17 under these criteria export credit guarantees benefits extended to cotton and other unscheduled commodities that are supported under us agricultural pr ograms

prejudice or injury in support of this concept the pane l stated in its original ruling on the threat of serious prejudice by actionable subsidies that us compliance with recommendations on prohibited subsidies ie the step 2 provisions and export credit guarantees could so significantly transform the basket of measures currently in question that it was not necessary or appropriate to address

brazil reached procedural agreemen t december 7 2005 thereby temporarily suspending further retaliation proceedings on the actionable subsidies42 the suspensions were likely intended to permit policy reform to occur in less confrontational forum under either the thenongoing congre ssional debate on an extension or revision of us farm legisla tion as current farm law was set to expire in 2007 or the ongoing doha negotiations brazil requests compliance panel initially brazil showed willingness to permit the us legislative process motivated by the 2007 expiration of us farm programs and the

expressed concern that the panel findings could extend beyond cotton to other major field crops pa rticularly as concerns the potential limits on export credit guarantees some trade and market analysts as well as legislators have expressed concern that broad finding against us farm program provisions under the actionable subsidies ruling could n ecessitate legislative changes to the us farm bill to bring existing program operations into compliance concerns have also been expressed regarding the reclassification of pfc and direct payments away from nontradedistorting green box support45 however the panel finding that us direct paymen ts do not qualify for wto exemptions from reduction commitments as fully decoupled in come support ie they are not green box compliant appears to have further consequences within the context of this case and does not involve any compliance meas ures this is because direct payments were deemed nonprice contingent and were evaluated strictly in terms of the peace clause violation the panel did not specifically reclassify us pfc and dp payments as amber box nor did the panel recommend that th united states should notify such future payments as amber box this is subtle but critical distinction because of the enormity of pfc and dp payments during fy1996 to fy2006 pfc and dp payments averaged 5 billion per year nd accounted for 26 of total us farm program outlays shifting this amount to amber box could have important implications for future dispute settlement cases as well as for the united states ability to meet its wto amber box commitments us cotton industry and government offi cials are concerned that the specific finding on the apparent failure of us decoupled payments to meet wto green box criteria leaves such programs open to fu ture charges and that third countries may feel emboldened by knowing how wto panel is likely to rule on such matters the european union eu is also likely to be concerned about this finding since the eus agricultural program following agricultu ral policy reforms of june 2003 relies heavily on decoupled payments similar to th those of the us program these concerns appear to have merit as

framework july 31 2004 of the wtos ongoing doha round49 although specific cotton program concessi ons were mentioned in the framework the united states committed to achieve ambitious results expeditiously under the fra mework further it is notable that cotton is the only commodity singled out for special mention in the framework role of congress given the importance of cotton in th us agricultural economy and the potential for wtoimposed limitations on us cotton program operations congress likely will be closely monitoring developments in the wto cotton case and the doha round of trade negotiations both the senate and house agriculture committees regularly hold hearings on agricultura l trade negotiations in addition to congressional hearings congress will likely be engaged in consultations with the administration on the bilatera l trade negotiations as well as the doha round of wto trade negotiations such consultations will be major vehicle for members to express their views on this dispute nd on the negotiating issues it raises ultimately congress is responsible for passing farm program legislation that complies with us commitments in inte rnational trade agreements when confronted with negative wto dispute ttlement ruling c ountry has essentially five options to choose from eliminate the subsidy reduce the subsidy to diminish its adverse effect revise the pr ogram function to reduce the linkage between the subsidy and the adverse effect referred to as decoupling pay mutually acceptable compensatory payment to offset the adverse effects of the

united states would appear to have already comp lied with most if not all of the abs recommendation concerning prohibited subsidies by eliminating the step 2 gsm 103 and scgp programs and by removing the fee cap on gsm102 credit guarantees ie by eliminating the subsid component of export credit guarantees however some questions remain as to what extent the 2008 farm bill pl 110234 has addressed

perception if not the reality of serious prejudice in the marketplace several of the proposed changes are specifically rele vant to the brazil cotton case but also germane to the broader issue of program vulnerability to wto challenge50 for example the enacted 2008 farm bill51 extends the countercyclical paym ents ccp program and current marketing loan provisions sections 1104 and 1201 of pl 110 234 raises both target prices and loan rates for several commoditieswhile only lowering marginally th target price for upland cotton sections 1104 and 1202 offers producers the choice subject to 30 reduction in marketing loan rates and in lieu of 100 of ccp and 20 of direct payments of revenuebased support opti on under the average crop revenue election program acre section 1105 with potentially higher per acre revenue guarantees for severa l crops than under the previous 2002 farm bill and creates new cottonuser payment of 4 cents per pound section1207 this payment appears s imilar to the wtoillegal step 2 payment except that cotton from all origins not just domestic sources is eligible for the payment since the united states imports very little cotton most payments would still likely go to domestically sourced cotton as result this subtle technical loophole might ultimately be subject to wto challenge but would not be part of the current wto cotton case finally the 2008 farm bill does not address the issue surrounding the disqualification of direct payments from the wtos green box exclusion as decoupled payments due to the planting rest riction on fruits vegetables and wild rice on program base acres instead direct paym ents are extended with change to the current planting restriction except for small pilot program on 75000 acres in seven states pl 110234 section 1107 this re tention of the status quo has important wto implications as both canada and brazil have recently initiated wto cases against the united states charging that the united states has exceeded its total limit for the aggregate measure of support ams on several occasions in recent years if direct payments are included in the ams calculation figure 5 52 additional uncertainty arises from the ongoing doha r ound of trade negotiations where successful conclusion could potentially mitigate or end brazils interest in continuing its case against the us farm programs
