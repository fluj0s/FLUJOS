budget proposals and unhcr should consider to orga nise training session on accounting and financial reporting the representation stated that two training session s were conducted in january 2005 c supply management procurement 21 implementing partners were only entrusted with limited procurement the procedures in place needed further improvement as bidding pro cess was not always followed the unhcr representation carried out little procurement during the period under review nonetheless suboffice aden did not always comply with unhcr rules and procedures formal competitive bidding exercises were not under taken for purchases valued at us 5000 and above oios recommended that competitive biddin g procedures be strengthened the unhcr representation commented that it was taking ction to improve procurement procedures local committee on contracts had been established 22 suboffice aden has been using the service s of local contractor for the maintenance of computers the agreement signed with the contrac tor did not contain relevant clauses such as the nature of services the periodicity of the s ervice or number of computers to be maintained in order to avoid any

contract format as outlined in annex 86 chapter 4 of unhcr manual unhcr representation in yemen responded that action had already been taken on this matter three bids had been received and new contract was being prepared with the qualified bidd er the contract would contain all the recommended elements such as the details and the n umber of equipment to be maintained 5 asset management 23 assettrak system was operational in both u nhcr offices in yemen while assettrak was working effectively at sanaa oios f ound assettrak data inaccurate and not uptodate in aden for instance for the assets der cssw custody the local assettrak database showed total acquisition value of us 12 5832 while the total current value amounted to us 27 million this was due to the in put error which occurred while updating the entries and which resulted in the overstatement of the net asset value by almost us 26 million also the results of the physical checks h ad to be better documented further efforts are therefore required to correct and update assett rak to ensure data on assets are reliable oios suggested that training on assettrak might be necessary to make staff familiar with it unhcr indicated that regional information system officer undertook mission to the suboffice aden had updated the assettrak system and all necessary corrections had been made accordingly warehousing 24 unhcrs warehouse in aden contained nonfo od items and drugs for some 20000 refugees with an estimated value of us 60000 our review found that the procedures for receipt and issue of goods were satisfactory with adequate controls in place however the stock was not insured which presents risk oios recommended that the representation assess the value of stock of nonfood items and dru gs in the warehouse and in consultation with sms consider insuring these stocks suboffice aden is in the process of identifying qualified insurance company d security and safety 25 security and safety arrangements at the hcr offices in yemen were generally satisfactory however oios noted that some staff h ad not yet completed the basic security in the field training periodic drills to test emer gency and evacuation procedures were not conducted at suboffice aden further tightening of security and safety is required at the sub office with the installation of cctv cameras smoke detectors and fire extinguishers also unhcr sanaa has to finalize projects on installat ion of blast mitigation barriers cctv system and bulletproof glass for the reception prem ises in sanaa the representation stated that suboffice aden still needed to install cctv c ameras in order to fully comply with the recommendations unhcr sanaa had installed all of the equipment as per the oios recommendation administration 26 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr offices in yemen generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under revie w however oios identified some areas where further improvements were required medical insurance plan mip 6 27 mip claims were generally processed with ccuracy and in accordance with the guidelines we noted however that unhcr representat ion did not maintain list of hospitals pharmacies and doctors where mip partic ipants are recommended to seek medical treatment in the absence of lists and rates for dical treatment unhcr was not in position to query unreasonable or excessive charges 28 as temporary measure and while establish ing list of recommended hospitals and pharmacies in conjunction with other organisatio ns oios recommended to refer medical bills exceeding certain value or specialised case s to the doctor in order to determine the reasonableness of the charges medical evacuation medevac 29 the unhcr representation in yemen did not maintain documentation required under iom 852001 fom 832001 for monitoring of m edevac cases further in several instances oios could not obtain assurance that the correct dsa rate was applied since hotel bills were not always available for medevac within country of recruitment unhcr did not apply the correct dsa rate for two national sta ff in aden resulting in overpayment of us 400 the representation recovered the overpayments and greed to apply henceforth the correct rates 30 oios noted an instance where staff membe r index number 125196 on medical evacuation to geneva in septemberoctober 2003 was paid dsa totalling us 2766 however the office could not provide travel clai m or other documents supporting the payment oios recommended that unhcr sanaa request the staff member to submit his travel claim or refund the amount of us 2766 in 2003 two staff members index numbers 125196 and 243036 were medically evacuated to thei r place of choice in lieu of the recognised place as per unhcr rules on medevac th cost to be borne should not exceed the amount that would have been paid on the basis of evacuation to the recognised place oios noted that the extra travel costs amou nting to us 436 and us 556 respectively which had resulted from the route dev iation had not been recovered recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in yemen should request staff member index 125196 to submit his travel cl aim for dsa totalling us 2766 received for medevac to geneva in 2003 and recover any overpayments rec 0 1 the representation is in the process of collecting documents in order to take decision concerning other recoveries pending the outcome of this matter oios keeps this recommendation open in its database delegation of financial authority 31 with the exception of the head of office the delegation of financial authority had not been established for the other professional staff t suboffice aden as set forth in iom 672000 fom 692000 the suboffice agreed to prepare the delegation of authority chart as well as signature cards for pertinent staff 7 salary advances 32 suboffice aden granted salary advances emergency and special advances to staff members as matter of routine staff members were seeking and were granted salary advances as soon as the previous one had expired s ince in most cases reasons for granting emergency advances were not properly documented we could not ascertain whether these payments qualified for emergency advance unhcr yemen agreed to keep the salary advances to minimum and in accordance with releva nt rules tax exemption status 33 it was unclear to unhcr whether the goods and services purchased locally were inclusive of vat andor other related taxes oios r equested unhcr to enquire about any tax levied and accordingly apply for tax exemptio n in their replies unhcr stated that tax is paid on the purchases in the view of oios the fact that tax is not expli citly mentioned on the invoice does not necessarily mean that unhcr is not charged for taxes according to the information received by oios the vat law has b een approved by parliament but currently implementation of the law is delayed the country is applying production consumption and services tax levied on all commodi ties imported local products and services which ranges from 5 to 15 per cent recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in yemen should fully asse ss together with the host country authorities its tax exemption status rec 02 in its reply to the draft report the representatio n stated that this matter would be further investigated to find out whether any tax wa s levied on goods and services purchased locally by unhcr and action would be initiated acco rdingly pending the action taken oios keeps this recommendation open in its database locally recruited consultant 34 we reviewed the case of locally recruite d consultant who served as health coordinator to supervise the health activities of t he implementing partner cssw at the basateen clinic she was recruited for period of nine months at monthly fee of us 2000 without the approval of dhrm also one per cent co ntribution towards appendix d of the rules governing compensation in the event of death injury or illness attributable to the performance of duties as per unhcr iom662000 and fom682000 was not applied oios pointed out that according to chapter 6 secti on 12 of the unhcr manual consultancy contracts shall be issued in the field irrespective of the contract being charged to an approved administrative budget or to project and irrespective of the consultant being internationally or locally recruited request for consultancy services has to be initiated in the field and sent to the respective regional bureaude sk which then makes an official request to dhrm the representation agreed to comply with unhcr proc edures and informed oios that the contract of the health coordinator had bee n terminated 8 v acknowledgement 35 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation
