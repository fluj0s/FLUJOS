designed to curb treaty shopping instances where foreign parent firm in one country r eceives its ussource income through an intermediate subsidiary in third country that is signatory to taxreducing

revenueraising tax provisions in terms of re venue impact by far the largest tax measure is proposal to restrict the use of taxtreat benefits by foreign firms with operations in the united states1 the

capital gains however are generally tax exempt also most portfolio interest that is interest paid to foreigners whose investment is strictly financ ial is exempt from the tax interest on intra firm debt however focus of hr 2419 is at least nominally subject to the withholding taxprovision would raise somewhat less re venue than hr 2419 27 billion over 5 years and 64 billion over 10 years the context us taxation of foreign firms in the united states the tax treaty proposals are di rected at us tax treatment of foreign firms that conduct business in the united states nd to understand how the bill would affect that treatment it is useful to take brief look at the exis ting structure foreign firm that earns business income in the united states is at least potentially subject to two levels of us tax the corporate income tax and flat withholding tax the us corporate income tax may apply whether the foreign firm conducts its business through uschartered subsidiary corpor ation or through branch of the foreign parent that is not parately incorporated in the cas of us subsidiary us tax applies because the united states generally taxes all uschartered corporations regardless of their ownership us taxes apply to foreign branch income because the united states asserts the right to tax foreignchartered corporations on their income from the active conduct of us trade or business in addition the united states applies withholding tax on interest dividends rents royalties and other fixed or determinable income foreign corporations and other nonresidents receive from sources within the united states5 the tax is required to be withheld by the us paye r hence withholding and is applied on gross basis without the allowance of deduc tions the rate of the tax is nominally 30 however and importantly for the proposal at hand the tax is frequently reduced or eliminated under the terms of one of the many bilate ral tax treaties the united states has signed in principle the withholding tax does not apply to intrafi rm repatriations of income where foreign firms us operation is not separately incorporated in the united states since the tax reform act of 1986 tra86 pl 99514 however the united states has applied 30 branch tax as llel to the withholding tax and that also may be reduced by treaty theoretically both levels of tax could apply to foreign firms us source income picture for example foreign fi rm that operates uschartered subsidiary that remits its income to the homecountry parent by means of stream of dividend payments dividend payments are not deduc tible under the corporate income tax so the tax applies in full to the subsidiarys earnings then if the dividends are paid directly to parent in nontreaty country the 30 withholding tax applies thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34245crs3 6 the corporate tax rate is generally 34 sinc dividends are paid out of aftertax profits the withholding tax applies at rate of 30 x 1 34 or 198 the total rate is thus 34 198 or 538 7 us internal revenue service us tax treaties pub 901 rev june 2007 washington 2007 pp 3435 8 in explaining an antitreatyshopping provision of the us model income tax treaty the us treasury department defi ned treaty shopping simply as instances where residents of continuedcombined rate of the two taxes on divide nd payments could amount to as much as 5386 this combined rate however is usually not reached first many types of intra firm payments are taxdeductible under th corporate income tax even if the payments are to related foreig n parents for example in terest on intrafirm debt is tax deductible albeit with some restrictions as mentioned below royalties paid for the use of patents trademarks and other intangible assets are likewise deductible thus foreign firm can eliminate the us corporate income tax on income transmitted to its parent via taxdeductible payments the foreign parent can for example finance its us operations by maki ng loans to the us subsidiary or it can charge the us subsidiary royalty f ees for the use of patented technology tax treaties frequently reduce or eliminate the withholding tax like most developed countries the united states is si gnatory to large number of bilateral tax treaties the treaties addre ss variety of topics aside from withholding taxes for example reciprocal assurances of nondiscrimination and provisions for the exchange of information by tax authoritie s reciprocal reduction of withholding taxes is however key element of most treaties to illustrate the us internal revenue service publication on tax treaties lists taxtreaty withholding tax rates for 56 countries the top 30 rate applies to in trafirm interest payments in only four instances and is completely eliminated for 20 countries7 in short notwithstanding the two poten tial levels of tax us tax on payments foreign subsidiaries make to their parents can be eliminated or substantially reduced in the case of payments made to firms in large number of countries both hr 2419 and hr 3970 however focus on firm s whose ultimate home country does not have taxreducing treaty with the united states we look next at how such firms are nonetheless able to use treaty shopping to reduce or eliminate their us tax treaty shopping and how it works not all countries have income tax treaties with the unite d states so if interest dividends royalties or similar us income were paid directly to firms from these countries the full 30 withholding tax would apply treaty shopping is an arrangement where firm gets around the absence of treaty by routing its us income through intermediate subsidiary cor porations located in third countries where lower or nonexistent w ithholding taxes apply8 treaty shopping further is not usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34245crs4 8 continued third countries benefit from what is intended to be reciprocal agreement between two countries us department of the treasury office of tax policy

treaty shopping but treaty shopping likely does not occur exclusively in eitheror situations wher firm faced by the full 30 withholding tax routes income through country where tax applies treatyshopping is likely matter of degree firm facing 10 ra in its true home country for example could benefit substan tially from routing us income through country where tax applies or firm facing the 30 rate could benefit by cha nneling income through an intermediary taxed at only 15 further while the exclusive focus of the current legislative proposals is deduc tible payments for example interest and royalties treaty shopping can also benefit nondeduc tible payments such as dividends to be attractive as interm ediate stops in the treatyshopping process countrys treaty provisions must

proposed by representative lloyd doggett on july 24 2007 the proposal provides that if us subsidiary makes deductible pa yment to foreign corporation that has common foreign pare nt and the withholding tax rate on the payment would be higher if the payment we re made directly to the common parent the higher rate will be applied thus for example if the payment is made to fellow subsidiary in country where us withholding tax applies and the common parent of the us subsidiary and countryy subsidiary is resident in country x where the applicable tax is 15 the rate that applies to payments to the countryy subsidiary would be 15 notwith standing the nominal 0 rate the provision would only apply to payments deductible under the us corporate income tax eg interest and royalties the degree of common ownership applied by the bill would be 50 thus the provision would apply to payments to foreign corporation wher the us corporation and the payee corporation are linked to common foreig n parent by chains of at least 50 ownership according to the house ways and means committee summary of hr 3970 the bills modification of hr 2419 is design ed to ensure that foreign multinational

subsidiary cannot be reduced unless the withholding tax is also reduced on dir ect payment to the parent thus it seems that hr 3970s restrictions would not pply where taxreducing treaty exists with parents home country treaty the re striction might otherwise violate pro and arguments central concern of supporters of th antitreatyshopping proposal is tax revenue foreign firms that reduce their us withholding taxes with the technique reduce the tax revenue the united states collects on ussource income and in international taxation the count ry of source in this instance the united states traditionally has the primary right to the tax revenue it generates supporters cite fairness as underlying this concern cont rasting the low us taxes treatyshopping foreign firms pay with taxes paid by usresident indivi duals and businesses13 opponents of the measure have argued that the provision would increase the cost to us firms of doing business in th united states and would thus harm us employment and wages in addition in th case of hr 2419 it has been argued that the measure would abrogate existing us tax treaties an objection that apparently led to modifications in hr 397014 the proposals op ponents include the bush administration which has stated that it s trongly opposes the farm bills taxtreaty provisions and has threatened to veto the bill for this and other reasons15 alternative approaches and previous legislation the taxtreaty proposals in the current c ongress are not the first instance where us policymakers have attempted to re strict treaty shopping conceptually one alternative to legislation is to include such restrictions in tax treaties as described above the treaties that the united states has negotiated in recen t decades have all contained limitation on benefits lob clauses that deny treaty benefits to third country residents the lob provisions ge nerally do so by requiring firms qualifyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34245crs7 16 kleinfeld

to be ow ned primarily by re sidents of the treaty country and not erode the tax base of the treaty country by making deductible payments to third country residents16 the current us model income tax treaty contains such provisions17 one analysis has noted however that considerable time would be required to renegotiate all us treaties with such an approach and not all treaty countries would be likely to ag ree to stringent lob provisions18 the sole legislation explicitly restric ting treaty shopping was included as part of tra86s branch tax provisions under its terms treaty cannot reduce the branch tax for foreign firm where less than 50 of the firms stock is owned by residents of the treaty country or where 50 or more of the firms income is used to meet liabilities to nonresidents19 note that these conditions parallel those of the model income tax treaty an existing provision of the tax code that does not direc tly address treaty shopping but that is nonetheless related is the codes earnings stripping rules applied by section 163j ea rnings stripping refers to the removal by foreign firms of profits earned in the united states by rranging for the subsidiary us corporation to make taxdeductible payments for example interest and royalties to the foreign parent as descri bed above such practice liminates the us corporate income tax on the deductible payments nd in combination with treaty shopping can remove all us tax on foreign firms us income provisions designed to limit earnings stripping by foreign firms investin g in the united states were enacted with the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 as section 163j of the internal revenue code the provisions deny deductions for interest payments to related corporations but apply only after certain thre shold of interest payments and level of debtfinance is exceeded20 while the provisions do not address treaty shopping per they do addr ess the same general policy goal attempting to ensure that foreign firms pay some amount of us tax on their us income economic analysis economic analysis of restrictions on tr eaty shopping begins by focusing on tax revenue when foreign firms avoid withhol ding taxes by routing income through treatycountry intermediaries the united st ates loses the tax revenue that it would collect if the income were paid directly to foreign parent and higher withholding tax were applied as noted at the outse t the treatyshopping restrictions proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34245crs8 in hr 2419 would increase revenue by an estimated 32 billion over 5 years and 75 billion over ten years hr 3970 woul d increase revenue by an estimated 27 billion and 64 billion over 5 nd 10 years respectively but beyond the proposals revenue ffect economic analysis poses more fundamental question would the plans enha nce us economic welfare the answer to this question still involves the plans tax revenue impact but it also looks at balance that between the benefit fro m collecting tax revenue on the one hand and from attracting foreign investment to the united states on the other the economic benefit from collecting tax revenue from foreign firms is clear in collecting revenue the united states re tains in its own economy portion of the profit that foreign firms would otherwise repatriate to their home country the counterpoised benefit the economic benefit from foreig n investment needs closer look popular discussions of foreig n investment frequently focus on jobs but while inbound foreign investment can cr eate new employment in particular us geographic areas its positive impact on the us economy as whole is on wages rather than jobs economic theory suggests that in the aggregate the economy is either at or moving towards full employ ment thus while foreign investment can attract employment from one sector of th economy to another it does not have an appreciable longrun impact on aggregate employment policy goal that is the target of aggregate fiscal and monetary policy rather than targeted tax provisions foreign investment can however increase wages basic economic theory indicates that increases in capital serve to increase labor productivity fore ign investment thus increases productivity of domestic labor another basic economic principle holds that in smoothly functioning markets labor is paid wage that is equal to its marginal product it follows then that increases in foreign investment in the domestic economy increases domestic wages the balance then is this given increase in taxes on foreign investors increases tax revenue and produces ta x revenue on the one hand and given increase in foreign investment produces high er wages on the other but if foreign firms are sensitive at all to taxes given tax increase also reduces the us investment they undertake thus reducing their positive impact on us wages from an economic point of view the optimal policy is to tax foreign investors such that the added revenue from an incremen t of tax is just equal to the reduction in wages that increment would cause the analogy of goose and golden egg is perhaps apt is the rate of tax on foreign firms close to the optimal rate would the proposals treatyshopping restrictions move towards or away from the optimal point in part the answer depends on exactly how sensitive foreign firms are to us taxes the elasticity of supply of foreig n investment in economic parlance the more sensitive is foreign investment the lower the optimal tax rate thorough investigation of the elas ticity of s upply is beyond the scope of this report importantly however in some cases foreig n firms may be able to use treaty shopping to eliminate all us tax on their us earnings and it is unlikely that foreign investors are so sensitive to us taxes that the optimal tax rate on foreign investmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34245crs9 21 in economic parlance an optimal tax rate of zero requires perfectly elastic supply however slemrod for example found nega tive relationship between us taxes and inbound investment but not perfect elasticity see tax effects on foreign direct investment in the united states evidence from crosscountry comparison in assaf razin and joel slemrod eds taxation in the global economy chicago university of chicago press p 112 note also that since nominal rather than real interest is tax deductible the actual tax burden for debtfinan ced foreign investment is probably less than zero which would suggest lessthanoptimal tax burden exists even if foreign investment is perfectly elastic for further discussion see crs report 91582 federal taxes and foreign investment in the united states an assessment by david l brumbaugh august 6 1991 copies are available by contacting crsis zero21 if this is the case economic theory suggests that it is likely that the proposal would increase us economic welfare there are however couple of important qualifications one is economic the analysis does not take into account possibl counteractions by foreign governments which might erode or offset any benefit to the united stat for example country that is home to firms that would be ffected by the treatyshopping proposals might impose antitreatyshopping restrictions of its own that would affect us firms investment within its own borders the other is noneconomic as noted above some have argued that the antitreatyshopping proposal in hr 2419 would abrogate existing us tax treaties an analysis of these questions is however beyond the scope of this report
