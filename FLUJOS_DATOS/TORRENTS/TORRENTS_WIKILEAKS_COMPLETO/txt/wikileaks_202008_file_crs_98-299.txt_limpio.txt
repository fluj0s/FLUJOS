defense division carl behrens specialist in energy policy environment and natural resources policy division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report examines russian ballistic missile and nuclear reactor technology transfers to iran and us responses to those transfers the report analyzes irans ballistic missile and nuclear power programs the significance of russias contributions to those programs resulting us security concerns and russianiranian cooperation from the perspectives of moscow tehran and washington the report describes large number of bills and resolutions in the 105th congress that addressed russian transfers of sensitive technologies to iran including hr 2709 title i of which was the iran missile proliferation sanctions act the report also summarizes existing us legislation relevant to the russian technology transfers to iran such as the arms export control act pl 90629 the export administration act pl 9672 the iraniraq arms nonproliferation act of 1992 pl 102 484 and the current foreign operations appropriations act pl 105118 title ii this report builds upon crs report 95641 russian nuclear reactor and conventional arms transfers to iran may 25 1995 this report may be updated or superceded by new report depending on action in the 106th congress on these issues russian missile technology and nuclear reactor transfers to iran summary many in congress and the clinton administration charge that russian entities are assisting iran in developing ballistic missiles russia is also building nuclear power station in and is furnishing other nuclear services to iran congress has passed legislation requiring the president to impose sanctions for missile technology transfers arms sales nuclear technology transfers and largescale investments in iran hr 2709 which includes the iran missile proliferation sanctions act of 1997 is one of several bills designed to tighten existing sanctions law it was amended and passed by the senate on may 22 1998 and by the house on june 9 by very large bipartisan majorities nevertheless president clinton vetoed the bill on june 23 and said he would work to sustain the veto the administration opposes congressionally mandated sanctions because it believes they limit administration flexibility and could harm usrussian relations and russias postsoviet transition vetooverride attempt was postponed following president clintons july 15 announcement of sanctions on russian entities suspected of missile technology transfers although iran tested new mediumrange ballistic missile on july 22 veto override vote was attempted before the session ended the administration says it gives russian missile technology and nuclear reactor transfers high priority but many in the 106th congress are likely to cite the missile test as evidence of lack of progress on the issue and might seek passage of similar legislation in the new congress moscow has indirectly acknowledged that there have been missile technology transfers to iran by russian entities but the russian government denies its own involvement and says it is upholding its commitments under the missile technology control regime mtcr russian assistance appears to have significantly accelerated irans missile program which reportedly is developing mediumrange ballistic missiles that could threaten us forces and allies throughout the region including israel this threat is compounded by irans reported pursuit of nuclear biological and chemical weapons russias 1995 decision to construct large nuclear power station in iran and to provide related nuclear facilities and services has also drawn sharp criticism from the administration and the congress which fear that these projects might benefit an iranian nuclear weapons program moscow is going ahead with these projects despite the threat of us economic sanctions usrussian commercial relations might also be threatened by sanctions and they are far more important to russia than its commercial relations with iran us assistance to russia would also be threatened the reactor project could provide russia with billions of dollars of hard currency earnings far more than the amount of direct us aid threatened by sanctions but indirect us assistance to russia through such institutions as the imf is vitally needed by moscow and far exceeds the earnings from its nuclear projects in iran contents the issues 1 russian missile technology transfer to iran 3 details of the russian transfers 4 role of the russian government 7 significance 10

administration charge that the russian government is directly or indirectly involved in assisting iran to develop medium range ballistic missiles at the same time russia is building nuclear power station in iran and has agreed to furnish iran with wide range of other nuclear services the issue is whether or not russian entities should be sanctioned for transferring missile technology to iran as would have been required by hr 2709 whether such sanctions would be detrimental to us efforts to dissuade russians from transferring missile technology to iran as president clinton contended in his veto of hr 2709 and whether administration actions aimed at curbing russian missile technology transfers are effective the 106th congress may revisit this issue congress has expressed strong opposition to and passed legislation requiring the president to impose sanctions for missile technology transfers arms sales nuclear technology transfers and largescale investments in iran on november 12 1997 the house passed hr 2709 title i of which is the iran missile proliferation sanctions act sponsored by house international relations committee chairman gilman that would have required the administration to impose additional unilateral economic sanctions on foreign entities that contribute to irans efforts to develop ballistic missiles the administration failed to persuade the senate to reject the bill1 which was approved by that body with an amendment on may 22 1998 by vote of 904 on june 9 the house passed the senate version of the bill by vote of 39222 despite these apparently vetoproof majorities president clinton vetoed the bill on june 23 and said he would work to sustain the veto his veto message said that the bill would make it harder to achieve the nonproliferation goals it is intended to serve russian officials and news media reacted sharply to congressional passage of the bill with newspapers warning that new economic sanctions reduce the likelihood of 1 on may 20 1998 stephen sestanovich the presidents special adviser on the former soviet union told the senate foreign relations subcommittee on europe that sanctions would be profoundly counterproductive to us national interest with respect to russia although he acknowledged that russia had not yet succeeded in stopping the leakage of missile technology to iran he warned that sanctions could risk inadvertently undermining our efforts to stop russias support of irans missile programs president clinton conveyed similar message in white house meeting with group of senators on the evening of may 20 reuters ap may 21 1998 crs2 duma ratification of start ii2 the bills supporters question whether moscow can or will stop the missile technology transfers without additional pressure an effort to override the veto scheduled for july 17 was postponed indefinitely and not revived when the administration announced that it would impose trade sanctions on the russian entities identified by moscow as being investigated for possible violation of russian export controls on july 28 president clinton issued an executive order that tightens us restrictions on proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery including russian missile technology transfers to iran see p 2123 below white house press release that day said that pursuant to this executive order all us assistance to and trade with seven russian entities under investigation by russian authorities was being terminated see p 9 below the supplemental appropriation bill hr 3579pl 105174 provides funds to enhance theater missile defense systems largely in response to russian cooperation with iran on missile development the fy1998 foreign aid bill hr 2159pl 105 118 provides for cuts in aid to the russian government if it does not terminate its nuclear projects and missile technology transfers to iran sanctions for improper missile technology transfers under the arms export control act export administration act and iraniraq arms nonproliferation act of 1992 may also applicable to the russiairan transfers the administration says it has made the missile technology transfer issue very high priority in official and unofficial dealings with russian officials including the talks between vice president gore and premier yevgenny primakov inmanila july 28 1998 and presidents clinton and yeltsin in moscow september 12 1998 although there are recent signs of change in iran and in us policy toward iran there has been strong consensus in congress and the executive branch shared by many foreign governments that iran is still leading sponsor of state terrorism and potential threat to us and western interests hence the united states has sought to keep military and weapons of mass destruction technology from iran russias military political and economic cooperation with iran may undermine this policy and is major source of tension in usrussian relations the clinton administration has made repeated highlevel representations to the russian government to persuade it to end missile technology and nuclear reactor transfers to iran with mixed success the administration considers cooperation with postcommunist russia sometimes expressed in terms of partnership and assistance in russias transition toward democracy and market economy to be very important us goals despite the fact that usrussian relations have soured lately not only over iranian issues but also because of russian opposition to us policy toward iraq serbia and nato enlargement thus the us objectives of containing iran and cooperating with russia appear to be in conflict critics of the administration are likely to point to irans july 22 1998 test of an 800mile range missile apparently constructed with russian assistance as evidence that the administrations approach is not succeeding 2 russia united states moscow condemns senate vote on sanctions fbis foreign media note may 26 1998 crs3 the clinton administration takes the general position that while it strongly opposes some of russias dealings with iran congressionally mandated unilateral sanctions will not change russian policy and furthermore usrussian relations are too important to be put at risk over disagreements on iran sanctions have rarely been imposed against postsoviet russia in part because of president clintons exercise of national security waiver authority included in the fy1996 and fy1997 foreign aid appropriations bills sanctions focused on the nuclear reactor deal russian missile technology transfer to iran in 1987 at us urging the g7 countries established the missile technology control regime mtcr aimed at limiting the proliferation of missiles and missile technology the mtcr is an informal arrangement consisting of guidelines for transfers of missiles and related technology and an annex listing items to be controlled nations that join the regime adopt the guidelines as national policy and undertake to restrain missile transfers through their export control systems thirty two countries have become partners in the mtcr including russia 1995 in january 1997 an israeli delegation told white house officials and members of congress that russian firms and institutes were providing critical assistance to irans missile development program within short time they said russian equipment and technology would help iran overcome obstacles it had encountered in developing mediumrange ballistic missiles that could deliver chemical weapons throughout the middle east us intelligence reportedly confirmed the israeli conclusions the government of israel raised the alarm in strong terms to the united states and russia because it would be threatened by these new missiles the transfers became central issue of usrussian relations and have been discussed at numerous highlevel bilateral meetings the russian transfers apparently were in violation of the mtcr guidelines and the usrussian agreement to ban new arms sales to iran under certain circumstances such transfers would trigger statutory us economic sanctions but as months passed and more details of the transfers appeared in the press many members of congress questioned russias denials and lack of effective us or russian action to stop the flow of missile technology to iran for the past few years some members of congress have been frustrated by the administrations decisions not to impose sanctions against russian and chinese firms that exported sensitive missile or nuclear technology the administration has often been able to avoid implementing the missile sanctions provisions of the arms export control act aeca pl 90629 the export administration act of 1979 eaa pl 9672 the iraniraq arms nonproliferation act of 1992 iiana the foreign assistance act of 1961 faa pl 87195 and the annual foreign operations appropriations act because of exclusions waivers definitions that allow for broad interpretation and the lack of certain binding requirements in the laws these sanctions had been legislated largely during previous administrations to put teeth into us nonproliferation policy and the multilateral nonproliferation regimes but some members concluded they were not sufficiently rigorous and introduced bills to tighten the requirements for sanctions numerous bills were introduced to crs4 encourage or force the administration to take stronger measures against russia and iran see the summary of legislation in the 105th congress at the end of this report rep gilman introduced the iran missile proliferation sanctions act of 1997 hr 2709 which would have required the president to identify to congress every foreign person with respect to whom there is credible information indicating that that person has transferred missile technology to iran and to impose economic sanctions against that person unless the president can rebut the information or justify waiver on grounds of national security congressional action on this issue focused largely on hr 2709 this bill would have closed two loopholes of the aeca sec 73a and b and eaa sec 11bb1 and 2 the first of these loopholes ties statutory sanctions to presidential determination which the president is not required to make the second makes sanctions inapplicable against most exporters in country such as russia that is an adherent to the mtcr the proposed bill would also apply sanctions to all persons who have exported missile technology to iran unlike the iiana which ties statutory sanctions to presidential determination that transfers are of destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons and that does not explicitly include ballistic missiles in the laws definition of advanced conventional weapons the bill might also block foreign assistance to any proliferating entity whereas sections 498a 620g and 620h of the faa and title ii of the annual foreign operations appropriations acts have not been successful in blocking such assistance the bill does however include authority for presidential waiver on national security grounds president clinton vetoed hr 2709 on june 23 1998 saying if enacted it would damage the us national interest making it harder to achieve goals it is intended to serve he further wrote that the battle against proliferation is most effective as cooperative enterprise implying that unilateral economic sanctions are less effective he also said that the standard of evidence in hr 2709 for establishing that person or entity had wrongly transferred missile technology is unworkably low and that the sanctions are also disproportionate he argued that the imposition of unilateral american sanctions would make it more difficult to win russian government cooperation on the important missile proliferation issue and perhaps on other issues such as arms control law enforcement counternarcotics and combating transnational crime there appears to be support in various departments of government and in the congress for the view that sanctions have contributed to us nonproliferation policies in some other situations there is also view that the government and congress have at least in some cases used sanctions inconsistently and ineffectively other members introduced legislation to authorize additional funds for ballistic missile defenses and other measures to counter the emerging threat posed by iran and other countries details of the russian transfers during the iraniraq war 19801988 iran reportedly acquired sovietmade scudb missiles from libya and manufactured variants of the scudb acquired from north korea in the meantime the soviet union sold over 800 scudbs directly to crs5 iraq these missiles gave iraq big advantage in the deadly missile exchange known as the war of the cities marchapril 1988 and helped force iran to end the war before achieving its goals neither side used chemical warheads on their missiles during the war but since then both reportedly have developed such warheads3 after the war iran bought additional missiles and missile production technology from north korea and reportedly subsidized north korean development of the nodong missile 1300 km range and perhaps longerrange missiles although the nodong could reach all of iraq from iran it is unclear whether it could reach israel pyongyang reportedly agreed in 1993 to supply iran up to 150 nodong missiles but the united states persuaded north korea not to deliver them4 iran has apparently not acquired significant number of nodong missiles tehran then broadened its search for missile technology in support of its own missile development programs iran reportedly encountered numerous technical problems with its ambitious missile programs and sought russian help with guidance systems engines advanced materials electronics testing equipment and other systems that it could not develop indigenously despite pledges by soviet leaders in 1990 and by various russian leaders since then to ban missile exports president yeltsins 1994 agreement to refrain from new arms sales to iran and russias entry into the mtcr in october 1995 there are recurring reports that russian companies are selling missile technology to iran and other countries on february 6 1997 vice president gore issued diplomatic warning to then premier chernomyrdin regarding russian transfers to iran of parts and technology associated with ss4 mediumrange ballistic missiles5 over the next several months press reports indicated that russian enterprises provided iran specialty steels and alloys tungsten coated graphite wind tunnel facilities gyroscopes and other guidance technology rocket engine and fuel technology laser equipment machine tools and maintenance manuals us and israeli concerns have focused on russian help in the development of two liquidfuel medium range missiles the shahab 3 and the shahab 4 see table below israeli and us officials believe the shahab missiles are further improvements on the north korean nodong and according to press reports us officials estimate iran could deploy the shahab 3 within year or two and could deploy the shahab 4 within 3 years one article cited classified us intelligence report as predicting iran would field prototypes of both missiles within 18 months analysts believe that the integration of nuclear biological or chemical warhead development of sophisticated guidance system and system to separate the warhead from the missile body will take iran more than several months israeli intelligence also reported the development of other iranian missiles the shahab 5 with ranges of 5500 km and 10000 km the latter is the distance from iran 3 carus seth ballistic missiles in modern conflict new york

developed in the 1950s had onestage liquidfuel engine and range of 1800 to 2000 km it was being phased out of the soviet inventory when it was eliminated under the inf treaty in the 1980s crs6 to alaska or to the northeastern portion of the united states6 report from congressionallymandated commission headed by former defense secretary rumsfeld released in july 1998 estimated that iran could demonstrate an icbm similar to north koreas taepo dong 2 up to 10000 km range within five years of decision to proceed in addition the report said iran is seeking and has acquired components that can be combined to produce missiles capable of reaching the united states7 russian assistance has apparently helped iran overcome number of obstacles and advance its missile development program faster than expected the rumsfeld commission said the ballistic missile infrastructure in iran is now more sophisticated than that of north korea and has benefitted from broad essential assistance from russia and important assistance from china as well many analysts believe continued russian technical assistance would enable iran to make further strides that would otherwise require years of research development testing and evaluation the director of central intelligence reported to congress that iran is using goods and technology acquired from russia china and north korea to achieve its goal of becoming selfsufficient in producing mediumrange ballistic missiles8 this progress was confirmed by irans july 22 test of the shahab3 missile although it is not known how successful the test was table

1998 the state department listed but did not make public 20 russian entities suspected of transferring missile technology to iran on july 15 1998 russian authorities announced that nine russian entities were being investigated for suspected violation of laws governing export of dualuse technologies the nine include the inor npo polyus research institute and baltic state technical university cited earlier plus the grafit research institute tikhomirov institute the moso company the komintern plant novosibirsk europalace 2000 and glavcosmos10 iran has an extensive network of research institutes and factories engaged in the development of missiles many of which reportedly have received assistance from russia these are dispersed about the country and some are probably hardened against aerial bombardment11 role of the russian government it is not clear whether the russian government has allowed or encouraged this assistance or merely been unable to detect or prevent it initially moscow denied that its missiles or missile technology had been transferred to iran but in september 1997 russian officials reportedly stated that such transfers were being made without the consent of the government in january 1998 after repeated detailed complaints by numerous us officials yuri koptev head of the russian space agency said of 13 cases raised by the us government 11 had connection to technology transfers related to weapons of mass destruction nuclear biological or chemical that were banned under 1996 agreement two cases which could be interpreted as an attempt to transfer dualpurpose technology were stopped and the government 9 according to early western press reports the kuznetzov npo scientific production association inor npo energmash npo ployus research

and resolve the issue with the united states in november 1997 nine months after vice president gore first raised the issue russia expelled an iranian diplomat for trying to buy missile engine blueprints he was reportedly the lead figure in irans quest for russian nuclear chemical biological and missile technology14 on january 22 1998 premier chernomyrdin issued decree prohibiting any russian entity from exporting materials or services that it knows will be used to develop weapons of mass destruction or their delivery systems and requiring government approval for exports that might be used for such purposes whether or not they are included on russias export control list if the russian foreign trade participants have grounds to believe that the products and services might be used for such purposes15 the decree which authorizes the russian government to block exports and to penalize companies that make unapproved exports reportedly was prompted by telephone call from gore to chernomyrdin16 since then there have been conflicting reports about the implementation of the decree and new allegations have arisen in february 1998 the washington times reported that russias federal security service fsb successor to the kgb was still working with irans intelligence service to pass technology through joint research center persepolis with facilities in st petersburg and tehran in march the washington post and moscow newspaper ran stories detailing years of fsb complicity in recruiting and transporting russian missile scientists to work in iran although neither claimed the practice was ongoing17 according to the russian space agency the following steps were taken in early 1998 the ministry of education instructed all universities and institutes to stop training iranian students in missile technology and related subjects the central aerohydrodynamic institute terminated cooperation with iran on wind tunnel tests npo energmash stopped delivering special firefighting equipment to iran all activities of the iranian firm sanam in russia were terminated and all contracts of the ramensky aviation design bureau and of npo lavochkin with iran were terminated

in constructing missile fuel tanks was intercepted as it was about to cross the border from azerbaijan into iran another shipment of russian missilerelated material on its way to iran was seized in austria and the moscow aviation institute is reportedly still training iranian missile technicians18 on may 14 1998 few days before the g8 meeting in birmingham england yeltsins spokesman announced additional measures to tighten control over the export of missile and nuclear technology he declared that supervisory bodies will be established at all enterprises dealing with those technologies the russian space agency will play greater role in overseeing exports of missile technologies and stricter licensing requirements will be implemented19 after the g8 meeting president clinton said that he and yeltsin had discussed the issue in some significant detail and that they had reached understandings that will bear fruit yeltsin said that he was creating new government commission to improve control over hightech exports including those to iran us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott present during the yeltsinclinton talks said that yeltsin had reaffirmed in the clearest and most unambiguous terms his commitment to ending the flow of missile technology to iran20 on july 15 the newly created russian export control commission announced criminal investigations of nine russian entities for suspected violations of the established state system of export control and of attempts to export dualpurpose goods and services connected with weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by missile most of the nine are stateowned entities the commission also announced that it was drafting bill to strengthen export controls over private companies not subject to direct state oversight21 on the same day the clinton administration announced that it would where appropriate end assistance to and trade with the russian entities under investigation22 white house statement said that the russian commissions actions demonstrate the growing effectiveness of usrussian cooperation in halting the proliferation and transfer of dangerous weapons technology and materials23 at an

at the moscow summit on september 12 1998 officials on both sides have cautioned earlier however that it might be difficult to halt all unauthorized or illegal missile technology transfers especially by individual scientists and small private enterprises some russian officials continue to argue that many us and israeli allegations of illicit missile technology transfers to iran are unrelated to missile technology25 in november 1998 robert gallucci the state departments special representative on nonproliferation was quoted as saying we are still concerned about contacts cooperation and assistance between russia and iran and we are discussing that with moscow it is still an issue26 turmoil in the russian government raises questions about the future efficacy of the gorechernomyrdin commission mechanism which according to the white house relied in large part on the personal rapport and trust built up between gore and chernomyrdin over five years in march 1998 yeltsin dismissed premier chernomyrdin and replaced him with sergei kiriyenko who was in turn dismissed in august 1998 and replaced by yevgeny primakov in addition yeltsins failing health has further diminished his own role in government these developments raise concerns about moscows ability and willingness to enforce export controls us and russian officials say that goreprimakov commission will succeed its predecessor and continue the same work as foreign minister however primakov was leading proponent of russian cooperation with iran significance threat to us interests in the middle east the russian transfers of missile technology are of importance because they have apparently accelerated irans ability to produce missiles that could reach us troops and friendly countries throughout the middle east as well as southern russia and perhaps greece and deliver weapons of mass destruction iran produces chemical weapons for delivery of blister blood and choking agents and might have the ability to fit chemical warheads to ballistic missiles iran is also conducting research on biological and nuclear weapons but it is not known when the country might have such weapons that could be delivered by ballistic missile us intelligence estimates that iran could produce an atomic bomb though perhaps not nuclear missile warhead by the middle of the next decade27 24 carol giacomo us russia will discuss ending the spread of nuclear weapons washington times july 29 1998 p 15 25 an official of the russian foreign ministrys export control department was quoted as saying on july 17 1998 that most of

gertz us hasnt stemmed flow of missile technology to iran washington times november 18 1998 p 3 27 ibid office of the secretary of defense proliferation threat and response november continued crs11 russia as proliferator the russian missile technology transfers are also important as an indicator of russias willingness and ability to control exports of dangerous technology to countries that are trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction and have history of belligerence the united states has taken great efforts to establish and win russian participation in nonproliferation regimes for nuclear biological and chemical weapons and missile delivery systems the united states has given russia technical assistance on operating an effective export control system and through the nunnlugar comprehensive threat reduction initiative has also helped russia with the safe and secure transportation storage and dismantlement of its weapons of mass destruction because russia has large inventories of weapons of mass destruction large quantities of equipment and material to produce and deliver such weapons and large numbers of underemployed scientists and technicians it is critical to us nonproliferation goals that russia maintain strict control of these resources russianiranian nuclear cooperation irans nuclear power program irans efforts to add nuclear power generation to its electric power grid began in 1974 when it contracted with the west german nuclear firm kraftwerk union kwu to build two large pressurized water reactors pwrs at bushehr near kharg island at one point 10000 workers were reported at the construction site28 following the 1979 revolution the islamic government canceled the project but few years later changed its mind and asked kwu to finish the plants however the west german government prohibited kwu from sending nuclear components and personnel to bushehr because of irans war with iraq in fact iraqi air raids and missile attacks damaged the project although at the time it was canceled in 1979 the two plants were said to be 70 and 50 complete essentially components of the nuclear steam supply system had been shipped to iran even after the iraqiran war ended germany and iran could not agree on plan to finish the project and iran turned to russia for help in january 1995 the russian nuclear agency minatom signed contract to finish one unit of the bushehr project for 800 million with projected 55month construction schedule29 the russian agency later decided not to try to finish the german plant but to build russian designed pwr on the site instead 27 continued 1997 p 27 reuters nov 18 1997 28 possibility raised for resuming iranian nuclear project nucleonics week december 22 1983 p 1 the number may be exaggerated but it is not impossible in us nuclear construction projects at their peak construction workers numbered in the thousands 29 hoffman david russia expanding role in iranian power plant the washington post february 22 1998 p a30 crs12 why is oilrich iran building nuclear power plants at the time the shahs government first started nuclear power program questions were raised about the economic role nuclear power could play in nation with vast oil and gas resources in the 1970s however there was widespread belief that world oil supplies were limited and prices would continue to rise as they had during the 1973 arab oil embargo at the same time nuclear power was viewed as technology already cost competitive with oil and gas and sure to become more so as it matured and as fossil fuel prices increased in such situation oil and gas deposits were looked on by many as resources that would increase in value in the future worth preserving by substituting cheap nuclear power since the 1970s however the world energy picture has changed radically world proved oil reserves instead of declining have increased by about 50 over what they were in 1973 and real prices have declined below what they were before the oil crisis irans petroleum resources are thus declining in value and exports are limited by world demand rather than supply while this trend has been taking place nuclear power has turned out to be more costly than anticipated nuclear plants may make economic sense for countries without domestic energy resources like japan france south korea and taiwan where they can contribute to energy security and save the cost of importing fuels for power generation but it is difficult to argue that oilrich countries like iran will soon recover the high capital costs of building nuclear power plants through the increased sale of oil and gas in the current world petroleum market the bushehr project in one respect bushehr is bargain for iran the russian offer to build 1000megawatt plant at bushehr for 800 million is far below the typical cost of such facility however progress on the project has been slowed by technical and financial difficulties some 750 russian technical personnel are reported to be on site in february 1998 viktor mikhailov then head of minatom complained that the iranian participants in the project who had been responsible for preparing the site for the installation of the nuclear components had not done so and that this task would have to be done by the russians also yevgeny adamov who was appointed atomic energy minister in march 1998 after mikhailov unexpectedly resigned is cited in the press as confirming that the russian agency would take over construction of the entire plant adding that the 1995 contract would have to be renegotiated to reflect the additional work30 adamov reportedly also said that the recent decision by the ukraine government not to sell electric generating turbines for the bushehr project would not delay its completion ukraines decision to cancel the 45 million sale came at the urging of the united states adamov said the turbines could be built in plant in st petersburg however the ukraine has been the primary supplier of turbines for russiandesigned nuclear power plants 30 russia confirms plan to build nuclear plant in iran associated press march 11 1998 crs13 us concerns about nuclear proliferation the united states has opposed the bushehr project since the islamic revolution both during irans negotiations with kwu to finish the plant and since the russians took over the project however us concerns are not focused primarily on the power plant itself it is not expected that iran would divert weapons material from the bushehr pwr if iran has program to produce nuclear weapons as the united states believes then it is aimed at producing or obtaining highly enriched uranium or at clandestine construction of small reactor specifically designed to produce bombquality plutonium the bushehr plant itself is therefore not considered source of weapons material rather the project is viewed as proliferation risk because it entails massive involvement of iranian personnel in nuclear technology and extensive training and technological support from russian nuclear experts this involvement and training may well provide cover for those iranians who are pursuing development of nuclear weapons it would be much more difficult for iran to conceal its weapons activities if the bushehr project were canceled as long as it continues regardless of delays or difficulties it can shelter the clandestine activities of the weapons program irans nuclear weapons activities the shahs government reportedly had small nuclear weapons research program the present iranian government denies having any interest in nuclear weapons although iranian officials have on occasion made statements supporting acquisition of nuclear weapons and have asserted that israel has nuclear weapons that are not subject to international inspections or monitoring31 however senior us officials including the secretary of state the secretary of defense and past directors of the cia have stated repeatedly that iran has program to develop nuclear weapons32 this us assessment is reportedly based partly on intelligence reports but it is reinforced by irans continued efforts to procure equipment and technologies unnecessary for power production but needed for weapons development despite insisting that its interest in nuclear energy is only for civilian power production iran reportedly has attempted to obtain facilities such as uranium enrichment plants which are necessary to produce highly enriched uranium for weapons and heavy water used in plutonium production reactors recently an iranian attempt to obtain from china large amounts of chemical necessary to prepare natural uranium for enrichment elicited protest from the united states and denial from china33 similarly news

production other governments concur with the us assessment although russian officials now say they have evidence of such program 1993 russian intelligence service report concluded that iran has program of militaryapplied research in the nuclear sphere the report predicted that without outside scientific and technical assistance the appearance of nuclear weapons in iran in this millennium is unlikely35 more recent russian intelligence report released after the controversy over russian nuclear sales to iran backed away from the earlier assessment36 russia eager for income from the sales of nuclear plants abroad insists that it is doing nothing more than fulfilling its obligation as nuclear weapons state to provide peaceful nuclear technology to nonnuclear signatories of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt the russians also argue that the pwr reactors they are building in iran cannot be used for bombmaking and will be closely monitored by russian and iaea safeguards and that the russian reactors are the same type that the united states is helping provide for north korea state that is not in full compliance with iaea safeguards nevertheless adamov was quoted in the press as acknowledging irans weapons ambitions i am sure that iran is trying to create nuclear arsenal it would be foolish to suppose that they do not want to create one he is quoted as saying after he was confirmed in his new job as minatom head by president boris yeltsin37 during visit to iran in november 1998 adamov said that he had reached agreement with iranian officials for speeding up construction of the bushehr project and that russia might agree to build other such reactors in iran38 iran and the npt iran is signatory of the npt and accepts international atomic energy agency iaea safeguards on its nuclear program that program consists mostly of small research reactor in teheran the uncompleted bushehr project has not received any nuclear fuel and hence is not yet subject to

program iranian issues irans relations with russia are based on strategic interests but tempered by lingering fear of russian power and intentions in 1907 russia concluded treaty with britain dividing iran into spheres of control russias in the north britains in the south and neutral center for iran russian troops occupied northern iran during world war i soviet troops invaded again in 1941 in concert with britain when iran was becoming sympathetic to germany the then shah reza shah pahlavi was forced to abdicate in favor of his mohammad reza pahlavi the last shah of iran the soviet union refused to withdraw completely from iran in 1945 and set up two autonomous republics in the north one in iranian azerbaijan inhabited by azeris turkic people dominated by the promoscow tudeh party and another in the kurdish areas of northern iran these autonomous zones threatened to break up iran and emboldened procommunist elements throughout the country combination of us threats and iranian oil concessions persuaded the soviets to withdraw in 1946 and the sovietsponsored autonomous republics collapsed and were occupied by iranian government forces throughout most of the first decade of irans islamic republic formed in 1979 after the fall of the shah the soviet union loomed as potential threat the soviet invasion of afghanistan on irans eastern flank in december 1979 revived iranian fears that moscow might have territorial designs on iran the soviets also backed iraq through the 198088 iraniraq war iraq and the ussr had close ties dating to 1972 treaty of friendship and moscow was iraqs most important arms supplier during that war the united states and its allies also tilted toward iraq leaving iran virtually isolated and with few outside sources of arms supply partly as result of its isolation iran suffered series of major battlefield defeats in 1988 that forced ayatollah khomeini to accept unbrokered end to the war its armed forces devastated after the war iran looked to rebuild it found willing collaborator in the soviet union which was looking to broaden its influence in the persian gulf february 1989 visit to tehran by soviet foreign minister edouard shevardnadze and his meeting with the ailing ayatollah khomeini signaled thaw in irans relations with the soviet union iran established an arms and technology transfer relationship in key visit to moscow by then parliament speaker ali akbar hashemirafsanjani june 1923 1989 the visit began two weeks after ayatollah khomeini died and two months before rafsanjani was elected president of iran the rafsanjani visit represented strategic breakthrough that set the tone for current russianiranian relations the joint communique issued at the conclusion of the rafsanjani visit said that the two countries would collaborate in the peaceful use crs16 of nuclear energy and that the ussr agreed to bolster the military capacity of the islamic republic39 the visit also resulted in agreements for iran to export natural gas to the soviet union and participate in central asian railway construction soon after the rafsanjani visit sovietrussian weaponry began flowing into iran since 1991 iran has taken delivery of 25 mig29 and about 12 su24 combat aircraft russia also has transferred to iran 150 t72 tanks three kiloclass diesel submarines and sa5 and sa6 antiaircraft missiles40 this weaponry has helped iran rebuild its arsenal which was depleted in the eightyear war with iraq even with these acquisitions iran is not as well equipped as iraq in armored vehicles although iraqs force is deteriorating due to lack of spare parts iran also lacks the logistical capabilities to cross the persian gulf in force on the other hand the kilo submarines are new capability for persian gulf country us military officials are concerned that the submarines coupled with other naval equipment received from china enhance irans ability to threaten commercial or military shipping in the gulf and might enable it to lay mines undetected41 the commander of irans revolutionary guard said on november 18 1998 that ships including us ships entering the gulf must report their passage to revolutionary guard forces based on iranian islands in the gulf this strategic relationship with russia might help explain why iran contrary to widespread expectations has emphasized economic cooperation over religion and ideology in its relations with the predominately muslim states of the former soviet union after the soviet union broke up in 1991 russia and the secular leaders of the soviet successor states in the south were concerned that iran might try to spread revolutionary islam in central asia and the caucasus however former president rafsanjani and other iranian pragmatists saw these regions as an export market and means to thwart us efforts to isolate iran rafsanjani appears to have made case within iran that political meddling in central asia which russia considers its sphere of influence could jeopardize continued sales of advanced conventional weapons and equipment related to weapons of mass destruction iran also saw russia as an ally in arguing that all states bordering the caspian sea should share in caspian oil and gas development the election in may 1997 of relative moderate mohammad khatemi as irans president produced speculation that iran might try to scale back its weapons of mass destruction programs and correspondingly to distance itself from russia since taking office in august 1997 khatemi has tried to improve relations with the arab gulf states and the west including the united states at the same time however irans weapons of mass destruction programs have reportedly continued apace and relations with russia have broadened in september 1997 the russian gas company

irans wmd programs israeli security concerns about iran israel views irans ballistic missile program as threat to its security and national survival iranian leaders have called for israels destruction and do not recognize its right to exist while much of the arab world has moved toward acceptance of israel under various conditions iran still formally rejects the idea of coexistence although there are signs that khatemi might be trying to reduce irans active opposition to the middle east peace process iran is loosely allied with syria with which israel is still technically in state of war according to annual state department reports on international terrorism iran gives financial and material assistance to groups such as hizballah hamas and palestinian islamic jihad that have committed acts of terrorism in israel and fight israeli troops in south lebanon israeli concerns may be heightened by memories of iraqs firing of 39 scud missiles at israel during the 1991 persian gulf israel fears that iran already has chemical warheads and might develop the capability to launch biological agents and eventually nuclear warheads at israel on the ballistic missiles it is developing43 in view of israels small size and the concentration of its population in few urban centers israelis are vulnerable to even small number of weapons of mass destruction russian issues russias multifaceted cooperation with iran is motivated by geopolitical economic and political considerations it is not new policy after irans islamic revolution in 1979 and especially after the soviet withdrawal from

it to play role in central asia and the caucasus these are all areas of strong russian interest it appears that russias top foreign policy priority is to be the dominant force on the territory of the former soviet union as noted above moscow values irans restraint in the predominantly muslim soviet successor states in central asia russia and iran also share an interest in countering azerbaijan45 and have cooperated against the puritanical islamist taliban movement in afghanistan as russian foreign policy became more nationalistic and resentful of american global hegemonism and unilateralism under foreign minister primakov moscow turned further toward tehran as partner irans lowkeyed response to russias war in chechnya and its proserb policies in bosnia despite the anti islamic aspects of those russian policies also helped solidify their relations there is also an important economic dimension to russias cooperation with iran russian defense and nuclear industries have been in severe economic distress for years further exacerbated by russias virtual economic collapse in 1998 iran reportedly pays hard currency for nuclear reactors missile technology and conventional weapons purchases in the soviet period the defense sector absorbed huge percentage of gdp in the space of just few years however this sector was displaced from its position near the top of the pyramid to relatively low status in which many of its major elements are struggling to survive minatom which employs about one million people is in much the same economic condition as the rest of the defense industrial sector workers are being paid subsistence and belowsubsistence wages while many enterprises and research institutes stand idle salaries often are months in arrears the director of prestigious nuclear institute committed suicide because he could not pay his workers against this background foreign reactor sales are viewed as matter of survival in minatom nuclear reactor sales worldwide have been slow since the accidents at three mile island and chernobyl minatom reportedly is discussing reactor sales with china india egypt and cuba those governments however unlike iran seek russian loans to finance part or all of the sales minatoms first completed foreign sales contract was with iran the contract for the first reactor at bushehr is valued at 800 million with recent contracts for two additional reactors at bushehr minatom spokesmen put the total iran package at 34 billion over 15 years us estimates of the total iran package are as high as 8 billion the entire russian state budget for 1998 even before the devaluation of the ruble in august was less than 80 billion multibillion dollar sale to iran would be very significant input despite us objections moscow appears determined to go ahead with the reactor deal missile technology transfers may also be motivated by economic factors russian advocates of close cooperation 45 some azeri leaders publically declare the goal of absorbing southern azerbaijan which is part of iran baku also resists russian attempts to dominate caspian sea oil and regional pipelines this provides basis for russoiranian cooperation against azerbaijan crs19 with iran argue that profits from the reactor project and other deals far exceed the amount of us aid that might be jeopardized by sanctions although official us foreign aid to russia in fy1998 is expected to be 120 130 million the united states has much greater economic importance to russia the value of us investments in russia where the united states is the largest foreign investor of the us market for russian sales and of indirect us government assistance via multibillion dollar imf loans which have strong us political backing within the imf and on which russia is highly dependent and us support of russian space activities far exceeds the value of iranian contracts with russian enterprises us economic sanctions could be made to be very painful to russia if decision were taken to pursue such course especially in view of russias renewed economic crisis in late 199846 the administration however still wishes to avoid this approach because of concerns that severe economic sanctions and pressure might seriously strain already tense usrussian relations and endanger russias fragile progress toward democratization and market reform the administration also argues that the russian government is now taking effective steps to curb missile technology transfers to iran there are international and domestic political calculations that seem to reinforce moscows cooperation with iran many russians argue that close collaboration or alliance with iran and china is an appropriate response to nato enlargement also as usrussian relations become more contentious and russian resentment of us global preeminence and of russias dependence on usbacked imf loans grows many analysts believe it is politically expedient for yeltsin to be seen as standing up to america by rebuffing us pressure on iran this helps assuage yeltsins communist and nationalist opposition in the duma it also strikes resonant chord in russian public opinion these political considerations however are probably not as important as the geopolitical and economic factors noted above the clearly articulated policy of the russian government to treat iran as valued partner if not an ally may undermine russian officials willingness to effectively implement exports controls on sensitive technology to iran furthermore many russian commentators and officials argue that us opposition to russias cooperation with iran is commercially motivated there are two versions of this argument the united states wants to cripple russian enterprises that are powerful competitors to us arms and nuclear reactor exporters andor b us firms dream of eventually recapturing the iranian market that they dominated until 1979 some observers have posited serious policy differences within the russian government on issues of cooperation with iran47 this view usually juxtaposed reformers such as chubais nemstov and their allies who advocate close 46 recent russian newspaper article critical of the governments complicity in irans missile development program cautioned that military assistance to iran could bring russia approximately 2 billion annually possible losses from various sanctions by the eu and the united states total approximately 50 billion albats our man in tehran p 4 this was written before the july 1998 imfbrokered 22 billion loan package for russia 47 see for example saradzhyan missile sales to iran crs20 cooperation with the united states against hardliners in the national security and militaryindustrial apparatus and their communist and nationalist allies who assert that russian and us interests as fundamentally antagonistic in late 1998 the reformers who are widely blamed for the economic collapse were greatly weakened while primakov and the militaryindustrial complex are in the ascendant this would seem to auger ill for usrussian cooperation on control of exports to iran on the other hand the economic collapse that propelled primakov into the premiership has also made russia highly dependent on economic assistance from the imf and other international financial institutions in which the us government has powerful voice hence potentially increased source of leverage us policy dual containment throughout its first term the clinton administration consistently characterized iran as an outlaw state that should be contained and isolated according to the administration the key us objections to irans international behavior include its support for international terrorism its active opposition to the arabisraeli peace process and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction in 1993 the administration placed the containment of iran within broader policy framework of dual containment that casts both iran and iraq as rogue regimes that it seeks to keep weak48 for information on dual containment see crs report 97231f iran us policy options by kenneth katzman updated november 4 1998 one of the elements of dual containment has been to cut off the supply of arms and technology to iran us pressure on russia beginning in 1991 did not persuade russia to cancel arms sales to iran however after two years of talks on the issue in may 1995 the united states and russia finalized an agreement under which russia pledged not to enter into any new arms agreements with iran on the basis of that understanding the united states dropped its objection to russian entry into new nonbinding export monitoring regime the wassenaar arrangement however the usrussian agreement on conventional sales to iran has not contributed to resolution of bilateral differences on the nuclear power plant deal or on russian entities assistance to irans ballistic missile programs us efforts to cut off irans supply of strategic weapons and conventional arms has continued despite the election of mohammad khatemi as irans president his election and subsequent statements indicating desire for better relations with the united states have produced signs of possible easing of hostility between the united states and iran in january 1998 khatemi publicly called for greater unofficial scholarly and cultural exchanges between the united states and iran 48 on may 19 1993 former nsc senior director for the near east martin indyk first described the administrations policy as one of dual containment of iran and iraq text of martin indyks speech can be found in the proceedings of the soref symposium challenges to us interests in the middle east obstacles and opportunities may 1819 1993 washington washington institute for near east policy p 1 8 crs21 under pressure from more conservative senior leaders including supreme leader ali khamenei khatemi stopped short of calling for dialogue with the us government us officials from president clinton down have responded that the united states would prefer political dialogue with the iranian government but would look to facilitate the peopletopeople exchanges mentioned by khatemi on june 17 the administration appeared to shift further toward conciliation in speech by secretary of state albright secretary albright said that the two countries should work to develop roadmap of confidence building measures that could eventually lead to normalization of relations president clinton echoed those comments the following day and in message broadcast in advance of the june 20 world cup soccer match between iran and the united states teheran reacted cautiously to the statements irans foreign minister responding to the albright speech in late september 1998 reiterated that iran requires concrete signs of change in us policy easing of sanctions before relations can improve members of congress although increasingly open to dialogue with iran oppose easing of sanctions in advance of concrete changes in iranian behavior some members of congress opposed administration consideration of removing iran from the list of states that do not cooperate with us antinarcotics efforts iran was re designated as noncooperative in february 1998 as it has been every year since 1987 although the administration noted reports of iranian progress on anti narcotics efforts several members also opposed the administrations may 18 waiver of sanctions on the foreign firms that invested in irans south pars gas field provision of the omnibus appropriation act pl 105277 expresses the sense of the congress that there be easing of us policy toward iran until iran alters its objectionable policies in addition some proisrael groups and iranian opposition groups want strict enforcement of all us sanctions against iran some of these groups oppose easing pressure on iran as long as it supports terrorism seeks weapons of mass destruction and hinders the arabisraeli peace process they also maintain that khatemis grip on power is not firm and he could quickly be ousted or neutralized by hardline elements within the regime others believe that khatemi himself has undertaken charm offensive in an effort to blunt us sanctions with real intention of improving relations with the west missile technology transfers to iran the arms export control act aeca pl 90629 restricts exports of military items including missiles and related technology the export administration act of 1979 eaa pl 9672 until it expired on august 20 1994 contained the legal authority for the government to control exports of civilian goods and technology that are also useful for missile production congress has not passed revised version of the eaa president clinton reimposed export controls under the authority of the international emergency economics power act ieepa he did this by declaring national emergency to deal with the threats to the united states caused by the lapse of the eaa and system of export controls executive order 12924 august 19 1994 each year he has extended that national emergency crs22 in november 1990 congress amended the aeca and the eaa to include export restrictions and penalties to be imposed on us and foreign persons and firms that improperly transfer missile technology in many cases the sanctions provisions of these laws do not apply to companies or individuals exporting from countries that are adherents to the mtcr in addition to these general policies against missile proliferation congress sharpened us policy toward iran by passing and later amending the iraniraq arms nonproliferation act of 1992 pl 102 484 this law requires sanctions against those who provide weapons of mass destruction or destabilizing types and numbers of advanced conventional weapons to iran or iraq although it also gives the president waiver authority congress also amended the foreign assistance act of 1961 faa to prohibit aid to 1 states of the former soviet union that transfer technology that contributes to the production of missiles or weapons of mass destruction sec 498a 2 countries that aid terrorist states sec 620g 22 usc 2377 and countries that provide military equipment to terrorist states sec 620h finally the last several foreign operations appropriations acts have reduced aid to russia unless the president certifies it has terminated its ballistic missile and nuclear technology assistance to iran on november 14 1994 president clinton declared national emergency under the authority of the ieepa in light of the dangers of the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weapons and the means of delivering such weapons eo 12938 this executive order declared the export control regulations initiated by president bush under the enhanced proliferation control initiative remained in force on july 28 1998 president clinton issued an amendment to eo 12938 effective july 29 1998 the amendment adds penalties for contributions to foreign nuclear weapons and missile programs as well as the chemical and biological programs previously covered whereas eo 12938 required finding that foreign person knowingly and materially contributed to proliferation the amendment requires finding only that foreign person made material contribution removing the factor that the person did so knowingly or that foreign person attempted to contribute materially to proliferation efforts the amendment expands the range of potential penalties to include the prohibition of us government assistance as well as previously specified penalties prohibiting imports and procurement from the proliferating person also the amendment authorizes the secretary of state to tailor the us response to proliferation efforts by determining the extent to which these measures should be imposed considering national security and foreign policy interests the likely effectiveness of such measures and their costs and benefits in addition to appealing to russian national security interests and threatening economic sanctions the administration is using economic incentives to try to deny iran missile technology in march 1998 the administration offered to increase the number of western commercial satellites russia would be allowed to launch under 1996 agreement russia was limited to launching 20 western geostationary satellites through the year 2000 since then the demand for commercial launches has increased american businesses in joint ventures with russians have urged the administration to increase russias quota but it had hesitated until now each crs23 launch costs 60100 million us officials say publicly that the additional satellite launches were not offered as quid pro quo nor merely as an enticement for russian cooperation on iran but both sides privately acknowledge linkage between additional launches and more effective russian control of missile technology49 since early 1997 the administration has considered russian missile technology transfers to iran high priority the president appointed special representative for this issue who met frequently with russian officials in moscow and washington in addition vice president gore took the issue up directly with former premier chernomyrdin in their talks in washington march 1011 1998 where they agreed to set up special expert joint commission to focus on issues of missile and nuclear technology transfers russian officials at that time reportedly gave assurances that tougher controls on missile technology transfers had recently been put in place and that some violators were already being prosecuted50 russian nuclear cooperation with iran following the announcement of the russianiranian nuclear reactor deal in january 1995 the clinton administration mounted an intense effort to persuade moscow to cancel the deal with frequent meetings at the subministerial level and between the us secretaries of state and defense and their russian counterparts and with chernomyrdin moscow consistently rebuffed the us overtures at the clintonyeltsin summit in moscow in may 1995 yeltsin made significant concession by agreeing not to provide iran with gas centrifuge equipment which would have enabled iran to produce highly enriched weapons grade uranium these centrifuges had been included in the january 1995 russianiranian agreement moscow also pledged to tighten its monitoring of irans nuclear program and to bring all spent nuclear fuel back to russia nevertheless although the administration has continued to view the bushehr nuclear reactor program as very serious matter it apparently has come to believe that it cannot persuade the russian government to renounce the deal as noted above congress has included economic sanctions against russia in the foreign aid bill each year since 1995 but has acceded to administration requests for inclusion of presidential waiver authority on national security grounds with hr 2709 congress confronted russia and the administration with more stringent requirements for sanctions in connection with missile technology transfers although the bill also provided authority for presidential waiver on national security grounds 49 jamestown monitor march 10 1998 defense news march 1622 1998 p 12 50 crs interviews with congressional staff and russian diplomats march 1998 crs24 selected legislation in the 105th congress the 105th congress considered several bills dealing with russianiranian missile technology and nuclear reactor transfers several bills called for sanctions against

and was passed in both chambers in bill that included implementing legislation for the chemical weapons convention however the president vetoed the bill and congress did not try to override the veto nonbinding resolutions would have condemned russian missile technology transfer to iran urged the president to impose sanctions or cut us contributions to the international atomic energy agency iaea
