provides only limited protection to commercial speech such as tobacco advertising th supreme court has prescribed the central hudson test to determine the constitutionality of governmental restrictions of commercia l speech this test requires that restrictions of nonmisleading commercial speec h directly advance substantial governmental interest in manner that is not overbroad in 1996 in 44 liquormart inc v rhode island the supreme court increased th protection that the central hudson test guarantees to commercial speech expressing skepticism of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what th governme nt perceives to be their own good one may apparently infer from thi s decision that restrictions on truthful tobacco advertising that is not aimed at minors may be unconstitutional subsequen t to 44 liquormart federal court of appeals upheld baltimor ordinanc that prohibited tobacco advertisements on billboards except in certai n commercially and industrially zoned areas of the city it reasoned that although the ordinance reduced the opportunities for adults to receive tobacco advertising it did not preclude them and the ordinance constitut ed reasonable way to attempt to limit underage smoking s 1415s total ban n billboards with tobacco advertisements by contrast would seem more li kely to raise constitutional questions similar questions may be raised with respect to other marketing and advertising restrictions to th extent that they deny adults access to tobacco advertising more than is necessary to protect children however the fact that s 1415s restrictions would not be s encompassi ng as the restrictions on price advertising that the supreme court struck down in 44 liquormart and would allow some tobacco advertising t continue might

advertises an illegal product or service and unlike fully protected speech may be banned if it is unfair or deceptive even when it advertises legal product and is not unfair or deceptive the government may regulate commercial speech more than it may regulate fully protected speech fully protected speech may be restricted only to pr omote compelling interest and only by the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest for2 commercial speech by contrast the supreme court has prescribed the fourpron g central hudson test to determine its constitutionality this test asks initially 1 whether the commercial speech at i ssue is protected by the first amendment that is whether it concerns lawful activity and is not misleading and 2 whether th asserted governmental interest in restricting it is substantial if both inquiries yield positive answers then to be constitutional the restriction must 3 directly advance the governmental interest asserted and 4 be not more exte nsive than is necessary to serve tha t interest in board of trustees of the state university of new york v3 fox the supreme court made it easier for the government to satisfy the fourth prong of the cent ral hudson test it held that the fourth prong is not to be interprete d strictly to require the legislature to use the least restrictive means available t accomplish its purpose instead the court held legislation regulating commercia l4 speech is to be upheld if the re is fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends fit that is not necessarily perfect bu t reasonable the court however does not equate this test with the s5 rigorous obstacles of rational basis review in other words although to satisfy the6 fourth prong restriction on commercial speech need not constitute the leas t restrictive means to advance the asse rted governmental interest it must be more than merely rational in 1996 in 44 liquormart inc v rhode island the supreme court increased the protection that the central hudson test guarantees to commercial speech b indicating that when state entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of fairhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs3 116 s ct 1495 1507 1996 the nine justices were unanimous in striking down the law7 which prohibited advertising the price of alcoholic beverages but only parts of justic stevens opi nion for the court were joined by majority of justices the quotations above for example are from part iv of the courts opinion which was joined by only justice s kennedy and ginsburg besides justice stevens us department of health and human services public health service centers for disease8 control and prevention state laws on tobacco control united states 1995 478 us 328 341 19869bargaining process the restriction will be subject to stricter review by the courts than regulation designed to protect consumers from misleading deceptive r aggressive sales practices the prohibition in 44 liquormart was on advertising the7 price of alcoholic beverages not on all advertisi ng of alcoholic beverages therefore when the court referred to entirely prohibiting the dissemination of truthful nonmisleading commercial messages it apparently included entirely prohibiting th dissemination of any particular item of truthful nonmisleading information we will now discuss the application of each of the four prongs of the centra l hudso n test to 122123 considering their provisions in general rather tha n considering each of their restrictions on t obacco advertising separately then we will consider whether 44 liquormart affects our general conclusion finally we wil l consider the constitutionality of some of the specific restrictions applying central hudson first prong the first prong of the central hudson test asks whether the restricted speec h concerns wful activity and is not misleading we will assume that the advertising is not misleading as if it is it is already illegal under 5 of the federal trad commission act 15 usc 45 which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts r practice s in or affecting commerce we will also assume that the advertisement s concern lawful activity even though the sale of toba cco products to minors is illegal in every state we will assume that the advertisements concern lawful activit y8 because some of the restrictions in 122123 would affect tobacco advertisements aimed at adults as well as at minors applying central hudson second prong the second prong of the central hudson test asks whether the asserte d governmental i nterest in restricting the commercial speech in question is substantial the supre court in posadas puerto rico associates v tourism company of puerto rico held that governments interest in the health safety and welfare of its citizens constitutes substantial governmental interest although part vi of9 the courts opin ion in 44 liquormart questioned some aspects of posadas this was not one of them and there seems doubt that s 1415 would satisfy the secon d prong httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs4 id at

hudson third prong in posadas the supreme court applying the third prong of the central hudson test found reasonable the puerto rico legislatures view that restricting advertising would directly advance the asserted governmental interest by reducing the demand for the product advertised which in this case was gambling the court also cite d10 with approval statement from an earlier case that the third prong of central hudson is satisfied where the legislative judgment is not manifestly unreasonable 11 in subsequent cases however the court has not defer red as readily to legislative judgments that restriction directly advances the asserted governmental interest in edenfield v fane for example the court struck down florida ban on solicitation12 by certified public accountants even though the court had previously in ohralik v ohio state bar association upheld ban on solicitation by attorneys the court13 found that the government had substantial interests in the ban including th prevention of fraud the protection of privacy and the need to maintain cp independence and to guard against conflicts of interest however the court found evidence that the ban directly advanced these interests and noted among othe r things that unlike lawyer cpa is not professional trained in the art f persuasion and the typical clie nt of cpa is far less susceptible to manipulation than the young accident victim in ohralik 14 in ibanez v florida board of accountancy the court held that the florid board of ccountancy could not reprimand an accountant for truthfully referring to her credentials as certified public accountant and certified financial planner in her advert ising and other communication with the public such as her business cards and stationery the court applied the central hudson test noting that the stat must demonstrate that t he harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to material degree15 in rubin v coors brewing co the court struck down federal statute 2 7 usc 205e that prohibits beer labels from displayin g alcohol content unless state law requires such disclosure the court found sufficiently substantial to satisfy the16 second prong of the central hudson test the governments interest in curbin g strength wars by beer brewers who might seek to compete for customers on th basis of alcohol content however it concluded that the ban cannot directly an d materially advance this interest because of the overall irrationality of th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs5 id at 48817 116 s ct at 150918 id at 151019 florida bar supra note 320 id 515 us at 62421 id at 62722 61 fed reg 44474 1996 these regulations have not taken effect because federa l23 court held that the fda lacked the statutory authority to implement them coyne beahm inc v united states 958 f supp 1060 md nc 1997governments regulatory scheme this irrationality is evidenced by the fact that17 the ban does not apply to beer advertisements and by the fact that the statute requires the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of wines and spirits finally in 44 liquormart the court in striking down prohibition n advertising the price of alcoholic beverages found that rhode island had not met its burden of showing that the ban will significantly advance the states interest i n promoting temperance the states own showing the court wrote reveals18 that any connection between the ba n and significant change in alcohol consumption would be purely fortuitous any conclusion that elimination of the ban would significantly increase alcohol consumption would require us to engage in the sort of speculation or conjecture that is an unacceptable means of demonstrating that restriction on commercial speech directly advances the states asserted interest19 cases like edenfield ibanez rubin and 44 liquormart indicate that to satisfy the third prong of the central huds on test the government must present evidence to support its claim that its restriction on commercial speech directly and materiall advances substantial governmental interest in florida bar v went for it inc the court upheld rule of the florida bar that prohibited personal injury lawyers fro m sending targeted directmail solicitations to victims and their relatives for 30 day s following an accide nt or disaster the bar argued that it has substantial interest20 in protecting the privacy and tranquility of personal injury victims and their loved ones against intrusive unsolicited contact by lawyers and the court found that the21 anecdotal record mustered by the bar to demonstrate that its rule would advance this interest in direct and material way was noteworthy for its breadth and detail i t was not mere speculation and conjecture 22 when the food and drug administration promulgated tobacco advertisin g restrictions it concluded that tobacco advertising plays concrete role in th decision of minors to smoke and that eac h specific restriction on this advertising that it is adopting wil l contribute to limiting its effect and thus to protecting the health of children and adolescents under the age of 18 if this is true then the advertising23 restrictions would in general apparently satisfy the third prong of the centra l hudson test of course it is possible f or court to find some of the restrictions in s 1415 constitutional but others unconstitutional httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs6 id24 see text accompanying note 6 supra 25 507 us 410 199326 id at 424 emphasis in original27 id at 42828 44 liquormart supra note 7 116 s ct at 1510 29the fda i n connection with its regulations wrote it is not necessary i n satisfying this prong of central hudson for the agency to prove conclusively that the correlation between advertis ing and minors smoking in fact empirically exists or that the steps u ndertaken will completely solve the problem rather the agency must show that the available evidence expert opinion surveys and studies provid sufficient support for the inference that advertising does play material role i n children s tobacco use this seems accurate given the courts acceptance f24 anecdotal evidence albeit anecdotal evidence note worthy for its breadth and detail in florida bar v went for it inc even though anecdotal evidence by itself cannot conclusively prove general propositions in sum it appears likely that the restrictions in s 1415 would satisfy the third prong if the government can present evidence that they will reduce the demand fo r tobacco and thereby reduce the incidence of tobaccorelated illnesses applying central hudson fourth prong we now turn to t he fourth and final requirement of the central hudson test that restrictions on commercial speech represent reasonable fit between th legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends as noted above this prong requires that restrictio n be more than merely rational but not necessarily the least restrictive means to advance the asserted governmental interest in25 cincinnati v disco very network inc the supreme court struck down cincinnati regulation that banned newsracks on public property if they distributed commercial publications but not if they distributed news pu blications the court found that the26 asserted governmental interest in safety and esthetics was substantial but that th distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech bears relationshi p whatsoever to the particular interests that the city s asserted the city therefore27 did not tablish the fit between its goals and its chosen means that is required by our opinion in fox28 in 44 liquormart the court found it perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulati on would be more likely to achieve the states goal of promotin g tempera nce as the states own expert conceded higher prices can be maintaine d either by direct regulation or by increased taxation even educational campaigns might prove to be more effective29 the courts strong language in cincinnati v discovery network relationship whatsoever and in 44 liquormart perfectly obvious suggests that it found the regulations it struck down in those two cases to be particularly poorl yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs7 id at 1507 quoted in the text accompanying note 7 supra 30 the fda argued that its restriction s were related to the bargaining process as they derive31 from the fact that at least as matter of law minors are t competent to use these products 61 fed reg 44470 it would seem to strengthen the fdas case in this regard if we read this instead to mean that minors are not competent to resist tobacco advertisements thi s argument would also s eem available to s 1415 but with less force because though s 1415 is intended to protect youth its restrict ions apply to more advertisements aimed at adults and so seem less designed to protect consumers from misleading deceptive or aggressive sales practices for example the fdas restrictions would ban tobacco billboards within 1000 feet of school or playground whereas s 1415 would ban all outdoor tobacco billboards 44 liquormart supra note 7 116 s ct at 150832 id at 151033 id at 1515 scalia j concurring34thoughtout s 1415 in general does not appear similar in this respect however the reason ableness of its restrictions must be considered individually which we d after we consider the effect of 44 liquormart effect of 44 liquormart as noted above the supreme court in 44 liquormart indicated that tota l prohibition on the dissemination of truthfu l nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of fair bargaining process will be subject to stricter review by the courts than regulation designed to protect consumers from misleading deceptive or aggressive sales practices sections 122123 like th e30 speech restriction struck down in 44 liquormart appears primari ly intended to reduce consumption of dangerous product rather than to protect consumers from unfai r sales practices sections 122123 however unlike the speech restriction struc k31 down in 44 liquormart would not impose total prohibition on any informatio n sought to be advertised in addition the fact that 122123 are in part intended to protect minors may help to distinguish it from the rhode island statute thread that appears to ru n through 44 liquormart is the justices hostility to the paternalistic aspect of rhode islands ban in part iv of the courts opinion justice stevens writes the first amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulation s that seek to ke ep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good32 in part v he adds that mere speculation as to whether restriction n commercial speech directly advances the states asserted interest certainly does not suffice when the state takes aim at accurate commercial information fo r paternalistic ends justice scalia concurring indicated that he shares justic

aimed at adults as well as at children in the context of indecent material the supreme court has reiterated that the government may not reduce the adult population to reading only what is fit for children thus for example indecent materia l may not be banned from the36 airwaves for 24 hours d ay and adults access to indecent material on the internet37 may not be preclude d in order to protect children at least if less restrictive means to protect children are available this principle may not apply as forcefully t o38 governmental restrictions of commercial speech however as adults access t indecent material unlike to commercial speech receives full first amendmen t protection nevertheless the justices discomfort with th paternalism they perceived in the rhode island statute suggests that even if commercial speech restrictio n aimed at public health might otherwise pass the central hudson test it might not if it unduly restricts adults access t truthful nonmisleading commercial messages at the same time the rhode island statute totally restricted liquor price advertising whereas s 1415 would not totally restrict tobacco advertising and this distinctio n could make difference in courts decision as to the constitutionality of s 1415 prior to 44 liquormart the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit in two cases upheld baltimore ordinances that prohibited tobacco and alcoho l advertisements on billboards except in certain commercially and industrially zone d areas of the city then after 44 liquormart the supreme court vacated an d39 remanded both cases for further

previous decisions in both cases and the supreme court subsequently declined to review the cases in penn adv ertising the tobacco advertising case the40 court said simply that it was readopting its previous decision for the reasons it gave in its op inion issued the same day in anheuserbusch the alcoholic beverag advertising case in that case the court wrote that in its previous decision we recognized the reasonableness of baltimore citys legislative findin g that there is d efinite correlation between alcoholic beverage advertising and underage drinking we also concluded that the regulation f commercial speech is not more extensive than necessary to serve th governmental interest recognizing that in the regulation of commercia l speech there is some latitude in the fit between the regulation and th objective we concluded that less restrictive means may be available to advance the governments interest while we acknowledged that th geographical limitation on outdoor advertising may also reduce th opportunities for adults to rece ive the information we recognize that there were numerous other means of advertising to adu lts that did not subject the children to involuntary an d unavoidable solicitation while walking to school or playing in their neighborhood in 44 liquormart by contrast the state prohibited all advertisin g throughout rhode island in any manner whatsoever of the price f alcoholic beverages except for price tags or signs displayed with th beverages and not visible from the street whi rhode islands blanket ban on price advertising failed central hudson scrutiny baltimore s attempt to zone outdoor alcoholic beverage advertising into appropriat areas survived our close look at the legislatures means of accomplishing its objecti ve baltimores ordinance expressly targets persons wh cannot be legal users of alcoholic beverages not legal users as in rhod island more significantly baltimore does not ban outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages outright but merely restricts the time place an d manner of such advertisements and baltimores ordinance does t foreclose the plethora of newspaper magazine radio television direc t mail internet and other media available to anheuserbusch and it s competitors41 the pertinent question it seems is whether the restrictions that s 1415 would impose would be more like those struck down in 44 liquormart or those upheld in the fourth circuit cases like the ordinances the fourth circuit upheld s 141 5 would not impose total ba n on any information sought to be advertised however s 1415 would not focus as narrowly on advertisements accessible to children as did the ordinances the fourth circuit upheld it is not the case with s 1415 as it wa s with the baltimore ordinances that it would not ban ou tdoor advertising of alcoholichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs10 15 usc 1335 4402 42beverage s outright but merely restricts the time place and manner of such adver tisements but like baltimores alcoholic beverage ordinance it would not except with respect to the internet foreclose the plethora f other media on which tobacco products may be advertised at the same time however federal law already reduces the size of this plethora as it bans advertisements for cigarettes little cigars and smokeless tobacco on any medium of electronic communication subject to th jurisdiction of the federal communications commission this would be factor42 that could be cited to argue that s 1415 would have more restrictive effect n adults than might appear from its face in addition s 1 415 would restrict the content of adverti sements in media in which it would continue to permit advertisements which is something the baltimore ordinances do not do in conclu sion it appears that the degree of restrictiveness of s 1415 would lie somewhere between that of the provision struck down in 44 liquormart and thos upheld in the fourth circuit cases some of the prohibitions of s 1415 would seem to include the sort of paternalism to which the court objected in 44 liquormart but others of its prohibitions seem more nar rowly focused on protecting minors we will distinguish among these in the next section of this memorandum first however we offer more general comment the decision in 44 liquormart might on the one hand be viewed as part of trend on the courts part to increase the first amendment protection it accords to commercial speech if this is in fact trend then the likelihood of its striking down substantial portions of s 1415 would increase on the other hand the court in 44 liquormart as note d above seemed to view the rhode island statute in question as particularly poorl thoughtout with the court commenting that any connection between the ban and significant change in alcohol consumption would be purel fortuitous and that it is perfectly obviou s that alternative forms of speech would be more likely to achieve the states goal of promoting temperance although s 1415 would restrict more speech than the baltimore ordinances do it does not appear poorly thoughtout in the manner that the supreme court seemed to think the rhode island statute in 44 liquormart was it is also possible t hat stronger link can be demonstrated between the restrictions in s 1415 and significant change in tobacco consumption but now we must examine some of the restrictions in s 1415 individually as that is how they will stand or fall analysis of s 1415s restrictions to do this necessitates applying the four prongs of the central hudson test however we will take as given that all the restrictions in s 1415 would pass the first prong as tobacco advertising is legal and we will presume it is not misleading we will also assume that all the restrictions would pass the second prong s restricting tobacco advertising would serve the substantial governmental interest of promoting public health in add ition to the extent that the restrictions would reduce childrens exposure to tobacco advertisements we will assume that they woul d directly and materially advance the governmental interest in reducing underag smoking the co nstitutionality of most of the restrictions therefore will apparentlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs11 pictures as well as words are protected by the first amendment see manuel enterprises43 v day 370 us 478 1962turn on the fourth prong which asks whether for each restriction there is reasonable fit between the governments means and ends the restriction must be more than merely rational but need not necessarily be the least restrictive mean s available the prohibition of outdoo r advertising might be subject to challenge if it were limited as the baltimore ordinance is to outdoor advertising within 1000 feet of school or pla yground then there would be precedent for its constitutionality the restricti on as it stands clearly would reduce childrens exposure to tobacc advertising so it would seem likely to satisfy t he third prong of central hudson but it would also reduce adults exposure to tobacco advertising so the governmen t would apparently have to demonstrate that restriction limited as the baltimor ordinance is would leave minors overly exposed to tobacco advertising and woul d not overly restrict adults access to tobacco advertising the prohibition of advertising in enclosed stadia may also be challenged because it does not exempt events or activities that children are unlikely to attend the government could advance its aim of protecting children without bannin g advertisements at performances from which children are excluded because they ar xrated though admittedly such performances usually occur in theaters or bar s rather than in stadia there are also performances from which children are t excluded but which relatively few children attend such as classical music concert s other than tho designed for children if few children typically attend particular type of performance then one might challenge this restriction on the ground that it would not materially advance the governmental interest in protecting children an d would therefor fail the third prong or one might challenge it on the ground that it would unreasonably interfere with the rights of adults and would therefore fail th fourth prong these arguments would apply on the assumption that th advertisements in question could be easily taken up and down if they were relatively permanent then there would be stronger argument that banning them would b constitutional the prohibi tion of advertising or labeling with human or animal image r cartoon character would seem to face similar problems if the government coul d present evidence that children respond particularly to human images and cartoo n characters then this restriction would apparently be constitutional to the extent that it would n ot overly restrict adults access to the proscribed pictures it would 43 however apparently raise constitutional questions to the extent that it would apply to material unavailable to children and perhaps also to the extent that it would apply to material with an intellectual content that would attract few minors the requirement of disclaimers that words such as li ght or low tar describing the product do not render the product less hazardous than any other tobacco product as well as of other discl osures not noted in the

626 651 1985 emphasis i n44 original see text accompanying note 38 supra 45has held that an advertisers constitutionally protected interest in not providing any particular factual information in his advertising is minimal44 the requirement that advertising and labeling be reviewed by the secretary f hhs before it is first used would apparently be constitutional if it is designed solely to enable the secr etary to advise the tobacco company as to whether the advertising and labeling complies with the law or to seek court injunction against suc h advertising if appropriate the prohibition of advertising on the internet unless such an advertisement is inaccessible in or from the united states to all individuals under the age of 18 may be problematic because the degree of censorship it would impose on adults migh t cause court to find that it does not represent reasonable fit under centra l hudson s fourth prong this provis ion would apparently in effect prohibit tobacco advertising on the internet except for the relatively small percentage of web site s available to adults only by subscription only as discussed above the suprem court in reno v aclu held comparable restriction on indecent materia l unconstitutional although the fact that indecent material receives higher level f first amendment protection than commerci speech increases the possibility that the supreme court would uphold this provision of s 1415 45 the prohibition of advertising with other than black text on white background except at locations where individuals under 18 are not permitted and in publications whose readers under the age of 18 constitute 15 percent or less of the total readership appears more likely to be found constitutional than some of the provisions that would more greatly restrict advertising aimed at adults as noted t here appears to be an inconsistency in the provision that woul d prohibit payments to be made to ensu re that logo symbol motto selling message recognizable color or pattern of color s or any other indicia of product identification appear in movie program or video game section 122a2 prohibits suc h payments outright whereas section 122a3 apparently prohibits them only in the case of print or film media that appeals to individuals under the age of 18 years or through live performance by an entertainment artist that appeals to suc h individuals thu s the restriction on advertising in programs or video games would not be limited to those that appeal to minors while the restriction as to print media and to live performances would be limited in that respect the word programs presumably means television programs rather than printed programs that ar distributed at live performances but this mig ht be clarified however the restriction on advertising in movies would be restricted to those that appeal to minors while the restrictions as to films would not be which seems inconsistent the above restrictions that are not limi ted to those that appeal to minors may be subject to challenge on the ground that they unduly restrict adults access to tobaccohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98466crs13 advertisements even those that are limited however may face challenge because of the possible vagueness of the word appeals the prohibition f logo symbol motto selling message recognizable color or pattern of colors or any other indicia identifiable with tobacco product to be used on nontobacco products would restrict particular form of tobacc advertising as such it might raise constitutional questions because it would not be limited to nontobacco products to which minors are exposed to significant degree finally section 123s lim its on pointofsale advertising at any location in which an individual under 18 is permitted would seem constitutional because they ar directed to minors and do not totally restrict advertising aimed at adults in summary it appears that the constitutionality of s 1415s restrictions wil l likely turn on whether they represent reasonable fit between the government s means and ends in reno v aclu in striking down rest rictions on indecent material the supreme court reiterated that the government may not reduce the adul t population to reading only what is fit for chi ldren however reno v aclu did not involve commercial speech which receives less protection under the firs t amendment than other speech consequently the courts might find that s 1415 s restrictions even though they would limit adults access to tobacco advertising would represent reasonable fit between the governments means and its end of reducin g underage smoking the fact that s 1415s restrict ions would not be as encompassing as the restrictions on liquor price advertising that the supreme court struck down in 44 liquormart and would allow some tobacco advertising to contin ue might increase the likelihood of the restrictions being upheld however this is an area f constitutional law about which it is difficult to make predictions
