the agenda of the 107th congress will be largely domestic social security health care education taxes and military pay were prominent in campaigns across america and on postelection news programs indeed many issues discussed in this report will be affected by the resolution of contentious battle for the presidency in the congress the 5050 split in the senate and the close party ratio in the house along with new house committee chairmen also will affect the agenda with less time to organize the presidential transition and with upcoming senate votes on executive branch nominatio ns the 107th congress will have to split its time between administrative actions and policy concerns the 107th congress will help define the us role in the world within the framework of increasing globalization and its effects on us foreign and security policy key issue on the congressional agenda will be debate over how and when to use economic aid and sanctions to achieve us foreign policy goals and objectives another focus will continue to be the extent of us involvement in conflicts and crises worldwide and unde r what conditions the us is willing to commit military forces and resources to such conflicts third category of concerns is the postcold war proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the related debate over the development testing and possible deployment of national and theater missile defense systems numerous other foreign affairs trade and defense issues will face the 107th congress in addition to those mentioned above important themes may include the

specialist in international relations robert l goldich specialist in national defense the new president and the 107th congress are facing early challenges in foreign defense and trade policy including unfinished business from the last congress new election in israel and ongoing transboundary concerns congressional action will be shaped by competing visions of the appropriate us role in the world the decade since the collapse of the soviet union has brought profound changes in the international environment the united states has been left as the sole superpower in less predictabl world than the one defined for half century by the ussoviet balance of power years of uninterrupted us economic expansion have strengthened the us position as the dominant world power with an unprecedented ability to exert its influence us leaders hip is sought and welcomed even as it arouses wariness of us hegemony at the same time the world is not static and we are witnessing the rise of new power centers in asia and europe chinese power is on the rise even as russian power seems to be waning and europe continues fitfully towards integration the emerging global economy built on revolution in science technology communications and the unprecedented movement of people ideas and goods across national boundaries has profoundly changed international relations and the ability of governments to control developments even within national borders international developments have an impact on domestic policy as never before the benefits of globalization are far reaching spurrin g world productivity economic growth and access to information advances in communications information technology science and medicine are likely to continue and even accelerate in the coming years along with the benefits come significant new challenges that may require further legislative action globalization brings economic dislocations in some areas and activates political environmental and cultural concerns transnational threats such as terrorism cyberterrorism and warfare international crime the spread of weapons of mass destruction the spread of contagious diseases environmental problems and the potential for financial instability are on the rise global developments lend themselves less and less to control or influence by individual governments yet mechanisms to act jointly and across borders are still weak as countries are reluctant to cede sovereignty to international entities the 107th congress will address many issues associated with globalization how congress deals with specific problems of national security foreign policy management foreign aid relations with international organizations regional hothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs2 spots trade and economic policy is closely tied to the unresolved debate over the appropriate us role in the world at the beginning of the 21st century profound differences on this question are mirrored in congressional debate many believe that strong us leadership within multilateral institutions will be necessary to find cooperative solutions to world problems others are suspicious of these organizations and reluctant to compromise us freedom of action the debate extends to issues such as the role of us alliances and the question of when and where the united states should intervene with military force should us forces be used only in defense of vital national interests or as broader policy instrument should they participate in peacemaking peacekeeping nationbuilding or humanitarian interventions there is more consensus than many realize among politicians and analysts about the broad outline of us defense policy in the early 21st century continuing and somewhat increasing the small upturn in defense spending which began in fy1999 maintaining nuclear weapons capabilities needed for decreased but still required deterrence regime containing potential adversaries with forwarddeployed forces in europe northeast asia and the persian gulf and adapting the theories and concepts of the computerdriven revolution in military affairs rma to actual forces and operations so as to maintain and increase our already formidable military technological and organizational superiority over our adversaries expressing these principles in specific programs and budgets generates controversy how for instance are even modest increases in defense spending to be carved out of predicted budget surpluses already marked for social security protection tax reduction debt retirement and other domestic legislation are the forces we have even if their readiness is improved sufficient to fight one let alone two major theater wars without incurring tremendous casualties and possibly temporary defeats in the process is in fact the requirement that the us forces be sized and structured to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major theater wars valid one many wish to deploy ballistic missile defense bmd systems but reconciling development of bmd capability with great reluctance to let this particular genie out of the arms control bottle will be difficult too little spent on new technologies from the rma and we risk being saddled with obsolete hardware later in the century too much and for all of the dazzling experimentation and future promise being shown we might not have enough force structure in the here and now to go to war and win in short the defense issues facing the 107th congress will be ones of deciding how to do what the congress the new administration and the american public want to do this will become apparent as congress acts on the fy2002 budget resolution foreign relations authorization defense authorization and appropriation bills for dod state department and foreign operations throughout

foreign and security policy economic sanctions and us foreign policy dianne rennack specialist in foreign policy legislation the 107th congress inherits from its predecessors continuing debate about how and when to use economic sanctions in furtherance of foreign policy or national security goals the use of economic sanctions coercive economic measures taken against one or more countries or entities to force change in policies or at least to demonstrate countrys opinion about the others policies1 has generally been supported by both the congress and the president as an option to combat proliferation of weapons of mass destructi on terrorism aggression drug trafficking or human rights abuses in the 105th and 106th congress however legislation was introduced to reform the way economic sanctions are used in foreign policy reform proposals advocated by us business and farm lobbyists would require or encourage the president or congress to exhaust other foreign policy tools diplomatic political or cultural first to make the use of sanctions more transparent so that the anticipated costs and benefits are understood beforehand to engage congress more fully in the decisionmaking process heretofore left primarily to the executive branch to target the sanctions to minimize the impact on people in targeted country who are not viewed as part of the problem and to require regular review of sanctions regimes with an eye toward easing or lifting the restrictions the 106th congress considered more than 150 legislative proposals to impose new sanctions ease current regimes or overhaul the entire process that the legislative and executive branches employ when considering the use of sanctions in national security or foreign policy the 106th congress enacted legislation to ease sanctions including 1 authorizing the president to lift or modify sancti ons imposed against india and pakistan in the wake of their nuclear weapons tests 2 granting normal trade relations status to albania and kyrgyzstan and 3 granting permanent normal trade relations status to china most notably the 106th congress passed the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of 2000 pl 106387 to limit the presidents authority to impose sanctions that would restrict the export of food agricultural commodities medicines or medical devices to targeted countries the 106th congress also enacted legislation to impose new sanctions or finetune existing sanctions regimes including 1 the iran nonproliferation act 2 the north korea threat reduction act also pertaining to nonproliferation 3 the foreign narcotics kingpin designation act to freeze usbased assets 4 the trafficking victims protection act targeting those involved in trafficking of women and children for sex or slavery and 5 new

expected to be introduced early in the 1st session advocates for sanctions reform in the congress and in the business community have stated their continued resolve to enact legislation nonproliferation watchdogs promise to be active nonproliferation issues are considered unfinished by many vis avis the peoples republic of china for example included in the debate in the 106th congress over that countrys permanent normal trade relations status recent proliferationrelated events in north korea and russia also might lend themselves to legislation early in the 107th congress us foreign policy toward iran and libya will have renewed attention in 2001 at minimum when reauthorization of the iran and libya sanctions act is raised some amount of discontent was stirred when as compromise to enact the food and medicine exemption from sanctions policy travel to cuba was further restricted see cuba below advocates supporting more normal or open relations with cuba may introduce legislation to lift the travel ban or at least rededicate the new restriction imposed in 2000 each year for the past several congresses legislation has been introduced to normalize all aspects of uscuba relations in mid2000 the state department announced that it would longer use the term rogue state to describe countries of concern some perceive this as beginning of process of revamping the us approach to countries judged to be supporters of international terrorism if such reorganization is undertaken congress could play significant role in defining what constitutes terrorist state at minimum the 107th congress is likely to take up reauthorization of the export administration act eaa in which basic components of the current policy toward terrorist states are found in 2000 the supreme court ruled against states and localities making foreign policy by imposing their own sanctions regimes late in the 106th congress legislation was introduced to reinforce this ruling the issue of state and local sanctions may continue in the 107th congress the 105th congress enacted the international religious freedom act to incorp orate standards of religious freedom and protection of religious minorities in us foreign policy the act established within the state department the office of international religious freedom some anticipate that the members of the 107th congress will give great attention to the office s annual report due september 1 and recommendations for imposing sanctions against transgressor states finally events in the middle east resulted in the 106th congress in its waning days considering legislation to oppose the unilateral declaration of palestinian state to withhold diplomatic recognition of any palestinian state that is unilaterally declared and to encourage other countries and international organizations to withhold diplomatic recognition of any palestini an state that is unilateral ly declared2 the issue may invite legislative

countering terrorism drug trafficking weapons proliferation and other transnational threats supporting peace efforts in the middle east and elsewhere contributing to humanitarian needs of victims of natural disasters and conflict and advancing us economic opportunities in emerging economies congress plays an important role in shaping american foreign aid policy and spending prioritie s through annual enactment of the foreign operations appropriations bill moreover the legislation frequently becomes an important instrument for congressional participation in broad aspects of us foreign policy decisionmaking on numerous issues over the past decade american policymakers and congress have struggled in their attempt to agree on new core foreign aid rationale to replace the strategically oriented justification of the cold war in the recent past the president and congress have shared common priorities for using foreign aid to respond to humanitarian and emergency global requir ements counter global health problems including hivaids and support middle east peace initiatives on other issues however there is far less agreement among the most contentious matters in recent foreign aid debates are international family planning policy and whether abortion restrictions should be incorporated aid conditions for russia yugoslavia and other recipients strategies for blocking north koreas nuclear weap ons development and the organizational structure of the us agency for international development usaid overall foreign assistance funding levels have also been source of sharp disagreement between the two branches in fy199697 congress cut foreign aid spending by over 10 to about 123 billion resources have increased to nearly 165 billion in fy2000 after president clinton vetoed the original foreign aid appropriations because of inadequate funding much of the higher spending however has been concentrated on unforseen international emergencies or onetime special initiatives such as cent ral american hurricane relief kosovo humanitarian assistance colombia counternarcotics aid or middle east peacerelated transfers except for global health programs and poor country debt relief initiatives few longer term continuing foreign aid objectives have received increased funding in recenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs6 years house and senate preliminary approval earlier this year of roughly 133 billion in foreign operations bills for fy2001 12 less than the presidents 151 billion request prompted further veto threats congress ultimately agreed to 149 billion including several top presidential priorities for hivaids and debt relief the 107th congress will confront number of foreign aid polic and funding challenges including the likely continuation of disputes over international family planning and congressional earmarks and aid restrictions that the executive branch has said undermine the presidents ability to conduct foreign policy new administration is likely to undertake review of broad us foreign aid policy objectives and may seek congressional authorization for alternative approaches the organizational structure of agencies managing foreign aid programs especially the relationship between usaid and the state department might also be revisited in the new congress how much of the budget to allocate for foreign assistance will come under close scrutiny and if the experience of the past three years repeats itself congress could confront emergency supplemental foreign aid spending requests early in the new session president clinton asked the 106th

economic growth and to finance basic social programs aimed at poverty reduction over the past decade the united states and other creditor governments have engaged in numerous debt rescheduling and cancellation schemes for governments that demonstrate commitment to sound economic and social policy reforms the most recent of these debt relief arrangements the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative was launched in 1996 and included for the first time the participation of the world bank the imf and other public international finan cial institutions that hold more than onethird of debt owed by the 41 hipc designated nations critics including jubilee 2000 and other religious and non governmental organizations charged however that hipc did not offer sufficient debthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs7 relief excluded several debtstrapped countries and required lengthy qualifying period during which poverty continued to mount in 1999 led by the united states and great britain the g7 and subsequently the world bank and imf agreed to significantly expand hipc terms to roughly double the costs of the initiative under enhanced hipc as much as 90 billion of poor country debt could be cancelled cutting annual debt service by roughly one half and redirecting the debt savings to investments in education health clean water and other priority sectors about 20 countries are expected to qualify at least at preliminary stage by the end of 2000 while 32 of the 41 hipc countries may eventually receive benefits the united states pledged 920 million for the hipc initiative over four years including 600 million contribution to the hipc trust fund which will facilitate debt writeoffs by regional multilateral financia l institutions such as the african development bank and the interamerican development bank the 435 million sought by the clinton administration for fy2001 became one of the top foreign assistance funding priorities this year congress approved the entire hipc request but required qualifying countries to agree not to borrow at nonconcessional interest rates for two years and directed the treas ury secretary to explore options at the world bank to increase grant assistance to hipc nations during the 107th congress lawmakers are expected to consider 240 million funding request which would complete the us 600 million commitment to

another for funding the state department within the commerce justice and state and related agencies bill every two years congress must reauthorize spending for the department of state foreign policy programs and personnel by passing or waiving the biannual foreign relations reauthorization legislation in addition each year congress must appropriate state department and related agency funding typically these bills become vehicles for full range ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs8 foreign relationsrelated provisions for example foreign policy agency reorganization was mandated in 1998 by the foreign relations authorization act pl 105277 the 106th congres s passed its foreign relations authorization legislation pl 106113 that included authority for the department of state to spend significantly more on embassy security through fy2004 throughout the 1990s both the administration and congress sought to reorganize the us foreign policy agencies with goals of streamlining their work and attaining budgetary savings number of proposals to reorganize the department of state culminated in the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of 1998 division g pl 105277 the act required abolishing the us information agency usia and the arms control and disarmament agency acda merging their functions into the department of state and maintaining separate international broadcasting entitythe broadcasting board of governors bbg the act did not merge the us agency for international development usaid into the department of state but did require usaid to reorganize and come under the authority of the secretary of state the 107th congress could consider renewed proposals to 1 merge usaid into state to better coordinate us foreign policy with foreign aid and 2 unify administration of all agencies foreign service operations annual appropriations issues in the 106th congress focused on embassy security due to the august 7 1998 bombing of two us embassies in africa and possible budget savings derived from the foreign policy agency reorganization the fy1999 state department budget included budget supplemental of 156 billion for overseas embassy security needs since congress has provided full funding for embassy security over the past two years budget savings resulting from reorganization is evident on the contrary the state departments fy2001 appropriation pl 106 553 represents an increase of 750 million over the fy2000 enacted level and 97 million more than the president requested for the state department and related agencies for fy2001 in response to the 1998 embassy bombing the state department established review panel the overseas presence advisory panel opap which reported its concerns and recommendations on how to increase security at us overseas facilities the 107th congress may consider these recommendations as well as some experts concerns that as security at us government targets is tightened risks for american tourists and businesses may grow in addition to security issues the foreign service continues to respond to criticisms of inadequate minority hiring and insufficient foreign language and management skills prior to

policy and funding issues larry q nowels specialist in foreign affairs since 1965 us policy has supported international population planning based on principles of voluntarism and informed choice that gives participants access to information on all methods of birth control this policy however has generated contentious debate for nearly three decades resulting in frequent clarificat ion and modificatio n of us international family planning programs in the early 1970s congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan and later the bush administrations restricted us funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial support in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortionrelated work since 1995 internat ional family planning policy and the abortion question has been the most contentious issue in annual congressional foreign aid debates the house has routinely voted to reinstate the mexico city policy while the senate has favored position leaving the decision in the hands of the administration moreover president clinton has threatene d to veto any bill that includes the housepassed mexico city restrictions unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted series of interim arrangem ents for fy19961999 that did not resolve the broad international family planning controversy but permitted the stalled foreign operations appropriations measure to move forwar d the annual compromise removed houseadded mexico city restrictions but reduced population assistance to 385 million and in several years metered the availability of the funds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month the fy2000 debate however reached different conclusion on the international family planning question congressional leaders insisted that if the president wanted congress to approve legislation authorizing the payment of nearly 1 billion of us arrears owed to the united nations the white house must also accept revised mexico city language adding abortion restrictions to us population assistance policy in order to remove the obstacles to arrears payments president clinton reluctantly agreed to the abortion restrictions marking the first time that mexico city conditions had been included in enacted legislation for fy2001 president clinton sought substantial increase in population assistance 541 million and vowed to veto any legislation that continued mexico city abortion restrictions unable to resolve opposing house and senate positionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs10 on the family planning issue congress agreed to leave the decision up to the new president under the terms of pl 106429 foreign operations appropriations 2001 none of the 425 million for population assistance may be obligated until february 15 2001 as many expected on january 22 2001 president george w bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from president clinton and directing the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 president bush further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning servi ces the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care during the next few weeks usaid state department and justice department officials will draft specific policy language and contr act clauses to implement the presidents directive the starting point according usaid will be regulations in place on january 19 1993 some changes however may occur if more recent legal decisions or statutes require modification because some overseas programs are reported to need immediate financial transfers officials have expressed hope that the new policy language can be put into effect by february 15 when funds become available congress will have an opportunity to debate the presidents new policy most likely when the foreign operations appropriations bill for fy2002

final legislation that the president signed into law the administration also sough t authority for us contribution to the hipc trust fund and language which would enable the imf to use certain blocked

implementing major market oriented economic reform s agreement to adopt these changes would have to be approved before the hipc contribution and gold sale funds would be approved in the end congress approved the latter two measures without specific conditions however the secretary of the treasu ry was required to report periodically on the progress being made towards the implementation of certain reforms or policy goals initiatives may come forward in the 107th congress that aim to seek majo r changes in the ifis along the lines discussed above alternatively proposals may be made to include

ib96008 peacekeeping nina maria serafino specialist in international security for nearly decade congress has been sharply divided over broad range of issues related to us worldwide peacekeeping and related security commitments several of which will most likely be focus of the 107th congress debate on international security the crux of the recent controversy in congress is the desirability of us military forces participation in such operations particularly the 9800 troops serving in two nato balkan operations in bosnia and kosovo relative to the costs and strains of such participation the issue of positioning us troops under the operational control of commanders seems less pressing now whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs12 some 35 us troops serve in operations than during the 1990s when at peak over 3000 us did so the bosnia and kosovo operations are under nato and not control however questions are still raised about the utility of several on going peacekeeping operations which total 15 operations involving nearly 38000 troops from 88 other countries to which the us contributed almost 500 million in fy2000 particularly those in kosovo east timor sierra leone and the democratic republic of the congo debate in the 106th congress over us peacekeeping deployments centered on the 4200 us troops serving in kosovo under nato at an estimated fy2000 cost of 17 billion arguing that european nations were not carrying their fair share of the burden many members of congress made several attempts to limit the length of and spending on the us deployment there but these efforts did not prevail other members countered that european nations were providing over 80 of the assistance to kosovo and worried that attempts to withdraw us forces would undermine nato and us leadership in providing 20 billion in supplemental funding for fy2000 kosovo costs in the fy2001 military construction appropriations bill pl 106246 congress removed house provisions that would have allowed cutoff in funding for us deployments in kosovo after july 1 2001 however congress subsequently limited fy2001 spending in kosovo to 165 billion with waiver allowed under certain conditions and required series of reports on european assistance and on efforts to resolve the balkan situations for discussion of congressional actions regarding peacekeeping operations see the section of this report on united nations reform debate over the appropriate us role and amount of us assistance in peacekeeping efforts in general and in the balkans in particular is expected to continue especially given president george w bushs stated reservations regarding openended nationbuilding missions involving us ground forces the high costs of international peacekeeping and related us security commitments which totaled over 4 billion in fy2000 and their effects on the readiness of us forces will be other sources of concern the initiation of new quadrennial defense review qdr process in

national defense congress the administration and our allies are debating the best combination of policies to counter threats posed by nuclear biological and chemical nbc weapons those policies include maintaining strong and credible deterrence employing active and passive defenses maintaining alliances and multilateral regimes preventing foreign acquisition of dangerous materials and technology engaging with potential advers aries negotiating reductions and control of weapons neutralizing terrorist groups imposing sanctions and providing incentives and promoting regional peace since the cold war number of developments have challenged past policies the demise of the soviet union as the primary threat the acquisition of nbc weapons by more countries the information technology revolution the increased availability of weapons material technology and engineers globalization of business and finance and an evolution of missile defense technology confronting the 106th congress were the 1998 nuclear tests by india and pakistan missile tests by north korea iran and pakistan and continuing transfers of nuclear and missile technology by russia china and north korea congress acted on number of issues related to nbc weapons as summarized immediately below missile defense also was emphasized by the 106th congress as discussed below under defense policy russian nuclear and missile technology exports to iran led congress to pass the iran nonproliferation act pl 106178 authorizing the president to impose aid and trade sancti ons against proliferating companies or organizations congress also supported dods cooperat ive threat reduction and associated programs to help secure nbc weapons material and technology in states of the former soviet union one exception to this support however has been congresss restriction of funds for cw destruction facility in russia citing lack of confidence in russias ability to fund the facility once constructed the peoples republic of china has acquired technology from the united states that harms us national security according to the congressional cox committee which released its declass ified report in may 1999 the dod authorization for fy2000 pl 10665 included several provisions on export controls that had been recommended by the report in 2000 congress also passed trade bill to authorize nondiscriminatory treatment permanent normal trade relations to china and to establish framework for trade relations between the us and china pl 106286 although other proposals to restrict trade to china were introduced none passed on north korea the speakers advisory group issued detailed report in november 1999 describing the threat posed by north korea to us national security the north korean threat reduction act of 1999 in pl 106113 prohibits nuclear cooperation agreement between north korea and the united states unless the president determines north korea is in compliance with certain commitments and does not have nuclear weapons program congress also authorized the president to waive economic sanctions on india and pakistan for detonating nuclear explosive devices or for other activities relatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs14 to nuclear weapons pl 10679 though congress could not agree on thorough revision of the export administration act eaa of 1979 s 1712 it approved bill hr 5239 that extends the eaa until august 2001 in october 1999 the senate voted against advice and consent to the ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty the fy2001 defense authorization bill requires the administration to conduct comprehensive nuclear posture review and report the results to congress in december 2001 it also calls for plan for the long term sustainment and modernization of us nuclear forces with report to congress by april 15 2001 and report by july 1 2001 on the requirement and capabilities to defeat hardened targets and stockpiles of nbc weapons it appears likely that in 2001 congress will review the development testing and perhaps deployment of national and theater missile defense systems it will probably again consider ways to prevent countries such as iran iraq and north korea from developing nbc weapons and delivery systems and ways to prevent entities in countries such as china russia and north korea from transferring nbc weapon and missile technolo gy to other countries revisions of the export administration act and possibl new sanctions and incentives to prevent further proliferation of nbc weapons and missiles will likely be discussed special attention may be focused on us exports of satellites highperformance computers encryption systems and conventional weapons congress may respond to positive or negative nbc weapons and missile developments in north korea iran iraq pakistan india or elsewhere programs to counter the threat of nbc weapons in the hands of international terrorists are likely to be considered see the terrorism section below as are the status and credibility of us deterrence against hostile states and terrorist groups the states which are parties to the biological weapons convention will meet in 2001 and are expected to adopt new protocol intended to enhance convention compliance and nonproliferation efforts the protocol has been under negotiation for five years and is expected to spark significant debate over the issues of international inspections export controls and protection of proprietary commercial information if the protocol is adopted the president will decide when it will be submitted to the senate for its advice and consent because recent political economic and technological developments have generated support for significantly different policy approaches for countering the nbc weapon

nations reform as variously defined has drawn the attention of many in congress and the executive branch as well as in other member governments congressional views and expectations on the need for united nations reform have 1 resulted in significant arrearage in us contributions especially to peacekeeping accounts and 2 led to congress specifying conditions to be met before the release of us funds appropriated to reduce most of these arrearages two areas of desired change are 1 reduction of us assessment levels for contributions to the regular budget and peacekeeping accounts and 2 the continuation of zerobased budgeting both by the united nations and by certain specialized agencies on november 29 1999 congress passed and the president signed legislation setting forth the conditions for us payment of its arrears or outstanding contributions to the united nations for regular budget and peacekeeping accounts the oftcalled helmsbiden package the amount appropriated and subject to these conditi ons was 926 million including 819 million in cash payments and 107 million in credits from the united nations as of the start of 2001 the united states had paid the first increment of 100 million after certifying that the relevant conditions had been met congressional funding in 2000 of the presidents full request fy2000 supplemental request of 107 million and fy2001 request of

activities of unconducted peacekeeping operatio ns and had disagreed over the use of peacekeeping operations in internal conflicts in africa including those with cross border impacts in late october 2000 congress appropriated 846 million for cipa the amount the president had requested on decembe r 23 2000 members during the 55th session of the general assembly reduced the assessment level for the united states from 25 to 22 for the regular budget it was expected that the assessment level for peacekeeping accounts would go down to 2814 for the januaryjune 2001 period and further reduce to 25 by 2004 since the 2001 level was higher than the 25 in the helmsbiden conditions senator helms introduced legislation s 248 to amend these conditions increasing the peacekeeping assessment level to 2815 the senate passed s 248 by vote of 990 on february 7 2001 passage by the house would clear the way for the release of traunche 2 funding of 475 million for us arrears areas for possible attention in

global climate change susan fletcher senior analyst in international environmental policy concerns that the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has caused warming of the earths climate have led to number of international responses as well as issues of interest to the us congress the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which the united states has ratified contained voluntary commitments by all parties to that treaty to take steps to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases primarily carbon dioxide produced by burning of fossil fuels and wood as well as five other gases from other sources congress has been primarily concerned with the issues connected with the 1997 kyoto protocol to the unfccc which contains legally binding emission reductions for 38 industrialized nations including the united states the senate passed sres98 before the kyoto protocol was completed warning that the united states should not sign treaty that would harm the us economy or did not include commitments for developing countries congress has held oversight hearings on many aspects of the economic impacts and scientific findings related to climate change generally and the kyoto protocol specifically legislation was introduced in previous congresses related to needed scientific research policies on domestic credit for activities to reduce carbon emissions or increase carbon sinks discussed below and to limit the activities of the government that could be regarded as implementing the kyoto protocol before it has been approved the united states signed the kyoto protocol in 1998 but it was not submitted to the senate for its advice and consent by the clinton administration in recognition of sres 98 the united states was seeking to obtain meaningful participation of developing countries and it had been participating in the continuing negotiations to agree on rules governing various aspects of how the protocol would operate these rules have key relevance to economic impacts of us commitments in particular how much the united states could rely on flexibility mechanisms that would reduce domestic measures needed to meet its commitments through trading emission credits with other countries and relying on its extensive forest and agricultural lands to absorb carbon acting as sinks in november 2000 negotiations held in the hague netherlands were expected to resolve number of political and operational issues on how the kyoto protocol would work however these negotiations collapsed when some of the key issues regarding flexibility

of developing countries primarily through the foreign aid program but because diseases cross national borders other agencies such as the center for disease control and prevention cdc and the

narcotics control raphael f perl specialist in international relations international political and economic instability especially political turmoil and ethnic strife in third world and former communist states where police capabilities have been drastically reduced provide fertile ground for expansion of wide range of criminal activities one such criminal activity illicit production and smuggling of narcotics remains an important area of concern for congress increasingly drug trafficking organizations terrorist organizations and other international criminal groups cooperate with each other to facilitate illicit crossborder and transnational activities intergovernmental cooperative efforts to combat such criminal enterprises are often slow and cumbersome generic issues likely to be the focus of attention in the upcoming congress include 1 the presidents march 1 certifications for major drug producing or transiting countries an annual certification as to countrys cooperation in international drug control efforts is required of the president under the foreign assistance act of 1961 negative certification may result in loss or reduction of foreign assistance 2 the effectiveness of current drug interdiction policies 3 the rising importance of drug cartels in mexico and their potential destabilizing effect on that country 4 the growing relationships between drug traffickers terrori sts and other organized criminal groups and 5 north korean drug production and trafficking activity moreover us relations with burma the worlds largest source of illicit opium and heroin are strained over lack of narcotics control cooperation and human rights violations prospects for immediate improvement in relations with burma do not appear promising an issue of growing importance in the 107th congress is expected to be the effectiveness of implementation of plan colombia the congressionally funded fiscal year 20002001 13 billion counternarcotics effort for colombia and neighboring states pl 106246 the massive aid package reflects us concern that an increasing supply of heroin and cocaine is undermining demandreduction efforts in the united states curbing the inflow of these drugs is therefore key priority for both domestic and foreign policy as the largest supplier of cocaine and major supplier of heroin colombia is central to these efforts see latin america below the us initiative will present major challenges and opportunities to policy officials in both the united states and the northern andean countries us counter narcotics policy is unlikely to be completely successful victory in the war against drugs seems unlikel until the seemingly insatiable demand for drugs in the us market is curbed however if the colombian initiative is seen as failing completely it could undermine us prestige and influence in the western hemisphere moreover perceived failure might weaken the us publics willingness to support future foreign policy and aid initiatives linked to counterdrug objectives assuming that the drug interdiction efforts have at least modest effect in reducing the level of coca cultivation and production the key challenge for

administration and congressional concern about the threat of international terrorism in the aftermath of the cole bombing the defense department and the navy initiated number of inquiries the house and senate armed services committee held initial hearing s on the incident in late october the attack raises potential issues for the 107th congress concerning 1 procedures used by the cole and other us forces overseas to protect against terrorist attacks 2 intelligence collection analysis and dissemination as it relates to potential terrorist attacks and 3 us antiterrorism policy and options for us response if and when perpetrators are discovered the issue of possible terrorist use of nuclear chemical or biological weapons in the united states has attracted great attention in congress the executive branch and among the general public in fy2000 congress appropriated 145 billion for defense against weapons of mass destruction and the fy2001 budget request totaled 155 billion spread among fourteen federal agencies the primary focus has been on assisting state and local emergency response personnel improving civilian medical surveillance and treatment capabilities and intensifying pharmaceutical research to counter the effects of these agents given the rapid increase in funding and the unusual range of local state and federal agencies involved the issue of effective interagency coordination remains significant legislative concern there is also growing number of critics who maintain that the likelihood of such terrorist attack is low and that overreaction to this threat has led to excessive and indiscriminate funding lowprobability threat estimates notwithstanding the potentially severe consequences of nuclear chemical or biological attack make it unlikely that legislative attention will diminish on june 5 2000 the national commission on terrorism nc congressionally mandated bipartisan body issued report providing blueprint for us counterterrorism policy with both policy and legislative recommendations it generally argues for more aggressive us strategy in combating terrorism critics however argue that nc conclusions and recommendations ignore competing us goals and interests ie that more aggressive strategy might lead to the curbing of individual rights and liberties damage important commercial interests and widen disagreements between the us and its allies over using the stick as opposed to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs21 carrot approach in dealing with states that actively support or countenance terrorism the reports recommendations were the subject of extensive hearings in the 106th congress and could stimulate strong congressional interest in counter terrorism policy in the first session of the 107th congress likely areas of focus include 1 the pros and cons of more proactive counter terrorism policy 2 possible enhancement of state sanctions policy and 3 the coordination of us federal counter terrorism

africa which has already killed nearly 16 million people will likely be an important concern in the 107th congress as it was in the 106th many involved in the struggle against the epidemic are advocating scaling up of the international response to hivaids so that hiv infection rates can be broadly reduced in africa through prevention programs as has already been achieved in uganda many are urging increased support for preventing mother to child transmission of the disease and for providing care including care for orphans there is also some backing for expanded hivaids treatment programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs22 particularly progr ams that prolong lives by treating opportunistic infections with inexpensive medications it seems probable that some members of congress will advocate measures to assure that the united states is leader in scaling up although others may be skeptical of the chances of success against the disease or may urge that other donors should share more of the burden in august 2000 the 106th congress enacted the global aids and tuberculosis relief act of 2000 pl 106 264 which authorized increased development assistance spending for hivaids programs worldwide contributions were also authorized to the international aids vaccine initiative iavi and to proposed aids trust fund administered by the world bank appropriators provided funding

trade and opportunity act of 2000 pl 106 200 in order to promote african economic development through increased trade members who supported this legislation will likely monitor its implementation in order to assure that africa benefits from its provisions and some may advocate expanding trade benefits for africa through new legislation others will be concerned with ensuring that new or existing

policy struggles with the administration many of which are likely to carry over into the 107th congress broadly speaking these differences emanate from four major developments 1 the ongoing realignment of security relationships and economic ties following the end of the cold war including the rise of china as an important regional and economic power that is more open to international trade 2 the residual effects of the 19971999 asian financial crisis as well as japans ongoing economic and political weaknesses 3 the unexpectedly rapid pace of change in the korean peninsula which has generated congressional concern and also raised anxiety in the northeast asian region about the future us military role in south korea and japan as well as broader regional power relationships and 4 nuclear arms race between india and pakistan china shirley kan specialist in national security policy kerr b dumbaugh specialist in asian affairs wayne morrison specialist in international trade and finance thomas lum analyst in asian affairs longstanding us policy to engage the peoples republic of china prc politically and economically may continue to be controversial in congress the 106th congress enacted legislation in 2000 granting the prc permanent normal trade relations pntr thus providing an end to the rancorous annual debate over chinas trade status that had continued since 1990 however the bill also established new commission to report annually on the prcs human rights record as well as other measures designed to improve congressional oversight on us policy toward the prc the 106th congress also grew increasingly leery of prc intentions toward taiwan in part this was due to the islands watershed presidential election in march 2000 which brought to power chen shuibian leader of the democratic progressive party party that advocates taiwans independence from china in february 2000 prc leaders issued new policy statement on taiwan which some saw as demonstrating greater willingness to use force to reunify taiwan with china some in the 106th congress came to favor formal efforts to strengthen ustaiwan relations in ways sure to antagonize the prc further complicating us relations with both beijing and taipei the possible accessions of the prc and taiwan to the world trade organization wto in 2001 are expected to be of major interest to the 107th congress pl 106286 grants pntr status to china once it joins the wto as long as the president certifies in report to congress that the terms of prcs accession are at least as favorable as the november 1999 uschina trade agreement it also ensures that wto trade agreements would apply to trade between the united states and the prc many members have expressed support for the prcs wto membership but under terms that would require it to significantly liberalize its trade and investment regimes additionally many members have expressed support for taiwans wto membership and have concerns that beijing might try to block taipeis accession pl 106286 calls on us trade negotiators to push for motion in the wto general council to make taiwans wto entry application the next orderhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs24 of business following the consideration of the prcs application and to strongly oppose attempts by any wto members to block taiwans accession congress may continue to monitor protests in the prc by falun gong practitioners and demonstrations by laidoff workers that are continuing in 2001 rising internet usage has facilitated communication and information access for growing number of prc citizens none of these trends however is likely to produce fundamental changes in the political system in the short run the pntr bill enacted in 2000 contains provisions that criticize the prc government for oppressing falun gong adherents and for denying workers and others basic human rights it also authorizes funding to expand radio free asias internet operations finally the 107th congress likely will continue to oversee policies to address the prcs challenges to us security interests congressional oversight and investigations including that by the cox committee have covered alleged transfers of missile technology by us firms in connection with satellite exports and whether the justice department should take further action regarding investigations that began in 1997 also congress has watched for progress in the counterespionage probes into suspected prc acquisitions of us nuclear weapons and missile secrets congress has increasingly asserted its role in providing for taiwans defense under the taiwan relations act including calling for consultations on arms sales and look at operational planning and considering the taiwan security enhancement act congress is expected to continue assessing the prcs military strategy and capabilities especially the missile buildup other issues likely to be considered include the establishment of the center for the study of chinese military affairs and the report on its operation due in february 2001 military exchanges subject to restrictions in the fy2000 national defense

national defense congress debates defense policy every year initially in action on defense spending in the annual congressional budget resolution and later when it considers defense authorization and appropriations bills because military readiness was major issue in the presidential election campaign the debate over defense spending may be particularly significant early in the 107th congress although the military service chiefs have called for substantial increases in defense spending over the next few years congressional action on the defense budget will inevitably be shaped by competing demands including tax cuts medicare drug benefits education and other priorities missile defense may also be on the agenda very early in the 107th congress because president clinton deferred formal decision on initial deployment of nationwide defense in alaska the us role in peacekeeping operations in the balkans was also campaign issue and it raises number of broader questions including relations with allies and under what circumstances the united states should be willing to commit its military forces to action in the future key defense policy issue is how to balance funding for shortterm readiness weapons modernization and longterm transformation of military forces to cope with future challenges this issue may be at the center of congressionally mandated pentagon reassessment of defense policy called the quadrennial defense review qdr that is scheduled to be completed by september 2001 the defense budget stephen daggett specialist in national defense in fy1999 funding for national defense increased at rate greater than inflation for the first time since fy1985 and spending has continued to climb modestly in fy2000 and fy2001 the decline in defense spending that began after fy1985 and that continued for the next thirteen years was driven initially by pressures to reduce federal budget deficits after the cold war ended the bush administration proposed cutting the size of the force from 22 million active duty troops to 16 million and in 1990 budget agreement the administration and congress agreed on cut of about 25 in military spending through fy1995 the clinton administration proposed further cuts in the size of the force bringing active duty troop levels to about 14 million and it initially proposed additional budget cuts totaling about 120 billion over the five years from fy1994 1999 subsequently the administration periodically added money back to the defense budget in response to perceived shortfalls and it allowed the defense department to keep most of the money saved from lowerthanexpected inflation in addition after 1995 congress regularly added money to defense budget requests as result after adjusting for inflation actual defense spending between fy1994 and fy1999 ended up being very little different from what the outgoing bush administration had projected over the same period much more money however went for operation and maintenance accounts most directly related to shortterm readiness and much less for weapons acquisitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs44 even though funding for readinessrelated accounts has continued to climb concerns about military readiness have multiplied in recent years over the past couple of years moreover congress has approved substantial pay raises and expanded personnel benefits in an effort to shore up military recruitment and retention the cost of these measures will grow over time meanwhile after several years of very limited funding for new weapons senior defense officials military service chiefs and number of outside analysts argue that money for weapons procurement in particular will have to turn up substantially over the next few years if the services are to replace rapidly aging weapons as they reach the end of their planned service lives taken together all of these factors are creating pressure to increase military spending substantially opinions diverge dramatically however on how much more it is reasonable to invest for their part in recent years the military services have given congress lists of unfunded priorities the latest totaling more than 80 billion over the five years from fy20012005 these amounts do not include some very expensive initiatives however including army proposals to increase the number of active duty personnel navy proposals to add more submarines and surface vessels and the full costs of national missile defense in view of perceived shortfalls some military service chiefs have argued that defense spending should climb from about 3 of gdp today to 4 or more an increase of at least 100 billion year neither the bush nor the gore campaigns however called for defense increases of anything approaching that magnitude although projected future federal budget surpluses appear quite large competing demands for tax cuts medicare prescription drug coverage increased education spending and other priorities also appear substantial the need to make choices among proposed force structure increases and major weapons programs therefore may well persist for congress the issue is both how much to spend on defense and how to set priorities among major defense programs crs products appropriations for fy2001 defense by stephen daggett crs report rl30505 efficiencies in defense operations the

end also transformed the defen business environment marking the rapid worldwide globalization of economics and trade and changes in dod policy toward the industry itself technological change especially visible in the information processing and telecommunications industries has forced convergence between civilian and military research and applications shrinking defense budgetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs45 worldwide have forced manufacturers of defense products into heightened competition these factors compelled dod to reassess its halfcentury relationship with the us defense industrial base as result dod policy is changing in two major ways first because the lead in some stateoftheart product lines had passed from defense to the commercial sector of the us economy dod is reforming the way it buys equipment and second dod has sought to reform structural aspects of the defense industrial base itself instead of continuin g to support excess production capacity across the board dod has focused on preservin g defenseunique manufacturing capabilities allowing other us defense firms to respond more freely to conventional market forces congress has traditionally protected economically vulnerable parts of the defense industry that are critical to us national security but global changes in the economic and defense environments are posing new issues for the 107th congress first continued mergers and acquisitions in the us defense industry raise questions about maintaining competition some maintain that surviving firms have emerged healthier and more competitive but others worry about the potential loss of technological innovation and price competition from fewer companies second defense acquisition reform has encouraged military use of commercial products in military systems proponents of this approach cite the advantages of rapid access to new technologies for dod and the adoption of efficient busin ess practices others question the appropriateness of some products for military applications and the ability of dod to cope with the speed of obsolescence for commercial products third globalization has increased crossborder flows of information and the availability of technology that could be used for military purposes the result has been pressure for the united states to ease defenserelated technology transfer restrictions that could increase exports of us systems and help the us defense supplier base critics of this logic however worry about the extra vigilance needed to prevent the unauthorized transfer of us defense technology potentially increasing us vulnerabilities this concern was shown when the security assistance act of 2000 pl 106280 was passed requiring that countries desiring

2000 presidential and congressional campaigns democratic candidates argued that the clinton administratio n had made readiness priority and that us armed forces werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs48 demonstrably the most powerful in the world republican candidates argued that the administration was wearing out the forces through over use and had allowed many pockets of unreadiness to develop the issue is complicated by the need for policy makers to define the ready for what questions and military leade rs to create accurate and useful measurements of the situation in the field where material quantifiable factors interact with human subjective factors in the last few years congress has legislated that dod provide monthly readines s reports and the pentagon has developed more sophisticated ways to apply unit status reports to assessments of overall joint force readiness to meet various contingencies in recent testimony before congress the joint chiefs of staff judged that the force was ready to execute the national military strategy by winning first major regional contingency mrc but that the added required ability to win second mrc would involve higher risk service chiefs then explained why first to fight units were ready but that the rest of the force had serious readiness concerns the roots of readiness concerns today stem from various defense planning decisions taken since the end of the cold war notably the force structure but not the infrastructure was rapidly downsized by more than 30 the defense budget was steadily decreased in real terms until fy19 99 and military procurement and recapitalization were significantly reduced in favor of paying for current readiness and unbudgeted operations in such places as the persian gulf africa haiti and the balkans smaller force and greater commitments led to increased operations tempo for many units and their personnel and equipment even greater stress was felt in high demand low density specialized units such as electronic combat aircraft and light infantry weapons and vehicles age require ever more maintenance and consume funds that then become unavailable to purchase new weapons and vehicles condition labeled by some as death spiral many training and support facilities have backlogs of deferred maintenance and some inventories are low eg some fighter pilots are denied realistic training because equipment such as lantirn night navigation pods and selected munitions are not available at all training ranges these conditions cumulatively have resulted in pockets of reduced readiness throughout all services the 107th congress may consider whether additional measures to improve readiness are needed and in what priorities options include reduction of operational requirements increases or decreases in force structure short term versus long term readiness increased funding for operation and maintenance procurement other procurement or munitions or more base closures all of the material

have had considerable problems since the late 1990s in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified military person nel although much less severe than the last episode of such problems in the late 1970s these problems have required great deal of highlevel attention and increased resour ces before beginning to turn around at least in the short run in late 1999 and 2000 the broad reasons for difficulties in both attracting new recruits and retaining capable career personnel are similar in addition what young person hears accurately or not about the benefits available to older career members with families can have an indirect effect on the enlistment decisions of young prospective recruits as well despite recruiting statistics in 2000 which are much more encoura ging than those of 1999 all of these recruitment and retention issues will continue to be of great concern to the congress in 2001 being translated into legislation in the fy2002 defense authorization and appropriation bills perhaps the single most important immediate factor is the need for the services to compete with actual and perceived career opportunities in civilian economy currently in the midst of an expansion of unprecedented depth and length to deal with this problem the congress increased acrosstheboard pay levels and variety of special pays in bousesoften at faster pace and with greater concern than that stated by dod pl 10665 fy2000 national defense authorization act in 1999 over dod objections congress also repealed legislation first enacted in 1986 that would have considerably reduced the retired pay of those career members who would have begun to retire in 2006 but who were starting to make decisions to stay in or get out of the service in the late 1990s in addition to cash compensation recruiting and retention are also affected by the extent to which military personnel think they can afford modern housing of size and sophistication comparable to that in which their civilian counterparts live health care for self and family that meets the same criteria schools and educational benefits and sense of community that often civilian neighborhoods may not provide another major reason for difficulty in recruiting and retention is armed forces that are too small to provide sufficient units personnel and equipment to meet requirements for both overseas deployments longterm and unexpected contingencies and maintenance of an adequately trained and equipped strategic reserve in the united states this has led to overwork insufficient time for units to train and longer periods of family separation all detrimental to career retentionand first enlistments if prospective military recruits get negative picture from older family members and friends some also suggest that although it is difficult to measure career retention may be affected by concern over military social issues such as dod policy on homosexual conduct by military personnel and the roles of women in the military military deployments for peacekeeping andor humanitarian relief purposes and actions which supposedly make military training insufficiently

overall system the official cost estimate for this system was about 36 billion the proposed system was controversial some critics charged that the system was not necessary and too expensive given the low likelihood of ballistic missile threats to the united states on the other hand some believed the system could not be deployed fast enough to counter imminent ballistic missile threats hence many argued that other systems such as naval nmd could be deployed more easily more quickly and at less cost finally other technical critics both supporters and opponents of nmd charged that the nmd technology envisioned in the plan was simply not ready for deployment decision on september 1 2000 president clinton announced that he had decided not to authorize deployment of national missile defense nmd system he stated that he could not conclude that we have enough confidence in the technology and the operational effectiveness of the entire nmd system to move forward to deployment

procurement holiday to degree he argued the holiday was warranted first because the military services purchased large numbers of newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs52 weapons in the 1980s that were just entering the force second because older weapons were retired first as the size of the force declined so the average age of equipment was falling even without new purchases and third because threats to us technological superiority eased dramatically with the end of the cold war the procurement holiday would have to end soon perry warned because aging equipment in each of the services needed to be replaced and investments were needed to exploit rapidly advancing technology by the end of 1995 the joint chiefs of staff made strong pitch for greater procurement funding urging an

billion for procurement in the fy2001 defense appropriations bill pl 106259 as it has turned out many defense proponents now see the 60 billion procurement level as inadequate early in 2000 study by the center for strategic and international studi csis calculated that procurement budgets would have to average 164 billion per year in fy2000 prices over the next decade to replace the weapons in the current inventory with more advanced versions the assumptions underlying the study were widely questioned but several less extreme estimates still show shortfall of some magnitude most recently the congressional budget office estimated that it would cost about 90 billion year to sustain steady state procurement rate ie rate at which enough major weapons would be bought every year to maintain roughly the current number of weapons in the stock on the assumption that parts of the force will be allowed to grow older than has historically been the goal for its part the defense department has acknowledged that procurement budgets may have to grow further in the future even as senior officials have disputed projections by outside analysts in congressional testimony in february 2000 secretary of defense cohen stipulated that procurement budgets will have to grow substantially beyond 70 billion year in the period after fy2008 when several planned weapons programs are scheduled to begin production along with the debate over the amount of money for needed procurement there has been vigorous debate about what kinds of weapons to buy in both the executive and legislative branches some advocates of defense transformation argue that many currently planned systems are inappropriate for the postcold war environment heavy armored weapons like the army s crusader selfpropelled artillery system they say are too bulky to transport rapidly enough to future conflicts similarly some argue that shortrange tactical aircraft like the multiservice joint strike fighter which might

administration efforts to reinstitute and expand the training of men and women in basic training continued as well except in the marine corps attempts to open certain military occupations and environments to women have not always been successful for example the fy2001 defense authorization act pl 106398 requires congress to be notified before any changes are made concerning the assignment of women to submarines proponents view these as equal rights issues conversely critics note the numerous cases of disruptive behavior brought about by comingling the sexes and the changes in training

three major reassessments of defense policy the bush administrations base force analysis of 19901991 the clinton administrations bottomup review of 1993 and the most recent quadrennial defense review qdr of 1997 now fourth review the second quadrennial defense review has been mandated by congress and is due to be completed in september 2001 like the 1997 qdr qdr 2001 is likely to be partly reaction to criticisms of earlier statements of strategy and partly an effort to reshape longterm defense plans in view of changing perceptions of international security challenges the 1997 qdr put much greater emphasis than the bottomup review on assessing the impact of smaller scale contingency operations on the force the new qdr may focus more on the prospects for significant transformation of us military forces one key issue may be how to cope with widely perceived mismatch between strategy and resources many critics of the bottomup review and of the 1997 qdr have complained that both were budget driven rather than strategydriven another key issue may be whether the very inclusive consensusoriented process of the first qdr which is being repeated in the new one can lead to sufficiently farreachi ng changes in defense policy although congress ional reaction to previous defense policy reviews was mixed congress mandated the 2001 qdr in the fy2000 defense authorization

transformation army transformation edward f bruner specialist in national defense army transformation as congressional issue first appeared in the second session of the 106th congress and will likely also engage the 107th as background us army heavy armored forces were victorious in the persian gulf war of 1991 and impressive in almost all facet s one exception being the length of time it took to deploy the force during 1999 heavy force elements were deployed to albania for possible combat alongside nato in serbia again critics complained that the deployment took too long assessing this criticism and the most likely types of operations facing the army in the post cold war environment the army chief of staff initiated program of transformation to provide the army new capability namely formations as deployable as light forces and as lethal and tactically mobile as heavy forces recognizing that fielding new technologies would take ten or more years general eric shinseki army chief of staff ordered the army immediately to begin forming interim brigade combat teams based on existing equipment by november 2000 contracts were ready to begin purchasing enough 20ton interim armored vehicles iav deployable in c130 aircraft to outfit six to eight of the new brigades at an estimated cost that could exceed 7 billion the 106th congress endorsed army transformation plans by appropriating some 16 billion in fy2000 emergenc supplemental funding roughly twice the administrations request congress did however caution against too much speed by mandating study that would consider using vehicles already in the inventory for the iav requirement the 107th congress will likely review this fast moving program not only on the iav selection issue but also as army transformation projects compete for funds with other army programs army transformation may also compete indirectly with programs in other services or become embroiled in larger issues emerging from

potential for cyberterrorism although the united states has sought to consolidate responsibility for information warfare it is not clear how successful this effort will be congress may choose to examine critically the policies organization and legal framework that guides executive branch decisionmaking on iw issues additionally two bills affecting cyberterroism were introduced in the 106th

aviation issues as part of its role in the defense budget process procurement of new aircraft the modernization and maintenance of current capabilities and spending on science and technology will be issues however the larger issue likely to face congress is the friction caused by making tradeoffs between these areas as it determines the investment priorities for military aviation in fiscally constrained environment noteworthy characteristic of current air power investm ent priorities is that dod is spending relatively large portion of its budget to procure just few new types of fighter aircraft the f22 raptor fa18ef super hornet and joint strike fighter many analysts assert that while dod focuses on these procurement programs much of the air component is aging and wearing out quickly due to low numbers and high operational tempo examples include the ea6b electronic warfare aircraft the u2 surveillance aircraft the ep3e electronic intelligence aircraft and the e3 awacs in addition to questions about the need to replenish these overworked aircraft there has been discussion about aircraft readiness and reliability chief of staff of the air force general michael ryan testified that despite spending an additional 25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs58 8testimony before the senate armed services committee september 27 2000billion per year since 1998 to reverse near term readiness declines air force near term readiness has not turned around8 decreases in readiness are caused by past under funding of spares high operations tempo loss of experienced airmen and an aging aircraft fleet readiness concerns are not confined to the air force army officials have also expressed concern about lack of funds to keep the helicopter fleet reliable furthermore recently completed study found that the air forces strategic airlift fleet is roughly 10 million ton miles per day short of the current requirement this shortfall may most heavily affect the army there were expressions of concern in the 106th congress over air force science and technology funding bill hr 5490 was introduced late in the legislative calendar to address this perceived shortfall again the air forces emphasis on near term procurement at the expense of science and technology was at the root of the concern however those in favor of spending on new fighter aircraft procurement argue that unless the united states is able to achieve and maintain air superiority it will not be able to conduct any of the other air operations described above they contend that because the current fighter aircraft fleet is aging and will increasingly be unable to guarantee air superiority relatively high levels of fighter aircraft procurement are critical to overall warfighting capabilities crs

grimmett specialist in national defense the use of us military forces abroad in the postcold war era has become topic of notable controversy in recent years congress has debated the purpose scope funding and duration of foreign military operations from somalia to haiti to the former yugoslavia the presidents decisions to introduce us armed forces into various operations abroad have been challenged especially when it might lead to their involvement in hostilities congressional debates have been especially intense over use of american military forces in peacekeeping operations such as those in the former yugoslavia in support of nato and operations in the 106th congress some house members brought suit in federal court seeking judgement that the president had acted unconstitutionally in using military forces against serbia in violation of the war powers resolution the courts dismissed the suit on grounds of standing there have been serious disagreements between the president and the congress over whathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30776crs59 constitutes proper use of american military force abroad in the service of us foreign policy goals equally significant has been the lack of consensus on what constitu tes vital us national security interest abroad until broader degree of agreement on the appropriate use of us military force abroad is achieved there are likely to be periodic clashes between the president and congress over the wisdom of given foreign military operations and the funding necessary to carry them out aside from the constituti onal issues congress has raised number of other concerns arising from the dramatically increased number and duration of contingency operations in the last decade perhaps paramount has been the concern over the impact on unit readiness for engagement in larger conflict peacekeeping assignments entail special training then deployment followed by retraining for combat missions upon return often 15month cycle during which the unit is not available or ready for combat operations repeated andor lengthy overseas deployments are believed to be contributing to personnel retention problems particularly among air force pilots increased operational tempo has raised equipment maintenance costs and shortened equipment lifespans thereby increasing the need for recapitalization of procurement programs peacekeeping operations in hostile areas eg the persian gulf have increased the exposure of us personnel to terrorist acts eg the khowar towers and uss cole bombings and necessitated greatly increased force protection efforts all of these concerns have raised congression interest in ways to encourage us allies to assume greater responsibilities in contingency operations particularly those of long duration that present little likelihood of major combat the version of the fy2001 dod authorization act hr 4205 passed by the house included provision that could have required the withdrawal of us troops from the balkans this provision was removed in the housesenate conference however extensive reporting requirements on allied burdensharing in the balkans were established in the final act signed by the president pl 106398 in consideration of the fy2002 dod budget request it is likely the 107th congress will continue to scrutinize contingency operations and their impact on us armed
