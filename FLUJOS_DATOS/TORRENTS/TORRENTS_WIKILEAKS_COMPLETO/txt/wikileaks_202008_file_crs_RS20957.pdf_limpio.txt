summary with the increasing utilization of the internet to facilitate commercial transactions concerns have arisen regarding the use of this medium to transfer firearms this report discusses the sale of firearms over the internet with focus on the extent to which federal law regulates such activity review of the relevant factors indicates that while firearms transferred in an illegal manner via the internet may pose special investigatory problems for law enforcement internet firearm sales are subject to the same regulatory scheme as traditional firearm transactions the rapid growth of the internet as venue for commercial transactions has raised concerns regarding the sale of firearms over the internet these concerns have been magnified by reports that there are approximately 4000 firearm salesrelated websites as well as 80 sites where guns may be purchased via auction1 in particular it has been asserted that current firearm laws either do not regulate internetbased sales or are insufficient to combat illegal firearm sales in the internet context2 review of applicable federal law discussed below establishes that internetbased firearm sales are not imbued with special character by virtue of their medium of transfer and are in fact subject to the same degree of regulation as any other type of firearm transaction it should be noted however that while current federal laws regulating the transfer of firearms are fully applicable in the internet context the unique qualities of internet transactions may pose significant obstacles to their enforcement3

18 usc 922n furthermore the gca places significant restrictions on the transfer to and possession of firearms by persons under 18 see 18 usc 922x 8 18 usc 922a 923 an individual is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms if he or she devotes time attention and labor to dealing in firearms as regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms 18 usc 922a21c 9 18 usc 922t1cthe gun control act of 1968 congress enacted the gun control act of 1968 gca to keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age criminal background or incompetency and to assist law enforceme nt authorities in the states and their subdivisions in combating the increasing prevalence of crime in the united states4 to this end the gca prohibits certain classes of individuals from possessing firearms and establishes comprehensive regulatory scheme designed to prevent the transfer of firearms to such individuals5 in particular the gca delineates nine classes of individuals who are prohibited from shipping transporting possessing or receiving firearms or amm unition in interstate commerce6 the individuals targeted by this provision include 1 persons convicted of crime punishable by term of imprisonm ent exceeding one year 2 fugitives from justice 3 individuals who are unlawful users or addicts of any controlled substance 4 persons legally determined to be mentally defective or who have been committed to mental institution 5 aliens illegally or unlawfully in the united states as well as those who have been admitted pursuant to nonimmigrant visa 6 individuals who have been discharged dishonorably from the armed forces 7 persons who have renounced united states citizenship 8 individuals subject to pertinent court order and finally 9 persons who have been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence offense7 restrictions on sales in order to effectuate the general prohibitions outlined above the gca also imposes significant requirements on the transfer of firearms pursuant to the act any person who is engaged in the business of importing manufacturing or dealing in firearms must possess federal firearms license ffl issued by the secretary of the treasury8 the possession of ffl grants an individual the ability to ship transport and receive firearms in interstate and foreign commerce while also imposing several requirements on the licensee designed to ensure that firearm is not transferred to an individual disqualified from possession under the act for example licensee must verify the identity of transferee by examining government issued identification document bearing photograph of the transferee such as drivers license9 conduct background check on the transferee using the nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20957crs3 10 18 usc 922t 11 923gd2 12 923gd3a 13 923gd7 14 923d 15 18 usc 921a21c 16 18 usc

official request for information contained in the licensees records within 24 hours of receipt13 and comply with all other relevant state and local regulations14 federal law does not impose licensing requi rements on all sellers of firearms however the gca contains specific exemption for any person who makes occasional sales exchanges or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of personal collection or for hobby or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms15 such private sellers are prohibited from knowingly transferring firearm to disqualified individual but are not required to conduct brady background checks or maintain official records of transactions16 b restrictions on interstate transfers in addition to the aforementioned requirements imposed upon the sale of firearms by licensed and unlicensed individuals generally federal law also places significant limitations on the actual interstate transfer of weapons17 these provisions are of particular interest in analyzing internetbased firearm sales given the inherently interstate quality of such activity and the perceived potential for abuse in the internet sale context while the possession of ffl grants dealer the ability to sell and ship firearms in interstate or foreign commerce the gca places several restrictions on the manner in which transfer may occur specifically while licensee may make an overthecounter sale of shotgun or rifle to any qualified individual the licensee may not make such sale of handgun to resident of state other than that in which the dealers licensed premises is located18 relatedly licensee is prohibited from shipping firearms directly to consumers in other states instead licensee making firearm sale to nonresident must transfer the weapon to licensee in the destination state from whom the transferee may obtain the firearm after passing the required nics check19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20957crs4 20 18 usc 922a3 922a5 922b3 21 for example publication by

frontier the challenge of unlawful conduct involving the use of the internet appendix at 3 report located at httpwwwusdojgov80criminalcybercrimeunlawfulpdf with appendix located at continuedsubstantial restrictions are also place d on firearm transfers between nonlicensees specifically whereas licensee may transfer rifle or shotgun to nonresident non licensee in an overthecounter sale the gca specifically bars nonlicensee from directly selling firearm to any person who does not reside in the transferring nonlicensees state20 instead nonlicensee wishing to transfer firearm to nonlicensee in another state must ship the firearm to licensed dealer in the transferees state the gca and the internet the aforementioned provisions control the present inquiry given that much of the concern surrounding internetbased firearm transactions centers on the notion that such sales are effectively beyond the purview of existing restrictions21 specifically the panoply of laws discussed above establish federal scheme that regulates every firearm sale irrespective of the medium of transaction given that these laws address the transfer of any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce the mere fact that firearm transaction is negotiated over the internet does not except it from requirements adhering to traditional brick and mortar sales or those facilitated through classifie d advertisements in newspapers22 accordingly it would appear that the proper analytical focus should center on whether there are fundamental differences between internet transactions and traditional sales methods that render the existing regulatory framework insufficient or obsolete the department of justice has identified several factors it finds unsettling regarding firearm sales over the internet23 in addition to the possibility that prohibited persons may be successful in acquiring firearms over the internet the doj is troubled that the internet provides convenient fora for the advertisement and sale of firearms by unlice nsed individuals who are not required to conduct background checks or retain records of sales and may encourage these individuals to illegally engage in the business of dealing in forearms without license additionally the doj asserts that the prospect of quick profits from internet sales may create temptation on the part of ffls to circumvent existing federal laws24 relatedly the presidents worki ng group on unlawful conduct on the internet working group created by executive order 13133 has stated that the sale of firearms over the internet poses unique problems for law enforcement25 first thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20957crs5 25 continued httpwwwusdojgov80criminalcybercrimeappendpdf 26 id 27 id 28 supra n 1 29 united states general accounting office firearms purchased from federal licensees using bogus identification gao01427 march 2001 30 id at 13 31 id at 13 32 id at 13 according to the gao report the two private sellers did agree to sell the firearms to the undercover agent in an inperson transaction which was not pursued the report does not provide sufficient information to determine whether such transaction would have violated the gca id at 13 working group maintains that illegal sales conducted via the internet will be more difficult to detect than sales facilitated through traditional venues such as print advertisements since the internet provides people with the means to advertise guns for sale on message boards through email in chat rooms or other websites that will be difficult to find and may even be inaccessible to law enforcement26 additionally the working group asserts that the lack of fixed physical location for the execution of internetbased sales may hinder enforcement efforts in particular the working group stresses that as opposed to sales made at gun stores or shows where the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms may conduct inspections and review records of transactions internetbased transactions are much more difficult to monitor27 given the facilitative qualities of the internet the observations by the doj and the presidents working group appear logically sound and have an intuitive appeal it should be noted however that there is currently little substantive evidence to support these assumptions as noted above the doj is particularly concerned that the ease with which firearm transactions may be advertised and to some degree consummated over the internet will lead to increased violations of federal law28 however there is currently official data indicating that individuals advertising firearms for sale over the internet are any more likely to ignore firearm laws than those employing traditional venues furthermore recent investigation by the general accounting office monitoring individuals advertising firearms for sale on the internet detected illegal activity29 specifically an undercover agent responded to ten of twentyone advertisements offering firearms for sale on an unidentified website30 eight of the ten advertisers were federally licensed dealers all of whom refused to ship the firearms offered for sale to anyone except another federally licensed dealer in compliance with the gca31 of the two advertisers selling firearms in an individual capac ity the gao report states that one refused to ship the firearm to anyone other than licensee and states that the other individual refused to send the firearm through the mail32 while the gao investigation was limited in scope the fact that none of the individuals solicited by the undercover investigator agreed to engage in any illegal activity could be interpreted as undermining the contention that the use of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20957crs6 33 see department of the treasury office of public affairs atf web page to prevent use of fraudulent firearm licenses september 23 2000 located at httpwwustreasgovpressreleasesps903htm 34 supra n 1 internet in facilitating firearm transactions will necessarily result in increase d illegal activity likewise it is important to note that concerns regarding the internets effect on law enforcement efforts appear to be based on assumptions that have yet to be substantiated in particular while the presidents working group identified several factors that may pose barriers to effective enforcement in the internet context it remains to be seen whether perceived difficulties in enforcement are related to technological barriers or are simply the result of insufficient investigative resour ces and experience in the internet context furthermore it is possible that advances in investigative technology may obviate such concerns for example the atf has implemented the ez check federal firearm license verification system which allows licensed dealers to verify via an atf website that licenses presented for the purchase or shipment of guns are valid33 additionally the atf is reportedly developing cybercrime branch to ascertain the scope of illegal firearm transactions over the internet and develop appropriate mechanisms to respond to such activit y34 the results of these initiatives should serve to illuminate the validity of the concerns identified above
