chapter 1 introduction background 1 the experience of numerous small wa rs has provided the british army with unique insight into countering in surgency in many of its forms service in northern ireland has given the present generatio n of commanders their main firsthand source of basic experience at the tactical level although this could constrain military thinking on the subject because of the national context and the local political connotations of this campaign there are of course many lessons to be learned becaus of the similarities between the campaign in northern ireland and those counter in surgency campaigns which are conducted elsewhere but there ar also significant differences ta ctics such as jungle patrolling and convoy antiambush drills whic h from the perspective of northern ireland seem to be relics of colonial past may still be very rele vant in different operational settings such as iraq and afghanistan 2 despite their long experienc in counter insurgency t he british have not developed any set methods of dealing with the problem of insurgency i ndeed it is prob ably unwise to attempt this because every situation is di fferent there are however many other approaches to this type of campaign not onl is the threat changing but so too is the environment in which an insurgent has to be confronted the revision of doctrine for counter insurgency 3 the current doctrine recorded in the ju ly 2001 edition of af m vol 1 pt 10 was prepared in the mid 1990s but on ly published in 2001 sinc 2000 british troops have been involved in actions to prevent insurgency in sie rra leone stability operations to support the legitimate authorities in east timor bosnia and kosovo and since 2003 two different types of insurgency in iraq and afghanistan as result of these campaigns and evidence that the more traditional type of insurgency has trans lated into much wider act of terrorism and insurgency on an international scale some form of revision has become necessary 4 there are currently plans to alter the si x guiding principles for counter insurgency these have been developed over many years since the second world war and have stood the test of time and experience similarly t he very british precepts of minimum force operating within the law transparency and gaining the support of the people do not need to change indeed operations since 2003 have re inforced these precepts significantly 5 this publication is intended to take t he armys major doctrinal principles and precepts and place them in this new operational env ironment for countering insurgency and thus to allow commanders to take some ccount of these new developments before complete and formal revision of military doctri ne operational and tactical practices can be prepared for publication which wil l take account of lessons learned and observations obtained in ops telic and herrick 6 the layout and sequence of th is revised publication follow s closely the format of the 2001 version issue 20 mar 07 2 1 chapter 2 the concept of insurgency section 1 definition for insurgency 1 insurgency is for the purposes of this publication defined as the actions of minority group who are intent on forcing political c hange by means of mixt ure of subversion propaganda and military pressure aiming to per suade or intimidate the broad mass of people normally within state to accept such change1 it is an organised armed political struggle the goals of which may be many and divers some insurgencies aim for straightforward seizure of power through comp lete revolutionary takeover others attempt to break away from state control and establish an autonomous state within traditional ethnic or religious bounds and yet others seek to des troy the state by viol ent action designed to disrupt the normal functions of control 2 in some instances an insurgency may st rive to extract wide ranging political concessions which are unattainable through less violent means insurgencies tend to arise when state authorities are unable or unwilling to redress the dem ands of significant social groups insurgencies could ther efore be coalitions of disparate forces sometimes united by common enmity towards gover nment and willingness to us violence to challenge its legitimacy 3 until recently it would be true to say t hat only an insurgency which was capable of attracting widespread popular s upport posed real threat to state authority arms proliferation and in part icular the availability of weapons of mass destruction together with the possibility of exaggeration through the media of an in surgents aspirations and prospects may well necessitate reassessment of the threat posed by insurgent groups in the future while the overall aut hority of the state may not init ially be at risk states ability to handle the potential disruptio n imposed by these new issues could have destabilising effect on any government there is growi ng view particularly amongst academics that the definition of insurgency may hav to change this is in view of the changes in the goals and aspirations of insurgents since the 1990s which now have an in ternational dimension linked closely with some aspects of ex treme forms of religious behaviour section 2 origins and causes 4 the seeds of insurgency the causes of insurgency lie in unfulfilled aspirations and what are perceived as legiti mate grievances which may ju stify rebellion or in other types of economic or social grievances wh ich may be manipulated by insurgents who are generally working to different agenda for thei r own reasons the causes may include nationalist ethnic tribal and cultural separatist movements based on strong feelings of identity which ar antipathetic to the domina nt majority in state b religion either as manifestation of separate identity or motivated by religious fundamentalism 1 this definition of insurgency was provided by the war studies department of rma sandhurst issue 20 mar 07 2 2 c neocolonialism the control of key sectors of the economy by foreign business interests or the presence of allied troops and their bases under the terms of an intervention or an unpopular treat which offends national sentiment d maladministration corruption discrimi nation and repression normally the precursor for failed state economic failure extremes of weal th and poverty especially in countries where the upper and lower classes ar of different ethnic origins f unfulfilled expectations particu larly amongst the middle class and the intelligentsia of the popul ation it is here that expecta tions of an improved way of life are usually greatest 5 exploitation of causes any of the causes of insurgency may be fostered and exploited by partyclan rivalries which may revolve around domestic political economic or religious issues exacerbated by the compet ition of ambitious personalities for power b political theorists for example old guard communists maoists anarchists and right wing irredentists by the same token religious extremism may also be utilised to exploit grievances c nationalist and separatist parties such parties may be mo tivated by extreme right or left wing ideologies or come from the middle moder ate portion of the political spectrum 6 examples from history history over the ages s hows that there are many examples of insurgency and in ll habitable areas of the world all will have lessons which continue to be relevant today but these are too numerous to record here in the first annex to this chapter certain well known and notable examples of insurgency from the seventeenth century onwards to the date of publication have be recorded or mentioned in the second and subsequent annexes there ar brief summaries of the more important concepts and theories about revolution and insu rgency that have been manifest since the start of the twentieth century these give an insight into how insurgency has changed and developed during this time section 3 the characteristics of insurgency characteristics 7 each insurgency will be uni although there may be simi larities between them insurgencies are more likely to occur in states where there are inherent social divisions based on racial cultural religious or ideologic differences leading to lack of national cohesion insurgencies may thrive in states that are economically weak and lack efficient stable or popular government s additional factors such as religious animosity corruption and external agitation may help to create climate in which polit ically inspired violence can erupt issue 20 mar 07 2 3 8 various models or patterns of insur gency have been postulated but whichever model is examined the key point to note is that the insurgent s aim is to force political change any military action is secondary and subordi nate means to an end it is also worth stressing that few insurgencies fit neatly into any rigid classifica tion in the past attempts have been made to cat egorise insurgencies according to particular characteristics for example by their environment rural or urban or by ideological origin leninist or maoist as the sandinist as showed in nicaragua in the late 1970s and as sendero luminoso demonstrated in peru in the early 1990s effective insu rgents take those parts of previous campaigns which seem to have work ed and adapt them to their own particular needs 9 examining the complete range of characteristics will enable the commander and his staff to build more accurate picture of the insurgent and the thinking behind his overall campaign plan prin ciples and techniques derived from previous experience may provide valuable guidance however the key to an appropriate response will be an objective military analysis such an analysis will identify the root cause or causes of the insurgency the extent to which it enjoys s upport both internally and exte rnally the basis on which the insurgent will appeal to his target population his motivation and the depth of commitment the likely weapons and tactics he will use and the operational environment in which he will seek to initiate and then develop his campaign 10 research2 suggests that during the cold war per iod 194890 there are seven main forms of insurgency which were used as the bas is for further exami nation these are recorded in the following paragraphs because they are important as analytical tools for military commanders to examine when considering the type of insurgency they are facing these seven forms of insurgency define insurgent s by their aspirations rather than by their actual manifestation and thus in more rec ent times 1990 onwards ma well be of limited use although there is still value in using these analytical tools particularly where insurgency is confined to single state and where only particular grievances within that state are perceived anarchist 11 the most potentially dangerous form of in surrection is that of the anarchist group which sets out to eliminate all po litical structures and the social fabric associated with them various groups in russia and elsewhere in europe flourished at the turn of the twentieth century but apart from assassination achieved littl else in more recent times cells such as the black cell and black help in wester n germany during the 1970s echoed this credo but were not particularly significant the pu rpose of an anarchist movement is to destroy the system there are normally plans to r eplace any form of gov ernment with any other system hence the danger of this form of insu rrection which could rapidly destabilise nation state very quickly and leave power vacuum 12 fortunately these normally very secretive and small groups do not have much public appeal and have not so far had any lasting ccess nevertheless their potential destructiveness to society cannot be overlooked with the growing prol iferation of all types of weapons and potential causes after 1989 these groupings cannot be underestimated or 2 acknowledgements to professor b oneill director of studies at the us national war college see also insurgency and terrorism inside modern revolutionary warfare also to the war studies dept at rma sandhurst and the staff college for additional material issue 20 mar 07 2 4 consigned to history one or two spectacula r and successful attacks by groups of this type could still have profound political effect on state or region far beyond their intrinsic worth and could undoubtedly have direct influence on international or global terrorism egalitarian 13 an egalitarian insurgency seeks to impose new system based on centrally controlled structures and institut ions to provide equality in th distribution of all state resources by mobilising the people m asses and radically tr ansforming the social infrastructure these insurgencies rely on gaini ng support for changes from within the state 14 this type of insurgency has been regularly used in the post second world war era and is characterised by the malayan communist party the viet cong in south vietnam the fedayeenikhalq in iran t he sendero luminoso shining path or sl in peru and several other communist style groupings similar type of insurgency but one which is not based on marxist doctrine can be seen in the baa thist groups that seized power in syria and iraq 15 as with all of these eg alitarian insurgencies those which achieved success normally established repressive regimes wi th authoritarian forms of political control in order to retain the power they had gained traditionalist 16 here the insurgency would seek to displa ce or overthrow the established system but revert back to nationaloriginal va lues that are rooted in the prev ious history of the region this form of insurgency has alwa ys existed but in recent year s following the collapse of the warsaw pact large areas aroun d the fringes of this former power bloc are now prone to such traditionalist forms of in surgency usually the insu rgent group would attempt to establish system centred on an autocratic rule supported by the army religious leaders and the traditional hierarchical syst em that prevailed in days gone by 17 insurgencies of this type can be seen in the movement in nicaragua the mujahedin groups in afghanistan and those who supported the retu rn of the imam to north yemen in the 1960s 18 more extreme and violent form of tradition alist insurgency is manifest in those who seek to reestablish an older political and re ligious culture based on values that are seen by many as feudal and which run counter to the development of social norms of behaviour in the contemporary world these can be defined as reactionary traditionalists examples being the muslim brot herhood in syria islamic jehad in egypt hezbollah in lebanon and hezbiislami party of islam in afghanistan these group ings would hope to establish islamic political and social norms in accordance with either the sunni or shiite version of the muslim faith the same can equally be appl ied to other religious groups christians jews hindus and buddhists all have their militant extremists 19 the dangerous potential for this type of insu rgency is that if it succeeds in one area as in iran it is likely to act as spur to other insurgencies elsewhere external aid to other groupings then becomes very real threat to the affected status furthermore the religious bias of an insurgency can affect and influence the views of indivi duals and these can be issue 20 mar 07 2 5 used to manipulate more popular support he re western nations could also be at potential disadvantage becaus of the contempt with which insu rgents of this type have for non believers see annex b for details of islamism pluralist 20 the final characteristic of the revolution ary types of insurgencies is the pluralist form where the goal of such insurgen cies would be to establish syst em in which the values of personal freedom liberty moderat ion and compromise are emphasised the history of western civilisations is marked by number of such changes but not generally in the post second world war era except in diluted fo rm in poland 198082 and possibly the baltic states of lithuania latvia and estonia many insurgencies may seem to be pluralist in tone but these invariably mask mo re authoritarian intention separatist 21 in sense the aim of separatist insu rgency is more total than that of the revolutionary types the separatists would s eek to remove themselves and the area they live completely from the cont rol of the remainder of the st ate the confederacy in the american civil war is classic example of separatist activity but in modern times the example of angola and nigeria are also useful illu strations of this category of insurgency the aspirations of kurds for kurdistan and the enclave of armenians in nagorno karabach are oblique examples of separatist ambitions 22 now that the hegemony of large power blocs has lost its appeal many such movements are manifesting themselves more openl however af rica has been blighted by secessionist wars for many years following the ending of colonialis m in many parts of that continent in effect separatist acti vity around the world has been endemic since the early 1960s and most continents cont inue to have their share of th is type of insurgency the form of political system that would be adopted by the insurgents if they succeeded varies enormously from the more traditional to the outright socia list extreme nevertheless these insurgencies can be classed as separatist because this is the goal that they all seek regardless of their size or whet her they are motivated by regiona l ethnic social or religious reasons independence wars can be regarded as separatist in their form because the primary aim of the insurgents is independence the vietnamese and algerian wars fall easily into this category as did the insurgency in dhofar during the late 1960s the secessionist campaigns in erit rea and biafra are african ex amples the tamil separatist movement in sri lanka is another exam ple in the indian sub continent reformist 23 this form of insurgency is toned down version of the separatist type in that insurgent groups would be fighting for political economic or social reforms and possibly some form of autonomy for themselves without altering the overall political status quo the kurds in iran and iraq are suitable examples as is the smaller more recent example in mexico during 1994 wher indians in the south of mexico sought improvements to their way of life issue 20 mar 07 2 6 preservationist 24 this final form of insurgency differs fr om the other six in that insurgents are orientated towards maintaining the political status quo in that nation becaus of the relative political social and economic ad vantages that can be gained from it these insurgents then take on the non ruling groups and the gov ernment where necessary in order to frustrate any moves towards change 25 classic examples of this are the afrik aner resistance movement in south africa and the military groupings of pr otestant extraction in northern ireland right wing varieties of death squads in number of latin american countries could also fall into this category section 4 analysing an insurgency 26 general it is not difficult to place the vari ous forms of insurgency into one of the seven categories listed above although care shoul d be taken to avoid too rigid approach to the analysis of an insurgency particularly in t he early stages of any insurgency this is because there can be many pitfalls to trap the unwary analyst in dealing with insurgents and their claims few are given in subsequent paragraphs 27 aims for an insurgency some insurgent movements change their aims during the process of an insurgency ne w leaders take over original aims may be seen as either unambitious or overambitious nd as the insurgency develops so may the aims change what started out in northern ireland as an ira requirement to defend catholic areas turned quickly into an insurgency against the establis hed authority and result ed in split by breakaway group provisionals fr om the old ira officials the change in the dhofar insurgency during the early 19 70s from separatist move ment to an egalitarian one resulted from marxist takeover in the leadership durin g the insurgency 28 rival aims the identification of the aim fo r an insurgency assumes unity of leadership and control within the in surgents more often this is not the case and it is not difficult to see why insurgents may vary in their outlook background and intellectual capability they probably work in secret or in conditions w here open discussion is not always possible and events can occur which ffect significantly t he role of individual insurgent leaders arrest and imprisonment can set back the course of the insurgents group in these complicated ci rcumstances it is easy for rival groups within the insurgency to have differing aims and priorities and it ma not be possible to identify immediately the overall aim of an insurgent group careful st udy of the group any material it produces and its actions on the ground may help to define the main thrust of an insurgency 29 written material and rhetoric where an insurgency does produce material or provide speakers whose views are reported these can be analysed however this is normally only appropriate when the insurgency is large and seeks wider audience for its views smaller more clandestine groupings generally avoid this option but are then probably less of real threat to the established authorities furthermore such material if produced can often be misleading and obscure n17 the small terrorist organisation which operated in greece from 1973 to 1998 published many articles in the newspapers after terrorist incidents attempting to justify their actions taken as whole these publications show that the organisation seems to have small middle classintellectual support very little appeal to any non committ ed group and particular progr amme to speak of it has issue 20 mar 07 2 7 remained small terrorist group outside the pol itical arena but yet an embarrassing left wing thorn in the side of the government which had to spend valuable resources to counter its terrorist activities 30 the implications of analysis while the roots of so insurgencies are more difficult to identify partly because of their own internal arrangement s most insurgencies can be identified once their aims are reasonabl clear and comprehensible the process of identifying the basis of an insurgency can also lead to t he implications that normally follow such analysis these could be that different aims put different demands on insurgents particularly with respect to resources if an insurgents aim is not amenable to compromise then it normally results in much stiffer opposit ion from the estab lished authorities in turn this implies that insurgencies should go for greater support more funding and longer term commitment to have any chance of ccess those whose aims are not the collapse of the established authority such as reformists and preservationist types of insurgency may be able to convince the authorities that concession is possible without recourse to protracted insurgency b clear analysis of an insurgency c an also help to discover the roles of outside or external parties to the insurgency in the 1960s the tendency of the united states to intervene in insurrections wa s in part the result of thinking to equate insurgency with the revolutionary aspira tions of egalitarian movements and the connotation of external support from chi na or the ussr calculations about intervention that gloss over the ultimate aims of an insurgency can be illinformed and costly 31 to help such analysis figure 1 describes in diagrammatic form how an insurgency could develop from this it may be possible to work out the aims objectives and courses of action for an insurgency section 5 insurgent strategies general 32 it should be noted that more often than not insurgent leaders are well informed astute and will probably st udy the lessons of previous campai gns of insurgency they will often seek to emulate the most successful ements of an established model which they hope will provide the means to achieve their chosen ends before looking at the strategies in more detail it is worth remembering that insur gents also make mistakes too until the mid 1970s the palestinian popular democratic front set it self an end state that is not achievable the destruction of israel and adopted totally inappropria maoist strategy as their means to this end 33 the most popular insurgent strategies continue to prov ide inspiration and guidance for diverse groups around the worl d it should also be reme mbered that the originators of each believed that they had discovered product that work ed an analysis of an insurgents strategic approach has practical application including for example the production of doctrinal over lay the four broad types are briefly summarised in the subsequent paragraphs issue 20 mar 07 2 8 grievances become political issuesmobilising public support organise open and clandestine opposition demand on state authorities opposition accepts without violence insurgency publicising grievances perceived lack of reasonable political economic social opportunities yes nono yes figure 1 an example of ho w an insurgency may develop yes yes issue 20 mar 07 2 9 conspiratorial strategy 34 the oldest and least complicated of the st rategies which was used by the bolsheviks in 1917 it is designed to operate in an urban env ironment ideally the capital city which is seen as the decisive arena small cells of potential leaders attempt to release and channel the energy of disaffected soci ety generating spo ntaneous uprising by means of bold armed action 35 typically key points will be seized and decapitating strike made against the governing regime modern exponents will seek both to seize control of and exploit media coverage the coup is gener ally organised by relatively small group which may be clique in the armed forces the insurgents have to be highly secretive disciplined and capable of quick assembly or dispersion protracted popular war 36 the overall strategy was designed by mao and has been adopted with varying degrees of success by numerous in surgent groups since mao envisaged three phases strategic defensive organisation strategic equilibrium guerrilla wa rfare and strategic offensive open battle leading to seizure of political power although it has often been linked with marxist ideology the strategy is based upon the assumption that the cause will attract ever increasing number s of supporters it will invo lve mix of political activity terrorism and guerrilla tactics but with the former always predominating 37 the strategy is most applicable in rura l peasantbased environ ments in situations where government control is we ak or non existent and where the insurgent can establish his base areas build parallel political and m ilitary structure and gradual ly expand the area of influence to challenge governm ent authority as the title suggests the strategy takes time to reach fruition the requirement for favourable terrain space in which to hide and trade for time may restrict the us of this strategy in the futu re although it may still prove effective in underdeveloped regions or states with poor armed forces it could also be argued that city and urban sprawl will provide the same sort of space that is needed to foster an insurrection of this type urban insurgency 38 in its pure form this strategy involv the application of organised crime and terrorism in systematic and ruthless manner the intention according to carlos marighela one of its main proponents is to force repressive military response that in turn will alienate the volatile mass of the urban poor and move them to revolt the media will be used to generate an air of panic violence is therefore catalyst fo r political change the strategy and tactics of this form of insurgency have been adopted by numerous groups 39 the urban insurgent is new phenomenon but t he very complexity of modern life and the ease with which it can be disrupted has undoubtedly encouraged the growth of urban guerrilla philosophies and tactics lenin developed the art of creating revolutionary situation he appreciated the importance of destroying the credibility of the governments will and ability to govern thus creating what has been aptly called climate issue 20 mar 07 2 10 of collapse where the people faced with the real threat of co llapse of urban life and livelihood will rally to whatev er organisation seems best able to restore order out of chaos 40 the urban insurgent has adopted tacti cs designed to erode the morale of the politicians the administrators an d the judiciary the police and the army with the aim of inducing climate of collapse at this stage the insurgency antici pates either that the government will capitulate or be provoked into adopting repressive measures and above all causing bloodshed agai nst such repression the urban insurgent purposes to appear like knight in shining arm our as the peoples protector 41 the chief weapon of the ur ban insurgent is indiscriminat terror by which he can induce the situation of general insecurity nervousness and fear pictured above he has the advantage of surprise and exploits this by concentrating on pinprick attacks like assassinations ambushes kidnapping sabotage and raids on banks prisons and army and police installations he has been pictured as familiar with the avenues streets alleys the ins and outs of the urban centres their paths and shortcuts their empty ts their underground passages their pipes and sewers the urban guerrilla crosses th rough irregular and difficult terrain unfamiliar to the police wher they can be surprised in fatal ambush or trapped at any moment minimanual of the urban guerrilla by carlos marighela 42 the urban insurgent cannot like his rura l counterpart establish bases and recruit armies he is an individual member of relatively small group relying on the cover afforded by the teeming people of the city and on rror to avoid betrayal but he relies above all on publicity to make his cause know n and achieve favourable public response good publicity is as vital to the insurgent as hostile public reaction can be damaging 43 similarly the deliberate promotion of adverse publicit against government agencies including the security forces if deployed is essential and complementary the opportunities for mass publicity hav not only advertised and cont ributed to the growth of this type of insurgency they have also given it an international aspect the growing trend towards the use of civil liberti and human rights by political groups also tends to lower the tolerance of the general public for effective counter measures this is shown not only by the way in which new techniques quickl become widely adopted but also through the advent of the international tr avelling insurgent usually well educated and often wellheeled who may appear in any country and any setting wh ere the circumstances seem to him or her ripe for ex ploitation isolated terrorism 44 less dangerous or destabilising for t he government is the potential for isolated terrorism often committed by small groups of militant insurgents modern society is vulnerable to terrorist tactics not only because of its complexity but also because of its high technology thus while on th one hand whole modern cities can be reduced to chaos by lack of electrical power or the health hazar ds of untended sewers on the other hand the terrorist can exploit the vulnerability of jet aircraft fast trains and crowded motorways to make extravagant demands linked to the threat of causing specta cular disasters with the issue 20 mar 07 2 11 sort of publicity which modern communicati on has made inevitable one such act of terrorism can make an impact on the world at large 45 evidence from the 1970s and 1980s shows that terrorists knew this and experience also shows that modern mocratic and open society can protect itself completely against such threat with this in nd small group who hold extremist views of whatever type can conduct isolated acts of terr orism or assassination in the hope that their demands can be met this may not amount to full scale insurrection or indeed anything approaching it but it could easily result in t he government becoming involved in large scale counter terrorist operations to find and neut ralise the group or face the embarrassing consequences section 6 the potential backlash against an insurgency violent reaction by communities 46 once insurgency is establis hed in state or region there is always the possibility of violent reaction within the communi ty particularly in response to rrorist acts this sort of backlash could be provoked by insurgency move ments sometimes deli berately but is often spontaneous reaction by parts of the comm unity it may be simple gut reaction by one community against another believed to be c ausing outrages or harbouring terrorists sympathetic towards them on the other hand it may be more premeditated attempt by an enraged section of society to take the w into its own hands against the perpetrators because it has confidence in the security fo rces ability to bring them to justice extremist reactions and death squads 47 reaction to such terrorism can also lead to sectaria n strife anarchic and chaotic situations which while provid ing useful propaganda and cover for insurgents can also be the reason for death squads extreme reaction and the possibility of coup détat by disaffected groups within the state including the armed forces operations in algeria both in the 1950s and recently in iraq are all cl assic examples of extremist reaction 48 furthermore this reaction once started can also escalate to sectarian or civil war situation which will provide good propaganda for the insurgents the loyalist terrorist operations in northern ireland dur ing the early 1970s and later is good example of action outside the law which can dest abilise society as whole conclusion 49 it should be stressed that t hese examples of strategies ar not watertight categories into which new threats should be fitted in pr actice insurgencies use similar tools but in different proportions and with different result s the success of the individual strategy selected will be determined by r ange of factors all of which should be considered in any assessment of an insurgency t hese are dealt with in more deta il later in this publication since 1990 newer and more pr ecise methods of analysing an insurgency are coming into prominence partly because defi ning insurgencies by their aspirations is becoming less accurate although not necessarily irrelevant issue 20 mar 07 2 1 annex to chapter 2 insurgency historical perspective background to the twentieth century 1 nationalism and repression after the battle of wa terloo in 1815 when napoleon was banished to st helena the concern of the victorious coalit ion powers quickly joined by france guided by talleyrands diplomacy was to restore peace and stability to continent torn by over two decades of conflic t this was achieved und er their sponsorship at the congress of vienna in series of treaties signed in 1814 and 1815 austrian influence was restored over much of germany italy remained divided some of it under austrian and french rule and the independence of belgium and pola nd was extinguished only belgium succeeded in winning its freedom in 1830 the remaining nationalist revolutions came to grief in 1848 and 1849 for the next sixty years the breechloading rifle the railway and the telegraph ga ve established governments the advantage over nationalist as well as socialist revolution aries new continental empire s and states were created by war rather than revolution though garibaldi as the inherit or of the enthusiasms of the french revolution mobilised popular armed support to help mazzini cavour and victor emmanuel weld the italian states into singl nation french vict ories at magenta at solferino saw the end of austrian influence in italy the new inventions and the efficient machinery of the prussian state and army enabl ed von bismarck and von moltke to apply napoleons legacy of military proficiency to fight three short sharp and successful wars to create the second reich 2 revolution and repression despite the attractiveness of the theme liberté egalité et fraternité as motif for revolution nationa lism was to furnish more potent stimulant than individual eman cipation on the continent during the latter half of the nineteenth century while dissatisfied na tional minorities schemed to dismember the austrohungarian empire an illa ssorted collection of revolution aries and idealists plotted to overthrow the tsarist regime in russia in that instance t hey were unable to make much headway against the state secret police in france hum iliated by prussia in the 187071 war the second empire was overthrown but the emergent third republic managed to defeat the paris commune the first marxist revolu tion in struggle which was far bloodier than the french revolution eighty years earlie r the commune was rare example of revolutionaries fighting openly the moderation they displayed in refusing to seize the bank of france for instance was not recipr ocated the commune was ruthlessly quelled similarly tsarist government humbled by j apan was able to face down widespread but uncoordinated revolt in 1905 the concessions yielded by the tsar were virtually meaningless as trotsky put it constitu tion is given but the autocracy remains an even more disastrous defeat would be needed to provide the catalyst for communist revolution 3 the british experience for the first six or seven years after waterloo the tory government which had won the war remained in power impervious to the mounting social pressures of the agrarian and in dustrial revolutions and to the demands for parliamentary reform violence there certainly was in those years but on lesser scale than on the continent the dispersal of crowd of 50 000 which had assembled at st peters field outside manchester to listen to orator hunt by yeomanry charge dubbed peterloo in issue 20 mar 07 2 2 1819 killing twelve and injuri ng hundreds and the ca to street conspiracy an unsuccessful plot hatched in that st reet to murder the ent ire cabinet at dinner party in grosvenor square year later were exceptional event s in slow intermitt ent but persevering progress towards reform apar t from the irish home rule crisis of 1914 soon to be swallowed up in the larger trauma of the first world war the nearest the country came to revolution or civil war was when the whig reform bill of 1832 with the limited aim of enfranchising the middle class was defeated once in the commo ns and twice by the lords it was passed however when lord grey suggested to william iv that it might be necessary to create enough peers to carry it to avert civi l war the voteless continued to press for democracy through the peoples charter but in cont rast to the riots and revolutions of 1848 on the continent the chartist march through lon don that year receiv ed scant support enthusiasm for empire building and constant stream of emigrants to settle the temperate colonies which were to achieve dominion st atus eased the strain on the british isles and provided distraction from dom estic social problems follo wing the passage of the reform bill the last seven decades of the nineteenth century were to wi tness steady extension of the vote and civil liberties even to the extent of offering marx and ngels an asylum where they could develop their revolu tionary theories in the closed society of the tsarist police state the bolsheviks as well as anarchists and other extremists learned to plot in secrecy and to develop cellular party or ganisation structure to spread their marxist philosophy and other ideas underground the twentieth century until 1945 4 marx lenin and trotsky the lesson that karl marx drew from the failure of the commune reinforced by the colla pse of the 1905 revolution wa s that it was use taking over an existing regime it had to be destroyed and replaced by revolutionary one lenin agreed but it was trotsky who pr oduced strategy for revolutionary war although he never claimed to be military expert he put his fa ith in arming and training well indoctrinated urban proleteriat able to strike quick and mort blow against regular forces which had been weakened by marxist propaganda he consid ered that rustic rebellion would take too long to mobilise would be hard to contro l and could be beaten by regulars loyal to the tsar 5 the russian revolution 1917 kerenskys weak liberal government was overturned not by popular upris ing but by lenin and trotskys coup détat of november 1917 it was the defeats hardships and pre ssures of the first world war rather than marxist theory which undermined the morale of the imperial army the tsars bulwark against revolution much of it was induced to desert to the bolshevik cause enabling trotsky to win the civil war by conventional military means the revolution was consolidated by making peace with germany and giving land to the peasants foreign support for the white russians from the war weary allies was only halfhearted the comintern was formed in 1919 follo wing meeting of the third communist international in moscow to promote revolution abroad howe ver the cominterns activities were temporarily shelved by stalin in the late 20s to preserve socialism in one country once that had been secured attention could be divert ed to promoting subversive proselytising activities based on indigenous communist par ties front organisations and the urban proletariat to foster world revolution thes efforts were to be pursued as opportunity offered until the collapse of t he ussr and of the central ro that the communist party played in the state just as stalin was prepared to sacr ifice communist parties abroad when it suited the interests of the ussr so he imposed ru thless dictatorship at home issue 20 mar 07 2 3 which surpassed the most brutal excesses of any tsar with t he murder of some 19 million people over the course of some 10 years for all their protestations to the contrary communism and fascism had much in common in terms of the tyrannies they created 6 mao tsetung and china the two great asian communi st leaders mao tsetung and ho chi minh based t heir revolution on the peasantry mao tsetungs policy was the opposite of the russian version of communist teaching which had aimed to convert the urban proletariat to the revoluti onary cause first and then to secure the countryside when he realised that the marxist model of proletarian war did not apply to china an agrarian society with weak industrial sector he tur ned away from the cities and workers to the countryside and the peasantry as the main support for revolution guerrillas weaker than their enemy could not be effective or even survive without strong wellorganised popular support mobilising that support was political rather than military task and the primacy of political over military concerns became hallmark of maos theorising about warfare in this respect he diverged markedly from tradit ional western military thought with its fairly rigid distinctions between war and peace an d between political an d military affairs1 faced with formidable kuomintang rmy mao withdrew from south east china by circuitous westerly route to the caves of yenan in the northwestern prov ince of shansi of perhaps 86000 men who set out on the long march in october 1934 onl about 4000 reached their destination year later myth was carefully created to turn severe defeat into legendary triumph however starting from his remote base mao was able to begin the process of wearing down the kuomintang forces in prolonged guerrilla war gradually he expanded the territory under his control by combination of terror and persuasion allowing him to raise and train an army capable of engagi ng his enemy in the field fifteen years after he set out for yenan he entered peking insurgency since the second world war3 7 after 1945 there is new common factor di scernible in all the armed conflicts since the second world war and especially in the majo rity of those conflicts that are irregular in nature military power has become less effe ctive in achieving decisive politically satisfactory results at every level of confli ct this is as true for enemies fighting with conventional weapons as for the nucleararmed super powers and it is equally true for governments and for insurgents in small wars that now account for most of the worlds suffering 8 the principal technique which the insurgent groups have used to attack the state authorities in the past 50 years has been guerrilla warfare for time in the 1950s and early 1960s it seemed virtually infallible techniq ue for overthrowing governments but like the first of the modern methods for seizing stat power the urban uprisings of nineteenth and early twentieth century europe which drew their inspiration from the french revolution in 1789 guerrilla warfare proved to be techni that only flourished in specific environment 9 guerrilla warfare as fo rm of resistance to foreign occupation or an unpopular domestic government has been ar ound since the beginning of history but it was not generally regarded as potentially decisive military technique even as late as world war ii 1 based on the army state and the people power confounded by dr g dyer in his book war published in 1985 issue 20 mar 07 2 4 when it was again widely employed against german and japanese occupation forces primarily because it lacked an adequate strategy for final victory 10 so long as the guerrillas remained dispers ed in the hills forests or swamps and indulged in only hitandrun ra iding against the gover nment or the foreign occupiers they could be tolerated but they could never cl ear their opponents out of the urban centres of power if they came down out of the hills and attempted to do so in open combat they gave their opponents the target t hey had been hoping for an d the enemys regular forces would smash them ev the yugoslavs the most successf ul guerrilla fighters of world war ii could not have liberated their country unaided the germ ans finally pulled out mainly because the red army was sweeping through the balkans toward them 11 what changed after world war ii was that the rural guerrilla technique spread into the european colonial empires at time w hen the imperial powers were in gravely weakened economic condition as in the occ upied countries of europe during the war the insurgents in the european colonies after the war had difficulty in mobilising many of their newly nationalistic fellow countrymen against the forei gn occupiers and as in the occupied countries of europe they had virtua lly prospect of winni ng military victory against the wellequipped regular forces of t he imperial power though they could turn themselves into an expensive nuisance what was different was that european powers had such stake in retaining control of thei r colonies and had lost t he legitimacy for their presence 12 if the insurgents could make it very expen sive for the colonial power to stay and could go on doing so indefinitely they didnt have to worry about gaining military victory the colonial power would event ually decide to cut its losse s and withdraw this was reality that had already been dem onstrated by the irish war of independence in 191921 and the turkish war of national resistance agai nst attempted partition by the victorious entente powers in 191922 the struggle for which the new so viet union coined the phrase national liberation war the demonstration was repeated many times in the two decades after 1945 in indonesia kenya malaya viet nam south yemen and many other places in few cases like malaya the british handed over to the malayan author ities in the case of algeria the colonial power won the military confrontation but could not overcome the political imperative for change in france algeria and elsewhere in the majority of cases the decolonisation process was achieved wit hout guerrilla war once the message of their own vulnerability to this technique had been absorbed 13 at the time the apparently irresistible spread of rural guerrilla wars caused some alarm in the major western powers there was also an ideological element however in that almost all of these postwar insurgencies espoused some variant of the same marxist ideology propounded by the wests main inter national rival the soviet union the insurgents tended to attribute their successes to ideology rather than to the particular environment in which they were oper ating this led to belief in the west that it was soviet andor chinese expansionism and not simply cal resentment of foreign rule that lay behind these guerrilla wars and so to the creation of specia l counter insurgency forces especially in the united states and ultimately to the commitm ent of us troops to vietnam during 1965 14 the technique of rural insurgency only fl ourished as long as there were demoralised governments around to oppose the world rema ins littered with rural guerrilla movements issue 20 mar 07 2 5 today hanging on in the more rugged parts of dozens of third world countries but as the exponents of minority ideology or the representatives of nority ethnic group they have very little prospect of success against cal governments that can credibly invoke nationalism on their own side the era of successful rura l insurgency was already in decline when the united states became involved in vietnam 15 it is far harder to win guerrilla cam paign against ones own government not only because there is not the natural antipathy against foreign ru to attract recruits to the cause but also because locally based gove rnment cannot simply cut its losses and go home if the cost of fighting counter insurgency campaign gets too high as consequence when fighting against their own gov ernment rural insurgen ts do have to face the question of how to win final military vi ctory in open battle against the governments regular armed forces and only three have achieved it china in 1949 cuba in 1959 and nicaragua in 1979 16 the war in vietnam between 196573 obscured an important development elsewhere however this was precisely the period in which rural guerrilla warfare showed how ineffective it was outside the specific late colonial environment in which it had flourished there was never any serious attempt to practice it in any industrialised country but in the middle and late 1960s the cubans made concerted effort to extend the technique to the independent states of latin america rural insurgencies sprang up in almost all the states of sout h america marxist in orientat ion and enjoying tacit or even open cuban support without except ion they failed disastrous ly the epitome of this failure was che guevaras tragicomic attempt to start such movement in bolivia which ended in his own death in 1967 17 this is not to say that the techniq ue can never work in independent underdeveloped countries but it certainly does require that the tar get government be iniquitous incompetent and politically isolated as in nicar agua in most latin american states the insurgents had been elimin ated or reduced to merely marg inal nuisance by 1970 the inescapable conclusion which was accepted by most latin american revolutionaries was that rural guerrilla warfare was another insurgency technique that had failed 18 this realisation drov numbers of these disappoi nted insurgents into random terrorism or rather urban guerrilla warfare as it is now known in effect the strategy of the latin american originators of this doctrine most notably the montoneros of argentina the tupamaros of uruguay and brazilian revolution aries like carlos marighella was aimed at driving the target regimes into extreme repression 19 by assassinations bank robberies kidn appings hijackings and such activity all calculated to attract maximum publicity in the media and to embarrass the government to the greatest possible extent the insurgents sought to provoke the displacement of democratic governments by tough military regimes or to drive existing military regimes into even stricter and more unpopular security measur if the regime resorted to counter terror torture disappearances and death squads all the better for the purpose was to discredit the government and ali enate it from the population 20 as with rural guerrilla warfare when it is attempted outside colonial environment the fatal flaw in any urban guerrilla strategy is t hat it lacks completeness the theory is that when the guerrillas have succeeded in driving t he government into sufficiently repressive issue 20 mar 07 2 6 posture the populace will rise up in righteous wr ath and destroy its oppressors but even if the population should decide that it is t he government and not the guerrillas that is responsible for its growing misery there is plan of how to eliminate the government 21 in number of latin am erican countries the insurg ents did accomplish the first phase of their strategy the creation of thor oughly nasty and brutally repressive military governments dedicated to destroying them but what then happened was that these governments proceeded to do precisely that in every latin americ an country where they attempted to use this strategy the vast majority of the urban guerrillas are now dead captured or in exile 22 in the past few years another form of militant tendency has reappeared on the international scene that of is lamic fundamentalism or rather islamism to use its more correct appellation since communism has now collapsed this form of militant opposition to secular governments and regimes has taken much of the limelight nnex b provides some of the background to islamism and some clues as to its strengt hs and weaknesses 23 in summary all the non governmental fo rms of organised violence which have emerged over the past couple of centuries do not cha nge the basic reality insurgents of any political hue matter which specific techni ques they use are an inherently transient phenomenon although this may be changing insurg encies that are regional or global in context are now being regarded as long or longer term in nature because of the overall complexity of dealing with insurgencies with such normally ambitious aims issue 20 mar 07 2 b 1 annex b to chapter 2 the dangers of islamism real and apparent1 1 in recent years fundamentalist terrorism and subversion have become growing and significant threat to wider area of the world than at any since the iranian revolution in 1978 this type of activity threatens stability in several north african states around the rim of the former soviet union and ev some parts of south east asia 2 islamism more commonly referred to in the western world as islamic fundamentalism is the ideologi sed and political version of is lam one of its pervasive characteristics is the sharpness of its verbal cr iticism of western secular practices which in the more recent past has been translated into rrorist action against st ates institutions and individuals in the west beyond the religious distortions which islamism has thrown up this recent turmoil is really about how people think and live and not simply about boundaries or economic interests this is why it affects whole group of nation states in swathe across the middle east and north africa and its cons equences and implicat ions are of global significance 3 the blanket labeling of islam as f undamentalist threat is dangerous because it plays into the purposes of the is lamists themselves this is be cause first such stereotype thinking tacitly accepts the assertion of islami sts that they and their followers represent the true islam and second it lends credence to the is lamist insistence that there is kind of irreconcilable hostility between islam and the west which inevitabl makes them arch enemies 4 that is not really the case the isla mists constitute only small group within the islamic world under some circumstances howev er they can mobilise sizeable following as was illustrated by the revolutionary years in iran and the more recent elections in algeria such circumstances usually involve dissatisfaction with nations regime and the political economic and social co nditions under its rule at that time such dissatisfaction may be more or less justified but in almost every instance it is at least based on genuine problems or abuses whether an islamist group if they pos sessed power could really govern better than any secular state is another ques tion all the current signs are that they could not retain power for long as witnessed recently in somalia 5 despite its antiwestern rhet oric in political practice is lamism is directed primarily against the existing state authorities which the fundamentalists hope to topple and supplant the arguments they use to that end however are largely antiwes tern in nature just as the late shah of iran was labeled lackey of the americans an existing secular government is stamped as lackey of the west as such it is often characterised by islamic extremists as not truly muslim gov ernment but rather as jahiliya regime 6 the term jahiliya the time of ignorance is used in islam to designate the era before the appearance of the prophet mohammed this is symptomatic of the islamist tendency to see themselves as the only true mu slims and thus to claim that they represent the real islam 1 based loosely on an article in swiss review of world affairs sep 92 by arnold hottinger issue 20 mar 07 2 b 2 7 in doing so muslims are articulating deepseated resentments prevalent throughout the third world today especially among eur opes closest neighbours these resentments are linked to the superimpos ition of western power litary economic cultural technological and ideological which noneu ropean peoples have experienced since the beginning of the 19th century and continue to experience today 8 many muslims have found those western influences acceptable as long as there was hope that they would ultimately bring thei r country prosperity and prestige but doubts about this have steadily increased with the years in the arab world following the six day war 1967 and in iran quite suddenly when t he economic boom collapsed in 1978 it came to seem progressively more improbable t hat the path of westerni sation would really lift the societies of the middle east to level comparable to that of the west 9 as long as such discrepancy exists bet ween the actual situat ion and the divinely given claim to superiority there is bound to be more or less diffuse malaise in the collective muslim psyche which intensifies when prospects for real change appear slight or non existent 10 the urgent desire for change in existing conditions is thus motivated not only by the desire for better life in this world but also by the religiously based drive to make of the muslim community once again the successful divinely blessed community it once was and should be according to the muslims own view of the world 11 such doctrine presents danger primarily to more or less westernised muslim governments and elites it aims first and fore most at taking power domestically in an internal arena which its advocat regard as corrupted by the west it should also be recognised that islamist ideology as politic opposition force makes promises it could hardly keep if its advocates were to come to power the inadequacy and hence exploitability of the muslim countries is c aused by objective facts which have been present for many years and which cannot be altered rely by adopting an ideol ogical dogma that purports to be the true islam 12 fundamentalists insist that their doctr ine will change people and that these altered individuals will then be able to approach the world around them di fferently so far alas there is little sign of such internal change in iran or sudan or in pa kistan where attempts are also being made to introduce fundamentalist style islamic state 13 it will doubt remain difficult to br ing about genuine change in the hearts and minds of men as long as the islamists insi st on equating islam with the body of religious laws known as the sharia fo rmulated by religious scholars in the early middle ages in keeping with their understanding of islamic text s and traditions the attempt to live in accordance with this mediaeval code results in strict formalism that is the formal fulfillment of finely detailed religi ous prescriptions and proscripti ons from time long past mode of existence hardly likely to alter the hearts and behaviour of people as to make them better suited to meet the challenge of modern life 14 as soon as islamists come to power t he unconditional acceptance of the sharia as legal guide turns into weakness in some cases they are forced to find formal excuses for circumventing religious w and merely fulfilling it pro forma in other cases religious law can constrain the life of individual fa milies and entire societies imprison their issue 20 mar 07 2 b 3 intellectual horizons in rigid structures thereby making it impossible for the islamists and the people they rule to create modern state 15 as internal tensions in islamistruled countries grow the danger increases of governmentsponsored terrorism or of some rash military action such actions are more likely to occur in the area immediately around t he country concerned eg the gulf region for iran and egypt for sudan so far these stat lack the military means to become active over greater distances but this could change their leaders ar aware of this limitation which is confirmed by the fact that muslim and islamist countries have failed to intervene in any significant way in the bosnian conflict 16 the fact that close to 12 llion muslim guest workers live and will continue to live in europe and the united st ates could also be source of some danger only very small percentage of these guest workers and immigr ants are islamists but the number could increase rapidly if these workers are handled badly exposure to repeated injustice will drive them into the arms of t he fundamentalists in this sense what applies to the middle east also applies to europe the wors matters become for the muslim population objectively and the more hopeless their european existence seems to them subjectively the more easily they will fall vict im to the lure of islamism most security services in the industrialised nations are not yet properly equipped to differentiate accurately between harmless foreign workers and members of potentially hostile islamic groups 17 to the extent that islamism constitu tes danger to any state the best way to counter it is to understand t he intellectual and organisational mechanisms in which the islamists operate effective counter measures must begin at that point because ideas even those that distort reality can only be fought by other ideas helping to eliminate the existing abuses and inequities is the price that has to be paid for deflecting the danger of islamism issue 20 mar 07 3 1 chapter 3 the strategic conduct of an insurgency section 1 abiding features 1 basic tenets all successful insurgents and thos who have come near to success have consciously or not subscribed to certain bas ic tenets like any other tenets such as the principles of war they should be applied rationally to it the circumstances of the society and the political circumstanc of the day these tenets are cause b leadership c popular support d organisation 2 cause in the past the cause for which the leaders have normally persuaded the insurgents to risk their lives and the population to provide suppor t sometimes at risk to life liberty and property has been valid one it has usually been based on generally perceived grievances in the political soci and economic fields and was sufficiently emotive to appeal to the imagi nation and fired supporters with enough enthusiasm to fight for this cause today the same situation prevails if the cause appears to be reasonable and valid then there will be grounds for revolt however with the recent rapid increase in the use of cheap speedy and reliable co mmunications and imagery an international dimension can readily be added to the ability to drum up cause sectarian and religious issues can very easily be exploited to foster antagonism towards the ruling authorities and to deepen and reinforce existing grievances sometimes this is cause enough to embarrass the authorities into re medial action or suppression and hence become the basis for potential insurgency 3 leadership the cause is best publicised and personified by charismatic leader who can inspire his followers convert the uncommitted and at least command the respect and certainly the fear of those who support the authorit ies he or she has to possess the sharpness of intellect to enable them to det ermine and define long term political and strategic aims and the nimbleness of wit and wisdom to adjust the immediate strategy and tactics to achieve them this also requires considerable military skills mao tsetung ho chi minh and tito all exercis ed fine political judgem ent in when to attack and when to bide their time an insurgent leader needs rd and ruthless streak behind the facade of cheerful bonhomie he or she has to wear for political and propaganda purposes there may well be rivalries for leadership whic h need to be dealt with firml to survive and leader has to have the strength of character to impose decisio ns taken especially when the insurgency is in its early stages there have been instances wher the leader of an insurgency does not appear to have the qualitie s of leadership normally associated with such individuals this may be because the leader is not generally know n within the country or because there is lack of understanding and appreciation of his or her motivations as rule of thumb the connection between cause and l eadership is dynamic one if the cause is sound the leader need not be so charismatic if the cause ems weak or divisive then issue 20 mar 07 3 2 the leader needs to be strong and effective it should also be recognised that any analysis of cause could by its natur be subjective perceived through western eyes and hence not always very helpful particularly in the early formative period of an insurgency when not much is known about their aims 4 popular support the cause and the leader have to appeal to as wide an audience as possible the insurgents political plans will endeavour to enlist t he support of as much of the population as possible irrespective of age sex or class neutrals are neither recognised nor tolerated by insurgents they have to be persuaded or coerced to join the cause some may have to be murdered to persuade the waverers popular support is not only important from political poi nt of view but is essential to the provision of logistic support to the development of an intelligence network and to the creation of protective security screen around the insurgents clandestine organisation in recent times aspects of this popular support may not be necessary as result of the brutal and potentially horrific application of the prop aganda of the deed see 911 5 organisation to be successful any insurgency has to have some organisation in order to be able to function pr operly and to respond appropriately to the many aspects of an insurgency at the outset of any insurgency organisation may not be the first priority and with few hard core members there may be ss need for detailed or ganisations as the insurgency develops however organisation into groupscellscompanies etc will be vital both to protect members and equipment and also to expand sufficient ly to take more adherents to the cause once sufficient vel of popular support has been achieved organisation will be vital to coordinate all the various activities of an insurgency and to start the process of providing credible alternative to the established authorities once again looser and more flexible organisation and c ontrol seems to be more useful in modern insurgency both for security and for international awareness section 2 the context of an insurgency 6 suiting the strategy to the circumstances insurgency is essentially an empirical art existing experience is adapted to suit par ticular situations nin mao tsetung and ho chi minh propounded strategies based on hegel and marx which they applied with realistic flexibility and pragmatism to seize pow er in russia china and vietnam in italy the red brigades were inspired by marxist philosophy in their ttempt to create revolutionary proletariat to ov erthrow the legitimate governmen t since the marxists took some trouble to rationalise their system of revo lutionary war they are worth studying many insurgents copied their ideas but few met with much success in the latter part of this century these ideas have become less fash ionable with the dem ise of communism although there is still much an insurgent can learn abo ut the tactics of an insurgency by an examination of previous antiimperialist campaigns it is also relevant to understand why some insurgencies have failed in order to appreciate the art of suiting strategy to the circumstances of the day 7 revolutionary situation in the context of massi ve discontent and weak and discredited government which cannot rely on the loyalty of its security forces skilled insurgent leader who has prepar ed the way with seemingly valid cause party with cellular organisation and capabi lity to apply ruthless methods to put plans into effect may achieve results relatively quickly lenin in 1917 and hitler in 1933 both seized power in putsches on smaller scale king farouk of egypts regime was ripe for

support and can rely on the majority of its securi ty forces the insurgent has to look to protracted war of attrition perhaps on the communist model ap propriately modified to the political and geographical environment polit ical policy and military action are closely coordinated to support each other the aim of the attritional approach is gradually to erode the will of the governments pporters at home to continue the struggle and to persuade public opinion amongst its foreign allies that the cause is hopeless and waste of life and resources once such mood sets in artful propaganda and large scale antiwar demonstrations can be expected to force allied governments to weaken their support 9 support for an insurgency at the strategic and opera tional level experience has shown that deception has often been major w eapon in the armoury of an insurgency particularly those that emanate fr om totalitarian base this would include religious zealots in wider interpretation of the term totalitari an the capacity of population in modern democracy to support counter insurgency for l ong is at best precarious the mixture of propaganda and compulsion which to talitarian form of insurgency can offer in order to extract vital support is normally not availabl to democratic state thus when military operations government controls and restrictions drag on for long pe riods popular support is bound to decline it has been quoted that unless it is seve rely provoked or unless the war succeeds fast democracy cannot choose th is method as an instrument of policy 10 deception for totalitarian regime conducti ng or supporting insurrection in other states the ideological and propag anda effort required can be blished easily in order to gain the sympathy and support of the outside worl d while at the same time deceiving others of the true nature of their invo lvement with insurgency by the same token deception can be used to project false pictur of the origins and character of the insurrection and to create myth of systematic war crim by the state authorities section 3 factors affecting an insurgency 11 general the factors which affect an insurgency can be as important as the cause of the insurgency itself and will co ntribute significantly to the end re sults if carefully applied the factors are protracted war b choice of terrain c intelligence d establishment of an alternative society external support f concurrent activity issue 20 mar 07 3 4 12 protracted war although weak government ma fall quite quickly to well organised rebellion or even overnight to coup détat strong government may only be defeated by protracted operations against it time is on t he side of the insurgent insurgents will need to be indoctrinated to expe ct long war and to display patience and endurance the struggle will generally take pl ace in two environment s the town and the countryside although insurgent ac tivity could well occur in both town and countryside once it has become firmly established the emphasis to be placed on each will depend on the size and nature of the territory and where the insurgents strength initially lies rural the rural scene lends it self to the gradual occupat ion of country for example mao tsetung factor s in china and ho chi minh in vietnam the insurgency leader has to be prepared to play long game withdrawing when necessary to avoid an unnecessary defeat to keep his forces in being he should have enough flexibility of mind to reconsider his immediate strategy while keeping his longer term aims constantly in mind b urban the urban guerrillas inability to ccupy territory can be partially overcome by establishing nogo areas in cities or in relatively safe zones domiciled by his fellow countrymen coreligionists or other sympathisers he relies more on warweariness economic privat ion and the inability of t he authorities to suppress terrorism than on winning an overall military vi ctory to achieve his aims there have been exceptions to this theory but they are rare cuba is one such example between 195860 13 choice of terrain while insurgents can operate anywhere either on their own account or in support of protracted insur gency force which wishes to survive and perhaps develop into an army c apable of formal conventional operations has to make the best strategic use of space or of the cover provided by thi ck jungle or high mountains to force the security forces to fi ght as far away as possible from their bases without the ability to seize and hold terri tory or to win quick victory space and time became weapons rather than goals proximity to the border of friendly country will offer the insurgents source of supply and sanctuary while mao ts etung initially relied on the vast tracts of western china castro used the sierra maestr of southeastern cuba in the smaller territories of cyprus and palestine in the former eoka used the towns as well as the troodos mountains to hide in and in the latter both arab and zionist guerrilla groups used the judean and samarian hills as well as the urban labyrinths of jerusalem and the towns on the coastal plain 14 space to operate in another sense terrorist ma make use of the neutral or friendly support of an urban populat ion to act as his space or cover to carry out his operations fish swimming in the friendly water to paraphrase mao tse tung loosely this form of activity may lead to the mobilisat ion of the urban population in favour of the insurgency it could in the short term lead to the creation of go areas however these then tend to focus the attention of the authorities on to that par ticular area and in turn could limit the space and cover needed for terrorist activity 15 intelligence the best source of insurgent in telligence is the sympathiser who works in some kind of government employmen t especially in job connected directly with the security forces the police are particular target for insurgent inf iltration information from double agents provides not onl good target intelligence but timely warning of security issue 20 mar 07 3 5 force counter action the media may also contribute to the insurgents information gathering organisation either inadvertently through naive ty or intentionally 16 establishment of an alternative society the insurgents will aim to impose an alternative society their motives may be nationalist an emotive call to patriotism to replace government which is not considered to be ruling in the countrys best interests the insurgents may wish to avoid social upheaval equally such cause may disguise the insurgents real aims of enforcing change in social as well as in foreign policy once the rebels have seized power b religious the remoulding of societ in accordance with more fundamentalist or as some authorities prefer radical religious lines for example ayatollah khomeinis revolu tion in iran during the venteenth century english civil war extreme puritans and levellers wit hin the parliamentaria n ranks sought to impose strict religious observance on this country c political to utilise philosophy diametrically opposed to that in use by existing government this involves cl ash between the left and right wings of the political spectrum firs t propaganda will be used to promot desirable changes and then society will be reconstituted in areas occupied by the insurgents government officials will be forced to flee or be subjected to the summary justice of peoples courts although marxism still has its adher ents the eclipse of the communist party in the former ussr has detracted from its appeal communi st governments have not only fallen in eastern europe but also in central america where the sandinistas have been voted out of office however ndero luminoso is still operating in peru even after the capture of its leader in september 1992 and the khymer rouge are still at large in cambodia d power for its own sake the acquisition of power and control within region has historically been motive for removing the existing state or regional authorities usually based on tribal grou pings an authority is toppled in order for that group to obtain power and then operate the levels of government to its own advantage saddam hussein in iraq is moder n example of this form of motive as are the current leaders in what remains of rwanda there are so many examples from the past china in the days of the wa rlords and ethiopia somalia and sierra leone in modern day africa criminals and mafias criminality exists in all states whether they are well governed or not what differentiates some from others is the d egree and extent of criminality in some states the preval ence of crime corruption and criminal groupings is so long standing that these can seriously destabilise the cohesion of the state while the defeat of criminals and mafia styl groups is properly the responsibility of the government and the police forces th is type of counter criminal activity may well form part of any future counter insurgency campaign and suitable plans may be needed to cater for this additional requirement 17 external support revolutions seldom succeed with out the help of sympathetic power in terms of diplomatic support the suppl of weapons and training assistance there issue 20 mar 07 3 6 are some notable exceptions for example the chinese communist victory over the kuomintang owed little or nothing to the ussr an insurgent movem ent has to appeal to popular sentiment abroad and try to raise sympathy for its cause in the forum of the united nations and such regional organisations as the arab league and the organisation of african states some forei gn governments may be counted upon to give the insurgents open or clandestine support others more hostile to the insurgents has to be constrained from helping the legitimate government by appealing over their heads to the people encouraging political parties friendly trade unions and other pressure groups to organise demonstrations strikes and petitions and the medi to promote the rebel cause are just some of the ways of applying pressure 18 concurrent activity the insurgent leadership w ill aim to wage insurgency on political economic propaganda and litary fronts simultaneously while foreign support is enlisted for the insurgency every effort is made to discredit the government at home and abroad the military struggle will be conducted in the towns and the countryside isolated acts of terrorism will be used where the insurgency is weakest all activity is designed to overturn and embarrass the state to the point where the collapse of authority and control occurs section 4 vulnerable points within an insurgency general 19 there are usually many potential weak points with in an insurgency that are vulnerable to some form of attack and disruption by those w ho plan to oppose them these of course will vary from one in surrection to another but some general pointers are given in the following paragraphs thes potential weaknesses are parti cularly apparent in the early days of any insurgent activity secrecy 20 any group who plan to use force and violence to prosecute their aims requires to adopt secretive and conspiratori approach to their planning and actions this in the first instance can give some form of glamour and attractiveness to those who may join but it can soon become counter productive once an in surgency starts too much secrecy can affect the freedom of action so necessary fo r an insurgency lower confidence in other similar insurgent groups and could lead to serious misunderstanding within the organisation there is balance to be struck between too secretive and clandestine approach to insurgency actions and the need to avoid undue attention by the authorities or rival groups 21 one of the ways to avoid the worst effects of this is to split the organisation into military and political groups as in the case of sinn fein and the provisional ira this could overcome the problems of the more public political aspects of an insurgency and the more clandestine military aspects even this has potential disadvantages in propaganda terms and there could easily be many more potential weak points which are described in subsequent paragraphs which wo uld not stand public scr utiny or concerted pressure from state authorit however excessive secre cy within an organisation can hinder the discussion of ideas plans and projects issue 20 mar 07 3 7 gaining support 22 this follows from the adoption of the mo st appropriate cause on which to base the insurgency if the cause is good and has appeal the insurgency should thri ve if not it will wither rapidly various group ings within the country may hav different views and outlooks requiring different techniques to gain thei r support and indeed possible compromises on the overall aim indifference sloth and neutral attitudes also have to be overcome perhaps by use of the weapon of in timidation in summary t he actual business of gaining popular support for the cause can be difficult and sensitive peri od in the early life of an insurgency publicity whether good or bad can materially improve the prospect of gaining popular support secure operating base 23 serious difficulty can be experienced in th choice of secure base from which to operate an insurgency if the base is too far away from the centres of normal activity it is potentially secure but out of t ouch with the people and vulnerable to isolation too close to the centres of activity make the insurgen cy open to observation and perhaps infiltration and closer also to the mach inery of state control 24 proximity to border regions can often prov useful in that mporary or perhaps permanent bases can be set up beyond the authorit of the state and yet safe enough to avoid the unwanted suspicious of neighbouri ng authority 25 timely resolute action to locate an in surgency base can cause serious disruption to an insurgency movement even if this activity is not entirely successful funding 26 all insurgencies require funding to great er or lesser extent weapons ammunition and expertise have to be paid for and unless the insurgency is backed by friendly nation or individuals who can provide support not great deal will happen taki ng part in criminal activities bank raids and protection could help and these could attrac t publicity albeit unwelcome for the cause l these activities are generally intermittent in their application and effect 27 controlling the rackets and the transporta tion of drugs has proved more enduring source of income but brings the movement into contact with unreliable and vulnerable groups who could attract undue attention from the authorities furthermore the big providers of funding may also have their political price whic h could distort and affect the overall aim of an insurgency 28 lack of sufficient funds could limit the scope of an insurgency and inhibit its prospects of success weakness that the stat authorities could utilise to their advantage if it is recognised financial control and regulation to limit the movement and exchange of goods and funds could be applied particularly if an insurgency is being funded from beyond the state borders issue 20 mar 07 3 8 setting the pace 29 given that insurgents if they have planned properly can control the start of operations and have some measure of control over subsequent activity it is surprising to note that in many insurgencies have failed to capitalise on opportunities or have allowed the pace of events and scope of activities to be dictated by the state authorities momentum is lost the strategic initiative re turns to the state and the insurgent organisation exposed at vulnerab and premature point sometime s an insurgency can overlook the fact that the state authorities can also recognise their own strengths and weaknesses and make moves to improve the position at the same time as the insurgency is starting this can complicate insurgent planning the c ontrol of the pace and timing of insurgency operations is vital to the success of any campaign the difficulty for the insurgent is that he may not have the information needed or the politicalmilitary capability to make the appropriate decisions at the right time as an insurgency escalates all of this requires training and experience and the in surgent leadership may have to accept some reverses in the overall campaign before sufficient expe rience is gained to j udge both the timing and pace of events to gain most advantage informers 30 while informers have sometime s been infiltrated into criminal or insurgent cells it is far more common to achieve success by t urning someone who is already in the organisation or is an auxiliary who has cont act with them eg the couriers cutouts or suppliers who are the links between clandesti ne cells and their accomplices among the public turning is the intelligence rm for persuading such person to become an informer this may be best achieved by spotti ng participant whose heart is not in it or who for personal or family reas ons wants to get off the hook pressure to turn may be exercised by arousing f ear of prosecution or by offeri ng rewards perhaps large enough to enable informers to go far away with their familie s to start new life with new identity an essential feature is that informers are made conf ident that they and t heir families will be protected against retribution there is not hing more demoralising to insurgents than the fear that people inside their movement or trusted supporters among the public are giving information to the state authorities they wil l try to stifle it by ruthless exemplary punishments but this could incr ease the desire of any waverers to get off the hook to avoid being caught between state surv eillance and insurgent reprisal informers and those who turn have always been singularly dangerous to any insurgent movement the problem of changing aims 31 this is not so much of problem at t he start of an insurgency but has potentially damaging effect once an insurgency has been in operation for some time actions and events during the earlier part of an insurgen cy may change the outlook of some groups within the insurgency and caus some disquiet about the ov erall aim series of successes by the state authoritie s or some errors made by insurgent groups could cause some to question the cause or even chal lenge the leadership of the insurgency 32 seemingly generous compromise offered by the state to the in surgents could also cause division within an insurgen cy at any event the insu rgent leaders may have to apply ruthless measures to ensure that unity and secre cy are preserved changing aims even as result of considered and agreed line of action can cause potential trouble for all issue 20 mar 07 3 9 insurgents here secrecy and lack of discu ssion can cause further misunderstanding and suspicion which could lead to defections punishments and loss of confidence in the insurgency as whole conclusions 33 these seven features of vulnerability ar usually regarded as critical for classic insurgency other more modern and up to date developments will ar ise to add to the problems of organising and maintaining an insu rgency but without an over all grip on these listed potential vulnerabilities an insurgency c ould well falter and split apart into rival groupings issue 20 mar 07 3 1 annex to chapter 3 strategic deception the north vietnamese model 1964721 1 although only one fact or among many north vietnam deceptions made an important contribution to their eventual triumph they incl uded the downplaying of the communist character of the north vietnamese regime and its revolu tionary goals and the promotion in its place of nationalist liberation myth t he concealment of northern leadership and invasion of the south the creation of belief in possible compromise settlement the denial of communist atrociti and the propagation in their place of unfounded allegations of am erican genocide or systematic violations of the rules of war guilt transfer to american shoulders of all the blame for the horrors of conflict 2 unlike the experiences of more recent major examples where deception operations have usually been aimed covertly at the opposing leadership to di stort their vision of reality and thus undermine their judgement the nort h vietnamese more often addressed deception overtly to mass audiences in south vi etnam the principal instrument as well as victim was the national liberation front in the west especially in america deception began with the political left and qui ckly spread to the liberal establishment who in due course gained influence over mainstream opinion 3 the choice of target illustrated how well the comm unists understood the vulnerabilities of democracy engaged in pr otracted conflict of apparent peripheral importance the essentia l domino american public opini on was recognised as the key to victory in the field because once this dom ino was knocked down the united states government was powerless to continue the fight 4 the transmission belts for these deceptiv messages were ubiquitous but the main ones were diplomatic the gl obal propaganda network contro lled by the international department cpsu the fronts set up in south vietnam and in the west to promote north vietnams interests and through them and thr ough professional agents of influence such as the international news medi the new york timess acceptance of indochina resource centre material was classic if relative ly unimportant and r outine example of transmission belt in action 5 the character of counter insurgency wa rfare the imperia list connotation of american involvement and the wars protracted and highly political na ture rather easily stimulated traditional liberal guilt over the use of force particula rly in the third world as the conflict wore on without prospect of early victory this latent guilt may have created susceptibility to the themes of american genocide and lawless ness certainly once the antiwar movement was in motion even activi sts who were not communist sympathisers might have felt subconsciously that the grea ter good of ending the war justified the lesser evil of uncritical acceptance of horror storie s of doubtful veracity which might nevertheless be politically effective 6 taken as whole hanois deception operations were re latively easy because they delivered messages their intend ed victims wanted to hear bu t the complex organisation and immense perseverance necessary to penetra the targets were remarkable this strategic deception may have been unique for the sheer scale and audacity of its effort and the resultant effect on the prosecution of the campaign by the americans 1 professor g lewy deception and revolutionary warfare in viewnam issue 20 mar 07 4 1 chapter 4 tactical considerations for an insurgency section 1 background introduction 1 general the essentially violent and destruc tive nature of insurgencies has been described in preceding chapters any insu rgency does however usually move on two concurrent complementary paths one destructive and the other constructive destructive actions are clearly aimed at overthrowing t he established order and creating climate of collapse in the states authority the constructive effor t meanwhile goes to wards creating an organisation which can replace the establishe d authorities at suitable moment even when the insurgency appears to renounce positive organisation and formalised political structures there will usual ly be some political group with the foresight to anticipate the impending vacuum and make some plans to fill i t it is this anticipatory action that marks out the separation between terrorist organisati on and more full blood ied insurgency it is inconceivable to think that the red rmy faction in germany during the 1970s sometimes described as the baadermeinhof group could be scribed as an insurgency beyond terrorism on small and focused scale t hey had further plans to take over from the authorities after op motorman nort hern ireland 1972 the ira ceased to be an insurgency whose aims were to get the british out of northern ireland they did however remain serious terrorist threat for many more years that nee ded to be countered with resolute action by the government and armed forces 2 destructive activity this type of insurgent activity splits into four main types subversion b sabotage of the economic framework where this suits the insurgency c terrorism and guerilla activity d larger scale operations 3 constructive activity where an insurgency is planned in the context of protracted war or where in the more classic case of total revolution in large state the whole apparatus of state cont rol needs changing an insurgency movement would seek to educate and improve the positio n of those in less well developed areas both urban and rural in order to show the practical benefits of joining the insurgency there will also be need to create and develop areas for subversive activity b form cadres for training of all types c organise alternative police and militar units to take over in due course d create administrative machinery to supplant the bureaucracy of the state issue 20 mar 07 4 2 section 2 destructive activity subversion 4 subversive activity is designed to undermine the political economic and military strength of state shor t of the use of force however even nonviolent activities may be exploited to the stage of provoking violent counter measures which can be denounced as an overreaction by the security forces and used to discredit the authorities 5 subversion is more effective in an undemocratic country and in society where there are genuine grievances wide disparities between rich and poor and where ethnic cultural and religious divisions exist in an at mosphere of intolerance democratic society could have less to fear although the propagandist may exploi t its freedoms of speech and association together with flourishing uncensored mass media to gain the maximum publicity for his cause subversive activity 6 this can take many forms some of which constitute legitimate political or industrial activity where the intention to undermine the strength of state is not present examples of subversive activity include activity in the political field an insurgency may be expected to attempt to penetrate existing political parti and organisations at all levels and to develop front organisations meetings rallies or proc essions may be staged the aims and nature of which may well be legal but which nevertheless can have the appearance of challenging and defying the aut hority of government tact ics of this kind may be accompanied by pressure on the threatened government to reduce the use of its armed forces in counter insurgency operations b penetration of the machinery of government an insurgency will seek to win supporters from inside the organs of state control in or der to use them to either find out about future plans or to wreck and hinder future planning at suitable times examples of this are leak ed correspondence knowledge of ministerial movements police and military organisations and plans protective arrangements and any other economic and financial information these ar all useful for an insurgency to exploit as appropriate particularly in th early days of an insurrection c propaganda propaganda is publishing info rmation or misinformation detrimental to the government or the securi ty forces also or iginating and spreading rumours designed to undermine trust and confidence in the government and possibly with stores of atrocities sowing the seeds of hate against the forces of law and order and capitalising on security forces errors d passive resistance passive resistance is achieved by activities such as 1 forcing or encouraging withdrawal of labour from public utilities and services 2 obstruction of the law issue 20 mar 07 4 3 3 sitins in public places 4 fomenting dissatisfaction amongst di fferent social groupings such as workers peasants and students by inciti ng them to demonstrate and strike disruption 7 disruption can involve the organisation of marches and demonst rations to foment riots to cause disruption in order to provok the authorities into some fo rm of physical overreaction b the intimidation of local and provincial leaders magistrates civil and military personnel businessmen and leader s of the local community c raising money by blackmail and intimi dating methods involv ing the control of rackets protection and associated illegal activity sabotage 8 sabotage is disruptive activity designed to further the interests of the insurgency it may be active in which case individuals and bodies of people place themselves outside the law and set out to disrupt impor tant services functions or industrial processes by violent means or it may be passive in which case damage is engineered by omission or neglect active sabotage targets may be selected at random for their political or economic impact or they may fit into wider tactical plan with the aim of increasing general confusion and tying down security forces in the static defence of installations in such circumstances communications sites and stores depots are favourite target because they are general ly widely dispersed and thus make large demands on manpower to guard them bec ause their disruption hampers the authorities and because the results of the damage caused can be readily perceived by the public without causi ng exceptional hardship to t hemselves other suitable targets are bridges roads railways telephone lines military supply dumps sewers power lines water supplies and transport targets whose destruction might cause mass unemployment and thereby lose the goodwill of the people are in general avoided b passive sabotage passive sabotage is generally aimed at causing disorder and disruption by deliberate error contriv ed accident absenteeism or strikes the target can be industry public services supp lies or the security forces although isolated instances of passive sabotage can be effective for example an important telephone exchange could be made inoperative it is more usual for action to be planned on wide scale across the region thr ough political front organisations sabotage of it facilities 9 although not yet known to have been utilised before the prevalence of computers in business and the growing number of it system s controlled by computers power stations emergency services has enhanced the potentia l for active or passive sabotage in this issue 20 mar 07 4 4 area this can be easily done by the insertion of suitable computer viruses into network to cause delay loss of data corruption and sometimes complete dysfunction while this may require careful planning to work effectivel the destructive dividend for an insurgency of this potential has grown eno rmous in states where the computer has become part of every day life terrorism 10 general terrorism is technique killing one to frighten ten thousand is used by revolutionaries insurgents and by political ac tivists of the left or right for their own purposes terrorism may be defined as the us of indiscriminate violence to intimidate the general majority of people in state to acc ept the political changes advocated by the insurgents terror is one of the insurgents main weapons to preserve their security by frightening individuals from passi ng information to the security forces religion may also be used to control individual behavi our through fear of ostracism or as an instrument of terror to justify murder in this world and eterna l damnation in the next terror can be used tactically to provide publicity for the insurgen t movement induce or sense of insecurity and discredit the authorities the last two aims may be achieved by overstretching the security forces so that they are manifestly unable to provide effective protection for prominent citizens the public and property and by provoking the governmen t and its security forces to overreact in response to some outrageous act of terrorism 11 intimidation intimidation as means of existi ng social and political pressure can take many forms but is normally used in one of three separate ways to extort support from the uncommitted to demoralise t hose who are loyal to the state authorities and to maintain discipline within the ranks of the insurgency movement 12 terrorism against loyal and uncommitted citizens the target may be an individual or group and the vict ims are often citizens to whom the ordinary inhabitants of the state look for leadership and example such as politicians professional men and industrial commercial and union leaders this terrorism may take the form of beatings kidnappings blackmail mutilati on assassination arson or bomb ing threats of terrorism may be used to coerce individuals into obeying insurgent instructions 13 terrorism to enforce obedience and discipline absolute loyalty is an inflexible principle for insurgencies and terror is used to ensure obedience in the case of the individual it is made clear t hat even though person has been forcibly drafted into the movement their defection is pu nishable by death or mutilati on and even if they should escape to an area free from insurgency control retribution could be expected from their family in areas which are under insurgency control terrorism may be directed against sections of the population who because of race class origin s wealth or employment are judged to be progovernment in surgent leaders usually endeav our to involve the local inhabitants in acts of terrorism thus ensuring their association with the uprising and to have good personal reasons to ensure its success 14 interfactional strife terrorism used in interfactional strife is an ex tension of that already discussed the aim being to drive members of an opposing faction out of particular area thus more closely identifying those who remain with the movement this can be double edged weapon in that it may result in backl ash from the opposing faction that could have deleterious effect on the conduct of the insurgency at time when more issue 20 mar 07 4 5 support is needed it can also be exploited by the state authorit ies in propaganda terms at any event the weapon of interfactional strife if carried too far can quickly result in the loss of control by an insurgency group and thus allow t he authorities the opportunity to regain the initiative on the backs of an outraged community 15 proxy operations countries wishing to press caus but without incurring the risk of war use terrorist groups whose links with t he government are difficult to prove iran and syria back hezbollah and amal respectively some states use assassination squads to liquidate exiles opposed to their regimes who have fled abroad for example from libya large scale operations 16 large scale insurgent operations do not rmally occur in the early stage of any insurgency while steps are being taken to enhanc and educate or terrorise the population into supporting the insurgency the acquisition of safe areas of terr itory is usually the hallmark of developing insurgency as was the case in nepal recently once this stage has been reached urban and rural larger scale and coordinated operations can begin these could be constrained by th lack of resources weapons money and logistic support and may well depend on how successful some of these operations are in more recent times it is becoming more apparent that lar ge scale insurgent operations may not be so necessary as in the past with the use of modern technology insur gents are more able to hit high value government targets with few res ources but much planning the attack on 10 downing street although it failed had an effect beneficial for the ira quite disproportionate to its actual prosecution section 3 constructive activity general 17 early signs an indicator of an incipient insur gency may be attempts to raise funds in the early stages this will probably be covert and criminal eg armed bank robberies or control of drug runners subsequently the polit ical organisation within the insurgency will take on the task of extracting aid from well intentioned charitable and philanthropic organisations and from sympathisers abroad the more violent meth ods may continue the extorting of ransom from individuals ki dnapping or from governments hijacking and perhaps the enforced levying of taxes on intimidated sections of the population although this would run counter to the aim of constructive activity see also chapter 2 for aspects of fund raising which could give rise to vulnerabilities within the insurgency 18 politics and organised crime there are some criminal organisations whose main aim is the control of profitable illegal trade such as the nar cotics traffic for example the colombian cali drug cartel use can be made of money laundered from terrorist sponsored rackets front firms and even st ock markets to finance an insurrection in pursuit of their political ends some organisations may become so powerful politically that they may be in position to threaten weak government or at least to oblige it to tolerate its illeg activities the mafia appears to exercise pervasive infl uence in sicily and southern italy where politicians judges and senior policemen who th wart its crimes and br ing the mafia members of cosa nostra to justice are ruthlessly mu rdered or intimidated the tongs play similar role with the overseas chinese communities issue 20 mar 07 4 6 arms and equipment 19 weapons many insurgents favour basic weapons whose essentials have not changed very much since the 1970s the features of compactness lethality and simple operating procedures have attract ed insurgents the world over in recent times weapons and bombs have been miniaturised explosives are harder to detect and more lethal in their composition and timing devices constructed to extent the range of potential targets these are designed to defeat detecti on and aid insurgent security hand held missiles small enough to conceal in small space can be utilised to br ing accurate fire on armoured vehicles aircraft and helicopters t he main categories are likely to be personal weapons principally pistols carbines rifles and weapons with high rate of fire sniper rifles utilising armour piercing ammunition are also very popular particularly in rural areas si gnificant developments are the use of the controlled burst setting between single shots and automatic fire where the weapon fires short but controlled burst of ammunition before the kick effect comes into action weapons made completely from non metallic material are being developed to avoid detection at airports etc although there are serious technical snags to overcome before production can start b ammunition most insurgent groups use 9 mm ammunition for shorter range weapons and calibres around 762 mm for rifles and machine guns however caseless ammunition if developed would aid the insurgent enormously lighter weight and evidence left for forensic teams to analyse c sighting devices night vision equipmentinfrar ed ir image intensification it and thermal imagery will have an increasing infl uence on the number of weapons that can be used in defence or ttack the same applies for laser sights which could enable an insurgent to fire weapon from suitca without appearing to be holding gun d mortars improvised mortars are easy to make but are usually inaccurate and unreliable most require some form of flat bed for transportation acquisition of military mortars and ammunition would significantly increase the range and lethality of such weapons antiarmour weapons both recoilless weapons and armour piercing rifles may be used and there is likely to be an increased emphasis on rockets probably fired from nonmetallic launchers f portable ground to air missiles the handheld suitcase type of air defence weapon with heatseeking or simp guidance system is particularly suitable for insurgency use even the acknowledged possession of air defence weapons by an insurgent gr oup is likely to hinder an d obstruct the full use of helicopters by the state authorities g mines this term covers military mines as opposed to home made devices which are covered in the next sub military mines both ant i personnel and anti tank mines are frequently utilised by insur gent groups to destroy roads bridges railway lines and other suitable ta rgets mines are easy to acquire difficult to detect issue 20 mar 07 4 7 and sometimes difficult to dismantle they can seriously hamper the efforts of the counter insurgency forces and terrify the local population once campaign has ended the clearance of minefield s becomes priority target for any government h improvised explosi ve devices ieds explosive devices of many types both commercial and improvised are usually available to insurgency forces methods of initiation are nowadays highly varied and include the suicide bomber the effectiveness of these as instruments of terror is well known and expertise in their manufacture and handling is often of high order while complicated fusing and antilifting devices are often available from international arms sources i hoaxes these are used more widely than real ieds to disrupt commercial and social life and to stretch army and police resources the insurgent has merely to plant sufficient real ieds in order to ensure that the security forces and the public cannot afford to ignore any warning j lures any incident bomb or hoax can be used as bait particularly to kill security force eod specialists 20 chemical and ra diological devices in theory nuclear chemical or biological device could be made by well financed insurgency group for delivery perhaps by ship to port with the threat of trigger ing the device if dem ands are not met by particular deadline however in addition to the difficulty of manufacture and delivery of such weapon any resultant tonation whether intended or t could be so disastrous for an insurgent cause that many governments woul d find it difficult to believe the threat and act accordingly threats involving these weapons are also far less credible and thus less effective as bargaining counter neverthel ess modified form of chemical attack is entirely feasible given the pr oliferation of information and chnical knowledge available further points are nuclear of increasing state concern is t he deliberate or accidental release of much lower quantities of radioactive ma terial than would be produced by military nuclear device in any incident this c ould enhance the credibility given to an insurgent group if such device we re used or threatened by them b biological biological weapons bw are becoming increasingly usable in military terms and have the potential for effect at the strategic level many of the less developed countries depend on mono cultures such as rice maize or wheat as the mainstay of the economy t hese are potentially vulnerable to bw attack bw could cause as many casualties as nuclear explosion while avoiding the latters collateral damage the very high toxicity of some biological agents lend themselves to covert use bw attack may also be extremely difficult for the targeted government to attribute c chemical chemical weapons cw are easie r for an insurgent to acquire than nuclear and biological w eapons but the scope for us of cw will be much smaller in terms of the area affected but the casualties caused could be massive cw may have considerable ps ychological effects which may have significant effect if the targeted government is sufficiently weak cw generally offers more casualtiesforcost than does high explosive the use of sarin in tokyo during 1995 issue 20 mar 07 4 8 only serves to highlight the potential use of such lethal chemical agents and there is some evidence that ricin and other eas ily obtained fertilizers and chemicals are being experimented with by cells of terrorists in the uk and usa in the recent past section 4 insurgent tactics in rural environment general 21 since the dissolution of the ussr the opportunity for insurgency in rural and undeveloped areas has increased enormously and although the classic maoist style of insurgency involving the peasants is not now gener ally applicable insurgencies in rural and remote areas could easily flare up again t he allocation of land water or other scarce mineral resources continues to provide real or perceived grievance particularly in areas where there is burgeoning population such as gaza and the west bank of the jordan bangladesh and parts of the caucasus area 22 while the political organi sation of an insurgency concentrates on mobilising popular support for the cause openly in areas distant fr om government control more covertly in areas where the government still exercises effective authority bases will be established in remote areas from these minor acti ons which may be mistaken for banditry are launched over as wide an area as possible to disperse polic resources amongst other indications that campai gn is about to begin area the preparation of isolated villages for defence incl uding the discreet clearance of fields of fire under the pr etext of protection against banditry b the hoarding of supplies and the preparat ion of caches outside villages for the future use of insurgents c the training and arming of village s elfdefence groups and small military style units d an increase in the scale and degree of local intimidation and coercion particularly in the production of goods and services 23 all these activities could easily appl in present day af ghanistan where taliban forces are bidding to dominate rura l areas and control the drugs trade tactics 24 general in its early stages an insurgency in rural areas has to rely on small bands of men assembling for limited enterprise pr obably of sabotage against some fairly remote and inadequately guarded bridge pylon or railway line as the movement grows to the stage where it can command significant support from the loca l population so its objectives will become more ambitious and larger bodies of men will be necessary to achieve these the relative strength of insur gent bands will always place them at disadvantage visavis the security forces and they will seek to av oid pitched battle their tactics are therefore based on mobility and surprise generally using ambushes explosives and ieds issue 20 mar 07 4 9 25 mobility mobility may be achieved on foot by using vehicles technicals trucks and bicycles where these are inconspicuous or by using animal transport in less undeveloped countries etc the pr inciple is to assemble fo rce and its weapons carry out an operation and then disperse the great er the scope of the operation and the consequent size of the force the more t horough will be the preparati on planning may need to cover such matters as the concentration of heavy weapons and munitions liaison with other groups through whose area force may have to move etc 26 the use of terrain rural populations are vulnerable to terrorism and intimidation and very quickly feeling of insecurity can spread around region which makes both individuals and communities feel isolated and cut off savage treatment given to local government official or his family has serious unsettling effect around the whole region recent experience suggests that this type of in timidation could be on t he increase in many rural areas bosnia sudan somalia kash mir and afghanistan can be cited as examples of places where this type of terrorism is rampant 27 the achievement of surprise some of the methods used are diversionary action designed to attr act security forces elsewhere b deception which may be initiated by feeding false information through sympathisers already infiltrated into the government intelligence machine it would be sensible to support this by diversiona ry tactic to protect the informant and give credence to the deception c attacks in areas thought to be safe by the authorities prob ably mounted from distance and relying on swift approach march d insurgent bands may sometimes rge into the population in an area adjacent to selected target then ssemble quickly strike and disperse 28 ambush the most widely used insurgent ta ctic the ambush is particularly effective against road movement especially w hen the ground makes it difficult for military forces to move off the road and take cover insurgents favour two main types of ambush hit and run ambush usually undertaken by locally based insurgents it relies on the devastating effect of well directed opening volley and surprise to cause sufficient casualties and disorganisati on to delay the security forces response in order to cover the withdrawal as t he aim is confined to causing casualties inducing general sense of insecurity dam aging morale and gr abbing any weapons which can be picked up without ri sk the insurgents do not usually deploy rear stop this type of ambush can be deployed an ywhere in city town or countryside insurgent strengths can vary from two to three armed persons or up to fifteen or twenty persons depending on the circumstances b annihilation ambush small scale annihilation ambushes may be sprung by the insurgents against medium sized curity force targets and large scale ambushes against large formations as the in surgency gains strength they may be mounted against even larger forces during any subsequent more conventional war phase the latter ambush may cover 1 to 5 kilometre stretch of road the issue 20 mar 07 4 10 principles for both sizes of ambush are th same the ambush force consists of front and rear blocking parties an attack fo rce deployed in appropriate positions on the road and fire support group section 5 insurgent tact ics in an urban environment the urban environment 29 in the last two decades of the 20th c entury there have been many examples of insurgency in urban environments the long running insurgency of the pira in the reasonably small but populated area of northern ireland is sufficient example to show that insurgency tactics in urban areas can thrive 30 state may either be too small or lack sufficiently i naccessible terrain such as mountains forests and swamps to sustain rural insurgency on large enough scale to defeat the authorities however urban civilization in west ern europe parts of asia and south america is vulnerable to provide relative ly small insurgent forces with the opportunity to create an atmosphere of serious alarm and insecurity sufficient to discredit government urban insurgents do not normally plan to occupy and control territory although they may seize small areas for limited time to establish presence it is frequently possible to control an area without occupying it nevertheless insurgents could well receive support from these enclave s where their political suppor ters form majority of the population as witnessed in the s adr city area of baghdad and basra 31 lacking the ability as sometimes the need to occupy territory on significant scale insurgents will aim to make the governments position untenable they will rely on engendering state of warw eariness frustration and anger against government emergency measures to bring bout climate of collapse so that people will rally to any organisation or strong man who offers stability action may include disrupting routine city life b damaging parts of the economy and obliging the government to pay compensation on scale it cannot afford c discrediting the security forces by alienating the public and provoking the police and army into overreacting this is more likely and more dangerous in the economy of onecrop state d undermining the morale of politicians civil service judiciary and the security forces eliminating informers f assassinating public figures g establishing nogo areas to demons trate the governments impotence such as those temporarily established by pi ra during 1972 in belfast and londonderry issue 20 mar 07 4 11 h persuading sympathetic foreign states to bring pressure to bear on the government urban tactics 32 cities and towns provide great scope for insu rgencies the concentration of large number of people in relatively small area provides cover for th insurgents maos fish moreover the needs of great city related to the complexity of urban living whereby interruption of power supplies noncollection of rubbish cutting off water etc can soon bring community almost to its knees howe ver the insurgent may only find support in certain areas of the towns or cities 33 the urban insurgent ther efore lives in community which is friendly to him or at the least is too frightened to withhold its support close to his leaders and fellow insurgents and with the tools of terrorism at hand local communication system can be engineered fairly easily and women and children can be used both to operate this and to provide cover for other activities 34 the urban insurgent can operate more bo ldly than his rural counterpart for these reasons and his tactics reflect this the sn iper complements the more conventional ambush and often replaces it and explosive dev ices can be used in wide variety of ways either as instruments of comm unal terror or more selectively against individuals or groups there is ample scope for t he propaganda ambush whereby inci dents marches protests sniping etc are deliberately staged to achi eve propaganda objectives detrimental to the security forces 35 the concentration of populati on in the city is important to an insurgent for two further reasons the ready availability of large numbers of people means that crowd can be assembled and demonstrations engineered with comparative ease these can then be manipulated the presence of wo men and children will normally be an embarrassment to the security forces par ticularly if the monstration is stage managed to cause over reaction by the secu rity forces against such group it could be argued that the presenc of women and children lows for the peaceful democratic process to operate b publicity is easily achieved in city as major incident can be concealed even if it is not widely reported on televi sion and in the press terrorist successes can therefore be readily exploited both to increase the impact of terror and to discredit the security forces their methods and the quality of the protection which they can provide 36 within an urban environment an insurgent can plan and execute large variety of tasks designed to publicise the cause and embarrass the state authorities hostage taking became fashionable in beirut du ring the 1980s and is now widely used all over the world kidnapping of civic and local leaders is another ploy carried out by hezbollah against the israeli authorities and which has been counter ed by abductions and arrest of leaders or clerks associated with the insurgents issue 20 mar 07 4 12 ethnic cleansing 37 ethnic cleansing is an insidious form of terror which has been operated in various forms over many centuries both in europe and the middle east ther are many examples of this type of activity thr oughout history when majority of the surrounding population wish to frighten and intimidate people into leav ing their homes and rritory and moving elsewhere in terms of cr eating human misery ethnic cle ansing is one of the most loathsome of all forms of terrorism and is rmally the basis for future unrest and potential insurgency in the area the roots of the civil war in greec and the growth of communism in the region grew out of the deliberate shift of populati ons between greece and turkey in the aftermath of the first world war furthermore the usual lack of any subsequent administration to provide long term accommodat ion and work for the uprooted refugees causes discontent and anger palestinian ref ugees fall into the same category as well as refugees from iraq and in the darfur region of the sudan section 6 insurgent communications general 38 there has been such development of voice and text communications in the western world that the older more traditional methods for insurgents to communicate have been largely overtaken and replaced mobile phones xt messages and the use of the internet have become the communication of c hoice for insurgents and because of this instant communication between cells and groups of insurgents is now fact of life there is still relevance in recording few of the more traditional methods because most current insurgents now plan to avoi d using mobile phones where possible to avoid technical detection by western armies who have had some success in utilising technology to locate and attack insurgents passing information 39 general in some states the security forces can readily gain control of most public communications systems such as radio stations telephone exchanges and post offices and thus an insurgency organisation may have considerable problems in disseminating information and issuing orders particularly as movement initially depends on only few trained leaders whose identit and whereabouts woul d be kept secret two ways of overcoming the problem are t he cell system and dead letter boxes 40 the cell system an insurgency is often split up into numerous cells each with leader and containing only few say three to five members know only each other and their own leader while the leader know s only one person outside the ce ll who in turn knows only one member of the district or regional organisation and so on up the scale there is virtually lateral communication in this organisation variat ions of the cell system may be devised for greater security by using couriers and dead letter boxes for example cut out courier may be used to collect from one dead letter box and deliver to another thus messages can be carried over risky link in the system by man or woman who has information except that they collect seal ed package from one place and leave it in another issue 20 mar 07 4 13 41 dead letter boxes dead letter box is simply hiding place for letters deposited by one person and collected by another some gener principles which govern selection of such places and at the same time are guide to the security forces when they search for them are the dead letter box is usually sited in an area where courier has good reason to go b it must be possible to deposit or retrieve messages quickly c the location must be simple to described accessible and easy to find d there must be simple but effectiv system for indicating that there is message to be collected 42 political literature political manifestos magazines posters and circulars may be used to convey instructions to cells at fi rst sight these documents may appear to be more than vague aims without dat or times however an analysis of incidents in insurgent campaigns shows that they can provide an indicati on of trends and intentions since in some respects they equate to operati on orders issued by the c entral organisation insurgent and terrorist activities depend more upon opportunity than ming and therefore there is programme such literature can lis t targets allocate re sources and lay down the period in which certain aims are to be ac hieved the importance of such documents when captured should not be u nderrated most of these activities have been replaced by much more use of television channels and the internet to spread the message 43 television almost every insurgent group has used television directly to promote their cause or indirectly by means of ens uring that incidents are newsworthy enough to ensure that they are reported on television it is coincidence that the steep rise in terrorist and insurgent action has taken place at the same time as the growth in television the distribution of video tapes can also enormously enhance an insurgent cause particularly when television channels are closely controlled or even censored 44 internet modern insurgent groups make extens ive use of the cyberspace the internet as an efficient and relatively secure method of communication the internet is not only used as means of communication between various members of an insurgent group or other insurgent groups but is also used as part of their information operations the use of cyberspace will continue to increa and detailed examin ation will be included in the rewrite of this afm in 2007 issue 20 mar 07 5 1 chapter 5 contemporary insurgency section 1 developments 1 quick review of the international scene on any given day will confirm that while many states are not at war t hey are also not at peace ye t so familiar is the shadow of political violence and terrorism that most peopl are only shocked from complacency by particularly dramatic and thus ne wsworthy outrage at time of continuing defence cuts in the west insurgency is on the increase both elsewhere and in the west host of groups and some states are using it to alter the political landscape in their region over the last two decades the number of international terrori st incidents has risen from 200 per year to over 800 insurgency which has traditionally posed degree of threat to individual governments and states now has an internat ional dimension combined with religious overtones this remains and is estimated to continue to be the most prevalent form of conflict and source of human suff ering for some time to come 2 yet despite the continuing utility of insurgent tactics nd their perceived successes by the end of the 20th century the sense of militar impotence in the west generated by failures in vietnam and else where had waned after the gulf war of 1991 terrorism in some more liberal states whilst proving surpri singly resilient was largely under control governments and people in the west were reaching the pragmatic conclusion that insurgents like the poor would always be with them but that they posed little real direct danger to well established democratic gover nments indeed some have been tempted to suggest that the study of counter revolutionary warfare as it was previously labelled belonged to bygone era and was largely i rrelevant although half recognising that insurgent tactics have been changing over t he last decade and that society had become more prone and vulnerably to these changes section 2 society and insurgency 3 in society the technol ogical revolution continued abated and by t he end of the century only some 20 of workers will be actively involved in production processes whilst the remainder were involved in service industri of one sort or another and working much shorter hours the river of information which began to be available in every house and workplace has become flood access to levision cable programmes and satellites mostly in pictorial form provides greater ch ances for individuals and groups to manipulate the emotions of the public at large the opportunities for propaganda by official sources commercial interests and determined minorit groups is and will be almost unbounded 4 the large networks of ectronic dataprocessing and communications are already shaping the future of this new society and ready these interdependent service industries are vulnerable to attack from hackers fraudst ers and extortionists computer centres could become objects of sabotage or attack software is open to disruption manipulation or espionage and the complete duplication of assets and resources is often prohibitively expensive cable and radio communicati on can be intercepted and although there are antidotes for this such as the use of codes secure transmissions and fibre optic cables the risk of losing overall security can still be high issue 20 mar 07 5 2 5 electronic transfer of cash is now comm on place and there will be less money being held or disbursed around the market place opportunities for theft and robbery could decline to be replaced by computer fraud and ex tortion by threat of kidnap murder and destruction of software or computer component s disposal of funds by laundering them through legitimate deposits or by purchasin g drugs or arms is an expanding business 6 in recent years there has been spate of car bombs placed by terrorists within city centres or at well known institutions with the direct aim of disrupting financial and commercial centres of business arrests and c onvictions are the best det errent to this new extension of terrorist activity but the publicity surrounding bomb ttacks and the growing use of an economic form of insurgency to achi eve quick political results is bound to be attractive to insurgents world wide in ad dition the use of people by insurgents for the purpose of hijack hostage ta king or kidnap for intimida tion in world of instant communication can radically alter the prop aganda prospects of minority group seeking attention for their cause section 3 recent trends 7 contemporary events have conspired to ma ke nation states more aware of this growing problem the end of th cold war may have removed t he threat of global nuclear war but it has created secu rity environment in which the ri sks of insurgent conflict are potentially greater and more di verse than ever prior to 1989 the international order was ideologically divided but reasonably stable it was an order which allowed competition on the fringes but gave little or scope for manoeuv re at the centre europe the potential battleground if the cold war had turned hot with its colonial empires gone experienced period of peace unprec edented in modern history but des pite the misplaced optimism of the early 1990s viable new world order has yet emerged instead new causes methods opportunities and sponsors for politic ally inspired violence abound both in europe and elsewhere 8 in parallel technological advances and the lowering of national bo rder controls within europe have created many more vu lnerabilities which the insurg ent can exploit as has been shown in section 2 deve loping communications mean t hat the media and individual groups even those elements of it which are pot entially friendly to state authority can bring the impact of insurgency into homes worl dwide and live providi ng the insurgent with free international public platform insu rgency has become dramat ic entertainment because viewers rapidly become jaded insu rgents are driven to seek ever greater spectacular success to make news lockerb ie the brighton bombing the world trade centre and obviously 911 and 7 7 attacks are cases in point as result both civil and military policymakers can be subjected to enormous pre ssures from national and international public opinion whose knowledge is inevitably based only on the circumstantial evidence that the media bestows 9 although america and russi have reduced their sponsors hip of insurgent clients there are numerous other sources of support some governments conduct campaigns of undeclared proxy insurgent style warfare as deliberate arm of foreign policy the syrian and iranian examples spring to mind putting political motives to one side there is commercial aspect thriving international rms market provides certain states with lucrative profits and much needed hard currency the easy availa bility of modern weapons has increased the range accuracy and lethality of insurgent attacks issue 20 mar 07 5 3 10 it is relatively cheap form of warfare and also one which can be lucrative for those involved under the cover of terrorism protection rackets and smuggling have become shadow industries in many states organised crime in russia and its potential links with the illegal export of nuclear material to terrorist groups poses the greatest single threat to the security of other states the drugs industry in latin america has formed complex triangular relationship with both go vernment forces and insurgents in peru and bolivia this is now mirrored in afghanistan over protra cted period of time the contesting sides in an insurgency may even form bizarre adversarial partnership insurgent leaders get rich or achieve status which woul d otherwise be denied them as common criminals whilst counter insurgency commanders s ee their own organisations gr ow in size importance and influence within the state narcotics clearly post threat to british national interests and those of weaker friendly states the govern ment is already involved in this undeclared war in many ways and narcodiplomacy could well in volve the greater use of the armed forces in the future 11 perhaps of more immediate concern the breakup of the warsaw pact and the soviet union and the disintegrati on of its sphere of influence has led to the release of long suppressed ethnic and religious t ensions in the balkans nationalism has erupted into civil war the brutality of which has shocked the liberal democracies to the south the spread of radical fundamentalism in algeria turkey and eg ypt contributes to regional instability and adds to potential tide of exil and refugees migrants moving from eastern europe the near east and north africa who some pr edict are beginning to become serious immigration problem for western europe 12 the shadowy links between certain terrorist groups and states could indicate some kind of international form of international insurgency fought by those who do not necessarily share cultural perceptions of ra tionality and fair play compounding the problem the spectre of mass migration has ready contributed to po litical resurgence of the racist right vigilantes and death squads long hazardous f eature of political life in other regions have reappeared in parts of eu rope arms proliferation the potential availability of pgms and in particular the prospect of the use of weapons of mass destruction of one type of another necessitate close and continuous assessment of the risk posed by insurgents wherever they operate section 4 conclusions 13 up to now and in the appropriate circum stances the uk government has wished to have its armed forces available for use in the international arena this clearly leads to involvement in different types of conflict and probably contact with variety of disparate groups of protagonists such c ontact may not necessarily involv direct confrontation but could occur whilst operating der international mandates or during an intervention in regions where insurgency and civ il disorder are rife the ar my in conjunction with the other two services and coalit ion allies has been called upon to provide advice support or overt assistance to state threatened by some form of insurgency nd this will doubt continue in the next few years 14 in other situations some of the principles and tactics of counter insurgency could also be applicable for instance in period of fragile peace after war when the civil administration in defeated or liberated country has broken down or in peace support operation when armed factions interrupt hum anitarian relief or ttack peacekeepers issue 20 mar 07 5 4 troops may need to employ selectively the relev ant coin tactics and tech niques while this is sensitive political area it is practical aspect of modern soldering that merits objective consideration in the field ne at doctrinal distinctions and defi nitions will become blurred to be ready to confront insurgency and its im pact in any and all of its new and complex forms at short notice and in wide variet of environments dem ands clear overall understanding of the relev ant issues this also requires some useful analytical tools to measure the situation and provide some practi cal counter measures only by monitoring events and carefully analysing possible new tr ends will commanders and staff officers be able to direct their thought to m eet the likely demands of any fu ture crisis it is in this modern milieu that the military pl anner has to consider the part that the army plays within the overall strategy to counter the improved ability of an insurgent to act on global or regional scale in the glare of an international audience issue 20 mar 07 part b counter insurgency issue 20 mar 07 strategic considerations issue 20 mar 07 b 1 1 chapter 1 aspects of the law section 1 the legal background introduction 1 the two parts of this publication deal with insurgency and countering insurgency in generic military terms the pr inciples both strategic and operatio nal covered in this second part could apply to any situation involved with c ounter insurgency whether it occurs in the uk or abroad 2 however the legal framework in which these military operations take place could differ significantly from place to place and commanders at all levels will have to be aware of the precise legal conditions that pertain for any military operations contemplated the position is this in whatever capacity troops are em ployed they must always operate within the law b if the conflict is inter national then the in ternational law of armed conflict1 loac must be observed and followed c if the operations fall short of internat ional armed conflict t hen the domestic ie internal law of the state in which the operations occur together with any provisions of international law1 that bind any parties to that operation must be followed d protocol ii to the geneva conventions of 1949 adopted in 197 7 and ratified in 1995 is intended to apply to internal armed conf licts but its application is specifically excluded in situations of internal disturba nces and tensions such as riots isolated and sporadic acts of violence and acts of similar nature 3 the full range of operations in which troops could be invo lved is shown below this has been extracted from volume ii of the manual of military law with slight amendment to illustrate these important and sa lient features of the law and its application in conflict 1 international treaties aimed at protecting human rights and article 3 which is common to all four geneva conventions of 1949 issue 20 mar 07 b 1 2 spectrum of military op erations and the law passive defence of military installations sporadic acts of violence riots counter terrorist operations counter insurgency civil war internal armed conflict war between states international armed conflict domestic law international law of human rights limited application of loac art 3 of geneva conventions 1949 international law of armed conflict 4 in this part of the publication military pr inciples operational proc edures and practices are explained but it has to be clearly understood that some or all of these techniques and practices may not be legally available for us in any particular situation this depends entirely on the legal st atus of the troops involved and the overall rules and constraints under which they are operating it would be pl ainly illegal for troops when responding to domestic riot at the request of the local police to establish ambush positions with view to killing those attempting to leave the area an ambush of this type would be feasible and legally supportable in situation of international armed conflict section 2 rules of engagement guidance for commanders 5 it is thus vital for commander to k now what law applies in given set of circumstances and what it is that triggers any changes in the law to be applied the answer to this type of question relates directly to t he sort of rules of engagement roe that would be issued by the ministry of defence 6 jsp398 is the joint service manual wh ich provides the gr ound rules and procedures for the incorporation and applicati on of particular roe to suit the prevailing circumstances 7 uk government ministers provide politic direction and guidance to commanders by means of roe which govern the application of force it follows that such rules which are approved by ministers may only be changed by nisterial authority commanders will in turn wish to issue roe to their subordinates these roe will be cast within the discretion allowed in the rules approved by ministers 8 roe define the degree and manner in which force ma be applied and are designed to ensure that such application of force is ca refully controlled roe are not intended to be used to assign specific tasks or as means of issuing tactical instructions in passing orders to subordinates commander at any leve l must always act within the roe received but is not bound to use the full extent of the permission granted issue 20 mar 07 b 1 3 9 roe are usually written in the form of prohibitions or permissions when they are issued as prohibitions they will be orders to commanders not to take certain designated actions when they are issued as permissions they will be guidanc to commanders that certain designated actions may be taken if the commanders judge them necessary or desirable in order to carry out their assigned tasks the roe are thus issued as set of parameters to inform commander s of the limits of constr aint imposed or of freedom permitted when carrying out their assigned tasks the conformity of any action with any set of roe in force does not guarantee its wfulness and it remains the commanders responsibility to use only that degree of forc which is necessary reasonable and lawful in the circumstances political policy indicators ppi 10 political policy roe authorising messages from t he mod will contain guidance on government policy to assist commanders to plan and react responsibly as situation develops this guidance will comprise polit ical policy indicator ppi and an amplifying narrative which would describe government in tentions the three ppis are as follows alfa deescalation play down t he issue as much as possible b bravo maintenance of the status quo c charlie risk of escalation acceptable t ake the initiative within the rules in force even if this involves esca lating the level of confrontation 11 procedures there are rules and procedures concerning the applicat ion of roe as situation develops these are listed in jsp 398 roe are app lied to all arms of the three services and to all environments air land sea and subsurface when uk forces are called upon to operate in conjunction with forces of other nat ions operating under different roe mod would attempt to harm onise the different sets of rules subject to british ministerial approval national forces under comm and or control of or other international or multinational agencies ma operate under roe issued by that agency in some circumstances national amplifyi ng instructions may be iss ued otherwise uk national roe will apply theatre of operations 12 every theatre in which uk forces operate will have particular roe profile however within large theatre it may be necessary to i ssue different profiles covering smaller areas to forces that are operating under sign ificantly different circumstances it may also be necessary to issue different roe pr ofiles to forces carrying out different roles nevertheless in any given area of operation uk forces having similar role would normally operate under identical roe section 3 the status of forces legal expressions 13 general this section does not attempt to define all the better known legal expressions that may be encou ntered during counter insur gency campaign there are issue 20 mar 07 b 1 4 however legal expressions that are fundament to any military under standing of the legal circumstances in which troops are deployed 14 jurisdiction this term determines who has the legal power to try an individual in any particular circumstances where soldie rs are employed abroad this fundamental question should be resolved by status of forc agreement sofa or memorandum of understanding mou between governments or possibly by an exchange of letters between governments in the unlikely sit uation where there is an absence of any agreement of this type the local civil and crimi nal courts would have exclusive jurisdiction the implications of this could be far reaching particularly for british troops in areas where the rule of law has collapsed or cannot be proper ly implemented 15 status of forces agreement sofa in amplification of 14 sofa covers the terms of employment for troops overseas their legal status operational aims use of weapons and other agreements or restraints upon their use the document is usually endorsed at government level and its content s should be passed to the military commander as soon as it has been agreed preferably before any troops r each the area of operations mous or an exchange of lette rs are other lesser forms of the same document and consequently are less legally binding in courts of law it should be noted that any agreement by state to allow british troops to be tried under their own legal codes does not automatically authorise br itish commanders to try soldiers in that state under british law and hence the mml this has to be agreed specifically 16 united nations operations the legal status of forc operating in support of the united nations should be secu red by legal instrument with the host government the type of agreement depends on the degree of accord between the states in dispute and with the united nations c ontributing states also negotiate agreements with the united nations secretariat covering such subjects as t he role planned for the troops disciplinary and financial arrangements 17 other legal references chapter 5 of vol ii of the mml covers many other terms that would have legal va lidity in any counter insurgency sit uations in the uk it also cites suitable examples from case law to indicate to commanders and staff officers the authority and binding nature of the law nd of its restraints and qualif ications vol iii of the mml provided similar expressions definitions and examples from case law of the legal position for troops abroad although this has now been superseded by jsp 383 the joint service manual of the law of armed conflict 2004 which covers legal aspects of international armed conflict of particular interest for land commanders are the last three chapters of the jsp chapters 14 15 and 16 those of the applicability of loac to peace support operations dealing with inter nal armed conflict and the enforce ment of the law of armed conflict summary 18 the five preceding paragraphs are suffici ent to show that it would be prudent for legal advice to be available to commander and staff officers on full time basis once operations to counter insurgency are set in hand the law differs from state to state the law changes to reflect developments in society and the implications of international treaty obligations human rights law and conventions on the use of some weapons all indicate that issue 20 mar 07 b 1 5 clear understanding of the current legal position and rec ent legal developments is necessary 19 commander has to be aware of t he legal background and the basis for any planned military operations he should also be aware of the contents of the sofa the appropriate roe for those under his command and have rapid access to legal advice then the complexities of the law in regard to countering insurgency can be tackled more effectively and can be integrated into the ov erall pattern of military operations conducted under his command section 4 operational law branch and legal adviser operational law branch 20 in the light of experi ence gained during the last fe w years an operational law branch has been established at the land warfar centre in warminster under one star leadership to provide theatre and regional commanders with legal advice affecting operations this service is available for co mmanders and staff to use on any topic where suitable legal advice can be prov ided rapidly if this is necessary where troops are deployed on operations the operational law branch will provide legal adviser for the military commander who would deploy and join the headquarters staff to provide on the spot legal advice concerning the conduct of operations and the applicat ion of the law of armed conflict and other legal protocols treaties and instruments where appropriate 21 the operational law branc h will have permanent links wit h military lawyers within the mod pjhq and the other service hqs and can where necessary seek advice from other government departm ents particularly with regard to inte rnational law affe cting states on operations where an interpretation is r equired which affects powers of arrest interrogation and the handl ing of pw and detainees by br itish servicemen legal advice should be mandatory in the c ourse of campaign as result of progress towards stability within the area of op erations or as result of exter nal factors and influence definitive negotiation with potential or actual adversaries may be contemplated legal advice should be obtained before such negotiations occur 22 where operational circumstances permit r each back facilities may be put in place reach back gives deployed commander access to legal advice when an adviser is not deployed with the commander or can be used to reinforce the advice available to deployed legal adviser typically legal advis er at the operational law branch will be designated as the deployed commanders point of contact for advice on emerging legal issues where reach back arrangements have been established care has to be taken to ensure that reliable secure communications re main available throughout an operation or deployment reliance on reach back arr angements does not preclude the subsequent deployment of legal adviser to commanders staff should the circumstances require it legal advisers work for their commander and not for other lawyers so there is legal chain of command as such however as staff officers they will have desk level links with their counterparts in different areas of any military headquarte rs or formation issue 20 mar 07 b 1 6 the role and function of legal adviser 23 the legal adviser will be member of the command group within deployed headquarters he should be readily available to both the commander and staff for legal advice on matters affecting milit ary operations conducted by that headquarters his duties are likely to cut across the usual staffing functions within headquarters but his responsibilities for legal matters lie directly to the commander he may well be required to act in legal capacity at joint service or multinational headquarter s thus he will need to have suitable security clearances and ccess to information commensurate with his responsibilities to the commander 24 in hq the legal advise r will need to develop close working links with political adviser and so1 g3 perations support commander wo uld anticipate that political adviser and legal adviser work in harmony both to interpret political and legal direction and to present information emanating from outsi the headquarters in coherent manner the legal advisers link with the g3 operational staff is based on the requirement to ensure that all operations are undertaken in accordance with internatio nal law the legal adviser and so1 g3 operations supp ort will typically be dealing with targeting rules of engagement roe and information operations legal difficulties should ideally be resolved by the cooperation of staff office rs and before they reach the commander the legal adviser has to also ensure that he is present at operational planning meetings and that he makes himself available to the g2 intelligence and g3 operations staff the legal adviser also needs to be aware of the legal implications associated with longer range planning and should be involv ed with g4 logistics and g5 pl ans staff to identify and resolve such issues issue 20 mar 07 b 2 1 chapter 2 the application of military doctrine to counter insurgency operations section 1 the british experience 1 the experience of numerous small wa rs has provided the british army with unique insight into this demanding form of conf lict more recently service in northern ireland bosnia kosova iraq an d afghanistan have added considerably to this experience and provides the present generation of offi cers with its main firsthand source of experience this could also tend to constrai n military thinking on t he subject because of its national context the procedures for dealing with the routine as pects of providing military assistance within uk are not c onsidered further in this public ation those aspects of military assistance to the civ il power in uk will continue to be relevant and military commanders will need to be aware of this overall doctrine if calle d upon to assist in counter terrorist or counter insurgency incidents in uk 2 the british have not devel oped general antidot to the problem of insurgency there have long been alternativ effective approaches the french in algeria during the 1840s produced novel tactics based on highly mob ile columns and in indochina military led community relations campaign predated mplers hearts and minds theories by several decades not only is the threat changi ng but so too is the environment in which an insurgent has to be confronted for example in any future counter insurgency operation military action will be conducted under the critical scrutiny of the law the media human rights organisations and other in ternational bodies such as t he european court thus while military planning should draw upon the lessons of the past doctrine has to evolve if it is to remain relevant section 2 the attrition theory 3 straight forward attrit ional approach is ne option such strategies have been adopted and some have worked absolute repression was used by the germans in response to guerrilla attacks during the second world war saddam husseins use of chemical weapons against th kurds and his campaign ag ainst the marsh arabs in southern iraq are contemporary examples of the use of at trition in uruguay the tupamaros campaign was crushed by vici ous right wing backlas h that not only destroyed the insurgency but in the process led to the replacement of vibrant civil democratic government by milit ary dictatorship none of the attritional solutions described above is appropriate in liberal democracy and it is c onsidered that gloves off approach to any insurgency problem has almost role to play in modern counter insurgency operations 4 furthermore the record of success for attrition in coun ter insurgency operations is generally poor one undue focus on military action clouds the key political realities which can result in militarydominated campaign plan that misses the real focus of an insurgency an inability to match the insu rgents concept with an appropriate government onelikened to trying to play chess while t he enemy is actually playing poker is conceptually flawed and will not achieve success having deployed conventionally trained troops and large amounts of firepower the attritionalist commander generally feels issue 20 mar 07 b 2 2 compelled to use them the head of the us mission to south vietnam general harkins claimed in september 1962 that what was required to defeat the viet cong within 3 years were three ms men money and materiel t he result of this approach normally to the delight of an insurgent is an escalating and i ndiscriminate use of milit ary firepower the wider consequences of this appr oach seen both in south vietnam and sewhere will often be an upward spiral of civilian alienation 5 it would be wrong to deduce that any applicat ion of attrition is necessarily counter productive in malaya the british were able to achieve force ratio of 201 and used their military superiority in numbers and firepower as means to drive chin pengs communists into remote parts of the country where they were then hunted down remorselessly the important point to note in this example is the close political control which was exercised over military power throughout that campaign ne vertheless an overall policy of attrition in counter insurgency operations has rarely if ever been policy for the uks armed forces 6 it is necessary to appreciate that althou gh at times military forces and policy of eliminating insurgents could have crucial role to play in restoring and maintaining government control military fo rce is not an end in itself but always means to achieve wider political purpose this implies that the military comm ander will have far from free hand and indeed in well orches trated military counter insurgenc strategy is unlikely to direct the overall campaign acceptance of th is fact has deep implications for the part that military forces will be given and should seek to play in counter insurgency and of any doctrinal approach to the situation section 3 the manoeuvrist approach background 7 insurgency can be seen as an ancient form of manoeuvre warfare in vietnam for example it was being practised against fo reign invaders 2000 years before ho chi minh and giap turned their attention to the fren ch japanese and then the americans the insurgent uses politicomilitary skills to turn the governments apparent strengths against itself this can involve relatively low leve l of military activity such as the malaya campaign or one which is virtually indistinguis hable from war as the french discovered at dien bien phu the military op erations in iraq and afghanistan fa ll into the same category it would therefore be an error to conclude that military operations in an insurgency are low intensity and hence the phrase is longer used applicability to counter insurgency operations 8 adp land operations explains that some element s of conventional warfighting wisdom may become irrelevant in counter insurgency and acknow ledges that other forms of operation will be governed by tight political control nevertheless because counter insurgency involves using degree of military force its conduct has some parallels with combat operations the army has an approach to operations which with careful reflection and imagination can be readily adapted it places due emphas is on the intellectual and psychological aspects of operations not simp ly the material it emphasises the focus on people and ideas not only on ground insurgent cohesion is identified and attacked by applying concentrated yet discrete force against cr itical vulnerabilities some of which have been described in part of this publication surprise tempo and simultaneity are used to issue 20 mar 07 b 2 3 overwhelm and unhinge an insurgent bringing about complete collapse of will and ultimately help to create the conditions for his political defeat as in warfighting force is applied selectively and its use is carefully measured and controlled des truction is means not an end the doctrine eschews accepting battl for battles sake and aims to create the conditions for success with less force more quickly and at less cos t all of this is directly applicable in counter insurgency subtle approach to subtle pr oblem because the theory of manoeuvrist approach shares common ancestry with some of the most successful insurgent strategies the military plann er educated in this doc trine is more likely to cope with the inherent complexi ties of counter insurgency level of conflict 9 there are however differences of emph asis and interpretation first counter insurgency operations do not readily lend themselves to neat divi sion into discrete levels of conflict an action at the lowest tactical level can have far reaching operational and even strategic consequences and vice versa indeed if the test of whether there is political dimension is rigidly pplied every patrol is potentially c onducted at the operational level because the conduct of an individual soldier amplified by the media can become an international issue 10 in warfighting servicemen tend to expect that once broad political parameters have been established their commander s will be left to decide the best way to achieve operational and tactical goals this is not nece ssarily the case in counter insurgency and this has important implications while bein g prepared to work and offer advice at the highest levels military commanders are unlikely to enjoy even tactical autonomy over matters that in would be considered service preserve this is due to the relationship between success and the centre of gr avity in counter in surgency operations defining success 11 success is defined by the st ate of affairs which needs to be achieved by the end of campaign since insurgency is pr incipally political struggle it may be that the desired aim of the host nation authorities falls short of vi ctory in strictly military context and setting this desired aim may well diffe r from views expressed by br itish authorities who will then have to operate within the conditions set by the host nation this is not to say that tactical defeats are acceptable merely to acknowledge that there may be significant restrictions on the degree of military success which is both achievable and compat ible with the overall political aim in counter insurgency success may equat to handing over an internal security problem to the local aut horities or simply not losing duration of campaign 12 if for example the intention of committing troops is to buy time in which to address particular grievances which need not necessarily mean making concessions then dramatic tactical military success may in fact be counter productive nor may it be possible to predict how long involvement may last so the campaign may not be planned in the decisive coherent fashion to which military commanders aspire counter insurgency operations are often protracted and as the nature of the task ma evolve or even radically change long after troops are deployed the politic aim may likewise change over time it is thus vital that the political authorities and co mmanders seek to identify where in the overall issue 20 mar 07 b 2 4 spectrum of government activity the military contribution lies what its relationship to the other aspects of policy is and its relative impor tance at any particular stage of the counter insurgency military campaign this will vary over time and even in different geographical areas at the same time troops have to be aware of the military role and commanders should select accurate measures against which to judge the effectiveness of military tactics ground captured has even less significance in counter insurgency than it does in warfighting centre of gravity 13 in an insurgency the strategic centre of gr avity will be the suppor t of the mass of the people clearly this is not open to attack in the conventional sense although insurgent strategies often incorporate t he use of coercive force the insurgency is an attempt to force political change therefore it logically fo llows that the centre of gravity can only be reached by political action the government re sponse to an insurgency should take as its fundamental assumption that the true nature of the threat lies in the insurgents political potential rather than his military power although the latter may appear the more worrying in the short term in malaya the centre of grav ity was targeted not by j ungle patrolling but by the political decision to grant independence the military contribu tion was invaluable but not of itself decisive the milita ry campaign will focus upon the insurgent s but is only one part of wider potential solution contemporary operat ing environment 14 the land environment in wh ich the british army is curr ently required to operate is arguably more complex than that for which the rmy has traditionally trained the adaptive foundation could however be complemented by training to cope with simultaneous and changing tactical challenges within the sa geographic area throughout history the british army has faced numerous and varied threats british involvement in conflicts or recent emergencies ranging from northern ireland oman and the falkland islands bear witness to this fact and yet throughout the last years of t he 20th century the perceived greatest threat and the threat against which tr aining was focused was that posed by the soviet bloc the risks of large scale arm ed conflict between nation states have reduced with the end of t he cold war but they have not di sappeared the army now faces spectrum of threats ranging fr om conventional forces to international terrorists and from weapons of mass destruction wmd to computer viruses these threats may manifest themselves wherever t here are british interests and be init iated from any region on earth in todays turbulent and uncertain world it is impossible to pr edict the exact nature of future conflict and therefore the army has to be prepared to meet t he challenges of any type of operation in range of physical environm ents and against all kinds of threats simultaneously this is the nature of the contemporary operating environment coe more details concerning coe will be available in the next revise of this publication these have been recorded in doctrinal note pr oduced by the mission support group of the land warfare centre and are available in edition 9 of the electronic battle box 20072008 and on the web based battle box developing counter insurgency campaign 15 the military plan should form one str and in coordinated attack upon the overall aims of the insurgents this should be estab lished by strategic estimates conducted by issue 20 mar 07 b 2 5 government taking military and other advice fr om this will flow fu rther operational and tactical estimates and plans while military forces may have critical role to play at certain stages in the campaign overal l its contribution will be of less importance and should be kept in perspective depending upon the level of insurgent activity for most soldiers it is likely to be an unglamorous rather unsatisfactor environment in which to serve at times there may be opportunities for fl air and to instigate decisive ac tion against insurgent groups but at others troops will be confined to acting in stabilising holding role with the bulk of their effort going into strategically fixing the insurgency this by means implies passive or reactive posture but an understanding of these realities and the reasons for them at all levels should help to prepare the soldier for occasi onal policy decisions which at first sight may defy military logic as well as giving units involved in counter insurgency realistic expectation of success 16 the aim should never be spectacular isolated success for one arm of government but sequence of successes that combine to wo rk in complementary ways toward single strategic goal there w ill be multiple lines of operation economic legal military etc working through series of decisive points but they should all complement the campaign main effort the primary line of operation which must be po litical the military commander will identify his military decisive points which are then rranged onto lines of operation to achieve the desired military ai m the military plan will be based upon number of operational objectives understood and refined at each level which assist the destruction of the insurgency by marginalisation and focus ed selective strikes and also provide assistance to the work of other agencies resources the m eans to achieve the specified ends should be allocated accordingly 17 the strategic campaign plan should be di rected in such way as to sequence and coordinate the various agencies individual lines of operation according to the overall strategic requirements at the time the intent is to overlap the oper ational plans of each with the others these concepts tr anslate directly to counter in surgency but contrary to the military aim in warfighting t he overall campaign director has far more complex range of events and options to weave into coherent plan campaign in the broadest sense section 4 success in operations destroying the insurgents 18 in counter insurgency physical destructi on of the enemy still has an important role to play degree of attrition will be necessary but the number of insurgents killed should be more than is absolutely necessary to ac hieve the success commanders should seek soft methods of destroying the enemy by rrest physical isolation or subversion for example minimum necessary force is well proven counter insurgency lesson in an era of intense media interest and one in which legality both domestically and in the international arena will become ever more important sound judgement and close control will need to be exercised over the degree of ph ysical destruction which it is possible necessary or desirable to inflict for exam ple the killing of teenage gunman could be justifiable in military terms but its possibl impact on his community could jeopardise potentially far more significant though less spectacular hearts and minds operation 19 success does not necessarily go to the side which possesses the best weapons or even uses them most effectivel seeking to destroy the enemy by physical attrition will issue 20 mar 07 b 2 6 also expose members of the gover nment force to greater risk of casualties and as the tet offensive in vietnam during 1968 demonstrat ed campaigns can be lost despite military success in that instance the american strategic centre of gr avity public opinion in the usa became vulnerable once the perceived costs of involvement escalated this does not mean that risk should be avoided or the tactical initiative handed to the enemy merely that the wider implications of any course of action should be carefully weighed attacking the insurgents will 20 attacking the insurgents will the strength from which he draws his cohesion is likely to be more productive particularly in the ea rly stages of counte r insurgency campaign before the insurgency has consolidated sophisticated attack on the adversarys will strikes at the centre of his philosophy this should be under taken as part of deliberate hearts and minds campaign this is so mewhat dated term but encapsulates what is needed it should incorporate g5 action psychological operations effective use of the media and troop information these are s eparate functions but they have common theme and are best utilised in complementary manner in practice the scope for such action will depend upon the way in which particular campaign is orchestrated at the highest level and the freedom of action which is delegated to military commanders given the political authority an appr oach that attacks the enemys will demands imagination and responsive decision making organisation whic h has the ability to seize fleeting opportunities see annex to this chapter for more details of how this can be done attacking cohesion 21 manoeuvre warfare theory indicates that it is prefer able to shatter the enemys moral and physical cohesion rather than seek his whol esale destruction the means of attacking cohesion in counter insurgency ar readily adapted from warfighti ng firepower which in the warfighting context is severely constrained but in counter insurgency can be broadened to include evidence gathering arre st and legal action surprise achieved for example through developing information gathering technology which is exploited by either covert action or rapid concentration of overt force into given area tempo 22 it has been said that low tempo appears to be charac teristic of many counter insurgency campaigns this is to misunderst and tempo which is judged not by the pace of operations but the speed of ac tion and reaction relative to t he insurgent it is true that slow pace is direct result of the protra cted nature of some though not all forms of insurgent strategy however even in maoi st style campaign where the insurgent may not be able to move beyond low leve l guerrilla activity for consid erable time the situation can still change radically diplomatic agreement to cu rtail external support for example will test the ability to achieve high tempo commander s have to be ready and able to adapt quickly to sudden developments some of which may be outside their contro l certainly the accomplished insurgent commander will rely on an ability to exploit tempo moving up where possible and down when necessary t he classic revolutionary phases of an insurgency at such speed as to make the security forces responses inappropriate and counter productive issue 20 mar 07 b 2 7 23 at the tactical level tempo is just as applicable here commander can seek to establish his own tempo to seize the initiative in the local ar ea of operations and force an insurgent group into reactive role an incident which in conventional war would pass almost unremarked such as t he death of civilian in cross fire will attract considerable media attention troops and co mmanders at all levels should have the mental agility to adapt to rapid even inexplicable changes in the mood of the population for example quicker than the insurgent high tempo can be enhanced through physical mobility timely and accurate contact intelligence coordinat ed c3 and flexible support procedures simultaneity 24 all effective insurgent st rategies emphasise simultaneity by creating parallel political and social challenges as well as military ones in vietnam giaps regular and guerrilla troops worked with political cadres in comple mentary fashion to expl oit the fragile nature of the saigon government if t he use of simultaneity is productive for the insurgent then it is equally applicable for the autho rities tactically it can be achieved through the restrained and carefully considered use of mix of agenc ies and by grouping for independent action such as joint militarypolice patrols with com patible communications working to single headquarters operationally it is achieved through the developme nt of harmonised campaign plan along multiple lines of operation as described above mission command 25 following from the points raised in 9 above it has been argued that mission command cannot be properly applied in counter insurgency but this is misunderstanding of what mission command involves clearly polit ical considerations will permeate down to the lowest tactical level this will inevitably constrain the fr eedom of action of junior military commanders which could have the effect of re stricting initiative at the lower levels paradoxically this makes missi on command even more important 26 certain matters will need to be promulgated in great detail relationships between agencies have to be spelled out demarcation lines established and prec ise sops written particularly in joint operations with other agencies or allies sensitive relationships with the media the security forces of neighbouring states and the p ublic have to be carefully defined however because contact with the insur gent could be rare it is essential to seize fleeting opportunities in ce rtain operational environments ther may also be considerable freedom of action for example in remote ar eas junior commanders will have option but to use their initiative 27 but fundamentally the spir it of mission command does appl in counter insurgency because in politically charged atmosphere it is even more important that soldiers understand both their task and the purpose behind it subordinates well versed in mission command are able to work within constraints and thus avoid the many pitfalls which await the unwary it will be important for directiv and orders to express the concept of operations in such way that everyone understands not just the aim but the atmosphere which is to be created 28 counter insurgency places heavy dema nds and calls for particular skills and professional qualities both in commanders at all levels and the tr oops they lead it requires the ability to adapt and utilise an unconventional yet highly disciplined approach to issue 20 mar 07 b 2 8 soldering one of t he factors to mission command working in counter insurgency lies in the selection and education of commanders and preparing troops prior to and throughout operations relevant and realis tic training should focus not simply upon military skills but upon those aspects which troops will find most demanding or fruitful including legal rights and obligations languages medi awareness and cultural or ientation in counter insurgency simply being able to hold reasonable conversation with civilian is military skill that may need to be developed in training 29 there are clearly risks in employing legated decision making troops need clear and comprehensive orders orders which link the commanders intent with sops this approach adds an extra safeguard to minimise the risk of commander jeopardising the political aim most junior commanders and soldiers will not need to know the details of how the strategy is constructed but through miss ion command they will have feel for what is expected of the army what the constraints are and why section 5 the core functions for counter insurgency 30 doctrine is intended to guide and thus help to view the overall government campaign and the military element of it through the functions of f ind fix and strike the role of various agencies and th part they are to play will be expressed in the overall campaign directors concept of operations the inte lligence services elements of the army both covert and overt and ot her government agencies find the enemy by gathering all available information on him the uniform ed services the police and the spending departments of government combined with dipl omatic efforts and an active hearts and minds campaign including information operati ons fix the insurgent locally raised forces can also help to fix and have be employed in numerous counter insurgency campaigns to good effect special forces overt military and police units psyops and the legal system spearhead the campaign to strike which is also carried on through socio economic operations such as reorganising local government creating jobs and improving social services section 6 information operations general 31 in counter insurgency the strategic applicat ion of information oper ations is primarily concerned with gaining comm and advantage at national leve l and the preparation and implementation of strategic information plan in the former case this would involve the protection of government and alliance comm and centres and the disruption of any equivalent command arrangements wit hin an insurgent organisation in the latter case the implementation of the strategic information pl an covers the acquisition and control for the information available to an insurgent organisati on by all appropriate means the targets of this information war may include political economic commercial and public media sources as well as military resources command and control warfare c2w 32 the military part of information operat ions is command and control warfare c2w which is defined as the integr ated use of all military cap abilities including operations security opsec psychological operations psyops deception electronic warfare issue 20 mar 07 b 2 9 ew and physical destruction supported by all source intelligence and communications and information systems cis to deny info rmation to influence degrade or destroy an adversarys c2 capabilities wh ile protecting friendly c2 capabilities against similar actions these five disciplines can st and alone but are most effectiv when integrated to form an overarching c2w strategy any c2w cell shoul d be within the g3j3 operations structure but its function involves complex interrelation of all staff areas there is potential for mutual interference between the different components of c2w operations this underscores the need for close coordination and monitoring at all command levels preparing strategic information plan 33 it is recognised that different counter insurgency campaigns will have differing calls on the use of information operations and c2w as the campaign progresses however experience shows that little ttention has previously been give n to the preparation of an overall strategic information plan in counter insurgency situations 34 despite the potential difficu lties and frustrations involv ed commander could reap handsome military dividends if sound and properly supported strategic information plan is prepared and subsequent c2 w planning is conducted as an in tegral part of the operational and tactical plans that would be necessary in any counter insurgency campaign this could equally apply to other campaigns and operations 35 an illustrative diagram that describes the functions that oper ate within the scope of information operations both in peac and war is shown at annex b section 7 integrating operations shaping operations 36 in counter insurgency just as in warfighti ng the core functions will be executed within the now familiar operational framework but in counter insurgency the concept needs broader interpretation shaping oper ations at the strat egic and operational levels will often tend to be political diplomatic and psychological in nature military involvement may be through covert action by special units at tactical level overt shaping operations such as cross border cooperation and surveillance of areas where known insu rgents live and work will contribute to fixing militarily shaping operati ons could be decisive at the strategic and operational level but rarely so at the tactical level until the insurgent is found he has the initiative and it is impossible to conduct any further shaping or subsequent decisive operations against him the fi nding function is prerequisite to starting any subsequent operations despite it being ofte n very difficult to identify an insurgent when he can blend himself into society this prerequisite sh ould also endure throughout the campaign once lost the insurgent has the initiative back again police or military unit covert or overt tasked with conducting shaping operations ma be given variety of surveillance tasks andor disruptive tasks such as infiltrating the financial alings of an insurgency or conducting overt checks to break up or expos an insurgents patterns of behaviour and lines of communications issue 20 mar 07 b 2 10 decisive operations 37 decisive operations normally take place at the tactical level in counter insurgency operations those operations involving fixing tasks should normally be aimed to reassure the general public and foster im proved community relations w here it involves striking against the insurgency it is essential that the shaping operation has already found and fixed the insurgent group and thus initiative is ensured however often decisive operations are reactive to an insurgent gr oups activities and there is time for preplanned shaping operation on these occasions the fixing has to be carried out as part of the decisive operation the key to success is to wrest the initiative from the insurgent as quickly as possible in order that the force can manoeuvre to position from which it can then strike sustaining operations 38 sustaining operations in counter insurgency will attract higher priority than they generally do in offensive oper ations in war and may need commensurately greater priority in terms of operational planning staff effort and resources the aim is not simply physical protection of the force but also securing political and public support from which all government freedom of action fl ows the insurgent commander may have identified non military targets such as vips or economic assets as government vulnerabilities and have selected them as decisive points in his campai gn that being the ca government forces are likely to become more heavily committed to protective duties than they would wish while the aim will always be to cure and hold the initiative by means of aggressive action significant numbers of troops are likely to be needed until locally recrui ted militias can be organised to take their place and technological aids put in place this has important implications for training force structuring and the timing of offensiv operations in the military campaign plan counter insurgency ca mpaigns are often long protracted affairs and the establishment of secure operating bas lines of communication maintaining public support and recruiting loca l militia are necessary to enable the security forces to sustain longterm operation hence the val ue of sustaining operations to the overall campaign plan summary 39 over and above the integrat ion of shaping decisive and sustaining operations there is discrete and undefined balan ce between the application of deterrence reassurance and attrition maintaining firm and clear polit ical and military dete rrent to insurgents and their activities helps to reassure public opinion and local support for government policies and plans while attrition when properly fo cused and directed can remove hard core activists and reduce the ability of insurgents to act coherently issue 20 mar 07 b 2 1 annex to chapter 2 the application of doctri ne in counter insurgency attacking an insurgents will 1 general there are many ways in which it is possible to attack and seize the initiative from an insurgent gr oup experience has shown that combination of activities simultaneously applied has the best chance of success these can be categorised in three ways which are covered in the next three paragraphs 2 preemption the aim here as in war is to identify and exploit the fleeting opportunity in order to maximise surprise faced with an elusive insurgent considerable emphasis should be placed upon preemption he or she must be constantly destabilised by proactive political and information campaign to deny the points and potential points of grievance for example the announcement of timetable for independence robbed the malayan communist party of its main politic plank military success in preemptive operations will depend on responsive intelligence system linked with rapid decision making process in such way that the detec tion of an opportunity c an be translated into successful contact surveillance capabili ty perhaps along the lines developed in northern ireland will help facilitate successful preemptive operations in coin it is frequently the case that one success leads to oppor tunities for another an arrest may lead to the discovery of an arms cache and so on special forces and quick reaction forces must be available properly pos itioned and able to ex ploit unplanned opport unities to strike at the insurgency there shoul d be scope to develop new tactics such as the novel use of parachute troops by the rhodesian army during their counter insurgency campaign in the 1970s the degree of preemptive action attempt ed by the security forces will in part be governed by an assessment of its overall impact and is therefore likely to be controlled at relatively high level the potential to ac hieve spectacular military successes like the american operation to c apture the achille lauro hijackers or israeli air strikes against guerrilla bases for example will need to be bal anced against political including media and legal implications 3 dislocation the emphasis here is on denying the insurgents the opportunity to make best use of his resources it will inclu deterrence and security measures designed to protect vulnerable targets search operations overt surve illance of potential mounting areas for insurgent attacks or meeting places and proactive public information pinfo stance effective rear operat ions although frustrating and unp opular with troops deny the insurgent the spectacular success on which his po litical appeal often rest s the results of determined effort to dislocate the insurgent may not be spectacular and may not even be apparent to troops on the ground but over time will rob the insurgent of the initiative both imagination to design new tactics and high degree of discipline in order to remain unpredictable are required 4 disruption the intention is to attack the insur gent selectively targeting his most important assets and so throwing him into confusion well executed overt military operations will help to disrupt the insurgent by threatening his deployment and escape routes locating his arms caches and restrict ing his movements even the threat of aggressive covert operations can be effective disruption calls for tactical awareness and issue 20 mar 07 b 2 2 cunning troops should also appreciate that rare opportunities may be better exploited by other agencies minor arms find for exampl could if left undisturbed become fruitful ambush site for special forces speed and ertness will be essentia l to get inside the insurgents decision cycle reserves must be available and the co mmander must have the ability to shift the main effort rapidly mission command clearly has key role to play at the lowest tactical level thorough training and briefing must ensure that everyone helicopter crews or drivers of ration trucks as much as soldiers on guard duty recognise report and where necessary act on combat indicators contingency plans based on thorough preparation and assessment will allow t he security forces to exploit advantages such as relatively greater mobility and better communications

that must be apparent when contemplati ng the sort of action which government facing insu rgency should take is that there can be such thing as purely military solution because insurgency is not primarily military activity at the same time there is such thing as wholly political soluti on either short of surrender because the very fact that state of insur gency exists implies that violence is involved which will have to be counter ed to some extent at least by the use of force general sir frank kitson section 1 principles matter of balance 1 there has never been purely military so lution to revolution political social economic and military measures ll have part to play in restoring the authority of legitimate government the security forces act in support of the civil aut hority in milieu in which there is less certainty than in conventional war the problem is that working on insufficient information at least in the early stages decisions have to be made affecting every aspect of political economic and social life in the country these decisions have repercussions for the nation or region far beyond the area both in the diplomatic field and in the all important sphere of public opinion 2 theories strategies and tactics come and go depending upon circumstances or merely intellectual fashion the five main british coin manu als published since 1949 have included several different lists of principles what remains constant is the fact that insurgency and counter insurgency are essentially about the battle to win and hold popular support both at home and in the theat re of operations if the stra tegic focal point is public opinion both domestic and international most in itial military tactical efforts will be focused on breaking the link between the insurgent and the people if t he insurgent can be isolated it is then theoretically relatively simp matter to eliminate him and his cause 3 unfortunately governments and armies have often been wrongfooted at the outbreak of insurgency meanwhile the br oad mass of the people may wait to see which side appears to have the best prospects that which can organise first developing tailor made strategy which is both effective and attr active will be at significant advantage hence the value of principles upon which successful coin st rategy can be based their practical application is much more difficult and the critical tool for use is an objective and thorough estimate taking two dramatically different outcomes of the same concept illustrates the dangers of trying to template particular ideas and theories without taking due account of the operational environment in malaya the st rategic hamlets policy worked well because in addition to separatin g the chinese squatter populati on from the insurgents it also satisfied one of the squatters basic demands namely providing them with their own land which in turn gave them stake in the fu ture of malaya in vietnam the same tactic insensitively applied due to cult ural misperception simply lienated the peasants and drove issue 20 mar 07 b 3 2 them into the arms of the vi et cong the vietnamese owned family farms and many were animists in that they worshipp ed the very land that they were being taken from the policy backfired increasing the r egimes unpopularity and boosting s upport for the viet cong 4 principles offer the ci vil authorities and the heads of all government agencies including the military commander both start point and useful signpos ts they also help guard against panicdriven or flawed attempts to initiate military solution adp land operations provides general guideli nes derived from experience and the work of general kitson and sir robert thompson while the relati ve weight given to each will vary for each type of campaign british doctr ine adheres strictly to the addi tional mandatory guidelines of minimum necessary force and legitimacy note therefore that some of the techniques which were successfully applied in previous campaigns such as certain interrogation methods or the relative ease with which t he legal system was adapted are simply longer viable in todays wo rld they would be unacceptabl either domestically or internationally the principles 5 the six coin principles are arranged in to logical sequence which provides the authorities with general guide on which to base and review its coin strategy like all principles they should be applied pragmatic ally and with common sense to suit the circumstances peculiar to each campaign it may not be possible or appropriate to apply all the principles and in some situations it may be observed that the detailed application of these principles may overlap or even temporarily run counter to the overall aim of the campaign the principles1 are political primacy and political aim b coordinated government machinery c intelligence and information d separating the insurgent from his support neutralising the insurgent f longer term postinsurgency planning section 2 political pr imacy and political aim formulating the aim 6 general once it has been assessed that an insurgency has or could be developed the authorities should move rapidly to provide an analysis of the type of insurgency it faces and its subsequent implications t hen it should decide how to stop neutralise or reverse the consequences of such an insurgency at the same time the authoriti and their agencies have to respond positively to any violence and intimidation generated by an insurgency it is in the latter response that force commander can play an effective part by advising the authorities of the role scope an d potential of the military forces available in any counter insurgency planning and how this potentia l can be matched to the authorities own issue 20 mar 07 b 3 3 political legislative and economic aims t he authorities should therefore formulate long term political aims which will be backed by political and ec onomic programmes these in turn will be supported by counter insurgency pl an involving military forces police and any locally raised security force organisations 7 intergovernmental agreement on aims the overall plan of campaign will be function of government before hmg agrees to support an ally in any counter insurgency campaign the authorities will need to agree on the overall aims the role british forces will play and whether there are any c onstraints on their employment 8 british force commanders po sition visàvis an ally british commander of force invited by an allied government will onl be able to advise his ally if he needs further guidance in what will probably be co mplex situation or if his advice is ignored he should be able to consult or have recourse to appeal through the seni or british political representative probably the ambassador or high commissioner if there is still disagreement on an important matte r of principle the question would be referred to hmg for decision in an extreme case if agreem ent can be reached th is might lead to the withdrawal of forces 9 suiting the plan to the circumstances the overall plan will differ from country to country taking account of local circumstances and the analysis of the type of insurgency faced previous experience and the appropriate use of the principles outlined in 5 should be used to set any plan of campaign into an overall political context once this has been settled then clear and achievable gover nment aim can be agreed and should in the right circumstances be given as much publicity as possible section 3 coordinated government machinery control and coordination 10 functions to be coordinated given the complexity and pot ential for friction within any large organisation unity of effort is prerequi site for success it is fact that different agencies will approach strategi c goal from different dire ctions and with different philosophies the ideal is fo r the government to give one person overall responsibility for the direction of the campai gn allowing differences of opinion betw een agencies to be resolved by an impartial director this coul d be soldier but is more likely to be politician or civil servant who in ideal circ umstances should have ready access to his own government in any case he will be working to strict government or alliance guidelines and overall control what should then be est ablished is command and co ntrol structure that reflects the security situat ion prevailing at the time 11 the military command system in theatre in the past it was not unusual for director of operations to be nominated to command all counter insurgency operations this worked well in colonial setting where the uk controlled all the levers of power and could also work where single nation is involved in dealing with insu rgency in coalition or alliance operations where several nations ar contributing forces to host nation workable chain of command and control will ne ed to be devised to ensure suitable modus operandi within the theatre of oper ations furthermore military commanders of those nations providing troop contributions normally work directly for their own sovereign governments before each new campaign fresh command and control arrangements will issue 20 mar 07 b 3 4 have to be agreed and endorsed by all concer ned before operations can begin nominated director or chairman from the host nation could act as the single overall commander of all operations particularly if an insurgency has been allowed to develop unchecked or if radical measures are necessary to retrieve deteriorating situation in any coalition or alliance of military forces each individual state may we ll have national caveats about the use of their own military forces military commander will have to be aware of these caveats and task troops in line wit h any restraints that may apply 12 the committee system under committee system such as that initiated by lieutenantgeneral briggs when appointed director of operati ons in malaya in 1950 and subsequently much favoured by the unit ed kingdom and the commonwealth the civil administration provides the chairman while the police and the armed forces find the members in the shape of the police and m ilitary commanders at each level in the administrative hierarchy decisions are taken collectively and implemented by the chairman and members through their own civi l service police and military command structures the members will be advised and assisted in the implementation of policy by officials responsible for the functioning of the civil service intelligence and psychological operations each of the members has the right of appeal to his superior in his own service who will usually represent that service on the committee at the next highest level this description of the committee system may need to be altered to suit the circumstances of the time it worked well in malaya but was oft not suitable elsewhere the structure of committees can be applied flexibly and the command arrangements at government level adjusted to suit the circumstanc of the day what is impor tant is to have coherence across all the higher levels of governments coalitions and ag encies involved in countering an insurgency and reconstructing national authority this will be more difficult to establish in circumstances where sectarian differences exist 13 personalities both the single command and the committee system will depend almost exclusively on the personalities of the individuals involved in serious situation which involves emergencies and counter insurgency action many different opinions and views will emerge and thes will have to be clearly reconcil ed the examination of several historical examples shows t hat there is invari ably dominant personality involved in any successful counter insurgency system of control and coor dination should normally be capable of adaption to suit the personalities of those involved these two types of system could be used as the basis for further adaption to suit local circumstances 14 assistance to allies if the british army provides military assistance to friendly foreign state any forces assigned would nece ssarily be subordinate to its government in order to preserve the host nations soverei gnty and the governments cr edibility in the eyes of its people the forces wo uld be obliged to adopt any coordination systems controlled by of the host nation but the existence of satisfactory arrangement would probably be condition for british support it is possible that advice may be sought on the subject in so far as policy is concerned this advice would probably be offered at government level but the british contingent commander may be able to make valuable contribution tactfully at his own level government planning 15 initial shortages however rich or poor the c ountry the government will be beset by wide variety of problems there will lways be lack of many resources in poor issue 20 mar 07 b 3 5 country and lack of forces and trained manpower in many countries to properly meet serious threat 16 appreciating the situation when the government is making its appreciation as to which of its objectives can best be attained wit h the help of the armed forces the latters professional military advisers will be able to explain their forces capabilities and limitations in the context of the particula r emergency an analysis of the situation should reveal the areas in which the government and the in surgents are most vulnerable these vulnerabilities are likely to be spread over the entire political ec onomic cultural and security spectrum diagrammatic net assessm ent is given at annex to this chapter which provides useful illustration of the sc ope necessary to combat insurgency effectively the aim will be to identify those government vu lnerabilities which are best suited to military defensive action and those of the insurgents which are most susceptible to offensive military action 17 allocating priorities coordinated national plan which would em erge from the above appreciation should cover the entire polit ical economic administrative operational and intelligence fields based on the analysis of the type of in surgency faced two priorities would stand out where do the insurgents obtain their most support and what actions by the government will achieve meani ngful results quickly an urban insurgency will require different priorities to rural based insurgen cy it may be necessary to close borders as preliminary to actions elsewhere the prioriti would need to be addressed at this stage of the planning process in addi tion other allocations of tasks and resources will follow once the major priorities are est ablished these could be roles and responsibilities betw een government departments to avoid duplication of effort and m uddle and to close loopholes b priority of action between the main fi elds of government activity economic social military and administr ation some careful pl anning and coordination is required to ensure that when areas are br ought under military control they can be administered and supported economically in order to avoid them falling back into insurgent control again c priorities within each field of activi ty it will be necessary to apportion the intelligence operational and l ogistic effort between protec ting the base area rooting out the subversive infrastructure and destr oying the insurgent forces the dilemma is particularly acute where t he insurgents are pursuing differ ent types of activity in different parts of the country simultaneously this kind of assessment should lead to decision on the geographical and demographic priorities for dealing with the insurgency some distant areas may hav to be abandoned for the time being in order to secure base and expand control into nearer and more important areas 18 government campaign plans the government should plan campaign which would force the insurgents on to the defensive on the political and m ilitary fronts and to oblige them to react to the gov ernments initiatives prot ecting the population will usually have priority in the initial st ages to rally support behind the government to provide firm bases for the expansion of government c ontrolled areas and to begin the process of wearing down and eventually elim inating the insurgent threat it takes time to lay the foundations of plan to beat determined and well organised insurgency if support for the issue 20 mar 07 b 3 6 government can be maintained there will be mptation to go for quick fix this should be discarded in favour of longer term planning for what is essentially focused war of attrition waged with the indispens able aid of good intelligence military planning 19 the military commander will adopt si milar approach to making his campaign estimate for coin campaign as he would for more conventional war the process should ideally start with the issue of strategi c directive in perfect world it would spell out precisely the governments strategic goals and desired nat ional aims however in practice the government may be unable or unwilling to be so spec ific defining the political aims for the campaign might entail revealing t he concessions which it is prepared to make or what the acceptable level of violence might be even the characterisation of events as an insurgency may be unpalatable as in the case of northern ireland these are sensitive issues ones which politicians may not wish to address so defining what is meant by military success when the overa ll government position is not clear may be difficult in practice this may mean that the military commander is forc ed to make some general assumptions about the eventual goals of the campaign and ba his detailed planning upon the short and medium term security require ments such vacuum highlights the usefulness of general principles to guide and organise planning in the climate of crisis which the emergence of an insurgency can generat the deceptive lure of the quick fix may be enticing 20 planning on the basis of t he government aims will lead to more precise estimate of the type of forces required and how they might best be used th roles of the armed forces can then be broken down into phases and objec tives to be achieved in an agreed order of priority again these objectives will termine the training programme for the units committed to the theatre 21 as the situation develops it will be necessary to review and alter the more detailed lines of operation as conditions evolve decisi ve points are reached or setbacks occur because military commanders are unlikely to c ontrol the campaign they may frequently have to adapt their plans to accord with the higher priorities of other agencies similarly it may be necessary to impose an operational pause on military operat ions perhaps during ceasefire or to allow peace talks to take place the military aim 22 it follows that in coin the military aim is not identical to the polit ical aim but it and the tactics employed to achieve it have to be complementary the m ilitary aim provides focus for all operations and because the in surgency may be widespread determines the allocation of scarce resources commander may express his aim in number of ways the elimination of specific gue rrilla band control of all road mo vement in given sector or the protection of key points and local official s for example the aim can be achieved using all of the conventional methods narrowing of boundaries grouping combat support and logistic allocations etc to these can be added specific c oin aspects like reorganisation and redistribution of staff effort the allocation of intelligence and covert agencies raising specialised coin units active pinfo psyo ps and allocating sufficient g5 community relations resources the commander will utilis manoeuvre resources to concentrate force against the insurgent with view to unhi nging him by means of surprise speed and issue 20 mar 07 b 3 7 firepower superior technology will if used judiciously provide the commander with the means to make the least use of manoeuvre to enable him to shift his main point of attack faster than the insurgent section 4 intelligence and information 23 the overriding importance of intelligence those involved with insurgency generally work amongst the populat ion in secret especially in the early phases of any campaign and only emerge as ov ert organisations in those parts of the country which they occupy as base areas during later stages they still work covertly in areas where the government is still contesting control their bases in fr iendly neighbouring countries and their command propaganda recrui ting and logistic organisations in sympathetic states operate under the protection of those states good intellig ence is perhaps the greatest asset for the authorities in combating an insurgency without it the security forces work in the dark and random offensive operations on th is basis produce nothing positive and much negative reaction amongst the population involved in the theatre and from within the international forum as whole 24 local knowledge knowledge of the country it s ethnic composition culture religions and schisms the political scene and party leaders the cl andestine political organisations and their undercover armed groups the influence of nei ghbouring states and the economy takes time to build up such background information is essential because intelligence relies on an ability to discern pa tterns of change in behaviour an ability to speak the local languages is ess ential to understanding of cultur attitudes as well as to obtain information but the num ber of people who can speak the languages of country which might invite british help may be small the host nation police and its special branch should be the prime agencies for providing information and intelligence and the best source for this is member of the insurgency itself 25 the organisation problem in normal times small centralised and secure system provides relatively small amount of prec ise information on potential major threats for the head of government and small number of ministers ideally the intelligence organisation should start expanding to match the threat as the insurgents develop the preparatory stage of their campaign however in the early stages it is difficult to assess the nature of the threat and to ant icipate the extent to which it might develop financial constraints and an understandabl political reluctance to expand and possibly compromise secure organisation are further large inhibiting factors consequently the enlargement of the service to provide the volu of detailed low level information down the chains of administrative and military command may not be put in hand soon enough in the interests of liaison and cooperation it is nec essary to produce an intelligence organisation which parallels the machinery of command and coordinat ion from the highest to the lowest levels to provide reliable information for commanders and staf fs at formation and unit level the principle of decentralisation has to be accepted and applied inevitably there will be an embarrassing interval before the exp anded organisation beco mes effective intelligence is dealt with in more detail in chapter 6 section 5 separating the insurgent from his support 26 general as indicated in 12 of chapter 2 the centre of gravity for any counter insurgency campaign has to be the people which generally means for the military issue 20 mar 07 b 3 8 commander at theatre level the p eople who live in the theatre of operations it is usual at the start of any campaign that about 90 of the popul ation will be neutral in their views as the campaign develops t he population will tend to support those whom they think are winning and thus it is axiomatic that government forces have to win this neutral population to their side by process of protection stabil ity and improvement to t heir conditions this in itself has inherent problems associated with how this can be achieved in sufficient time frame that does not ali enate tolerance levels for occupati on or intervention forces this can quickly lead to hostility unless return to the status quo can be restored quickly similarly if insurgent activity can be curta iled rapidly then there is real chance for the population to appreciate the beneficial effects of military presence but only for limited period this is also covered in utilising as pects of campaign authority as described in jdn 405 the comprehensive approach 27 firm base in this the first requirement is to secure the base areas essential to the survival of the government and state its capital the points of entry key installations and those areas which are yal to the government the provis ion of security in those vital areas encourages their inhabitants to rally to the government 28 inkspot method of expanding secured areas initially it may have to be accepted that the insurgents might control the remote areas in the hinterland inaccessible jungle and mountain country and territory adjoi ning the borders of state friendly to the insurgents success could lie in applying l ong term methodical in kspot policy as each area is consolidated loyal local forces wo uld be raised to secure the area to release mobile regular troops to secure the next area while the host states civil administration and police reestablished themselves in the recently liberated terri tory this is well tried approach to combating an insurgency although t here are difficulties about its application where an ink spot policy has succeeded in t he past has been when t he authorities have enough ink to allow it to spre ad across the blotting paper i troops to task and that the authorities remain in the ink blot area on near permanent basis or at least during the campaign if this policy is adopted then co mmander will have to review his troop levels and timings before commencing any campaign to ensure that he will have sufficient troops and time to implement the policy properly 29 eliminating of the insurgen t subversive support system the rooting out of the insurgents subversive and support organisations is more important t han and an essential prerequisite to defeating any active insurgent groups because insurgent groups will continue to receive food supplies recruits and information on the security forces from the population as long as their support organisation remains intact b the subvervise organisation controls the population of the towns and villages denies government popular support and prevents witnes ses from volunteering information on dissidents and giving evidence in court c once the subversive organisation is destroyed the insurgents are unable to swim like mao tsetungs fish in friendl sea of the people they are forced to approach the people direct to obtain money food and information exposing themselves to ambush and arrest by the security forces issue 20 mar 07 b 3 9 d the subversive elements arrested are the best informants on the illegal organisation they require ca reful handling by expert staff 30 separation methods skilful combination of meth ods is needed to separate the insurgents from their subversi ve and supporting organisations intelligence to identify subversive cells usually police special branch responsibility in remote parts of the co untry where there is virtually police presence special forces could establish ba ses make friends with the villagers and eventually win their confidence to obtain identifications of the cell members b security force protection for residents and informers this is easier said than done because political subversive cells us subtle and not so subtle means of coercion c the gradual spread of government control by the inkspot method d curfews and the searching of pers ons leaving their houses for work and returning in the evening to prevent the smuggling of food weapons explosives messages etc patrols ambushes and vehicle checks particularly in urban areas f interdiction campaigns against the entry of external supplies it should be noted that the variation in methods to achieve this are not always successful indeed it is very often impossible to achiev complete success examples of this are 1 diplomatic agreements with neighbouring or more distant countries to limit supplies of arms ammunition expl osives and other items useful to the insurgents the current proposal for the usa to talk to diplomats in syria and iran to resolve issued in iraq is good example 2 air interdiction campaign where appr opriate such as the coalitions effort in the nofly zones of iraq before 2003 3 physical barriers for instance t he successful application of the morice barrage on the tunisian border during t he french algerian campaign and the construction of the leopard hornbeam and hammer lines between dhofar and south yemen during the omani camp aign the green zone in baghdad is scaled down example of this and the israeli wall around the west bank another example of this tactic 4 resettlement of vulnerable elements in protected areas 31 gaining international support winning the support of foreign governments and the sympathy of the majority of their people or at least their benevolent neutrality and obtaining favourable attitude in the united na tions makes the task of dealing with an insurgency much easier it could make all the difference between success and failure success in applying principles with moral conten t observance of the law restraint in the issue 20 mar 07 b 3 10 use of force gaining popular support and the benefits bestowed by the social and economic aspects of the national plan all help to pr oduce favourable international climate 32 diplomacy careful diplomacy will aim to confirm the governments credibility and standing as the legal government b discredit the insurgency movement as unrepresentative and criminal c convince the international community that the governments political aims are legitimate and that its methods are l egal moral and respectful of human rights d gain the support of allies in provid ing economic investme nt advice training and if required an advisory mission and m ilitary contribution the latter may be in the form of military contingent naval antigunrunning patrols air reconnaissance troop lift etc it may well include large sc ale effort to retrain and reeducate large bodies of the host nations armed forces deny the insurgents ex ternal support including the use of crossborder sanctuaries section 6 neutralising the insurgent 33 general the aim should be to defeat the in surgent on his ground using enough but more force than is absolutely necessary 34 neutralisation the selective destruction of insurgen ts is an area in which the overt security forces of the government will have thei r most obvious impact and is fully addressed in later chapters organisations and tactics have to be adapted to suit the particular threat military operations can be conducted on rela tively large scale often at battalion level or above 35 patrolling the basis of much successful coin action however is the junior commander leading small patrol into the terrain t he insurgent sees as his own this is the area in which an army can function at its best and should be the focus for coin training section 7 longer term postinsurgency planning 36 the application of government plans this last principle probably holds the key to the effective application of all the other five principles merely providing for the military defeat of insurgents does not in any way end t he authorities requirement to make suitable longer term plans to enhance the economic and social aspects of its population and to ensure that the political caus of the insurgency have been iminated and overcome by effective planning in the dhofar campaign the end of insurgent activity occurred in december 1975 but the authorities had to work and plan hard for several more years to achieve continued support from the population before the caus of the insurgency had been fully rectified 37 publication of longer term plans the announcement of bold government initiatives to be started after the insu rgency has been defeated can have real and issue 20 mar 07 b 3 11 significant effect on winning t he hearts and minds of the popula tion during any campaign hence the need to formulate these initiatives at the same time as plans are prepared to defeat the insurgency the timing of any st atement about longer term plans could be of crucial importance and should be handled in sensitive and controlled manner by the appropriate authorities section 8 factors bearing on the principles for counter insurgency popular support 38 insurgent aims an insurgency aims to discredi t the government and its policy it will have spent much time preparing the ground for insurgency with propaganda using real and contrived discontents when it consider s that the government has been sufficiently undermined and that signif icant part of the population has be alienated from authority it will use coercion and terror to reinforce its propaganda campaign few determined men using systematic terror can exact support from exposed sections of population 39 hearts and minds in democracy popular support is an essential prerequisite for success in counter insurgency campaign even more traditional governments rely to some extent on the consent of the governed government has to be able to convince its population that it can offer better solution better government and better life than the opposing insurgents in order to win the hearts and minds of its people there can be exceptions to this general argument the bla ck population in south africa were in many ways better off economically than many other black populations in southern and central africa during the apar theid era and yet were wholehear tedly behind the anc in their efforts to change the whites only governments dur ing this period the regime of apartheid cut across all other politic and economic factors 40 the competition for loyalty just as an insurgency needs the sympathy or the acquiescence of sizeable percentage of the population to survive and to overthrow the government so the government needs the peoples support to appear legitimate in its eyes and to obtain information leading to the arrest or capture of the terrorists violence or the threat of it is aimed at the citizens fears for his family nd freedom to earn enough to feed them whoever can guarantee reasonable degree of security can often command their allegiance an insurgency is competiti on between government and insurgent for the individuals loyalty unless the government c an offer reasonable protec tion individuals are unlikely to risk their own or their families li ves by volunteering information the security forces could well meet an invisible barrier of passive resistance in addition to the active resistance of the insurgents 41 government protection protection involves irksome restrictions on the liberty of the individual for example to safeguard co mmunity either in cities urban areas or in countryside it may be necessary to establish guarded areas and to impose restrictions on movement night curfews ident ity checks searches and controls to deny the insurgents their contacts the insurgents will seek to misrepresent necessary inconveniences as harsh and oppressive consequently the gov ernment and its security forces have to anticipate possible hostile publ ic reaction to its security measures and prepare arguments to rebut insurgent propaganda in order to keep the initiative in the battle for the hearts and minds of the people issue 20 mar 07 b 3 12 42 involving the population in th campaign against insurgents initially when local areas are organised for def ence they should be allocated sufficient police or soldiers to provide protection as soon as possibl however communities should be encouraged to raise their own local defence against insurgents fr om reliable elements this is not just matter of releasing the security force garrisons for more offensive operations it is question of mutual trust the trust the community initially place in their protectors is repaid by the trust the government shows in them by allowing them to bear arms in common cause 43 countering propaganda insurgent propaganda has to be monitored and answered quickly and convincingly using ever possible outlet such as newspapers leaflets radio and television depending on the ci rcumstances in the host nation the media may either be government controlled or persuaded by briefing j ournalists and private television concerns specialist advice will be necessary possible sources of sound advice are sympathetic expatriates and friendly gover nment advisers in running counter insurgency information operati ons campaign there is risk of criticism on the grounds of eroding public freedom but the government and its curity forces cannot afford to opt out the insurgents will use all forms of propaganda particularly to attack those government policies and security force operations which are damaging their popular support infrastructure and insurgent forces this is only to be expected but hostile suitable material will be much harder to answer if the security forces act outside the law in short the government needs to be active in its use of pr opaganda but it cannot afford to lie to tell half truths or to say things that turn out subsequently to be wrong this is difficult position which has to be overcome political awareness 44 sensitivity just as the government has to be sensitive to public reactions to its policy and the measures used to implement it so commanders at all levels and individual soldiers have to be aware of the consequences of any action they may take this is especially important should an unexpected opportunity present itself or in sudden emergency when there is time to seek advice or direction from higher authority those with knowledge of the political scene are bette r able to assess the likely effect of their actions on public opinion and to make sensible decision 45 briefing the soldier all ranks have to be briefed on government aims insurgency aims and propaganda and how the government plans to counter the latter an understanding of the issues at stake ensures that soldiers know how to reinforce the government effort the british soldiers flai r for getting on with people at grass roots level should be exploited care shou ld be taken not to express cont roversial opinions still less become involved in the political life of the country the law 46 legal environment the legal framework within which the army works generally is outlined in chapter 1 and elsew here because observance of the law and the use of only the minimum necessary force are of sufficient importance to merit consideration alongside the principles of coin it is useful to exp and on those essential elem ents in chapter 1 which contribute to better understandi ng of these important issues issue 20 mar 07 b 3 13 47 acting within the law although terrorists and insu rgents use lawless and violent methods maintaining that the nd justifies the means the secu rity forces cannot operate outside the law without discrediting themselv the government t hey are supporting and providing the dissident political machine wi th useful and damaging propaganda material if the government and its security forces lose the high moral ground the people have incentive to back them the po lice and the army have to ac t within the law of the state within which they are operating and be seen to be doing so appropriate emergency powers can be introduced to meet particular threats posed by insurgents in the circumstances peculiar to particular campaign while changes to the law can always be made to meet new insurgent ploy or threat the security forces must always act within the law as it stands and not anticipate change until it becomes legally enforceable 48 clarifying the legal position the soldier must be in doubt as to his position in relation to the law apart from the need to brief all ranks on th law as it affects powers of search the use of force arrest evidence and other pertinent matters on arrival in new theatre everyone should be kept up to date with the important aspe cts of any emergency regulations and subsequent amendm ent any new concept of operations at the higher level and new techniques such as searching people and premises at the lower level will need to be checked for legality the army legal serv ice will provide both adv ice and link with the host nations legal system ease of appl ication should be borne in mind when drafting emergency regulations in order to avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities which the insurgents will undoubtedly exploit minimum necessary force 49 what constitutes minimum necessary force more force may be used than is necessary to achieve legal aim the am ount used has to be reason able and it must not be punitive directly the aim is ac hieved more force may be used 50 deterrent show of force the need to use minimum force is not to be confused with deploying the minimum number of troops the appearance of force large enough to contain situation at the ri ght psychological moment may convince insurgents and other dissidents that the authorities are so well prepared and determi ned to prevent trouble that none occurs 51 unnecessary provocation on other occasions the display of force either prematurely or without sufficient justification may provoke the very confrontation the authorities wish to avoid whet her to keep in the background or to deploy is question of judgement and assessing the sit uation correctly military commander should be as wary of being committed to an unnecessary use of force as much as using more force than necessary 52 illegal use of force failure to observe the law to use force without justification or to employ an excessive amount of force may result in prosecution b civil action for damages issue 20 mar 07 b 3 14 c discrediting the government the alienat ion of those already critical of the government as well as waverers and the loss of government supporters 53 rules of engagement roe whatever the circumst ances of any military intervention or deployment in counter insurgency operati ons agreed rules of engagement for all servicemen will be prepared prior to the start of any operations these should take account of host nation requirements and britis h government obligations with regard to both national and international law all troops involved in t he area of operations should be issued with an aide memoire or coloured card to be carried at all times on duty this card would give clear

operations section 1 the pattern of counter insurgency campaign threat and response the classic situation 1 insurgency movements generally grow sl owly methodically and work within the society they scheme to overthro w and replace initially they work secretly and when they launch their overt campaign of speeches demons trations strikes marches and riots the clandestine organisational cells remain well hidden so the seriousness of the threat may not become apparent until the in surgents have exploited conten tious issues to produce situation which democratic pluralist society is illprepared to meet even then the authorities are sometimes reluct ant to recognise an incipient threat until it has developed into serious challenge to it s control because of its aversi on to abandoning the habitual routines of everyday lif and administration 2 reaction to such situation is too oft belated and inadequate so that the initial security force response could easily be ill coor dinated and ineffective the establishment of an integrated intelligence service vital element in counter insurgency operations is apt to be tardy because of personal and interdepartmental rivalries and the lack of trained staff officers with sufficient local knowledge if british forces are called in to support an ally the situation will almost certainl have deteriorated to danger ous degree while the host government will be anxious to obtain help it will be necessary for the terms on which it is given to be agreed at intergov ernment level before british tr oops are committed amongst other things this should include an agree d aim for the plan of campaign and joint command structure 3 if the governments response is not to th reaten the society and the institutions it wishes to protect so giving the insurgents gr atuitous ammunition fo r their campaign its response should be measured and carefully graduated to meet the rising threat on the strategic level action has to be coordinated across the whole s pectrum of government and national activities within country measures to tackle the root cause of the problem may include the maintenance of law and order the redress of grie vances legislation to enable the law to work effectively and economic in itiatives to improve conditions abroad diplomacy will aim to win support for the governments case and to discourage support for the insurgents 4 state of emergency is likely to be declar ed particularly if the threat persists and becomes an attritional struggle the need to deploy troops in pport of the civil power in law enforcement role in this country has been reduced by increasing the capacity of the police to deal with all but an arme d challenge from insurgents 5 in normal circumstances the british arm ed forces would only operate in support of the authorised civil power it is not consi dered that purely military solution to an insurgency is feasible proposition because the political and social causes can only be remedied by political action the armed fo rces contribution becomes more delicate and complicated as societies become more developed sophisticated and complex issue 20 mar 07 b 4 2 government involvement 6 for convenience the governments response to serious internal threat may be divided into three phases the threshold circumstances this is the period when the threat is evolving and developing when the government attempts to deal with it entirely by civil measures b military commitment during this phase the armed forces take an active part in supporting the governmen t the police and the host nations military forces in helping to defeat the insurgents and restore w and order again as force by itself cannot defeat an insurgency its role in providing security and in eliminating insurgents should be seen in the context of furthering the governments long term political and economic aims at the stra tegic level the government has to have clear idea as to how the insurgency is to be defeated it has to give the armed forces precise aim and directive defini ng the objectives to be achieved when operating in support of an ally the senior british officer s position in the chain of command his responsibilities towards hm g either directly or through high commissioner or ambassador s hould be the subject of dire ctive similarly the british contingents relationship with the ally on legal and other matters should be defined in status of forces agreement sofa c withdrawal as its name implies this is t he phase of military disengagement in the event of an internal and perhaps an international settlement troops may be withdrawn quickly such settlement might represent compromise consummated by government in the host state in t he worst case it could follow government defeat an insurgent seizure of power and an ignominious evacuation however on the assumption that with lied support the host nation wins the government would retain the initiative to arrange an agreed pr ogramme for the withdrawal of the allied forces in the case of prolonged struggl of attrition in which the government regains control of its disaffected rritory area by area and the insurgent infrastructure is gradually eroded the withdrawal phase may last some time 7 the various phases may not be as clearcu t as described in the last paragraph and as indicated in subpa ragraph 6c different parts of country may be in different phases of an insurrection and recovery processes at any one time indeed this is the most likely scenario in addition there is seldom precise moment when on phase turns into another usually the boundaries will be blurred military intelligence and planners have to keep abreast of developing situation stay in touch with the civil authorities and police and be prepared to contribute suggestions through the system of ministerial control throughout the phases of an insurgency 8 the involvement of british forces in another nations inte rnal affairs is sensitive matter the benefits of overt support would have to be weighed against the host nations vulnerability to criticisms of inviting neocol onialism much would depend on the nature and source of the threat to british interests and ho w much political capital the government could gain or lose from any involvement if neighbouring state wa s clearly using and exacerbating domestic problem to further its interests and am bitions or if the internal challenge was of such nature as to attr act wide measure of condemnation in the issue 20 mar 07 b 4 3 international forum british offer of substa ntial military help for beleaguered government may well receive sufficient international support or at least acquiescence in more marginal cases military assistance may be confined to advisory missions and training teams threat and response failed or failing states 9 the pattern of counter insurgency campaign in classic situation paras 15 has almost been overtaken by events in the m odern world there is value however in retaining this model for guidanc because it may well have rele vance in certain areas of the world such as the remote pacific islands and in former british colonies or possibly in the balkans more likely is scenario where insu rgency will develop in country or across region where the national author ities request assistance from the in which case coalition of forces may well be tasked to deal with the situation nd the uks role in countering the insurgency will depend on the size of their commitment of forces to any coalition or nato grouping and hence their role and function in any military activity beyond this scenario could be situation w here uk forces could be committed to some form of intervention in an area where stat government has manife stly collapsed and chaos and insurgency follow once again this could well be in conjunction with other nations in this last scenario there may we ll need to be realistic ssessment of the nature of the additional tasks that will fall to the uk aut horities in the event of an occupation of that state or even part of it 10 events and experience now indicate that t he second or third sc enario described in 9 are much more likely to occur in t odays world iraq and afghanistan are clear examples of this and it is not impossible to consider sim ilar actions in africa sudan somalia and perhaps the c ongo in the near future section 2 threshold circumstances indicators 11 in deteriorating situation the governmen t and civil authorities will be trying to detect the sources of subversion and to take such action as is within their power to remove the causes of unrest they will be looking at i ndicators which in the context of the political situation will furnish circumstantial evidence as to the nature and ex tent of the threat individually they may be unremarkable and in nocuous but when seen in relation to each other they may reveal particular tendency in chain of events indicators may be provided by wide range of seemingly unconnec ted occurrences such as strikes with political motive in key industries demonstrations in which pattern of subversive political activity becomes apparent rumours which discred it government minist ers local officials and the police thefts of arms and explos ives bank robberies seditious leaflets propaganda from hostile countries and open or covert suppor t from the embassies of unfriendly countries for extrem elements harder and fi rmer evidence of an organised campaign of violence will be the use or disc overy of improvised explosive devices ieds timing devices and heavy weapons of military nature 12 the security services in the country concerned may be able to interpret these events taking into account local circumst ances and advise their senior officials and ministers accordingly this appreciation is mo st important since many of these incidents already occur with subversive intent in rmal times in democratic states assessing the issue 20 mar 07 b 4 4 significance of attitudes issues and trends and th appropriate level of response calls for fine judgment at time when c entral and local government is likely to be under severe pressure the strain on democracy 13 insurgents exploit the fertile ground democra cies provide for terrorist initiatives but which are not so readily avai lable in authoritarian regimes the rights of free speech and freedom of movement can be exploited to promote their own cause should the government place restrictions on either to limit their activities the insurgent propaganda machine will have readymade i ssues with which to attack th authorities while the insurgents will make the most of any securi ty force infraction of the law they will deliberately flout the legal system themselves often justifying their actions by claiming that they should not be bound by hostile code whic h they aim to discredit and destroy the security forces are obliged to work within the law of the land while the insurgents can engineer compromising situations to entrap them if the securi ty forces were to throw off their legal constraints and operate outside t he law they would merely play into the insurgents hands destroying t heir reputation and tarnishing t he image of the government 14 all restrictive measures whether of free expression or in an extreme case detention without trial place strain on democracy and any decision to introduce them will not be taken lightly any measures chosen should be enforceable to avoid becoming counter productive the insurgents who created the si tuation will be poised to exploit public disquiet and will find ways to evade restrictions for example censorship can be rendered at least partially nugatory if neighbouring count ries provide platfo rm for revolutionary speakers and make their broadcasting servic available to hostile propagandists underground newspapers have way of surv iving and flourishing notwithstanding restrictions the spread of mobile personal phones the internet and modern communications make censorship most unlikel because it would be impossible to control 15 an insurgent incident often brings p ublic demand for more extreme measures and governments will be under popular pressure to overreac t indeed prov oking an ill considered response is classic insurgent tactic unnecessarily harsh and vexatious measures merely further the insurgents aims of alienating m oderate and sympathetic opinion within and outside the c ountry some curbs on the pu blication of information and freedom of expression may be ess ential in the interests of security they should be the minimum appropriate and the case for them care fully explained so t hat the insurgents are handed unnecessary ammunition for propaganda campaign to present the restrictions as oppressive infringements of constitutional liberties 16 the government may conclude that combi nation of selective legislation and small scale but precisely directed operations by the security forces would stand good chance of nipping the insurgency in the bud in practice taking such decision is never easy an incipient insurgency situation pr esents confused picture and it may be difficult to assess its seriousness and the possible ext ent of the threat in such am bivalent circumstances it is hard to convince the local population that irritating initiatives ar necessary even when timely action on modest scale may obviat the need for sterner measures later furthermore sensitivity to potential reperc ussions on the domesti c and international political scenes firmly incline government towa rds the deferment of painful decisions sovereign state may be particularly anxious to avoid the political embarrassment of calling issue 20 mar 07 b 4 5 on friendly government for help before an insurgency gains dangerous foothold nevertheless the penalty for pusillanimity and procrastination may be as disastrous for democracy as an illconsidered overreaction prudent governm ent will try to steer deft course between the two government planning 17 initial planning after several decades of inter national terrorist activity most sensible governments will have prepared contingency plans to deal with strikes in essential utilities and services major demonstrations public disorder and the occasional terrorist atrocity although they may not all have anti cipated the need to deal with an insurgency however as the situation beg ins to deteriorate government should review its plans and start preparing measures to meet an escalating th reat out of the review should emerge recognition of the causes of the threat and thus the aims and objectives of the insurgency from that master plan couched at strat egic level can be prepared which sets out governments policy in the politic legislative economic and security fields supported by cogent persuasive and truthful public informati on campaign the plan is likely to develop gradually as the gravity of the th reat unfolds initially the s ubjects of especial concern to the security forces may include the formulation of the long term political aim b reviewing the machinery for inform ation and for countering propaganda c overhauling security measures related to identifying and interpreting indicators d integrating and expanding as necessary the intelligence and security services drafting emergency legislation f reviewing the organisation of the polic and the armed forces including the embodiment of military and police reserves special constables and the

will depend on the size equipm ent standard of training and morale of the police force the efficiency of its special branch in the gaining of information and the production of intelligence will be as important as the ability of the uniformed branch to deal with the initial stages of an insurgency if the insurgency prospers the special branch may initially lose control of the situation in some areas and be hard pressed to near breaking point in others hence the need for military support the organisation and role of police forces are discussed in chapter 7 summary 21 the paragraphs above describe t he sort of circumstances t hat in more classic terms indicate that an insurgency is developing and the sort of res ponses that can be made by sensible and prudent gover nment taken in isolation these actions could seem to describe slow perambulation towards insurgency it is even possible to read into these indicators that the uk could appear to be half way towards some form of insurgency this is not the case and all these indicators need to be proper ly considered in the context of their environment nevertheless it is more than li kely that insurgent activity will move and develop at much faster rate and in di fferent manner than wa s formerly the case section 3 military commitment direction and control 22 adequate preparation duri ng any threshold phase will ease the way for the commitment of british armed forces the ear lier that liaison is established between the british services and the local forces and the cl oser the consultation and planning that has taken place beforehand the smoot her will be the deployment of the military contingent however it is seldom that all the necessa ry measures will have been provided for in advance and some may have to be taken retr ospectively nevertheless one essential measure is that m ilitary operations should ever be undertaken until all the relevant commanders have been properly brie fed by the host government and the civil military and police authorities concerned this briefing which should be accompanied by formal directive is the basis for pl anning at the operational level 23 military assistance will onl be requested when the local forces are longer able to deal with an existing or developing threat it follo ws that the aim of milit ary intervention is to restore the situation to the poi nt where the police once again are in position to maintain law and order experience has shown that it is easier to commit the army than to extract it there is danger of overinvolving the m ilitary so that they replace rather than supplement the local forces this situation must be avoided in all but the direst circumstances as much in the interests of maintaining the proper relationship between government police and the armed forces as of preserving the morale of the police and its standing with the population it will have to serve after the emergency is over 24 the police and local forces should retain re sponsibility for the direction of operations the command of their forces and as much operational commitment and control as is practicable the british forces command t heir own troops and have responsibility for specific operations or parts of either operation every ffort should be made to scale down and remove the armed forces as soon as the polic or the local forces are in position to assume full responsibility issue 20 mar 07 b 4 8 25 when operating in support of friendly gove rnment british forces have to as in the united kingdom be seen to operate clearly in suppor t of the civil power and not in isolation from it lack of direction and firm control may result in operations that are successful in the short term but eventually prove counter produc tive to achieve sound framework in which british military forces can support the civil authorities to good purpose the following conditions must be met the existence of national strategic policy acceptable to hmg which can be clearly interpreted by military commander s and readily understood by the population b the proper coordination of civil and military action at the operational level particularly the incorporation of local secu rity forces into military planning whenever possible c the implementation by the local civil government of those aspects and measures of policy planning and control which closely affect military operations responsibilities 26 coordination chapter 3 emphasised the need for well integrated counter insurgency plan and chapter 7 describes how the machinery fo r coordinating the activities of civil administration police and the milit ary could work the following two paragraphs show in outline the broad division of respons ibilities between the civil administration including the police and the armed forces 27 civil responsibilities those with militar significance are the formulation of the political aim and the long term planning covering the whole duration of military commitment and its aftermath b defining policy and in particular 1 deciding at which levels of the go vernment and security force hierarchy decisions on policy matters of varying degrees of importance

ary tasks which are covered in chapter 7 at the operat ional level the military commander may be required to supplement the civil effort in certain fields such as advice on the overall directi on of

contribution to conflict prevention in fragile or failing states in all cases it is seen as critical activity that provides the basis for longe rterm stability and will address two broad areas the

professionalism of those in the security sector 33 the security sector the composition of the security ctor will differ from state to state so there is universally applicable defini tion of it however

development interests of the main government departments security concepts 35 international consensus supports the idea t hat the foundation of state security action should be the protection of the people this idea is based on two principles the security interests of the state shoul d not conflict with the security interests of its citizens b the state is ultimately responsible fo r providing the security conditions for the well being of its population in developing countries that security is not provided exclusively by westernstyl statutory bodies but also comes from traditional and nonstatutory systems the c onditions are not limited to law and order issues but include all political economic and social issues that ensure life is as free from risk as possible c ideally the

levels of tr aining and mentoring to provide indigenous forces requires trainers who will also act as force developers monitoring and facilitating the progress across functional lines including logistics infrastructure and personnel continuity of effort is necessary in rms of personnel and the overall approach to development reform should start and finish as soon as possible section 5 scenarios for military involvement 37 framework the form and scope of militar commitment will depend upon the circumstances and the seriousness of the sit uation as assessed by hmg in conjunction with the host nation government to provide framework for the study of the conduct of operations certain scenarios hav been devised they may not necessarily represent the sequence of events nor is any situation in future emergen cy likely to fit neatly into any one scenario as explained in part of this publication an insurgency could develop at different speeds in different parts of country commander arriving in host state is likely to be faced with spectrum of conflict covering two or more scenarios in neighbouring regions each demanding an apt and suitable response at t he appropriate level 38 isolated insurgent incidents occasionally insurgent in cidents occur for which the police have neither the training nor the equipment to provide complete range of workable responses amongst the possibilities are host age taking the hijacking of aircraft and the seizure of ships by heavily armed skilful dedicated and dete rmined terrorists in such circumstances the police may request military assistance either to provide an offensive capability to restore the situatio n or to enhance security when there is possibility that terrorist attack might occur th police retain full control of the incident until the decision is taken to commit troops at this stage responsib ility for the conduct of the military option is formally passed to the military commander on the spot within stri ct geographical and legal limits the use of military fo rces as way of extending the capability of the police in carefully defined and controlled circumstances in countries which do not maintain armed paramilitary organisations to support the police is now generally acknowledged this scenario can occur out of the context of an in surgency or at any phase in the development of an insurgency 39 administrative and logistic support during police public order operations this kind of support might be useful at an early stage when the insurgent political cells organise rallies marches and acts of civil disobedience in conjunction with propaganda campaign designed to promote popular causes and to bid for mass support by persuasion and coercion an atmosphere of dissent will promote growth in petty crime and similar occurrences which together wit h the political activity will place an undue burden on the local security forces clandestine training and arms smuggling will provide further indications of the political extr emists violent intentions as the government becomes aware issue 20 mar 07 b 4 13 of the threat it will hopefully take timely steps to initiate the measures necessary during the threshold circumstances the police and local authorities would retain full responsibility for the situation and military forces would be in an entirely subordinate capacity in such circumstances servicemen should be employed in areas where there is unlikely to be risk of confrontation with turbulent ements of the cal population b their tasks should be as unprovocative as possible c if there is risk of conf rontation servicemen must be briefed carefully on how they should behave what they should do and to whom they should apply for assistance d uniform will normally be worn but arms will not usually be carried in situation where only few specifically selected and tr ained policemen are bearing arms it would be inappropr iate for military forces gaged in tasks away from the scene of confrontation to do so the normal military command structur will be preserved with suitable arrangements for the injection of political guidance at national and regional levels and with appropriate liaison ma chinery established with the local civil and police authorities at every level f if the military are requir ed to assist in the information and counter propaganda fields civil director may be appointed as coordinator g host nation might request the help of specialist training teams for both its police and army h if military operations are to take place within this scenario they would probably be limited in scope tasks needing trained disciplined manpower using specialist skills may be the most appropriate thes tasks may or may not require emergency legislation if they do any draft l egislation which may have been drawn up previously as contingency measure should be reviewed i if contingency plans do not already exis t for issuing warnings of terrorist attacks especially bomb attacks and fo r dealing with unexploded devices and explosions preparations should be put in hand j helicopters might usefully provide surveillance and help with liaison and transport support but at this stage they should be kept well away from direct involvement in disturbances 40 coordinated widespread disorder when it becomes apparent that there is coordinating force behind series of incid ents and when these occur on scale which is beyond the unassisted capabilities of the police to contain t he country may be entering the early incipient stages of an insu rgency then the gov ernment will be obli ged to consider limited commitment of troops to assist the civil authorities on operational as opposed to issue 20 mar 07 b 4 14 administrative tasks while the troops remain under military command operations continue to be planned and directed by the police possible tasks might be guarding key points and manning vehicle check points in disturbed areas in order to relieve local police forces and per haps military forces as well for more active and high profile duties such as riot control b at this stage british servicemen are likely to become invo lved with the public and have to be properly briefed c selected men may be discreetly armed especially if terrorist attacks are believed to be imminent and if they are they will be subjec t to the rules of engagement in force at the time otherwise british troops are likely to be armed only with nonlethal antiriot weapons until they are required to perform antiterrorist tasks for which lethal weapons are necessary it is possible that assistance may not be requested by friendly host nation unt il the situation has deteriorated to the extent that it will be nec essary to carry firearms from the moment our troops are committed d the extent of the threat and the need to introduce british forces may not at first be apparent to the local population the information service must take account of this and plans to explain t he situation and to justify t he deployment of troops must be worked out in conjunction with the host government the normal military command structur should be adequate provided that suitable arrangements are made for polit ical civil and police liaison f contingency plans for prolonged oper ations and arrangements for closer integration of the security forces in deteriorating situation shoul d be prepared g emergency legislation may be required at this stage if not earlier 41 insurgency the situation deteriorates to wid espread political or intercommunal violence which the police with low key military support can longer contain without substantial military assi stance at this stage party in revolt which has been preparing the scene for escalation ght exploit the situation to l aunch well planned and prepared insurgency alternatively an overt or cl andestine political organisation may seize the opportunity provided by general breakdown of order to launch deliberate guerrilla campaign in these circumstances roles may include both those normal police duties which the police can longer undertake and also those counter insurgency tasks which require levels of force beyond the capability of the police or even of any paramilitary forces which the host state may have b heavy infantry weapons and artillery may be required against specific insurgent targets when there is risk to the civilian population c information and counter propaganda po licy should be coordinated in the theatre by civilian director issue 20 mar 07 b 4 15 d the british military cont ingent and the local or ho st nation police and armed forces will become one operationa l entity known as the sec urity forces and will be controlled accordingly although in this situation joint rrangements for command and control are essential brit ish military forces must take care not to swamp the police and the local forces and so effect ively assume control of operations everything possible should be do ne to ensure that the police and local forces retain primacy in the planning and control of operations if th is principle is ignored it may lead to unnecessary resentment and friction in the joint coordi nating machinery with the host nation and make it more difficult to reestablish the normal machinery of administration when t he threat recedes as an insurgency develops british m ilitary assistance may be required from all three services for example to provide dditional fire support in remote insurgent held areas where there is risk to civ ilians and to prevent the smuggling of arms and supplies across shore lines which cannot be controlled from the land side 42 loss of control in some areas where an insurgency has succeeded to the extent that guerrilla forces have taken over control of parts of t he country they have consolidated their position sufficiently to impo their administration to levy taxes enforce their own system of law and order and recruit sizeable number s of recruits if the insurgents win control of sufficient territory they may raise r egular form of army while an insurgency would continue in the diminishing territory ft to the government more conventional war effort in conjunction with dipl omacy and war wearine ss on the part of the defenders would eventually trium ph british military assist ance may involve all three services in near conventiona l war role in addition to the army led counter insurgency tasks against an urban and rural insurgency movement to clear the lost territory and regain control in this kind of scenario additional powers may be required to cover the consequences of an escalating conflict b the principle of minimum force woul d still apply to the counter insurgency aspects of the campaign for the conflic t with insurgent regular forces and formed guerrilla units the normal laws of war such as the geneva convention may be more appropriate although the rebels may not recognise them c civil affairs would play significant part both within the areas of contention between the security forces and the guerr illas and in the areas reclaimed from insurgent control d the country would move on to wa r footing and the campaign would very likely be directed at the strategic level by war cabinet and defence committee or its equivalent run by the host states prime minister or president in conjunction with his chiefs of staff if the british contribution we re to be significant one the united kingdoms interests would be repr esented at suitably high level section 6 withdrawal of military forces 43 the authorisation for withdrawal the authority for any wit hdrawal of intervention forces or those loaned for ssr purposes will come from the ho st nation authorities in issue 20 mar 07 b 4 16 ideal circumstances this will be the result of achieving success on operations and significant progress in stabilising the governm ent and authorities across the nat ion the indication of the conditions suitable for withdrawal of m ilitary forces is that the armed forces and police of the host nation are capable of providing and enforcing satisfactory level of security across the whole area of control ch that normal routi ne of life and social conditions can thrive before any withdrawals co mmence experience has shown that there are always differing opinions about the success or otherwise of campaign and the rate at which withdrawal takes place it has been us ual not to indicate particular date for withdrawal so as to offset height ened tension and the potential fo r final insurgent push to achieve victory which can be used for pr opaganda subsequently viz hizbollah in lebanon 2006 44 the control of law and order pa sses back to the local forces in the final successful phase of operations british military forces woul d be withdrawn as the local security forces reassume full responsibility the factor governing the timing of the handover is the ability of the local forces to control the security situation on their own this condition may be fulfilled before the last remnants of insurrection are ex tinguished the timing will require fine judgment and impartial expert military advice will be needed for what is primarily political decision understandably the host nati on will be anxious to be seen to be able to cope unaided with its internal affa irs at the first oppor tunity and there will be pressures both within the host nation and in this country to withdraw the troops and to conclude an expensive commitment the withdraw plan should be suffici ently flexible to allow for delay to meet an unex pected resurgence of insurgency 45 timing premature withdrawal can be as disa strous militarily as outstaying ones welcome can be harmful to relations with the host country politically prolonged military commitment inevitably produces some strain between the friendliest of allies and reluctance to remove troops when it is safe to do so may alienate moderate opinion and embarrass the civil authorities who ar the final inheritors of the si tuation the revocation of state of emergency must go hand in hand with the programme of returning the country to state of normality and the wit hdrawal of the military 46 methods of withdrawal the method and timing of the withdrawal will depend upon the speed with which the insurgency is defeated in various parts of the country in broad terms there are three options rapid single phase operation at the end of sudden small localised crisis at the lower end of the scale of scenarios discussed earlier b gradual determined and protracted insur gency is defeated gradually area by area as the rebels and their supporti ng political and supply organisations are methodically rooted out the military pres ence is scaled down and the civil police resume full responsibility for law and order the hand over to the police and civil authorities can be phased on geographical or functional basis or combination of the two when roles and tasks are passed back to the police one at time in each area as it is cleared gradual phased hand over in the latter manner is the more usual because it ensures t hat the police gain thorough grasp of each function within an area to consolidate t he security forces successes issue 20 mar 07 b 4 17 c partial this is accomplished in principle by changing the role of the military forces from direct aid to the civil power to indirect aid to the ci vil authorities thus replacing the image of force wit h one of peaceful assistance in practice it usually means withdrawing armed troops to positions out of sight of the public where they are readily available if needed while employing small numbers overtly on tasks in aid of the civil community 47 other forms of disengagement in some more recent circumstances it may not be appropriate to have suitable phased fo rms of withdrawal british troops in coalition of forces may have to withdraw from one area within theatre and move to another area possibly with significant changes to roe and potential engagements with insurgents these forms of withdrawal may well follow the sequenc of withdrawal in conventional operations there may also parti cular for isolated groups of soldiers be need for rapid disengagement either within theat re or as military force to leave the theatre altogether in the former case it will be necessary to use the tenets of force protection to evacuate the area and rejoin larger forces in the latter case there would probably be need to act as if in withdrawal during co mbat operations possibly with outside reinforcement from the uk or from other allies conclusion 48 this chapter has described in some detai l the strategic concept of countering an insurgency to some readers it may appear to be rather pedant ic rerun of previous ideas about countering insurgency when events and re cent experience points towards much changed and more rapid progression of events on near international scal this may well be the case and will be the subj ect of more detailed attention in the next more radical update of this publication however this c oncept does continue to be valid even if some parts of it may not be necessary or appropriate particularly when intervening in failed state where the armed forces and police may have collapsed and state authority and control is lost furthermore it would be useful in si ngle states where more classic form of insurgency could occur the recent insurre ction in nepal and the unrest in fiji are examples of this commander will need to develop and adjust his own considerations about an insurgency based on the circumstance s at the time and his own experience issue 20 mar 07 b 5 1 chapter 5 coordination to summarise the first requirement for the successful conduct of counter insurgency campaign is for the government to set up sound framework within which it can take pl ace this should consist of co ordinating machinery at every level for the direction of the campaign arrangements for ensuring that the insu rgents do not win the war for the minds of the people an intelligence organisation suited to the circumstances and legal system adequate to the needs of the moment general sir frank kitson1 section 1 the system of coordination purpose 1 suiting the circumstances as indicated in chapter 4 to execute the british or host governments national plan in all its aspects political economic security reconstruction and information policy an organisa tion has to be established to coordinate the activities of the civil admin istration and the security forces from the latters point of view it provides the forum for the discussion and reconciliation of operational and intelligence issues and priorities with the aim of formulating consistent policy which the civil authorities the police and the army can implement each in its own sphere but in the closest cooperation army officers who ma be involved in helping to create this coordinating machinery have to appreciate that the host countrys cu lture customs and political traditions are bound to be reflected in t he manner in which they run their affairs although the principles gover ning the conduct of counter in surgency operations have general relevance throughout the world their app lication particularly in the setting up of joint allied planning and liai organisation need to take ccount of local circumstances especially the constitution and legal system and how they m ould the method and means of government 2 roles the

representation at all levels committees should be established at each level of civil government where the civil administrati on and the security forces meet to formulate policy at the higher levels an

in t heir respective spheres the number and title of the committees established and their detailed modus operandi will vary the structure described below may serve as suitable model national level 4 national defence council an allied host government will probably already have established national defence council or some similar body to ensu re that the aims and priorities of the national plan are applied by ll government agencies with in their fields of responsibility additi onal points are that the chair will normally be taken by t he head of government and its permanent members will be the ministers in charge of the main departments of state the british ambassador or high commissioner may attend the council in an advisorary capacity and to watch ov er british interests b the chiefs of police and the rmed forces will be in attendance for consultation but are unlikely to participate in the decisionmaking process of what is essentially civil council for the determi nation implementation and coordination of government policy the senior british office r may attend in an advisorary capacity or give his advice direct to the host nati ons chiefs of staff outside the council c council decisions which are purely ci vil are implemented by the appropriate civil ministries decisions with operational implications are the responsibility of the defence councils national operations committee 5 national operations committee this is the executive in strument of the national defence council implementing its policy in the security forces sphere in that the committee should include representat ives of the ministries of home and foreign affairs of the po lice and the armed forces b allies contributing forces will be represented on this committee by their ambassadors or high commissioners in the ca of commonwealth nations if they do not attend the national defence council the allied contingent commanders will normally attend c the chairman may be the head of the ho sts government in his capacity as supreme commander of the armed forces or more usually someone appointed by him such as the chief of the host nation s defence staff if the latter he may be formally appointed director of operations issue 20 mar 07 b 5 3 6 the director of operations he will be appointed by the head of government unless the latter retains the post himself the c hoice of the director of operations depends on the nature of the governmen t personalities and on the current security situation and how it may develop if not t he head of government the direc tor of operations may not necessarily be the chief of the armed services or of the police but he will be linked to the overall command of the security forces whos composition and balance may influence the choice the director of operations is normally t he chairman of the national operations committee unless the post is held by the head of government 7 coalitions in the event of coa lition of allies perating in the country there will obviously be different coordination arrang ements but these them selves will depend on whether the coalition is supporting the national authorities or is acting as an occupying power in failed or failing state in prin ciple the same top level councils and committees should be formed in order to conduct and contro l the counter insurgency director of operations is critical to this process in th at unity of coalition command is necessary to ensure coherence across the spec trum of security operations who this person is will depend on many factors but the appointment will probably be crucial to the campaign lower levels 8 regional provincial and district committees fully integrated coordinating committees are necessary at each subordinate level based on civil administration and local government boundaries in regions provinces c ounties andor districts or whatever their local equivalents may be dditional features are that the lower level coordinating bodies are usually referred to as operations or action committees b the chairman is usually the senior offi cer of the local civ il administration in whose support the security forces are operating depending on the size of the area he could be minister appointed for the purpose provincial governor the chairman of county council or his chief executive officer c the local police and military comm anders and the intelligence and security organisation representatives will form the membership local civilian experts may either be full members or in attendance as the occasion demands british formation commanders of t he appropriate level would normally attend the appropriate host countrys committees d sometimes representatives of employ ers organisations and trades unions are coopted 9 town ward and village level smaller less formal committees are needed to coordinate civil police milit ary and intelligence operations at the lower levels without jeopardising security or creati ng cumbersome bureaucracy this is the level at which the national plan is implemented and has to be seen to succeed to retain the loyalty and support of the people it is important that local interest s are represented and that the people are identified with government policy failure at th is level spells defeat the insurgents can be expected to exploit any s hortcomings the chairman is normally the head of the civil administration perhaps the mayor the town clerk or the rural council issue 20 mar 07 b 5 4 chairman the membership reflects the pol ice military and other interests already discussed in paragraph 8 above the military repr esentative may be battalion or company commander depending on the sca of the emergency in the context of an allied operation the british represent ative at the appropr iate level of command would probably attend this committee section 2 the application of principles the difficulties 10 the human factor the application of the principl for coin operations and the consequent decisions resulting from them ma be difficult to accept and implement particularly for those who live in the affe cted areas it shoul d be remembered that principles are easier to affirm than to apply b in underdeveloped countries there could be shor tage of trained administrators which would hamper the development of any national plan to the insurgents advantage c established organisations and influentia l people may fear losing power and prestige legal complications interdepartment rivalries and dislike of change may frustrate necessary reforms d there will be need fo r tact understanding and compro mise as individuals and organisations are persuaded to give up some of their power and influence in the interests of greater efficiency and closer cooperation however should tact and reason fail to dispel personal and inte rdepartmental rivalries more ruthless approach may be needed to quell or remove uncooperative ements at least in an allbritish operation in an allied operation di sagreements which cannot be resolved locally would have to be referred up the chain of command through national channels for resolution at higher and perhaps political level everyone responsible for implem enting government policy should be thoroughly educated in the overa ll philosophy of the governm ents plan of campaign and kept briefed on current and planned operations so that their reactions to sudden crisis will promote the long term aims as well as solve the immediate problem f insurgent commanders and their staffs us ually remain in the same posts and in the same areas for considerable peri ods to build up wealth of background knowledge even though the po lice provide long term continuity within the security forces the army should aim for as much stab ility as possible especially in important posts as is consistent with career plann ing and the length of to urs in operational theatres g there are specific areas in which changes have to be ap proached in an atmosphere of ready comp romise and cooperation 1 administrative reorganisation issue 20 mar 07 b 5 5 2 boundaries 3 location of headquarters 11 administrative reorganisation in counter insurgency situation there may be opportunities to alter the admin istrative control of areas and regions but these need to be carefully thought out and agreed to avoid further so cial pitfalls the fo llowing points need to be borne in mind limit the number of new administrat ive organisations to be set up because they are costly in manpower and money nd take time to shake down make the maximum use of existing structures and av oid cutting across existing soundly based organisations b make use of the existing administra tive machinery and staffs as far as possible and adjusting them only where necessary in t he interests of greater efficiency will ensure continuity minimise institutional resistance and save scarce resources changes in organisation and pr ocedures should be limited to achieving better coordination quicker decisions and closer supervision of execution c joint secretariats with british representation when worki ng with an ally are needed at each level of civil government and security forces control to cope with the extra work in order to ensure that decis ions are implemented swiftly and with the least risk of compromise they are also useful for ensuring that everyone who needs to be informed is kept in the pictur for keeping check on progress and to enable problems to be identifi ed early enough to take timely remedial action d secretariats have to be kept small in the interests of efficiency and security in large secretariat much time is wast ed in coordinating business within it those who work in secretariats should take care not to usurp the functions of the staffs of the civil administration police and armed forces the civil ministries police and armed forces need to remain responsible for carrying out the work of their own organisa tions in cooperation with each other and not in competition to avoid the c onfusion of overlapping functions 12 boundaries civil administration police and rmed forces boundaries should be the same in the interests of lia ison planning and coor dination and to av oid operational and intelligence muddles and accidents police boundaries usually coinci with those of the civil administration in cases of disagree ment military boundaries should conform to the civilpolice ones because the latter are well established and will remain when the army withdraws occasionally it may be expedient to adjust boundaries in order to bring known insurgent organisation within the ar ea of responsibility of one commander however the case for sticking to establis hed boundaries whenever possible is strong one and is discussed further in paragraph 13 13 location of headquarters and th joint operations centre the joint operations centre at each level of command provides the fo cal point for the collectio n of information it also provides secure meeting place fo r the civil authoritie s police and military issue 20 mar 07 b 5 6 commanders and the staff machiner for disseminating decisions for implementation by all the various forces and organisations within the local boundary further points are that the joint operations centre should be located at the police headquarters well established organisation with easy access to police in formation and intelligence and which has its own communications plus outle ts on to the civil network in failed states it would be prudent to avoid utilising the same admi nistrative building used by the previous regimeauthorities to av oid being tarred with the same brush b the associated military headquarters f ormation or unit sh ould be set up next door with ready access to the joint operati ons centre if this is not feasible the military headquarters should be set up as near as possible and secure communications established between them c military and police comm anders or their deputies should spend significant part of their time in the joint operations centre all operati ons should be planned there but both military and police forces need to retain their own headquarters for the issue of orders day to day routine administration and logistic support d counter insurgency oper ations require the cooperation of many agencies which have their own communications systems not all of which are compatible with so many organisations and agencies involved there are bound to be increased security risks and the problems of overcrow ded accommodation it is essential to restrict the size of the staffs in the jo int operations centre to manageable proportions particularly in the operations room which controls the minute by minute activity on the ground in order to keep the noise leve l down to avoid congestion and to lessen the chance of inadvertently giving information away the chain of command 14 regional character of counter insurgency operations the system of making civil administration police and military boundar ies and the regional character of counter insurgency operations limit the scope for redeploy ment in an allied country this is matter for the host government but if british advice was requested it may be proffered on the following lines with the possible exception of the sc enario mentioned in pa ragraph 11 rather than alter boundaries to meet possibly fleeti ng operational needs it is better to reinforce formation area with extra units b should significantly larger force be r equired in region it may be necessary to upgrade the level of command with com parable upgrading of lower levels of command this ensures continuity of liaison intelligence work and operations between the civil authorities the police and t he military 15 direction in the circumstances of static framework commanders exercise control by written directives laying down over all policy and detailin g broad tasks within unit areas issue 20 mar 07 b 5 7 b frequent meetings and visits to keep in touch with the situation and to give specific orders for important operations fo r example those mounted to extend the area under government control or perhaps to exploit windfall of good intelligence to ambush or capture key insur gent figure or group or to seize supplies of food and arms 16 framework for direct ives and conferences the following is suggested framework for directives and routine meetings director of operatio ns policy directive issued initially and reviewed periodically perhaps quarterly unless major political decision requires quick revision b formation commanders directives based on the director of operations policy directive and issued in conjunction with it to implement that part of the overall plan appropriate to the formation area it may need more frequent revision to take account of new tasks changes in force levels boundaries and other factors which affect the local situation c daily staff conferences aimed to keep formati on commanders abreast of developments they are usually attended by police and civil administration representatives d daily operational meetings held in conjunction wit h the staff conferences or separately to discuss intelligence dev elopments and to issue orders for special operations for example to arrange night operation 17 routine committee meetings the decisions of regional or district meetings can be implemented either by issuing directive or at the daily conf erence or operational meeting at the appr opriate level 18 command and control much emphasis has been laid on the need for centralised direction and decision making however the function of the committee system is essentially to provide forum for planning and coordination the command function remains the prerogative and res ponsibility of each military and police commander or civil department head these officers and officials will be expected to consult one another before taking any initiatives or making any c hanges to previously agr eed policy or plans honest and wholehearted cooperat ion remains essential to maintain mutual confidenc between the three arms of the executive the civil administration the police and military forces the latter includes the host nations allies b prevent disputes and accidental engagements between the security forces this is especially important in the c ontext of operations conducted with allies c ensure that all the available civil po lice and military resources are available to implement the overall plan d avoid jeopardising the security of intelligence or intelligence sources issue 20 mar 07 b 5 8 19 rapid command reaction there will be occasions when quick decision is needed perhaps to exploit fleeti ng opportunity or to foil an expected insurgent initiative or change of plan if there is time for military commander to cons ult his superior or his committee members he will have to take time ly decision and act upon it provided that good understanding exists amongst the members of the local committee and within the chain of command and that some thought has been given on how to react to foreseeable contingencies the commanders decision should be sensible one military commanders have to consider that they can act quickly and decisively in an emergency without having to waste valuable time in consultations comm ander who tells his superior the police officer and if necessary the chairman of his commi ttee what he has done and why he has done it can expect rapid support in terms of reinforc ement and cooperation to rn the situation to good account incidents invari ably attract the attention of the media commanders and their public information staffs have to prepare brief quickly to explain the event accurately to forestall hostile propaganda and questioning issue 20 mar 07 b 6 1 operational considerations chapter 6 intelligence section 1 the preeminence of intelligence introduction 1 the need for intelligence good intelligence is vital in any phase of war in counter insurgency operations it will be in cons tant and continuous demand operations require steady success built up over time wh ich will wear down the insurgent movement restricting its capability and reducing its mora accurate intel ligence will permit commanders to conduct operations with precision reducing the detrimental effect on the local population and minimising casualties among friendly forces the combined effect will be to secure and maintain the morale among t he security forces and raise their standing with the civilian population effective and precis use of force will earn respect vital in the campaign for hearts and minds illdirected and in discriminate use of force will serve merely to alienate any local p opulation it may be appreciated t herefore that s ound intelligence is precursor to all counter insurgency operat ions it must be built up quickly and sustained efficiently from the start of campaign to help the reader glossary of more specialised abbreviations used in this chapter are at annex 2 intelligence support to operations thorough knowledge of the extent of the insurgency and the political and military aims command structures and logistic network of the insurgents should allow the state governm ent to develop longterm overall strategy and sensible military policies to defeat it at all levels in telligence will permit commanders to put the strategy and policies into practice by the defeat in detail of the insurgents by killing capturing or arresting individuals nd depriving them of tar gets intelligence the means of command and communication weapons ammunition food and other supplies defeat of all these elements will reduce the insurgents abilit to maintain campaign guidelines on intelligence support for c2w are given in annexes b c and d 3 intelligence in counter insurgency operations there is nothing radical in the application of the fundam entals of intelligence to count er insurgency campaign there are however three aspects which will carry gr eater emphasis than might be the case in conventional operations the dominance of human intelligence humint in lowlevel conflict b the influence of the civilian authori ty on counter insurgency operations and the consequent constraints and complic ations on intelligence gathering c the appearance that at mes operations are in support of intelligence rather than the reverse 4 the importance of humint the purpose of intelligence in any phase of war is to determine the enemy threat to assess his c apability and his intentions so that the commander may develop plan to bring about it s defeat in counter insurgency operations issue 20 mar 07 b 6 2 this is equally the case the insurgent has to be defeated militarily or politically and this can be done only if commanders are given sufficient k nowledge of him by the intelligence staff where the insurgent lives am ong the population perhaps without uniform or recognisable military structure hi s capabilities and intentions are likely to be determined only from information provided by the population and those in dividuals able to move in close proximity to him sophisticated intell igence sensors crucial in gener war normally cannot match the humint agent informer informant surveillanc or the reports from routine police or army patrols timeconsuming collation of detail and painstaking anal ysis may then prove the key to unravelling im portant aspects of the insurgents activity 5 civilian control intelligence gathering in counter insurgency campaign will in all probability lack the freedom that may be enjoyed in combat operations the primacy of civilian political control the balance between effort aimed at defeating the insurgency and that expended on crime prev ention and resolution the rule of law and the need for admissible evidence for prosecution will all c onstrain the gathering of intelligence military intelligence staffs may well find themselves in unfamiliar circumst ances subordinated to civilian control and methods of operating which may have conflicting aims and priorities 6 principles of intelligence the principles of intelligence are summarised below their application in combination with the four stages of the intelligence cycle direction collection processing and dissemination provides the structure within which the intelligence organisation operates this chapter follows this struct ure examining all intelligence aspects of counter insurgency operat ions as they occur within it the eight principles of intelligence are centralised control b responsiveness c objectivity d systematic exploitation security f accessibility g timeliness h continuous review 7 the reader should also refer to other army level publications for further information on the application of intelligence during operations section 2 direction intelligence architecture and th organisation of intelligence 8 design of an intelligence architecture early in counter insurgency campaign it will be necessary to establish chain of perational command which reflects the political issue 20 mar 07 b 6 3 and military requirements of th state and any allies committed to the campaign when this has been established there will be need fo r supporting structure of intelligence staffs placed at appropriate levels in order to provide timely responsive intelligence for commanders it is inevitable th at an intelligence stru cture will develop with the campaign the architecture has to anticipate this and deploy progressive phas of capability which are readily linked together in parallel with these staffs communications network which will permit the rapid efficient passage of inte lligence data of differe nt types upwards downwards and sideways throughout the intelligenc community needs to be constructed it should also cross national militarycivilian and rvice boundaries so that it can link staffs and agencies at every level unlike the military chain of command which is purely hierarchical this network should be construct ed on the principle of providing intelligence from wherever it is available to wherever it is required this may result in it bypassing some levels of command in order for it to reach the appropriate user this skipechelon working will be aided by information being available on the pull rather than the push principle at whatever level of command may need it the in telligence architecture is not simply communications network it incl udes the allocation of areas of intelligence responsibility air to each level of command it specifies precisely where author ity to task individual collection assets is to lie and it allocates th reporting authority ie who is responsible for the provision of fused intell igence reports based on information from collectors the intelligence architecture should form an annex to the operational direct ive under the title of the intelligence management plan imp 9 constraints there will be constraints on this fr ee flow of data caused by the necessity to apply the need to know principle vital where humint source protection is of such paramount importance as is likely to be t he case in counter insurgency operations some intelligence perhaps that provided from strategic sources may not be made available to all intelligence sta ffs at every level for exampl material with the uk eyes only caveat may be made available from t he uk exclusively for its own national commanders there will be n eed for special handling procedu res for this and other material in such circumstanc operational intelligence support group oisg may be established within which t here may be humint support grou p hsg cryptological support group csg providing sigint or an im int support group isg if specialist intelligence segregated compartments are necessa ry then they must be deployed but their use should always be kept under close review when operating with allies as they can encourage exclusivity and reduce the mutual trust so necessary for effective cooperation 10 communications networks inevitably extensive inte lligence data networks will place large burden on the communications availa ble this should be borne in mind when designing the intelligence architecture with as much use being made of existing systems as possible in coin campai gn the usage by intelligence or ganisations of available bandwidth will outstrip that of all other users due to the need for access to national databases imagery products and the output of national agencies this is particularly the case when satellite communicati ons are established in the theat re once forces from the uk have been deployed centralised control 11 the need for centralised control intelligence assets are normally centralised at the highest appropriate level of command in order to be available across the widest possible area of operations in counter insur gency operations there are further imperatives issue 20 mar 07 b 6 4 for centralised control where several intelligence organisations are working against common target there is the dan ger of overlap some duplication is always necessary in order to improve the evaluation of informat ion by its being confi rmed from more than single source the danger lies in there being single sour ce exploited by more than one agency each in ignorance of oneanother this ca n lead to false confirmation and in turn gives the source greater credibilit than may be its worth there is also the undesirability of wastage of effort and resources 12 the director of intelligence in designing the intelligenc organisation decision has to be made to coordinate all intelligence staffs military and civilian local and allied centrally ideally single director of intellig ence should be established at national or coalition level with similar pos ts at each lower level of comm and perhaps those of civilian administrative authority or military command dependi ng upon the circumstances integration the committee system 13 establishing an intelligence committee the director of inte lligence at national level should ideally chair an intelligence co mmittee subordinate intelligence committees would then meet at eac h lower level each committee wo uld owe allegiance to the next higher level which in turn woul d be responsible for the effect iveness and coordination of the intelligence efforts of those belo w them committees should meet regularly if there is to be useful exchange and discussio n of intelligence and good wo rking relationship between civil authorities police and militar intelligence staffs established 14 membership of the in telligence committee membership of the intelligence committee should be arranged mutua lly between the local intelli gence services civilian and military and those of british and other allied intelligence staffs 15 coordination i ntelligence committees should ensure that civil police and army boundaries are the same and accord with the civil authority and security force command system this may not always be possible b information and intelligence flow downwards as well as upwards and sideways to neighbouring co mmittees where appropriate c representatives of government departm ents and local experts are coopted for special advice with due regard for security they might come from customs services and coastguards such fields as the highways department rail services inland water transport civil engineering telecommunications power and water suppliers and from wider ci rcle of the local community which might include farmers businessmen and other traders the committee system 16 functions of an intelligence committee the functions of intelligence committees are as follows at the nationalcoalition level to keep the government the civil and military commanders or chiefs of staff and operat ions staffs informed of all aspects of issue 20 mar 07 b 6 5 intelligence and security operations and to fa cilitate the exchange and provision of the intelligence necessary for the pr osecution of strategic campaign b at subordinate levels to keep thei r parallel operations committees and the next higher intelligence committees fully informed with relevant intelligence for operational planning c to advise operational staffs on security and protective measures d to develop the collection plan agains t which the collection agencies will be tasked through the intelligence staffs to di rect the collection agencies allocating tasks and priorities and time within wh ich the information must be obtained f where possible to establish common procedures for all local and allied intelligence and security organisations g to provide an appropriate dissemination service to commanders 17 central intelligence staffs subordinate to the committe there should be centralised integrated staff capable of performi ng collection coordination and intelligence requirements management ccirm database management and fusion functions on behalf of all the intelligence sta ffs at that particular level at the outset as part of the intelligence plan clear orders should be given on the level at which responsibility for maintenance of master databas will be performed it is ess ential to prevent every level of intelligence staff running databases in parallel although it will never be possible to avoid some duplication of recordkeeping there shoul d be minimum with single probably the highest local level maintaining the master database with subordinate and other levels submitting changes to it in the form of data change requests maintenance of single database is facilitated by the pull rather than the push method of information retrieval and by close cooperation between all collectors and analytical staffs 18 command and control while intelligence committees give general direction laying down policy and allotting particular aims collection tasks and priorities they do not exercise command command and control rema ins the prerogative of the commanders civilian and military over bot h their respective intelligence staffs and their collection agencies factors affecting integration 19 although single centrally controlled integrated intelligence organisation answering to director of intelligence is the ideal the circumstances prevailing in state may not be conducive to such system particularly if british contingent is part of an international allied force in which the senior british office r may have limited influenc where it cannot be achieved compromise solution has to be brokered between the interested parties the establishment of centra lised system may be affected by an or all of the following factors issue 20 mar 07 b 6 6 the effectiveness and reliability of the states security forces and its intelligence and security organisation b willingness by all parties to cooperate to share information and details of perhaps sensitive loca l sources other intelligence tails and particularly at the higher levels matters of political sensitivity c the different points of view and doctr ine of the security forces local and allied because the states security forces in particular the police must continue to live and work among the population after the eventual parture of the allies they will be subject to greater inter nal pressures and constraints d the degree of authority egated to officials at each level of the command structure national provin cial regional and district the integrity of particula rly local intelligence office rs and the vulnerability of intelligence services to corruption infiltration subversion and apathy f the sensitivity of military commanders towards the local police forces which may resent the military view of their area of oper ations as being their patch in which they alone hold sway this can cause friction with local po lice whose continued operations in the area perhaps in isolatio n and with consultation can in turn irritate the military it is important that intelligence sta ffs overcome this problem as failure to integrate will seriously impede the intelligence effort 20 joint intelligence cell whether or not an intelligence committee is established the normal focus for intelligence for british forces will be the joint intelligence cell jic which will be located alongside the joint operations cell joc forming the hub of any joint forces headquarters jfhq within the jic will be the senior inte lligence officer and his staff this will incl ude ccirm and the all sour ces cell asc in which fusion and bulk of the analysis will be conducted representatives of the agenc ies for example hsg csg and isg will be located in the asc in some cases it will be necessary for these elements to be afforded their own segregated area with mo re stringent access cont rols than pertain in the rest of the asc see paragr aph 9 above similar constrai nts may apply if uknic is deployed factors affecting organisation 21 general whatever the design of the intelligence architec ture the organisation and the sources and agencies deployed there are number of factors which will be common these need to be considered at the outset and plans made for their inclusion in the structure continuity units should be kept in the same area of responsibility aor for as long as possible this ensures that they become fam iliar with the local inhabitants the other security forces ch as the police and the terrain and infrastructure they are better able to get the measure of their opponents and they acquire the ability to develop information into in telligence in short they get feel for what is normal as background against which to observe the abnormal regrettably operational and roulement mo ves are inevitable during the period issue 20 mar 07 b 6 7 when units change over intelligence corps continuity ncos concos can provide the essential element of continuity concos who remain in single aor throughout an extended tour in the theatre should acquire an intimate knowledge of the local situation in their area which t hey can then pass on to the intelligence officers and the commanders of incoming units b flexibility just as an intelligence organis ation is designed to meet specific situation so it has to be receptive to the adjustments needed when the insurgent threat develops in new directions themes strategies and tactics or the situation changes in some other way such c hanges in the situation may make fresh demands upon specialist services such as imagery interpretation and interrogation commanders and their intelligence staffs need to be able to respond quickly to new circumstances by redeploying resource s and where necessary adjusting the functions they fulfill c information handling the intelligence system w hatever its shape has to be able to cope with an incr easing amount of informati on as units with growing experience become more produc tive and better focused with time it is to be hoped the population becomes sufficiently conf ident to pass more information to the security forces as this happens suffici ent intelligencetrained personnel should be made available to collate the additional info rmation analyse and integrate it interpret its meaning and disseminate the resulting inte lligence in time for it to be used operationally d specialists the training of analysts so urce handlers surveillance operators imagery interpreters linguists interrogators and other intelligence specialists must be developed as early as possi ble if the inevitable shortage of such skilled personnel which exists at the beginning of any campaign is to be overcome the careful husbandry of scarce skills is necessary throughout campaign but particularly essential at the beginning til more trained specialists become available in addition to the normal comple ment of intelligence st affs there will be requirement for some augment ation with specialists whos task will be liaison with local intelligence organisations such perso nnel are likely to deploy into the country at the very beginning of or even before the campaign these vital posts need to be filled with welltrained exper ts capable of acting with degree of initiative and away from normal military stru cture they will include 1 military intelligence liaison officers milo milos ar military officers on the establishment of the fence intelligence staff dis controlled through di commitments in peacetime they maintain watching brief on developments in their particular geographi cal area of interest and are capable of deploying quickly with the minimum of support ideally milo might be deployed in advance of the arrival of any deployed british force in order to establish liaison with local authorities primarily for intelligence purposes but also to ensure the smooth passage of troops into the theatre the milo should be equipped with united king dom military intelligence support terminal ukmist which will give hi m access to defence intelligence staff dis and other data incl uding imagery and the means to transmit reports ukmist provides at minimum core in telligence production capability and its own communications on arrival of the main body of troops milo will assist issue 20 mar 07 b 6 8 commander by developing liaison links later the milo will hand over his responsibilities to the formati on intelligence staff and withdraw 2 local agency liaison personnel military liaison personnel will usually be deployed to the local security services and police special branch or its equivalent with the principal task of preparing for the expansion of the intelligence organisation in the theatre others will be deployed on covert passive surveillance cps or covert information and intelligencegathering tasks these personnel wi ll be provided by intelligence corps field security units and defence humint organisations such as the specialist intelligence wing siw of the defence intelligence an d security centre disc such personnel may carry titles such as milit ary intelligence officer mio or force intelligence nco finco all are likely to be both linguists and humint specialists like milos they should so be deployed early the intelligence product of such liaison and covert inte lligence specialists will be passed to the intelligence staffs through hsg which wi ll also be the focus for tasking from ccirm theatre liaison if the intelligence organisation is to work effectively and efficiently good liaison between all intel ligence organisations and agencies local allied civilian and military is paramount t he specialists referred to above are vital elements in establishing effective liaison with local intelligence agencies the sensitivities of such intelligence liaison duties require the liaison officer to have wide experience of militar capabilities and knowl edge of intelligence f security the need for security especially source protection has to be paramount within the intelligence organisa tion and among those to whom it is disseminated the need to know principl has to be enforced and clear guidelines given on dissemination particularly to local civilian authorities composition of an in telligence organisation 22 intelligence staff organisation there is fixed establishment for an intelligence organisation nor is there any predetermined scale on which to base its composition its size will be determined by the extent and nature of the threat the commanders requirements the architecture necessary to support operations and the intelligence collection agencies which can be m ade available as two ca mpaigns are ever fought in quite the same circumstances it follows t hat the intelligence organisation for each new commitment should be customdes igned although past campai gns will provide guidance where there are useful parallels the size of any british cont ribution to counter insurgency campaign will have to be designed by consultation between the senior intelligence officer and the intelligence staff of the state concerned almost certainly the size of intelligence staffs will grow and wil l be considerably bigger as the campaign develops than was the case at the outset this likely expansion should if possible be allowed for when allocating worki ng space and other resources 23 intelligence support organisation the kind of specialist support that the intelligence staff would need was covered in paragraph 21 above issue 20 mar 07 b 6 9 tasking 24 commanders intelligence requirements direction will begin with determination of the commanders intelligence requirements these will be the product of his mission analysis and should be discussed with the senior intelligence officer who will be able to ensure that they are accurately focused it may not be possible in the early stages of campaign to state clearly the commanders intelligence requirements as insufficient operational information may be av ailable on which to plan where this is the case the intelligence staffs have the responsibility of gi ving guidance to commanders on the kind of intelligence that they will require this may be done by means of an intelligence estimate an intelligence estimate takes the commander s plan matter how broadly stated and compares it with existing intel ligence on the insurgency conc urrent with the intelligence estimate the staff should appl intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb the intelligence estimate and ipb together will give the intelligence staff good idea of the gaps in their knowledge of the insurgency and these can form the basis of the initial collection plan it is likely that particularl in the initial stages there will be shortfa ll of intelligence the probability is that ther will be more basic intellig ence available than current intelligence the preparation of an initial collection plan will also give some indication of the necessary collection assets and intelligenc architecture that will be needed for the campaign 25 direction to the collectors even when an intelligence organisation has been established information does not flow automatica lly into the hands of the intelligence staff and thus to commander if direction is poor the intelligence organisation may be in danger of collecting large quantities of irrelevant information commander has to give his intelligence staff clear directi on and firm indication of the prio rities to be allotted to his intelligence requirements on receipt of t he commanders intelligen ce requirements the intelligence staff will first with the aid of the inte lligence estimate and ipb identify gaps in the intelligence already held these gaps s hould be filled by asking collection agencies to collect against them the questions put to the collectors are known as information requirements ir and thei r collection is planned carefully by the senior intelligence officer in conjunction with his ccirm staff who wil l coordinate the collect ion plan and irs and manage the intelligence r equirements the resultant colle ction plan has to in turn be approved by the commander prior to collectors rece iving their direction from the intelligence staffs the collection plan will normally be main tained on collection worksheet which will show the allocation of tasks in order of priori ty to individual coll ection agencies and the time and form in which information is to be reported section 3 collection 26 aspects of collection there are two aspects of collection exploitation by intelligence staffs of their sources and agenc ies and the timely delivery of collected information to intelligence staffs for subsequent processing into intelligence or when appropriate directly to weap on systems collection will be based on the collection plan drawn up by the intelligence staffs under the di rection of commanders and the intelligence committees during the direction phase issue 20 mar 07 b 6 10 sources and agencies 27 humint as outlined above the most effective source of intelligence will be that derived from the direct questioning of persons this is likely to include the following british and allied military sources this will include all r anks of the security forces especially those whose duties re quire them to move among the local population on patrols on collect ion of locallyproduced suppl ies on liaison with local authorities dockers airport workers aid work ers and the like it is vital that all such persons are thoroughly briefed on the gaps in intelligence which their duties might enable them to fill they should be made intelligence aware so that they are always prepared to report information whic h may appear trivial but which when added to other pieces may be important b local military forces this will include military paramilitary auxiliaries and reserves they will be of value both on du ty and when on leave like their british and allied counterparts they should be encouraged to become intelligence aware attempts should be made systematically to brief those going on leave locally and debrief them on return c military surveillance all the usual humint sour ces of observation posts op mounted and dismounted patrols rec onnaissance units air reconnaissance and troops supplemented by specialist surv eillance equipment are equally useful in counter insurgency operations they hav to be tasked and briefed with great care because insurgents operate more covertly than an enemy in co nventional warfare and can be harder to detect units will frequently be tasked to mount operations specifically to obtain information or to gi ve cover to other intelligencegathering operations for example the inserti on or retrieval of covert ops d covert surveillance siw will provide specialist personnel for cps in addition special forces sf have long hi story of success in t he role of static covert surveillance and the ex ploitation of the information which they obtain the use of sf for intelligencegathering and off ensive operations needs to be carefully coordinated with g3 when sf are deployed it will be normal for there to be sf liaison officers at the hq of the formation to which they are assigned irregular forces units may also be raised loca lly from the police the host nations army and from friendly sections of the civilian population for the purpose of defensive or offensive operations against in surgents defensive operations include the guarding of key points and storage areas irregular forces may also be formed from exinsurgents deserters or t hose who have been captured or have surrendered and who can be per suaded to serve the government they have role both in intelligencegathering and in off ensive operations such use of irregular troops is however relatively sophisticated and these operations can be developed only over protracted period in an environm ent which is very well understood by the intelligence organisation f interrogation prisoners can be an important source of information interrogation in counter insurgency cam paign can however be sensitive matter politically and is likely be subject to rigorous oversight both officially from the local issue 20 mar 07 b 6 11 government and unofficially from the media it is important to be fully aware of the legal basis under which interrogation takes place systematic interrogation of captured insurgents can have ex cellent results particularl in building picture of command structures communications and other aspects of the insurgents infrastructure in lowlevel conflict interr ogation is less likely to produce intelligence of immediate tactical value simply because insurgent methods of operating normally involve very restricted circle wit hin which future plans are discussed in general terms but not always so interrogat ion should be capable of producing evidence which will be acceptable in court it is vital therefore that it is conducted strictly in accordance with ru laid down by the host nations judiciary where necessary the defence humint unit dhu can provide both advice and interrogation teams g debriefing dhu will also provide def ence debriefing team ddt personnel skilled in debriefi ng willing subjects these wil l normally include british subjects with recent know ledge of the hostcountry and ev ents within such people might include travellers airline crews expatriate workers and members of british diplomatic missions if such people have remained in the country then debriefing team often called country liaison team clt may deploy for debriefing operations in the hoststate later in the campaign debriefing may be extended to foreign nationals in the uk with recent appropriate experiences h humint support both interrogation and debrie fing require close steerage and extensive intelligence support if they are to be effective liaison representatives will be established at appropr iate jics and will need extensive analytical and research support i captured documents equipment and stores these are valuable sources troops have to be trained to realise their worth and encouraged to make them available to intelligence staffs at the earliest oppor tunity documents found on suspects may assist in the questioning of prisoners by providing interrogators with information which they can exploit during interview j local police forces local police are an excellent source of information but they need to be handled with great sensitivity care should be taken not to duplicate the information collection from police of ficers being undertaken by their own intelligence staff police special branch equivalents are very likely to be handling their own sources among the population it is probable that there will be strong reluctance to disclose these sources to inte lligence staffs but their tasking and the information they provide should be coor dinated and fused by the centralised intelligence machinery k local population undoubtedly the local population will if systematically exploited be the best source of humint great care shoul d be taken in developing the local population as sources and close coordination with cal intelligence agencies the police spec ial branch in particular needs to be arranged if difficulties are to be avoided the insurgents ma use bogus informants to plant false information or uncover the sourcehandlin g network local informants should be given the opportunity to contact the security forces confidentially this can be done by making confidential telephone lines or post office box numbers available and by issue 20 mar 07 b 6 12 keeping routine military patrols in close pr oximity to the populatio n doing so will permit budding informant to pass information without unduly drawing attention to himself if possible and where necessary troops should be encouraged to obtain at least some knowledge of the local languag informers however may still be afraid that their voices may be recognised by lephone operators or their writing identified by postmen people who have good cause to fear reprisals should be given the opportunity to contact the security force wit h information for example at road blocks or on cordon and search operations where t heir interviews can be concealed under the guise of interrogation the intel ligence organisation will be capable of developing system for making contact wit h or being contacted by sympathisers l informers and agents much of the useful information which reaches the intelligence staff will come from informe rs and agents small number of well placed and reliable agents fostered or inf iltrated into an insurgent movement in peacetime can provide information of value we ll beyond their cost pa rticularly if at the pivotal points in the insu rgents command if it is po ssible to expand sufficiently the agent network at the t op level of the insurgents command information may be provided on the development of the command structur and organisation the identification of important leaders the system of liaison between the military wing and the insurgent political leadership and th methods of acquiring funds food and arms at lower echelons informers are us eful for providing information on for example personalities tactical plans weapon and food hides at these levels if continuity is to be maintained it is im portant that the agent network expands at similar rate to that of the insurgent move ment otherwise their relative value will diminish the problem with acting on informati on supplied by an individual is source protection in an insurgent organisation the circle of know ledge is kept small if an informer reports the move of weapon to new hide for exam ple perhaps only three insurgents have been made aware the courier the commander and the quartermaster subsequent imm ediate operation by the security forces to recover the weapon might raise suspicions which w ould be on just three people this could seriously jeopardise the security of the sour ce care must therefore be exercised in such matters and the advice of the hs g sought when planning operations m patrolling at times it may well appear to the soldier fighting insurgency that more of his efforts are being expended on gathering information than in actually combating the insurgents this may well be the case for in operations where the reliance on humint is paramount the footsol dier becomes the eyes and ears of an intelligence organisation the value of extensive patrolling and subsequent briefing may not readily be apparent to him w hen for example the aim might be to develop picture of patterns of insurgent behaviour against background of normality over protracted period rather than shortterm reconnaissance for immediate offensive action the need to wi n the hearts and mind s of the population in order to weaken sympathy with insu rgents and increase th potential flow of information may also be bur den on the soldiers patienc and morale as he finds himself adopting less aggressive stanc than he might otherwise have chosen 28 coordination whenever humint sources are to be exploited it is imperative that all humint collection agencies oper ating in the theatre effect liaison closely with each other this liaison is vital to ensure issue 20 mar 07 b 6 13 deconfliction source should ever be run by more than single agency if single source works for more than one agen cy it is possible that his reports can unwittingly confirm themselves this fa lse confirmation sometimes called false collateral as well as being danger to the intelligence proce ss can cause the source to gain greater cr edence than his worth furthermore if the situation becomes known to the insurgents they can exploit the false collateral at the expense of the security forces b veracity there is always the risk of source if not properly handled producing information which is unreliable or even acting as double agent tasking must be rigidly controlled to reduce the like lihood of this happeni ng reliability of sources must always be evaluated with great care and records maintained by the humint agency c security the smaller the circle of people knowing the identity of source the safer can he operate if sources are to be maintained and confidence spread sourceprotection must be effective and be seen to be effective 29 open source intelligence intelligence derived from open sources osint is playing an increasingly import ant role in all phases of combat operations nowhere however will the role of the m edia be more important than in counter insurgency not only will the actions of the security forces be scrutin ised closely it will be pored over at length by press and current affairs televi sion and radio programmes the wo rld over and will play major part in forming public opinion rela tions with the media are not the direct responsibility of the intelligence staff they should remember however that reporters can get access where security forces often cannot furthermore press teams are often out and about for protracted periods warm relationshi p built up between in telligence staffs and individual members of the press corps can reap dividends in the form of lowlevel information many british journalists wi ll cover the campaign for an extended period visiting the country for perhaps weeks at time before returning to britain if an intelligence staff develops sufficient relation ship with individual mem bers of media team information might be forthcoming in return for perhaps sanitised update or security brief on their return to the theatre of operat ions intelligence staffs should not forget however that the media do not collect intel ligence merely information and media reports should always be regarded with caution they are likely to include bias to some particular purpose rather than be straight reporting of unabridged or une laborated facts commanders may have seen the morning televi sion news coverage of the campaign immediately prior to being briefed by the staff this can inevitably lead to staffs having to respond to press reports rather than leading on subjects of their choosing with unfortunate results intelligence officers should take steps to avoid briefings developing in this way local media in particular will have vital role to play in the hearts and minds campaign and intelligence staff can expect to play part in this with operati ons and psyops staff 30 opensource publications in addition to the current reporting of news teams in theatre there is likely to be considerable opensource materi produced prior to the campaign which will go some wa to meeting intelligence staffs requirements for basic intelligence this can include atlases encycl opedias travel books statistical summaries and host of other reference books produced by the specialistinterest press covering the armed forces the political economic geographica l situations inside the country and much of value issue 20 mar 07 b 6 14 31 insurgent use of the media it has to be remembered that the insurgent movement will also attempt to make use of the media to spread its own views and discredit those of the government and the security forces in telligence staffs should attempt to catalogue insurgent publications they can sometimes reveal aspects of the insurgent otherwise unknown imagery intelligence 32 imagery intelligence as source intelligence derived from imagery imint will play an important role in counter insurgen cy operations coverage will include imagery ranging from mapquality prints fr om airborne platforms both sate llite and aircraft some of very high resolution to thermal imagery and infrared ir pictur imagery is excellent at detecting bodies which are wa rmer than their surroundings such as people concealed in dense foliage or warm vehicle engine ir imagery is capable of detecting disturbed soil valuable for detecting buried arms caches command wires for booby traps and other insurgent devices collection platforms will include satellites strategic aircraft tactical air reconnaissance tar aircraft helicopters and unmanned airborne vehicles uav such as phoenix ops and other re connaissance troops can expect to be equipped with handheld cameras video recorders equipment and image intensifiers ii coordination of imint is the task of an isg rmally found from within the resources of the joint air reconnaissance intelligence centre jaric where raf aircraft with reconnaissance role are deployed so too will reconnaissance intelligence cell ric it is at the ric that the firs tline analysis of the results of reconnaissance sorties will be performed there will be co nstant demand for photographic coverage of areas of operations the isg will be able to provide inte lligence derived from the analysis of all kinds of imagery much analysis will be done however not on wet film that is photographic negative or print but on soft copy images on computer screen although prints of images can be made available care should be taken to ensure that they are demanded only when necessary for example as briefi ng aids prints should not be demanded as proof of intelligence reports as matter of cour the time taken to interpret results of an imint task is considerably lengthened when prints of the im agery are required signals intelligence 33 signals intelligence sigint plays vital role in wlevel conflict the immediate value of sigint may be less apparent insur gent groups will however have need to communicate and when they do vi any electronic medium they are vulnerable to intercept besides deriving intelligence from communica tions comint sigint analysts will exploit emissions from radars and other electronic emitters this ectronic intelligence elint can enable the detection of for example r adiocontrol devices and missile control guidance and targetseeking radars where s igint collection is envisaged csg will be available to coordinate its collection and to interpret the results within the asc section 4 processing 34 processing as discipline the processing stage of the intelligence cycle incorporates the work of the intelligence staff in collation analysis integration or synthesis and interpretation of information issue 20 mar 07 b 6 15 35 processing staff the processing staff will normally be trained intelligence operators often from all three services s upported by specialists in the collection disciplines where appropriate specialists fr om other arms and services will join the analytical staff for example engineer intel ligence operators with their specialist knowledge of particularly terrain mine warfare and search ammunition technicians with their training in explosives firing devic and weapon insp ection are able to develop weapons intelligence in conjunction with the police forensic scientists this discipline based on such items as weapon matching will be able to trace weapons to their sources of supply to rounds they have fired explosives and detonators to their origin and so on 36 the intelligence office the best results will be obt ained from those intelligence organisations which are fully integrated work to centrallyagreed collection plan employ suitable personnel fusion and database m anagers analysts and other intelligence specialists and approach their task in structured objective and systematic way 37 fusion one of the critical tasks performed in th asc is that of fusion this is the collation of reports and information from t he separate singlesour ce agencies humint sigint and imint into single assessment ea ch agency produces its own view of an event or activity and reports it to the intelli gence staff this is known as singlesource picture compilation the fused assessmen t that is the assessment made by the comparison of more than one singlesource report becomes the recognised tactical ground or maritime or air pi cture the recognised picture will be produced at the level with responsibility for reporting usually the level maintaining t he database as it is there that the broadest view will be this then becomes the authoritative view which forms the basis for assessments by all subordinate intelli gence staff and will be disseminated upwards downwards and to the flanks in the form of in telligence summaries intsums which are often pictorial 38 databases one of the fundamentals of effectiv processing is the maintenance of an efficient database in counter insurgen cy campaign there will be plethora of small apparently insignificant and connected data only effe ctive collation and cross referencing will enable analysts to assess the significance of individual pieces and make best use of them nowadays it is likely that the database will be held in electronic form on computer ideally this will be available throu ghout the user community to all the analysts the specialists and if possible to subordinate intelligence staffs it should be decided at the very start at which level re sponsibility for maintaining all the records will lie all other levels should have some preferably direct read only or limited write access ideally on the pull principle the database itself should be constructed and maintained with care it must be accessible to from as wide community as possible thus centra lisation is critical it will be worth some effort to ens ure that the initial design is right that the software can meet the requirement or if this cannot be done that it can be amended or updated effectively as experience in its use grows to hope to transfer re cords from redundant system to new one in midca mpaign is not realistic reco rds will be lost or become corrupted and efficiency will suffe r provision has also to be made for interrogating national databases and those of co llection agencies all this will require deta iled consideration careful planning stringent security r egimes and heavy reliance on an extensive communications network intelligence databases are vulnerable they have to be well protected against fluctuations and cuts in the power supply and against viruses and unauthorised importation of software informa tion must be backed up regularly and the backup tapes stored separately under secure and fireproof conditions the database issue 20 mar 07 b 6 16 manager should be selected with care he t he users and technicians have to be allowed access only in controlled and monitored environment section 5 dissemination 39 responsibility dissemination of intelligence to subordinate commanders is the responsibility of the director of intelligence at the highest level and of chief intelligence officers at subordinate levels where inte lligence committees are tablished individual intelligence chiefs of the separate services r epresented will accept res ponsibility for briefing their own commanders 40 use of intelligence architecture it should be emphasised that intelligence should flow not necessarily in hierarchical m anner as is the case with orders along an operational chain of command but quickly and efficiently from whomever holds it to whomever needs it this will mean that on occasion it will bypass some levels of command this principle is ea sier to effect if information can be pulled from the user rather than be pushed by the holder where appropriate graphical dissemination for example pictorial intelligence summaries picintsums should be used as these are the most readily assimilated th is is greatly aided by the use of information technology intsums should be disseminated at regular intervals these can be supplemented by detailed reports on specific to pics for example insurgent orbats or incidents as required often these too can be dissemi nated regularly perhaps weekly as with intelligence reporting in any phase of operations care has to be taken to avoid circular reporting in which parts of summary from one intelligence staff are plagiarised in another and return to the originator as apparent confi rmation of the original this problem is particularly acute in combined operations where the different national authorities include reports from third parties in their own summaries the best defence against this is clear orders for reporting authority and thorough knowledge on the part of intelligence officers of the sources and agencies avai lable to all the intelligence st affs providing reports for the theatre 41 security while intelligence is of use only in the hands of operational decision makers its dissemination should be closely controlled sourceprotection must always be in the front of the intelligence officers mind if source is at risk intelligence should be sanitised or disguised in such way as to conceal its source access to intelligence in such circumstances should be restricted to those with real need to know security of intelligence needs to always be balanced against the value to be gained from its dissemination agencies generally have strict guidelines for dissemination of intelligence in an emergency perhaps wh lives are at risk intelli gence officers need to acquaint themselves with these acti on on procedures so that em ergency dissemination can take place with the minimum of delay section 6 training 42 predeployment training all those involved in the direction collection processing and dissemination of intelligence should deploy to the theatre having made thorough preparation they need to be clear on their role in the intelligence organisation and have had the opportunity to r ehearse the issues with which they will be dealing with those to whom they will be worki ng chief intelligence officers in particular should take the time to examine the forthc oming operation against the fundam entals of intelligence which issue 20 mar 07 b 6 17 are the same for any phase of war and attempt to order their thoughts on architectures and intelligence support in such way that they can see clearly what infrastructure will be necessary to meet their aim of supporting the commanders plan those personnel with role which will require them to effect liaison with othe r authorities in the united kingdom should have had the opportunity to make contac t with them to discu ss the issues and particularly agree on the means with which they will communicate ideally they should have the opportunity to exercise using sim ilar communications systems before departure 43 background intelligence military staff should be as thoroughly briefed as possible on the situation in the theatre of operations prior to deploymen t local companies will be able to assist with individual and unit training on intelligence matters current affairs and other aspects of the insurgency 44 specialist skills military staff with specialist skills should ensure that as much training as possible is done prior to arrival in theatre problems are much easier to solve particularly those involving technical equipmen t in benign environ ment where extensive support facilities exist than after arrival th is will apply also to those members of an intelligence organisation who will be requir ed to use computers and other types of information technology it there are mu ltitude of different systems with varying functionality and connectivity thorough knowledge of them on the par t of users markedly increases their value 45 intelligence at unit level further aspects of unit intelligence and security training are covered in other publicat ions published by the army section 7 difficulties facing an intelligence organisation 46 nonoperational requirement although the immediate r equirement at the start of an emergency will be for the existing intelligence organi sation to expand and produce intelligence to support commanders for military and police operations it will have to continue to provide other strate gic political and economic inte lligence the intelligence organisation will be severely stretched in the expansion phase and the recruitment of additional staff may give the insurgents an opportunity to infiltrate their agents 47 security of the expanded organisation finding and vetting suitable personnel and preventing insurgent penetration of rapidl enlarging intelligenc system will present difficulties and risks the difficu lties may be overcome by effort and cooperation the risks have to be accepted with open eyes and minimised by good security 48 political direction political direction of intelli gence is sensitive matter in democracy because the system of checks and bal ances demands that it is not abused to promote personal party or factional interest s in more authoritarian regime the governments control of intellig ence is closely guarded to ens ure that it retains monopoly of power in either case direction is us ually exercised by s enior member of the government the decentralisation necessary to counter an insurgency erodes control in three respects dissemination of intelligence the number of people who have access to sensitive issues will increase thus centrali sed control of the intelligence is more issue 20 mar 07 b 6 18 difficult there will be cr eated opportunities for subordi nates newly in receipt of intelligence to take advant age of it or to be suborned b collection methods methods used to collect information can longer be controlled rigidly from central governmen t humint must be handled at the lowest level agent handlers require the kind of local knowledge whic h demands that they live in close proximity to those with whom they work c decisions on the threat more importantly there is the increase in an individuals opportunities to exercise valu judgements as to wh ich people and what groups are to be considered threat to th state and who should or should not be targeted often there is not only legal dividing line between proscribed insurgent organisation and its legitimate political par ty but also between the insurgents and those who sympathise with them 49 increase in military influence further difficulty wh ich insurgent propagandists exploit is that the dilution of highlevel po litical control is exacerbated by the increased influence exercised over the intelligence system by the security forces the charge however unjustified that the security forc are thereby involved in politics can be damaging one the obvious retort that the army is already invo lved to the extent that it supports legitimate governmen t against lawless insurgents wi ll not convince all the relationship between the government the judici ary the security forces and intelligence should be indivisible sit uation in which the in telligence organisation and the security forces are answerable to separate authorities government regional allie d or factional has to be avoided 50 influence of foreign allies in combined operations t he charge may be made and exploited by the insurgents that the governm ent is under the contro l of foreigners the resultant sensitivity may cause the government to place greater restri ctions on the freedom of action by the allies than might otherwise be the case this ght include restrictions on intelligencegathering particula rly sensitive collection in the humint and sigint fields

military operations scope 1 this chapter starts with consideration of the operatio nal aspects of governments overall strategic concept it goes on to discuss defensive and offensive tactical methods in outline in order to provide li nk with and an introduction to afm vol 1 pt 9 which deals with tactics in more detail the governments st rategic concept establishes the political aim and provides guidance to the militar on its roles and tasks it also gives broad direction for the intelligence effort and determines the thrust themes and emphasis of the psychological and public information campaigns 2 essentially the aim and c oncept of military operat ions is to help the authorities to re establish control throughout the country so that the civil administrat ion can exercise its proper function the military commanders task is unlikely to be as straightforward as conventional military oper ations his estimate has to take account of wide range of political economic and local inte rests these factors are re flected in the way in which operations are subject to the approval of the civil administration and other elements of the local security forces key factor in the appraisal of commanders mission analysis is his estimate of the purpose of t he operations he is to carry ou t whether they are designed primarily to provide physical s upport for an existing government structure in areas which are at least nominally under its c ontrol or to restore areas under hostile control to the local authorities his conclusion will determine whether the nature of that particular phase of the campaign is to be mainly defensive or offens ive the former case will be more likely to apply at the outset of campaign when the c ontrol of vital areas ma be essential to the governments survival however unless the government can go over to the offensive to recover insurgent held areas its authority may collapse to the ex tent that it is obliged to grant independence or autonomy to an insurgent dominated enclav or cede it to hostile forces principles 3 the six principles identified for the ccessful conduct of coin operations have been detailed in chapter 3 the physical impl ementation of the milit ary aspects of any national plan will depend on many factors but usually begin with the securing of firm base from which to operate once this is est ablished military forces should then seize the initiative in any campaign by separating the in surgent from his suppor t and then neutralising him and his cause all this has been described in previous chapters however it is necessary to detail in military terms the more precise methods by which this concept can be implemented campaign estimates 4 estimates are prerequisite for success in coin at the highes t level the focus will be far broader than in tactical military estima tes but all should be based upon thorough understanding of the entir ety of the problem not merely its most obvious features issue 20 mar 07 b 7 2 5 as in combat operations before producing military campaign plan the commander should use the full estimate process to analyse his strategic guidance and interpret it into operational and ultimately tactical plans t he balance between military and other factors will be determined by the extent of the initial government conc ept for the campaign though it may neither be termed as such nor in reality will it necessarily be ext ensive and in crisis may amount to cry for help an d in particular the role defined for the army subsequently the same discipline is required at all subo rdinate headquarters throughout the theatre to ensure that detailed tactical plans are appropriate at local leve l and accord with the overall purpose comprehensive anal ysis can offer important clues in the absence of hard information and should enable high level conti ngency planning to proc eed on the basis of broad assumptions essentially this study r educes the chance of undertaking unwinnable coin campaigns and increases the chances of developing an appropria operational role once involved mission analysis 6 if it has not been made clear to him in his initial br iefings the commander will need to establish the precise nature of the military contribution to t he overall campaign in the light of political direction for example which agency has primacy he will then need to determine the extent of his free dom of action and more pre ssingly the restrictions and constraints that apply matters such as stat of command especially if working in support of another government legal powe rs status of forces authority to impose curfews restrict movement arrest and search for example t he use of force and acce ss to and control of the media will require clarific ation there may be restrictions on the use of certain equipment such as afvs and in the case of coalition operation the lack of common doctrine will need immediate attention as has re cently been highlighted in iraq not all of the answers will be forthcoming this is facet of the operational environment that commanders at all levels have to learn to li ve with but coin demands delicate touch and sound political judgem ent for instance the line between legality and guile will need careful consideration and options such as booby trapping arms caches entrapping intelligence sources and the lik will require commander to weigh the potential risks and gains 7 this analysis will provide the comm ander and his staff with sufficient planning guidance to launch campaign the operational commander ma well seek novel ways to apply and maximise the resources he has availabl for instance raising local militias and recruiting civilian guards to release regular troops for more offensive action staff branches and other staff func tions will need to be reorganised g2 c2w psyops p info and g5 staff branches which should be regarded as the military overt contribution to the hearts and minds campaign will assume fa r greater importance whilst some units whose function in operations is mainly conc erned with the application of firepower may be retasked 8 having established the role which the military forces are to conduct and having analysed his mission the commander would issue statement of intent that starts the process of operations before doing so he would be wise to discuss his thoughts with whoever has been appointed as the overall direct or of operations ens ure that the broad thrust of his approach is developing in harmony with those of other agencies bearing in mind that in an emergency troops could be dep loyed to the theatre before full estimate and plan have been made the early issue of an in itiating directive will be important it issue 20 mar 07 b 7 3 should further focus staff effort and if possi ble give clear albeit limited tasks such as securing key points vip protecti on and reassurance patrolling implementing the campaign estimate 9 phases implementing the campaign estimate may conveniently be divided into number of phases as explai ned earlier an insurgency will generally develop unevenly across an afflicted country the national stra tegic plan will lay down priorities for the prosecution of the ca mpaign probably concentrating on just one or selected few areas in turn at the operational level the phases in any one area are t mutually exclusive and will tend to progress from one phase to the other the police are normally organised on regional basis corresponding to the boundaries of the civil administration which implies that unless there are other compelling reasons the incoming military formations and units should be deployed on the same geographical basis 10 securing base area hopefully the host government will have firm control over sufficient of its territory to provide secure base where reinforcing allied contingents can build up acclimatise and establis h their essential logistic unit s and installations however it is possible that the host government may have allowed the situation to deteriorate to the extent that area is safe from terrorist acti vity before calling for assistance in this instance it may be necessary to hold some logi stic stocks and assets in reserve at safe area while the first reinforcing troops to be committed secure the base area in the worst case it may be necessary to ask friendly nearby nation for facilities 11 establishment of firm forwa rd operational base fob it may be feasible to establish forward operational base at suit able provincial capital which has become isolated from the area still loya l to the government preferabl the area selected should be one with traditional loyalt ies to the government where the p opulation will readily rally back to its old allegiance once it feels secure fr om an insurgent offensive and serious terrorist attack an airhead may be seized by an airbor ne operation initially and then reinforced so that it can be expanded to secure the airfield from indirect fire weapons the risk of this type of operation is that if it is undertaken in an area wher insurgency is well developed the cost of maintaining it against an over whelming insurgent concentration may be too great the french disaster at dien bien phu in 1953 and 1954 when an airhead was established in hostile territo ry too far from the base area for proper support provides an unfortunate example the area selected has to be one that can be consolidated quickly and used as base for further operations des igned to link up with the main base and extend government control to other areas only allied troops invited by the host government may possess the resources to unch an operation to secure forward operational base later political factors may call for higher pr ofile host government effort in the recovery of its own territory and co rrespondingly lower profile role for the allied forces when it is considered safe to do so the allied troops may concentrate on securing the forward operating base and ot her base areas in order to release the host nation security forces for more active role the occupation and security of forward operational base are considered in detail in annex to this chapter 12 securing controlled area framework operations carefully planned and designed to clear secure and pacify the next area to be bought under government control are launched from forward opera tional base or from the base area itself the immediate aim of framework or ink spot operation as it is sometimes called is designed to separate issue 20 mar 07 b 7 4 the insurgents from their supp orters food suppliers and sour ces of information in the designated area these operations are essentially offensive in nature as they aim to wrest territory and more importantly the people who live in it from insurgent control the offensive element is provided by cordon nd search and search and destroy operations against known fixed bases which fo rce the insurgents to react or surrender the initiative well planned and organised ambushes destroy t he insurgent as he reacts when the opportunity offers fix and destroy operations may be used to attack known and vulnerable insurgent locations and base positions but to cceed the intelligence has to be very good special force operations may concentrate on more distant areas and valuable targets again on good intelligence it cannot be ove remphasised that success in offensive operations is not won by launching masses of troops into an area on the offchance of finding and destroying insurgents only operations based on good information and sound planning produce results until the insurgents start operating in large groupings in more conventional manner when they pr ovide larger targets will better results be obtained than from smaller scale operations which are well set up and based on reliable intelligence the less spectacular framework operations aimed at separating the insurgent from his support and providing security for the population of newly won controlled ar ea are the ones which achieve lasting results 13 consolidation of the controlled areas as areas of the hostile territory are cleared of insurgents civil admin istration can be reestablished it is possible that many of the areas former civil servants magistrate s and police may have escaped the initial insurgent take over and would be able to pu t their local knowledge to good use on their return however they and the civil police will undoubtedly need the backing of suitable military forces for some time and certainly until the neighbouring r egions have been brought back under government control the armed forces may be asked to help to train local auxiliary forces which will support the polic on their own when eventually the military withdraw 14 continued extension of controlled areas the freshly consolidated controlled areas provide the firm bases for the extensi on of framework operati ons until gradually the entire country is restored to government c ontrol the same steady methods described earlier in this chapter continue to be app lied the process is slow but sure 15 surveillance surveillance provides accura information regarding insurgent related activity which contributes directly to the effectiveness of operations overt and covert within the overall campaign plan co rrectly focused coherent surveillance plan which uses limited manpower and equipment resources to maximum effect is essential the plan should be both flexible and dynami c to take account of changing operational circumstances commanders should take adequate steps to integrate surveillance plans into existing and future operations this will require systematic approach to the task which should seek to improve the quality and scope of the surve illance results information gathered by surveillance is only of value when it is passed rapidly to location where it can be analysed properly and where subsequent action c an be taken if this is appropriate 16 operations in depth longrange raids and penetrati ons designed to destroy specific targets such as insurgent concentrations leaders key indivi duals and dumps or to interfere with communications and depress insurgent morale are essentially precise surgical operations only launched when there is sufficientl reliable and detailed intelligence to make success certain it may be necessary to use an existing forward operational base issue 20 mar 07 b 7 5 or to establish one temporarily if the latte r can be achieved without arousing the enemys suspicions such operations are us ually conducted by special forces relationship between defensive and offensive operations 17 counter insurgency operations may be grouped into two categories defensive and offensive general kitson descr ibes these categories and the relationship between them as follows firstly there are defensiv operations which are those designed to prevent insurgents from disrupting the government s programme secondly there are offensive operations which are those designed to root out the insurgents themselves before discussing each in turn it is worth noticing how important it is to strike balance between them if too little emphasis is placed on defensive measures in order to concentrate resour ces on the offensive the insurgents are offered an opportunity to achieve easy succe sses which they can use to embarrass the government and thereby undermine its s upport if on the other hand too little emphasis is placed on offensive operati ons the insurgent organisation gets bigger and bigger and an everincreasing proportion of the countrys resources has to be devoted to the security forces for defensiv counter measures so that eventually the insurgents achieve their aim by maki ng it appear that th price of further resistance is too high it is perhaps worth highlighti ng the ways in which political considerations affect the achievement of good balance between def ensive and offensive operations there is almost always political pressure on security force commanders to devote more resources towards defensive operations becaus of the shortterm difficulties which the government faces after every spectacula r insurgent success furthermore if the operational commander is insensitive to this political pressure he stands to find himself suddenly confronted by an unnecessarily rge number of spec ific political demands for defensive measures design ed to restore confidence among the population those demands might easily be bi g enough to disrupt the offensive plan altogether and thereby upset t he balance in the opposite direction undoubtedly the insurgent leadership will do all in its powe r to ensure that the balance of the security forces plan is upset both by planning their own operations with this in mind and by the use of propaganda designed to inhibit offensive action on the part of the governments forces it is particularly important to understa nd the extent to which insurgents use propaganda when defending themselves against government offensive action anyone at home or abroad who can be persuaded to write or broadcast or otherwise influence public opinion will be pressed into rvice the aim is usually to try and get debilitating restraints imposed on the security forces and particularly effective line is to say that offensive security force action is driving uncommitted people into supporting the insurgents like all good propagan da this line is likely to contain at least an element of truth what the insurgent propagandist naturally fails to point out and what the writer or broadcaster often does not underst and is that the offensive action may be the lesser of two evils in that failure to take it will result in far greater increase of support for the in surgents as their organisation grows unchecked and their power to coerce and persuade correspondingly increases of issue 20 mar 07 b 7 6 course the right level of offensive action depends on pr evailing circumstances the point which has to be understood is t hat good balance between offensive and defensive action is difficult to achieve bec ause of all the pressures which operate against it1 18 operational and tactical levels of control the relationship between the operational and tactical level of control during coin operations w ill differ for each situation and is not as clear cut as is the case in co nventional operations ta ctless move or over reaction at section or pl atoon level can easily have eno rmous operational and possibly political significance in t he following sections defensive and offensive tactics are covered in general terms only to give the flavour of coin operations most of which are conducted at tactical level the use of non lethal weapons nlw 19 there is an intellectual argument t hat force can and shou ld be used with few casualties and little collateral damage this argument is enhanced by the increasing capability of modern hightechnology weapon syst ems not only can these systems deliver high destructive capability at long range and wit h great precision but there is now also the ability to deny potential enemy his goals without the use of such destructive force these latter systems known generically as nonlethal weapons nlw are designed to temporarily immobilise an ene my or render his equipment useless for the task it was designed to do 20 the use of nlw is not new weapons such as batons water canon rubber bullets stun grenades and electronic wa rfare ew have been used by police and armed forces throughout the world for number of years in situations where the use of more lethal weapons would be ina ppropriate what is new and has enhanced the importance of nlw is the prevailing security climate in which the use of force especially for operations has become almost common place until now troops on peacekeeping operations have been authorised to use lethal weapons only in selfdefence if fo rced to open fire they shoot to kill public concern for losses among th belligerents and civilian population and the associated requirement for the nimal use of force have increas ed interest in the potential for nlw especially in peacekeeping and counter insurgency operations 21 nlw should not be thought of as separate unique capability nor do these weapons invite different form of warfare nlw represent additional capabilities for use in military commanders graduated use of force to deter defend or attack an opponent research and development of w hole range of techniques in th use of nlw indicates that this will become major factor in future c ounter insurgency campaigns further details of the issues surrounding the use of such weapons are given at annex b to this chapter 1 bunch of five f kitson 1977 issue 20 mar 07 b 7 7 section 2 defensive tactics categories 22 the main defensive operations are protective measures b defensive c2w c control of movement d crowd dispersal protective measures 23 the threat until an insurgency reaches its fi nal stages there is normally front line area can be assumed to be safe ev in cleared and co nsolidated area the insurgents may still have few operational cells which can l aunch bomb attacks or carry out assassinations they may as matter of policy attempt to reintroduce insurgent cells to launch terrorist attacks both for their pr opaganda value and in an attempt to force redeployment of police and troops to take t he pressure off their forces elsewhere protective measures will still be required in the most secure base areas although the tasks may have been handed back to the civil police or auxiliaries 24 balance protective measures in high risk ar eas are manpower int ensive many of the tasks are routine and boring and soldiers tend to lose their vigilance after long periods without an incident if possible troops on such duties should be rotated with those on more active operations and every effort must be made to keep training programme going 25 tasks protective measures include personal protection for vips and troops both on and off duty b small convoys c large road movements d picketing routes guarding installations f rail movement defensive c2w 26 defensive c2w is used to deny negate di minish or turn to friendly advantage enemy efforts to destroy disrupt exploit dec eive andor deny information to friendly command systems including its supporting communications information and intelligence activities safeguarding friendly command syst ems is fundamental consideration as issue 20 mar 07 b 7 8 failure to do so is likely to result in loss of freedom of action and init iative misdirection of effort or failure of the operation the primar objectives of defensiv c2w are therefore to reduce the vulnerability of co mmand support assets procedures and installations to attack b reduce the effects of insurgent dec eption actions against friendly command systems c nullify the effects of insurgent ew actions against friendly command systems d deny the insurgent the ability to exploit allied command systems ensure that the insurgent s

to be clear need for them they should be fairly applied within the law and the necessity for them explained to the public the civil authorities are responsib for imposing collective measures and the security forces for enforcing them befo re they are imposed the measures may be discussed between the civil author ities the police an d the military authorit ies to make sure that enforcement is

controlling movement may hav any of the following aims to make it easier for the security forces to enforce the law thus increasing public confidence in the governments ability to protect them with the fear of retribution removed individuals who have information are more likely to divulge it b to disrupt insurgent gr oups and plans by making mo vement difficult unable to contact their

31 in spite of measures to prevent it unlawful crowds may assemble the civil police if they are present may be unable to cope with t he situation and military assistance may be required the size of crowd is indication of its attitude rge one containing many curious onlookers may be docile until agitators get to work on it small crowd may be peaceful or it may be concentration of those with extreme views the military commander on the spot has to use his own judgment as to how to deal with any particular situation 32 the role of the police varies in ccordance with its strengt h organisation and employment policy with regard to the use of force an armed police force with strong paramilitary capability is likely to be well trained and prepared to deal with riot and the threshold of violence to warrant calling in the military will be correspondingly high if military forces are called in the situation is likely to be very serious other more conventionally equipped police forces may be forced to seek litary assistance at comparatively early stage 33 riot and crowd control are essentially urban operations although they may also occur in large villages litary commander should appreciate the situation carefully to see if crowd can be contai ned and allowed to disperse of its own accord through boredom the unnecessary use of force to di sperse crowd often leads to increased antagonism and resentment heightened degree of violence and more intractable and serious situation as with counter insurgency situations the long term effects are the important ones 34 in an urban setting particularly at the beginning of an emergency it may pay to deploy screen of joint civil and military polic patrols perhaps backed by helicopters as soon as serious trouble is ant icipated their sighting repo rts will provide the joint operations room with early warn ing of the assembly points size demeanour and movement of crowds and perhaps the identity of any agitators who are inciting violence if the demonstrators do not prove amenabl to the normal police meth ods of crowd control the civil police riot squads will be committed first they will probably use cs smoke or baton charges or both to break up the mobs in to smaller and more manageable groups which are easier to disperse while snatch squads arre st the ring leaders initially the army will be kept in the background partly as reserve of final resort and partly perhaps to help the police form an outer cordon to prevent unruly mobs from one area reinforcing crowds in another should the situation deteriorate to t he stage when the police are longer able to cope military forces will be called upon to in tervene either with riot squads or firearms wherever troops or police are committed it may be necessary to picket the roofs of buildings block side streets and watch subway ex its to secure their flanks and rear it may well occur that civil police are present at the scene of t he disturbance and thus military action of some sort may be accelerated in any sequence of dealing with the mob issue 20 mar 07 b 7 11 section 3 gaining the tactical initiative categories 35 tactics which can gain the initiative include the following c2w operations b patrolling c rapid reaction forces d ambushes search operations f larger scale operations to destroy or at least dislocate and disrupt insurgent units and formations c2w operations 36 c2w is used to deny insurgent comman ders effective command of their forces through destruction disruption exploitation decept ion influence or denial of all or part of their command system including its supporti ng communications information and intelligence activities c2w is particularly effective and often the most economical way of reducing an insurgents combat effectiveness it is applicable at all levels of command the primary objectives of c2w directed again st insurgent combat potential are to slow down his tempo in relati on to that of the security forces b disrupt his activities c degrade the insurgent commanders ability to command d disrupt his ability to generate and sustain offensive action patrolling 37 general the types of patrol and their purpose are the same for counter insurgency operations as for conventional warfare wit h suitable modifications while both reconnaissance and standing patrols have an import ant part to play offensive patrolling has to be executed with discretion like their counterparts in conventional operations patrols rely on good information and they are even more vulnerable to ambush type of patrol peculiar to counter insurgency operations is the framework patrol system method of patrolling specifically designed for this kind of warfare the syst em is described in paragraph 40 38 reconnaissance patrols the presence of patrols gen erally has steadying effect on the population of those neighbourhoods which are loyal to the government sending weak patrols into areas hostile to

of face and possibly weapons merely encourages the insurgents and depresses t he morale of the loyal population as well as the security forces however well planned patrollin g taking into account the natur of the threat can achieve useful results in an urban or rural setting tasks may include gathering information by observation and contact with the civilian population b harassing insurgent movements by carrying out snap checks and searches c dealing with such minor incidents as are within the capabilities of the patrol 39 standing patrols after the initial deployment of the military forces the establishment of network of overt and co vert standing patrols occupying key positions provides an important means of acquiring information and furnishing security force presence which can help in dominating an area their tasks might include obtaining general information on activi ty and noting any significant patterns b observing the movement and activity of terrorists curfew breakers

mixt ure of information protection and security force presence they operate on team multiple system which varies in accordance with the environment urban or rural the threat their task and the involvement of other security force element s the patrols work from firm bases and where possible within the ambit of standing patrols they may be mounted or move on foo t their aim is to deter an insurgent attack or sn iping operation by saturati ng an area and threatening the escape route of bomber or sniper in broad terms their tasks are to provide local protection for security force bases b inhibit insurgents freedom of movem ent by random deployment at different times in different areas framework pat rolling should avoid creating pattern of predictable habits issue 20 mar 07 b 7 13 c increase the chance of intercepting an insurgent sniper d provide an instantly available detection and reaction force on the ground provide regular update of local information 41 disruptive patrolling as in other forms of warfare success cannot be obtained by defensive measures alone the aim is to bring troops into contact with the insurgents on favourable terms the essential prerequisite is good information which may be obtained from variety of sources the coordinated effo rts of special branch and military intelligence building up painstaking picture the cultivat ion of local inhabitants reconnaissance standing and framework patrols tracking and sometimes lu cky contact small patrols operating discreetly may overhear voices or the clatter of cooking pots in camps where the enemy believes himself to be secure even t he smell of bad sanitation may betray position in jungle country where it is ldom possible to deploy and close cordon successfully an offensive patrol has better chance of scoring success because only few weapons can be brought to bear effectively the patrol does not have to be strong in numbers taken unawares the shock of surprise on insurgents is normally so great that they turn and run as mentioned above disruptive patrolling must be used with judgment to avoid falling into ambushes used judiciously it is an excellent way of k eeping small groups of insurgents on the move induc ing sense of insecurity and dislocating insurgent plans rapid reaction forces 42 isolated police and home guard forces have to be confident that they will be supported quickly and effectively if they come under attack should number of posts be overrun many others will be intimidated into eit her deserting their post s entering into cooperative arrangement with t he insurgents while outwardl remaining loyal to the government or even going over to w hat they regard as the winning side 43 part of the plan to support such isolated posts is the defensive framework of military garrisons however the maintenance of ccessful defence and control over an area depends on the ability to take quick offensive c ounter action reserves have to be held in readiness to go to the aid of threatened detachments rout and where they exist alternative routes need to be reconnoitred to avoid the risk of ambush because an insurgent attack on an isolated post may hav the additional aim of destroying the relieving force apcs provide protection against small arms fire but are vulnerable to handheld antiarmour weapons and should not be used blindly in relief operation air support provide rapid means of transporting mobile rese rve or part of it but again t heir vulnerability especially on landing has to be considered 44 reserves kept at short notice provide us eful rapid reaction force to take advantage of situation provided by an unexpected contact or an in telligence windfall when appropriate such reserves should have tra cker dogs and heavy weapons including armed helicopters should be on call ambushes 45 an ambush is surprise attack made by fo rce lying in wait relying on shock action ambushes are usually deliberate but drills need to be developed to enable section or issue 20 mar 07 b 7 14 patrol to move rapidly and quietly into an ambush position the latter type designed to take advantage of an unex pected opportunity to exploit surpri and gain the initiative is called an immediate ambush encounters are usually brief and at close range the quarry either being destroyed by combination of kill ing zone and cutoff tacti cs or escaping from badly sprung ambush perhaps to turn the tables on the ambusher s perfect ambush in the most favourable circumstanc where the entire insurgent force is caught exposed in the open could allow the commander to call on them to rrender in which case some valuable prisoners could be gained for inte rrogation ambushes may be laid with any combination of the following aims the destruction of an insurgent force b the capture or killi ng of wanted insurgent c the capture or destruc tion of weapons and equipment d the gaining of intelligence deterring the insurgent from using an area f preventing the insurgents fr om approaching friendly positions g acting as diversion to draw attent ion away from another area or operations 46 like framework patrols ambushes are sometimes deployed on an area basis with the object of increasing the chances of trapping an entire insurgent force search operations 47 the aim of this type of operation is to is olate selected area by deploying cordon either by stealth or at such speed that t he intended quarry has chance to escape and then searching it thoroughl such operations are usually carried out jointly by the police and the military with the purpose of capturing wanted persons arms radio transmitters supplies explosives or documents b disrupting insurgent activities c eliminating insurgent activity in spec ific locality particularly with view to expanding c ontrolled area d gaining evidence to support prosec utions where this is appropriate information to s upport future operations 48 the establishment of the cordon and the search are two separate activities but are mounted as one operation because the search part of the operation is usually lengthy affair which disrupts the life of locality while the people are conf ined to their homes cordons and searches should only be mounted on relia ble information series of fruitless issue 20 mar 07 b 7 15 operations merely alienates t he population from t he government and provides the insurgent with unnecessary propaganda 49 however cordon and search operations are not easy to execute because of the difficulty of closing the cordon so quickly that the insurgents have chance to escape it is easier to position cordon in open country with good road network and with the help of air support when the security forces have the advantages of mobility and observation is good in close jungle country it is virtually impossible to position and link up cordon because movement will be slow and noisy and obser vation restricted to few metres in such an environment the kind of raids by fighting patrols stand far better chance of success larger scale operations 50 in cases where an insurgency controls rge areas of the c ountryside the insurgents may raise and deploy sizeable force consisting of several large groupings such situation is most likely to ccur where they have access to friendly neighbou ring country which they use as haven to assemble train and equip field army undisturbed 51 ideally such forces should be engaged and destroyed in battle while they are relatively small and before they pose major th reat this may not be feasible for number of reasons the threat is likely to develop in remote area while t he host government has its hands full securing vital areas close to the capital the main towns and their surrounding wellpopulated and economically impor tant rural areas if the gov ernment is to survive it has to consolidate its control over the vital areas initially and then extend its authority to neighbouring inhabited regions because counter insurgen cy is essentially battle for the loyalty and control of its subj ects the host nation may have neither the troops available nor the means of projecting force over cons iderable distance into remote and possibly mountainous jungle region premature effort resulti ng in defeat may demoralise waverers in some of the vital secure or marg inally controlled areas sufficiently to tip the balance against the government there may also be risk that operations on the border of stronger hostile neighbour ma provoke an unwanted interventi on on the pretext that the neighbouring countrys borders have been vi olated or its security threatened 52 before the authorities coalition forces can go over to the offensive they may have to await the buildup of their own forces and the arri val of allied forces in sufficient strength some of the additional troops may help to fo rm central mobile reserve while others release experienced troops from framework operat ions to go into reserve whether newly arrived british contingent is llotted straight to the mobile re serve or whether it spends preliminary period on framework operations to acclimatise fa miliarise its troops with the physical and human environment and acquire some experience in local minor tactics will be matter of judgment in t he light of circumstances 53 if the british contingent is to form part of the central mobile rese rve it will be matter for intergovernmental agreement based on servic advice as to the composition of the force the kind of support t he host government may need cann ot be predicted in advance it will depend on the size and nature of the threat the adequacy of the host nations resources and the terrain the requirement may vary from infantry with an air support capability at the lower end of the scale to bal anced force of all arms backed by offensive air and transport support at the other if the host nation has ng coastline vulnerable to issue 20 mar 07 b 7 16 the infiltration of insurgent supplies mariti air reconnaissance forces naval forces with perhaps some amphibious capability may be needed special forces will almost certainly be useful if the british contribution is to be part of major allied effort the governments concerned in conjunction with the host authori ties will agree on an appor tionment of types of forces and tasks in accordance with the long term plans of campaign 54 when the moment is right for an off ensive against the insu rgents groupings and formations usually once the host government has established control over its vital cities towns and populated rural areas it will be nece ssary to decide on the aim and purpose of large scale operations the goal of the annihilation of the insurg ents forces represents the perfect solution in practice it may be diff icult to achieve because once the insurgents realise that they face an overwh elming threat their tactic is to leave small parties to delay the government forces while the main bodies sp lit up into small parties to exfiltrate the encircling troops an insurgent leadership is normally quite prepared to leave their delaying elements to their fate 55 while destruction of the insurgent main forc may legitimately be the security forces aim lesser result may lack perfection but be nearly as useful if their main forces can be compelled to abandon hitherto secure area broken up with the loss of heavy casualties useful prisoners seized logistic stockpile s destroyed communications disrupted and the links with their supporting political and supply or ganisation severed the insurgent will need time to recover even across friendly bor der the time bought may be used by the government and its security forces to deny the former enemy base to insurgent reinfiltration to consolidate the administratio ns control over formerly marg inal areas and extend the ink spot process to new areas significant in surgent defeat will have heartening effect on the population and will encourage wave rers to support the government 56 there are number of prerequisites fo r the success of rge scale operation good intelligence blind blow in the dark seldom achieves anything the locations of insurgent headquarters and leader s is as important as knowledge of the insurgents positions and secu rity screen equally import ant is good intelligence on the insurgents supporting polit ical and logistic organisation special forces may be given the task of seizing or killing t hose key leaders whose whereabouts are accurately known their demise will so help to disrupt the insurgent command organisation at the moment when the rebel forces and their supporting organisation need quick decisions and orders b isolation the area chosen for the operation should be isolated as far as possible to prevent insurgent reinforcement or exfiltration if the escape of small parties cannot be stopped the insurgent s should not be able to evacuate formed bodies of men enemy escape routes s hould as far as possible be blocked c surprise and deception obtaining surprise presents the greatest difficulty preparations and prelim inary moves which cannot be hid den have to be disguised patrolling to obtain information should be carri ed out in as many areas as possible with obvious emphasis on the selected area rumours of possible operations planned to take place elsewhere may be fed into the insurgent intelligence organisation through channels wh ich the insurgents are known to trust feints may issue 20 mar 07 b 7 17 be launched in such manner as not to arouse suspicions as to the location of the real operation its aims and its objectives 57 the execution of such an operation requi res rapid deployment to encircle the main enemy forces including the delivery of troops to isolated locations by helicopter insurgent forces should not just be surrounded by cordon which is likely to prove porous in the best circumstances but located and pinned down t he latter requirement may best be achieved by special forces once surrounded disorg anised and broken up t he insurgents need to be pursued relentlessly against large insur gent formations conventio nal limited war or medium intensity conflict operations will be needed but care has to be taken to choose the scene to fight the battle on terms favourable to the allies and to keep the initiative reserves should be held ready for committal to reinforce hard pressed units to exploit success or to block enemy escape routes 58 finally success has to be followed up by rooting out the insurgent political and logistic support organisation and replacing it with the host governments administration the people in the area need to be protected from future covert rebel infiltration by its political cells and new terrorist network as well as another occupa tion by insurgent main forces consolidation of t he governments authority will depend as much on constructive and imaginative rehabilitation ca mpaign as on protection backed by the establishment of good intelligence service mass regroupment of the population should be avoided although it may be necessary to resettle exposed isol ated communities which are vulnerable to resumption of insurgent initiatives in securely guarded villages preferably as close to their fields as possible section 4 opsec in counter insurgency operations general 59 opsec gives an operation the desired overall degree of security it is defined as the process which gives military operation appropr iate security using passive or active means to deny the adversary knowledge of the dispositions capabilitie s and intentions of friendly forces the aim and scope of opsec 60 the aim of opsec is to deny to the adv ersary the information he needs to be able to identify dispositions and capabi lities and the intelligence to assess friendly intentions opsec is forcewide process which addresses t he overall security of the whole operation or exercise in the light of the adversarys known or suspec ted intelligence surveillance target acquisition and reconnaissance istar capabilities it is not intended to provide blanket security the insurgent may know that fr iendly forces are in the area of operations or that further operations are planned the intention is to conceal from an insurgent those indicators from which he could deduc vital elements of our plans to increase the element of surprise and reduce the insurgents capability to interfere with friendly operations b to increase security and thus prevent the insurgent obtaining information that would assist in his offensive planning process issue 20 mar 07 b 7 18 c to analyse continuously the intelligence likely to be available to an insurgent thus allowing friendly force plans to be revi ewed in the light of probable adversary knowledge the use of opsec in counter insurgency 61 surprise is one of the most important factors in counter insurgency operations the insurgents are frequently disper sed over wide area using the local population as both cover and to provide themselves with informati on and supplies insurgents will often have an excellent intelligence net which will keep them informed on all activities in the area and where appropriate allow them to disper or hide whenever they are threatened 62 while it will not be possible to conceal all activities involved in major security force operation opsec has to be applied to conceal ch details as the sca of the operation timings target areas for searches routes in out of the area of operat ions dropoff points specialised equipment and other details from which an insurgent could deduce the operations objectives specific targets and timescale responsibility for opsec 63 opsec is commanders resp onsibility it is g3 func tion staff element within g3 operations should be responsible for the specific coordination implementation and monitoring of any opsec plan media security policy 64 media security policy should be formula ted at an early stage certainly prior to deployment after consultation between in telligence operations military public informationrelations and legal st affs this policy should be coordinated at the highest appropriate level to prevent in advertent disclosures outside the operational ar ea media security policy in the area of operations should be directed by the commander in consultation with the mod and in acco rdance with his overall opsec policy relationship between opsec and deception 65 the aim of opsec is to deny an insur gent knowledge of friendly forces whereas deception aims to present deli berately false picture decept ion is thus not necessarily part of opsec but opsec is essent ial to deception in presenting false picture it is vital to this conceal those indicators that woul d reveal the true nature of events at the operationalstrategic level however major movements or preparations may be necessary which cannot easily be conceal ed at this level the psec plan may therefore need to incorporate elements of any deception plan section 5 ew in counter insurgency operations 66 general ew is one of the fi ve primary functions of c2w together with opsec psyops deception and destruction 67 the electromagnetic environment due to the wide variety of potential counter insurgency campaigns and contrasting elec tromagnetic em environments operations issue 20 mar 07 b 7 19 conducted in the em environmen t will be different for each deploy ment during any coin campaign the em environment will also be influenc ed by both military and civilian systems the priority at the start of operations wi ll be the production of detailed plan of the operational em environment it will be important to identify and note the electromagnetic signatures of each active element of the em spectrum in or der to produce the ew orbat 68 em spectrum threat when considering the threat posed by the em spectrum the following factors should be addressed the protection of friendly communica tions and target acquisition systems against exploitation and attack b the most appropriate way of def ending against em guided and homing weapons c the gaining of information about potentially complex em target array d the most appropriate method to atta ck such complex em target array 69 current trends for the em spectrum there is widespread and growing use of the em spectrum by military and civilian organi sations combat net radio and trunk communications are essential to the effective command and control of armies paramilitary organisations also have easy access to em systems that are mobile and operate throughout the em spectrum modern co mmunication and radar equipments are characterised by an increasing use of digital si gnal processing provid ing low probability of intercept and antijam techniques such as frequency hopping direct sequence spread spectrum dsss and burst trans missions the use of digita l encryption devices are also becoming commonplace in addition to communi cations military technology uses the em spectrum to aim weapons guide smart muniti ons collect information and disseminate the resultant information conduct night operations counter comm and and control facilities and to protect soldiers communications systems and their facilities radars are increasingly used for navigation surveillance and in fire c ontrol systems in c ountering units any ew threat can expect to mix of former soviet union fsu western and commercial radio and radar equipments in addition to guided and homing weapon systems 70 future technologies there will be significant shi ft away from insecure voice at tactical levels of command as data entry vices encryption and the use of low probability of intercept techniques become more wides pread at higher vels of command an increased use of secure single channel and multichannel systems is likely operations in the future could involve the use of radi frequency weapons capabl of disrupting or destroying em systems and weapon guidance system s mobile telephones and similar systems that operate above the 500 mhz frequency vel the pace of introduction of advanced communications equipment is likely to increase as the cost of technology declines for example hand hel d battery powered dsss tran sceivers and manportable direct access satellite systems ar both available commercially if ew is to make realistic contribution to the commanders surveillance an d military information re quirements it will be essential to identify at t he

required ew resources can be deployed and allocated tasks accordingly issue 20 mar 07 b 7 20 military information requirements 71 although ew equipment and the principles of ew support apply equally to general war and coin the military information needs of the commander in coin may often vary in emphasis from those in general war these requirement s will often focus on non military topics such as

relevance dur ing coin operations in those states where the population reli almost totally on radio and possibly television for their access to information the ability to transmit relevant accurate and timely information on unused commercial radio and television bands could also be an important asset in preventing an escalation of hostile activity the role of ew in coin operations 74 general detailed plan combined with t he identification of all detectable emissions will be essential in or der to determine whether the emissions belong to friendly neutral or potentially hostile em systems to achieve this and to ensure that the correct ew assets are deployed to meet the threa t capable esm recce system supported by comms and noncomms parametric data base wil l need to be intheatre of the earliest possible moment as em emissions are not restricted by national or regional boundaries the physical extent of the op erational em environment is not directly related to the geographical theatre of operations thus advantage must be made of all available national and internatio nal stand off military information syst ems in addition to the military information product from those formations deployed any friendly system radiating in the em spectrum can be exploited by hostile ew systems to disrupt or compromise pso the coordination of ew and military information c ould be an important factor in the success or otherwise of any operations 75 application of ew ew has long been recognised as an essential feature of warfare and is key component of command and control warf are c2w which has equal utility in war and ootw ew in coin perations will provid the commander with flexible nonintrusive surveillance system and ecm can be used to counter homing and guided weapon systems to protect key military and civilian installations such as hospitals airports and densely populated areas ecm used in this way could provide minimum force defence against sophisticated homing dev ices which would be difficult if not issue 20 mar 07 b 7 21 impossible to identify the source of this type of electronic atta ck ew used in this manner would also reduce the risk of or reason for retaliatory action being taken by insurgents which in turn could lead to reduction in the level of violence however successful ew operations will depend on information collection smart jamming data fusion and the rapid dissemination of information 76 esm the presence or indeed the perceived presence of widespread and impartial electronic surveillance in the th eatre of operations can help to deter hostile activity by insurgents electronic surveill ance will remove the element of surprise from actions that insurgents might take especially if it is k nown that the informati on arising from that surveillance is shared with others the loss of surprise will greatly improve the opportunity for the security force to anticipate offensive action by the insurgent s this could well degrade the effectiveness of th aggression and could make such action seem less worthwhile effective electronic surveillance can also assist commander to identify suspects in each case the likelihood of aggr ession being rewarded is reduced the risk of the insurgent being publicly exposed to the co mmunity is increased and the threat of anticipatory responses by security forces is heightened esm can be used to cue other surveillance systems and ecm offensive jamming esm will also have role to play in the development of friendly ectronic protect measures epm which will in turn reduce the jamming

as security forces and insurgent groups throughout the world continue to develop the use of advanced electronic systems ew planning will be the responsibility of the commander in coordination wit h any host nation to assist the commander an ew coordination centre ewcc should be formed which needs to be located alongside the issue 20 mar 07 b 7 22 g2j2 and g3j3 branches the staffing level within this organisation will vary in size and will be dependent on the scale of ew assets deployed as minimum requirement an ew liaison of officer ewlo from each service pr oviding ew assets to the security

and across the strategic operational and tactic spectrum of conflict it can also be used profitably in psychological operations public information and in state planning to sow doubt and division in the opponents camp decept ion is defined as t hose measures designed to mislead the opponent by manipulation distorti on or falsification of evidence to induce him to react in manner that is prejudicial to his interests the aims of deception 84 the aims of deception are to to gain surprise b to maintain security c to give commander freedom of action to carry out his mission by deluding an opponent as to his actions d to mislead the opponent and thus pers uade him to adopt course of action which is to his disadvantage and which can be exploited to save lives of own troops and minimi

counter rveillance and opsec to prevent the enemy from observing genuine activity deception m easures are categorised as offensive or defensive offensive deception measures offensive measures are used for the active dissemination of false evidenc to the opponent in order to mislead him about future intentions the prime purpose of offens ive deception is to achieve surprise b defensive deception

forces tro ops and their capacity to work equally well as individuals or in small groups make them particularly suitable for counter insurgency most countries possess special forces units many of which are specially trained for counter revolutionary warfare operations in addition to their tasks in general and limited war they will play an important part in any future c ounter insurgency campai gn frequently making contribution out of all proportion to their small numbers possible ways of employing them should be considered at all stages of pl anning and developing counter insurgency operations however they should be used to co mplement rather than replace conventional units further general details are contained in annex section 8 air power in support of counter insurgency operations background 88 before the second world war it was nor mal practice for both italy and the uk to utilise air forces to dominate large areas of their colonial empires the reasoning behind this was that the technologic gap between the imperial pow ers and the locals population was so large as to render effective opposition impractical since the second world war this reasoning rapidly became invalid 89 the use of air forces in the gulf war and more recently in the iraq and afghanistan have shown the enormous pot ential of advanced technology for surveillance target acquisition and attack of targets for those air forces that possess the technology these major improvements have also been achieved wit h few casualties and little collateral damage to infrastructure near the target area linked with the possibilit ies inherent in the use of non lethal weap ons by aircraft there has been re introduction of air power having major role in future co unter insurgency operations the present position 90 recent experience in peace support operations point also to the inherently flexible application of air power in co vering not only counter insur gency campaigns but other more generalised conflicts where the technological gap between the various belligerents could be large the use of air power to deter and neutralise the effectiveness of ground forces in yugoslavia and the use of suppressive air power by the israeli air force against their arab opponents over the years to coun ter terrorism highlights the us that could be made of this technological gap 91 the use of air power which includes atta ck helicopters airships light aircraft and air transport resources in any counter insurgency campaign will doubt be constrained by the overall political aims for the campaign but within these cons traints the growing number of possibilities for the use of the improved capabi lities of air power could well issue 20 mar 07 b 7 25 provide military co mmander with wider range of milit ary options for his campaign estimate section 9 an information campaign general 92 in modern times counter insurgency now in volves wide variety of participants and groupings often in loose or ad hoc alliances frequently operating outside the geographic area in dispute or even globally the causes of these insurgencies are equally complex religion ethnicity politics poverty and per ceived oppression are among the many factors behind them military action alone cannot reso lve such situations but it can set the conditions for resolution by ot her parties there is need for coherent activity cross government approach from all instruments of national power and where possible with other international organisations ios 93 the impact of the international media virtually all crises are conducted under the spotlight of the international media the maintenance of public support is crucial for democratically accountable governments and th is influences the options they can take including military action and the presentation of these options to different audiences in order to gain and maintain pub lic support national and inter national governments need to show degree of transparency in their actions and these actions should be in accordance with received ethics and internati onal law the influence of the media has increased as access to regional and internat ional media has increased this has been brought about by advances in technology in radio and television such as satellite broadcasting by the increasingly porous nature of inte rnational borders and by the ava ilability of relatively cheap printing or copying equipment that has brought newspapers and other printed material to much wider audience consequently there is need to be proactive in ensuring that the presentation of military actions is positive while at the same countering the insurgents attempts to undermi ne public support 94 the impact of technology as well as the role that is played by technology in increasing access to the media there is an ever increasing dependence on information technology it by both military forces and by civilians this introduces new opportunities that can be exploited and new vu lnerabilities that have to be protected many people now have the ability to access information direct via the internet and without necessarily knowing its pedigree and source pl ace considerable credence on it this is particularly so in societies without free press the internet can be used to spread or circulate information and opinion including rumour with speed inconceivabl few years ago all this reinforces the need for proactive informa tion campaign with an in ternational reach 95 the previous army publication on counter insurgency afm vol 1 pt 10 of jul 2001 had chapter on information operations because this activity was in its infancy and neither doctrine nor procedures were in place since then information operations have expanded to include bot h the uk government and other agencies are fully involved in harmonising information operations to allow co mmander to make full use of this campaign tool in iraq and afghanistan in fast moving

operational base may be defined as an area providing firm base from which aggressive action against the insurgents can be developed its establishment will be undertaken as joint operation 2 the normal requirements and characteristics of forward operational base are it should be formation base establishe d at seat of local government if this is not possible easy access to the centre of local administration is essential b it should be located in an area from which operations can be successfully developed throughout the form ation area projected pa cification operations and operations in depth must be withi n convenient helicopter range c it must contain suitable airfield si in some circumstances tac tsr airfield may have to suffice initially but it must be capable of quick development for use by tac tmr aircraft for which it may be necessary to bring in or to air drop large quantities of engineer plant or stores d the immediate vicinity of the base s hould be at least temporarily free from insurgent interference it should be easily defensible if it is surrounded by natural obstacles so much the better if not the ground of tactical si gnificance that lies out side the immediate perimeter should be controlled f the area of the base must be large enough to accommodate the logistic units and dumps necessary to support the force bei ng deployed but as small as possible to facilitate its defence g the base should be accessible by road or track so that tracked vehicles and heavy plant can be brought in probably by one time road convoy this requirement is not always possible to ac hieve and more extensive use of air transport may have to be made to bring in vehicles and plant it will probably be impossible to establish secu re land line of communication occupation 3 the occupation of forward operational base may be entirely peacefu l but if it has to be undertaken in the face of so opposition careful consider ation must be given to the method of approach if combined air and land ap proach is employed it is important to plan the correct balance and to coordinate the timi ng of the arrival of the two forces as an example it may be necessary for the airfield site to be secur ed initially by parachute troops issue 20 mar 07 b 7 2 followed by rapid build up with some fo rces air landed and some moving by road whatever the precise circumstances the following factors mu st be considered there can be question of seizing fo rward operational base in the face of strong opposition this would be an oper ation of quite different nature and would in any case be contrary to the tactical c oncept whether or not parachute troops are employed the close defence of the airf ield should be established as soon as possible b it is likely that insurgent sabota ge staybehind and re connaissance parties will begin to operate against the base within short space of time c in planning the build up careful consideration must be given to possible threats infantry support ed by armour andor artillery are likely to be the first requirement but if there is an air threat some priority may have to be given to air defence engineer plant and stores may also be needed early to velop the airstrip rapidly d both the air and land approach operations will need to be carefully planned and executed it is possible that civil demonstr ations against the appearance of foreign troops may take place during the occupation of the base defence and sequence of build up 4 general the measures outlined below envisage defence against insurgent sabotage raids or attacks of up to battalion str ength supported by mortars the defence commitment of the base will be reduced as the surrounding countryside is cleared of insurgents and as the controlled area is enl arged by pacification operations when planning the defence full use must be made of any available rnarmyraf and administrative units every man capable of bearing arms must be incorporated into the defence organisation and must be fit and trained for combat duties including patrolling within the base 5 all round defence every unit or sta ff of an administrative installation must be given sector to defend with arcs of fire weapon pits obstacles and patrol areas installations must be protected from sabotage and insurgent ttacks special attention being given to items particularly attr active to the insurgent eg w eapons ammunition explosives and parked aircraft the maximum use must be made of wire mines booby traps alarm systems illumination surveill ance devices and guard dogs together with improvised devices such as caltrops all main and isol ated positions must be organised for all round defence guard posts and detac hments in isolated positions covering approaches to the base must be dug in with overhead cover be protected by wire mines and improvised obstacles and have reserves of ammunition supplies and water duplicated system of communication between all posts in the base must be established the use of booby traps can be two edged weapon in hot humid climate is essentia l that early warning devices are checked regularly to ensur they are in working order and the danger of our own troops initiating booby traps during these checks must be appreciated and prov ided for by briefing them from carefully k ept minefield records issue 20 mar 07 b 7 3 6 command if the formation commander assu mes personal command of the forward operational base he and hi s staff tend to become immersed in detail and are unable to pay as much attention as they should to operati ons in depth someone else is needed to command the base area as every component of t he force or its echelo ns will be located there and the coordination of the defence and detailed command is large task to nominate the headquarters of an infantry battalion detracts from the units offensive capabilities the same disadvantage applies to the headquarters of field regiment although perhaps not to the same extent t here is little doubt that the appointment of deputy force commander provides the best solution specific commander and headquarters must be nominated for the cont rol of the forward operational base 7 sequence of build up the build up of the base may take weeks depending on the distances involved and the resources available the sequence for land forces might be an air assault by parachute troops and its reinforcement by an infantry battalion group if possible by surf ace route rather than by air b the assumption of overall control of the defence by the assault battalion group c key plan which directs the deployment of uni ts and installations to selected areas d reception arrangements by the ass ault battalion group for the followup echelons arriving by air offensive patrolling by the assault ba ttalion in areas close to the base f the hand over of sectors of the per imeter to followup battalion groups g frequent clearance searches of the base area and adjacent country h the reception of one time road convoy i followup battalions patrol offensively in their taor j the opening up of an airstrip k the assault battalion group may still be primarily concerned with the defence of the base and the provision of the counter attack force l the establishment of limited controlled area m the expansion of t he controlled area n the introduction of local military and paramilitary forces to assist in the defence of the base the pat rolling of the controlled ar ea and the establishment of defended villages etc issue 20 mar 07 b 7 4 operations in depth star t concurrently with the establishment of the controlled area p the progressive reduction of the number of infantry required to ensure the security of the base initially the infantry commitment is likely to be high but as soon as the domination of the immediate rrounding area is successful the numbers can be reduced 8 defence problems the ideal defensive plan should ensure that insurgent small arms rockets or mortar fire can damage anything in the base this will seldom if ever be practicable because of the size of the problem for example if it is assumed that the forward operational base covers an area of approximately 2000 metres by 2000 metres with one side totally protected by the sea and the insurgents only have mortars with ranges of up to 6000 metres this still leaves an ar ea of approximately 100 kilometre map squares from which insurgent mortars c ould be fired and achieve hit on part of the base this illustrates the size of the area around the base that must be converted into controlled area as quickly as possible insurgent rockets ma present an additional problem because they have considerably longer ranges than mortars but due to their inaccuracy they are mainly harassing threat every effort must be m ade to prevent insurgent small arms from engaging aircraft approaching and leaving the airfield 9 patrolling while the area of the base itself s hould be patrolled by any units located in the base the infantry battalions should be used for offensive patrolling in the taor in the following ways in general offensive patrolling should ex tend from the perimeter of the base out to the limit of the range of enemy mortars and rockets this patrolling must of course be tied in with or be part of the controlled area patrol programme comprehensive and detailed random pat rol plan will be needed and the maximum use must be made of listening devices detectors and surveillance equipment b patrols must operate within the r ange of artillery support and be adept at laying ambushes 10 security measures in addition to normal security precautions the following require special consideration in connecti on with the defence of the base the declaring of prohibited and rest ricted areas for civilian movement b under some circumstances it may be necessary to stop all movement except patrolling within the base after dark c local labour which always constitutes major security ri sk must either be carefully screened and supervised or escorted d the timings and methods of patrolli ng changing guards and detachments and other routine matters must be varied guards and patrols might be supported by tracker and guard dogs issue 20 mar 07 b 7 5 f depending upon the nature of the threa t full use must be made of all forms of illumination includi ng floodlights searchlights if av ailable and illum ination provided by mortars artillery or aircraft g the provision of earthwork protecti on for vulnerable equipment and stores h harassing fire can be used to disrupt t he insurgents routine and to inhibit their use of particular areas 11 reserves in addition to the mobile reserve which is held ready for use within the controlled area as whole small central reserve for the defence of the forward operational base is essential tasks for th is reserve must be planned and rehearsed and must include well coordinated fire plan the infantry reserve might use helicopters or micvsapcs helicopters are particularly vulner able if there is an opportunity to get behind the insurgents to cut off their withdrawal he licopter landing sites are vulnerable to ambush but the risk can be reduced by short period of prophylactic fire from artillery or armed helicopters immediat ely before landing 12 armour cvrs provide valuable fire support whilst the base is being established their presence alone often acts as deterrent thereafter they are likely to be required for both defensive and offensive tasks 13 artillery and mortars the defence of forward operational base depends very much on fire support all artillery and mortars in the base must be coordinated through the senior artillery officer to ensure that the best use is made of t he available fire power there will usually be an urgent requirement to fly in or to move in by road artillery and mortars locating equipment will also be needed if the insurgents hav mortars the following points should be borne in mind artillery is invaluable for breaking up insurgent concentrations and for counter battery fire in addition to airportable fiel d artillery some medium guns are useful to provide destructive effect and to attack insurgent morale b when close support defensive fire is r equired on or near t he perimeter of the forward operational base it will be provided by combination of field artillery firing over open sights when necessary infantry mortars armed helicopters and offensive air support c if the size of the base is small it may be necessary to establish some fire support subunits away from the base but within range 14 air defence in counter insurgency operations the enemy is unlikely to have any air power but the possibility of sneak air attacks perhaps from neighbouring state sympathetic to the insurgent s has to be considered 15 engineers engineer considerations are likely to be critical both for the selection of the site for the forward operational base and fo r the rate of development of the operation particularly the opening of the tac tmr air head engineer tasks in the base may include issue 20 mar 07 b 7 6 the construction and maintenance of the tac tmr airhead together with the necessary bulk fuel installations maintenance facilities and protective defences b the forward tac tsr airstrip c vstol sites d the improvement of port or beach exit facilities combat engineer support f clearance of minesboobytraps im provingmaintenance of routes 16 control of air space in the initial stages apart from insurgent action hazards to low flying aircraft in the area of the forward operational base arise fr om collision and from friendly artillery and mortar fire because of t he nature of the insurgent threat and the fact that at least initially the fo rward operational base must expe ct attack from any direction the close coordination and control of weapons and aircraft is most important this is the task of the fire support coordination centre fscc and the air pport operations centre asoc issue 20 mar 07 b 7 b 1 annex b to chapter 7 non lethal weapons nlw 1 the use of nlw is not new weapons such as batons water canon rubber bullets cs gas stun grenades and electronic warfar ew have been used by police and armed forces throughout the world for number of years in situations where the use of more lethal weapons would be inappr opriate what is new and has enhanced the importance of nlw is not only the increasing number of military operations but also the high visibility of such operations including c ounter insurgency where satellite technology makes it possible for the public to see in minute detail how the oper ations proceed such public scrutiny has highlighted the inability of armed forces to respond to situations with anything other than lethal force which in many circumstances especially those asso ciated with peacekeeping have proved to be inappropriate 2 the public concern for casualties am ong the combatants and ci vilian population has increased interest in the potential for nlw in the expectation that they can provide armed forces with more appropriate but less than lethal response when required the public expectation has been fuelled by the increasingly high profile some might say exotic non lethal technologies considered in the media 3 counter insurgency operati ons may involve nonlethal or lethal weapons or both and one situation can be limited to specific level of lethality nlw contribute to the application of military force in pursuit of militarypolitical aims and objectives and are already part of an existing spec trum of force it is theref ore wrong to talk about nlw in isolation and consequently terms such as nonlethal warfare and conventional warfare become unspecific and contentious the categories of nlw 4 general the categorisation of nlw c an be difficult depending upon which definition is used and the interpretation giv to it however desp ite the rather unspecific meaning of the phrase nlw ca n be broadly categorised into those that are designed to impair or immobilise persons systems targeted against personnel include 1 psychological oper ations psyops psyops uses information warfare and the media to reduce the morale and combat efficiency of enemy troops or to influence the emoti ons of the populace in order to persuade them to or dissuade them from taking specific action 2 acoustics noise whether it be audible or inaudible infra and ultra sound can be used to immobilise indi viduals or disperse crowds by causing discomfort disorientation and nausea 3 calmative agents and irritants these systems are used to calm or disperse riotous crowds or indivi duals and will include current agents such as cs gas issue 20 mar 07 b 7

and incapacitants ie stun grenades are us ed to temporarily blind dazzle or immobilise individuals 5 equipment and material systems targeted against equipment and material include those designed to impair or prevent mobili ty neutralise weapons exploit or disrupt communications or degrade the infrastr ucture such systems include antitraction agents combustion alteration technologies to impair or immobilise equipments b sensor damage lasers targeted against vehicle optics to prevent mobility and target acquisition c metal embrittlement polymer and super adhesive agents to disable mechanical linkages and alter material pr operties causing gene ral equipment and weapon failure d radio frequency weapons rfw to cause electronic failure in ignition systems communications radars computers and navigation aids conductive ribbons to short circuit power lines fuel additives to contaminate fuel supplies and the introduction of com puter viruses to disrupt communication and economic centres the advantages and disadvantages of using nlw 6 advantages the principal advantages of nlw are that they can be deployed to reinforce deterrence and militar credibility by providing the commander with graduated re sponse over wider range of military activities b they can reduce the risk of rapid esca lation especially in operations other than war by offering progressive increment increase in lethality equally in specific situations they can prov ide the opportunity for deescalation c they can provide public and politically acceptable alternative means of conducting operations in that they enable fo rce to be used with the likelihood of fewer casualties and less collateral and environmental damage d they can prolong the situat ion at low casualty rate in order to buy time for negotiation they can have positive implications for use at the strategic level for relatively little cost in terms of expense resources and national commitment issue 20 mar 07 b 7 b 3 f they can enhance the capability of fo rces in wider variety of tasks that otherwise may have been too costly in rms of manpower and resources too sensitive politically or publicly unacceptable g they can be used covertly to create uncertainty fear and low morale amongst insurgents h they can reduce the co st of rebuilding the infr astructure and economy 7 disadvantages the main disadvantages of nhw are that with the prospect of few casualties and little collateral damage the use of armed forces could become more accept able and thus more frequently employed instrument of government policy b the use of some nlw would be rest ricted due to international treaties conventions and laws others would rece ive bad publicity if used against an unsuitable target or had lethal consequences c the need for reliable information in t he employment of nlw is paramount not only to portray their nonlethal ity to insurgents but also to assess the vulnerability of the target and to verify their effectiveness afte r strike verificati on could be difficult but is essential if counter llegations are to be avoided d they do not destroy insurgents alt hough they may adversely influence their cohesion and will to fight their use may be perceived as lacking decisive action the damage caused by some nlw may be difficult to control for example the use of computer viruses and rfw similarly the effect of many nlw can be difficult to assess f some nlw are omnidirectional or have poor or target acquisition systems there is therefore danger of friendly or noncombatant casualties unless strict command and control arrangements are m ade and rules of engagement roe followed g the long term aftereffects on individuals is not known h the use of nlw may heighten the re solve of the insurgent in that he responds with lethal force thus the us of nlw should always be backed up with the ability to use lethal force if necessary i additional protection may be requ ired for those deploying some nlw guidance in the use of nlw 8 in the absence of any practical experi ence to base firm and clear principles the following guidelines would be appropriate for the potential use of nlw in future win the information war and s eek the support of the media issue 20 mar 07 b 7 b 4 b nlw can either be used alone provi ded they are backed up with the ability to use lethal force or as compliment to thal force their use should be controlled by roe and should not be lowed to jeopardise the ri ght of soldiers to defend themselves with lethal force c the employment of nlw should be consistent with extant treaties conventions international and national laws their use should also be morally and ethically justifiable d nlw should be used proportionately the least destructive way of defeating insurgents and discriminatel the protection of nonco mbatants from direct intentional attack in planning the employment of nlw the operational response to all possible reactions should be fully rehearsed f responses from the medi cal legal civil and public affairs authorities as consequence of unintended results and side effects caused by the use of nlw should be fully prepared g nlw should be fully integrated with lethal weapons in order to provide graduated response to situation based upon the use of minimum force and perception of the threat h nlw should not be deployed without consideration

in hostilities issue 20 mar 07 b 7 1 annex to chapter 7 the use of special forces in counter insurgency tasks 1 general one of the main characte ristics of most special forces is their capacity to carry out very wide spectrum of tasks rangi ng from discreet advisory visits of few days through to prolonged campaign involving comple special forces units some possible tasks are outlined below more details on the em ployment of british special forces uksf in these roles can be found in the bibl iography at the end of part 2 2 training teams their wide range of skills and language qualifications make special forces troops particularly suit able for military assistance programmes 3 raising and training indigenous forces the raising and training of local forces is traditional and effective task for special forces troops us special forces made significant contribution to the vietnam war in this role while the sas carried out similar task with the firqat in oman when involved in this task special forces troops are often involved in leading or advising the indigenous forces on oper ations but on other occasions for political reasons they may be debarred from combat 4 deep penetration patrolling and surveillance skills developed for operations in limited and general war can be applied most effe ctively in those counter revolutionary campaigns where large areas have fallen under the control of revolutionaries the sas operations on the jebel akhdar in 1959 in t he radfan in 19657 in borneo in 196266 and the us special forces operati ons against the ho chi minh trail in indochina are all examples of this activity 5 counter insurgency teams special forces are sometimes called upon to provide specially trained teams to support the civil power in uk for incidents involving armed terrorists such as the siege of the iranian embassy in london in 1980 6 plain clothes operations special forces may be called upon to conduct operations in plain clothes in counter revolutionary ca mpaign the quality of the individual and his high level of basic training make the special forces soldier especially suitable for this task additio nal training will normally be nec essary for such specialised and sophisticated operations before special forces are involved in this activity either on internal operations or on operations abroad in support of allies the legal aspects and the wider political and security implications must be carefully considered constraints 7 the main constraints on s pecial forces operations are manpower special forces are usually few in number casualties cannot be easily or quickly replaced because of t he long selection and training process b reaction time although in strategic sens special forces can react issue 20 mar 07 b 7 2 promptly and with notable flex ibility tactically there c an be some constraint the reason is that in spite of the high level of training of the special forces soldier the precision demanded of delicate counter in surgency tasks requires time for careful planning and preparation moreover once depl oyed in the field their tactical mobility will be limited because communications are usually conducted on schedules for operational reasons and because movement on f oot in hostile territory and difficult terrain is inevitably slow retasking and redeployment take many hours and sometimes days however these constrai nts need not be too serious particularly for coin operations within the designated theatre c endurance once deployed the endurance of special forces is limited by what they can carry on their backs unle ss resupply is guaranteed in hostile environments such as the desert or mountai ns the provision of water can present major problem this should not be serious constraint within the theatre of operations incountry during counter insurgency campaign principles of employment 8 high value operations special forces are precious but numerically limited asset unable to absorb large casualties due to misemplo yment to get the most out of them they need to be used precisely for they can achieve re sults out of all proportion to their size 9 command special forces should be regarded as strategic or operational assets and be kept under the theatre commanders hand tactical control should be delegated for specific operations to the appropriate level there is sometimes tendency for special forces to proliferate in coin centralised command at the highest level helps to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort and lack of coordination however careful synchronisation of special forces and main force activity is essential to avoid misunderstandings 10 access to intelligence the nature of special forces tasks makes it essential for them to have access to all available relevant intelligence if operations are to stand chance of success 11 mission command the employment of special fo rces must be tied in with the overall plan for the campai gn and their commanders must be given clear directive specifying what is required and stating any limitations on met hods of execution special forces must be commanded by their own officers and it is these officers who should work out and execute the detailed plan providing regular progress repor ts to the overall commander 12 security success so often depends upon surprise and surprise depends upon good security the inherently discreet nature of special fo rces makes them the ideal military arm to exploit intelligence from sensitive sources the compromise of such sources not only entails serious loss of capability but may raise acute political difficulties the media can pose particular threat to security in counter revolutionary operations and it is essential to work out sound public information plan with the public information staff issue 20 mar 07 b 7 3 liaison 13 within the security forces it is most important that special forces establish and maintain close liaison with all other security force units and formations with responsibilities in the same area it is likely that special forces liaison officers or nco s will be attached to the appropriate headquarters and units 14 on behalf of the authorities there may be occasions when the state authorities will wish to contact third parties or perhaps t hose acting for the insurgents this unusual form of liaison may involve special forces for th is role such tasks would require the full consent of the appropriate uk military authorities before such duties were undertaken legal issues 15 there is widespread misc onception that special forces are or should be exempt from the legal constraints wh ich bind armed forces this is misguide d and dangerous notion the legal constraints covered in chapter 1 apply to special forces operations just as they do to the more conventional type of oper ation flouting the law is invariably counter productive both in the s hort and long term once members of any special forces have been discredited in the courts and the media it is di fficult to justify their continued employment and the insurgents will then have removed ma jor obstacle to the achievement of their aims successful special operations have to be mounted within the law and any temptation to ignore legal constrai nts must be resisted 16 each member of the britis h special forces is held responsible for his actions under british military and civil w in exactly the same way as are other soldiers and policemen it is therefore incumbent on those planning special forces op erations to be aware of and to think through carefully the legal implications of any intended action in any case where point of law might arise legal advice should be sought in the planning stage conclusion 17 special forces are valuable asset in any counter insurgency campaign however they can only be effective if those directing t he campaign appreciate t heir potential their limitations and the pr inciples governing their employment issue 20 mar 07 b 8

service support afm volume 1 part 6 combat service support here they are merely listed as reminder to the reader foresight b efficiency c simplicity d cooperation agility 2 the same principles also apply to count er insurgency operations but with appropriate allowances for the intensity of operations at least in the preparatory and insurgency phases planning factors 3 some modifications to normal practice ar necessary to allow for the circumstances under which counterinsurgency operations take place deployment of the security forces in small detachments over wide area b land communications are vulnerable to in surgent interference an insurgent ability to disrupt lower flying aircraft or he licopters may complicate the provision of air supply c dependence on local resources for ex ample construction purchase storage and perhaps distribution which adds to the overall security problem d possible need to assist the civil ad ministration with the maintenance of public utilities and essential services because counterinsurgency operations are manpower intensive there will be pressure for economy in css manpower f while on the one hand lower rates of expenditure of combat supplies reduce the css burden the disper sed deployment mentioned in sub above increases it issue 20 mar 07 b 8 2 g if the security forces assisting host nation are multinational there will be problems of coordination and standardisation h the need to guard and protect vehicl and routes used for css may well affect routine logistic planning factors re lated to manpower ie who conducts this protection task front li ne units or css units the combat service support system in coin operations 4 the geographical factor the normal layout of the rear and forward support groups for conventional warfare operations may have to be adjus ted to meet the conditions peculiar to counterinsurgency operations the layout will be determined by operational and geographica l considerations if during the insurgency when guerrilla operations are widespread hub and spoke system may be more appropriate the hub will correspond to t he rear support group located near the main point of entry and the spokes to the forward support groups deployed to support combat units throughout the area affe cted by the insurgency should the insurgents consolidate an area sufficientl large to support more conventional operations or should neighb ouring state intervene on behal f of the insurgents it would be necessary to set up normal rear and forward support group organisation with the hub and spoke system superimposed on it b host nation infrastructure the layout of airfields ports the railway and road systems inland waterways depot facilities in cluding cold storage in relation to the area of operations 5 security the main supply area msa and its st atic installations should be sited in an area where there is l east risk of attack commens urate with operational and geographical factors if the scale and intensit of the operation warr ant the establishment of forward support group fsg it s units are likely to be more at risk and will require more security force effort to defend them while quiet area is des irable ease of access to the msa group and the airrailsea port of disembarkation on the one hand and convenience for forward distribution on the other may be the determining factors the greater the amount of air and helicopter lift that is av ailable the more it will be possible to cut out intermediate bases with the advantage of economies in grounded resources guards and theatre transport the use of joint sea basing wo uld ease the physical security and protection of these vulnerable installations 6 operational security care should be taken t hat css preparations do not prejudice the security of information and pl ans sudden increases in stock levels exceptional amounts of road rail and air movement the arrival of new combat service support css units in the forward areas and t he local purchase of unusual items are just some examples of changes in normal pattern of repleni shment which might betray future operation combination of secre cy insofar as it is possible to hide css preparations and convincing cover plans help to preserve security discretion in dealing with contractors and taking care not to discuss operational matters especially future plans in the hearing of local labour are essential if elementary precautions to keep our secrets secret issue 20 mar 07 b 8 3 7 fragmentation and dispersal of combat and css units there may be tendency to fragment and disperse css units to support widely deplo yed security force subunits however the support of isolated detachments in villages is problem better solved by the unit logistic staff than by an unec onomic dispersal of css units the use of helicopters can be vital provided that they are not exposed to the fire of insurgent small arms and antiaircraft weapons nevertheless some dispersion of css units may be inevitable under the hub and spok system it will be necessary to exercise careful control of resources to keep the size and num ber of css units do wn to an affordable burden on the armys assets the combat service support plan 8 reconnaissance party points to note are that the reconnaissance party sent to new theatre is likely to be organised on joint service basis with the army providin g perhaps the major element the party will aim to make early contact with the host nation government through the local british diplomatic representat ive in order to assess the resources available in the theatre and to provide an estimate of the requirements which must be sent out from the united kingdom b it follows that reconnaissance party has to include strong css element headed by sufficiently senior officer who is fully aware of the kind of operation envisaged and of the css require ments to support it he should have the authority to arrange liaison with the host nation an d allies to take decisions and to make recommendations to the ministry of fence at home and through the high commissioner or ambassadorial staff to the host

should be taken not to cause shortages in the host countrys ho market with consequent price rises causing an inflationary pressure although there are obvious political advant ages to be gained by boosting the local economy the apparent ready availability of cal supplies may be mistaken for nonexistent plenty with loca l entrepreneurs eager to exploit rapidly growing market created by an influx of troops if the civil population suffers from shortages and inflation the insurgents will be handed ready propaganda weapon with unfortunate results for the host government nd for interallied relations security 18 insurgent infiltration of labour it has to be assumed that local labour will be infiltrated by hostile intelligence agents it wil l be difficult for incoming units and security sections to distinguish between loyal and disloyal elements to reduce the potential threat to base installations ports airports roads and railways reliance should be placed on good unit and installation security and an efficient local vetting system the method of vetting has to be agreed with the host government if this is appropriate whose police and security units will be largely responsible for its impl ementation the system may never be foolproof and measures need to be taken to guard vulnerable installations from terrorist attack and to prevent the leakage of plans nd intentions all so ldiers especially css troops employing civilians have to be carefully briefed on security matters 19 protection of labour labour has to be protected from insurgent attack and intimidation if the host nati on cannot provide suitab protection additi onal combat units may have to be deployed in an escort and prot ection role in the worst case it may be necessary to bring in pioneer and labour troops to replace loca l labour coerced into leaving the employment of t he british element of the security forces 20 installations css installations need to be suit ably sited for security and defence and effectively guarded in the best case the host nation will provide prot ection if this is not possible extra combat troops may have to be provided because css units do not have sufficient men to carry out their functions and guard themselves except against the lightest of threats some installation s may hold such vital stores t hat only british troops should man issue 20 mar 07 b 8 8 and guard them nevertheless c ss troops have to be sufficiently well trained in infantry skills to be able to defend t hemselves in an emergency section 3 maintenance of essential services background 21 the possible need to help the civil adm inistration with the maintenance of public utilities and essential services is always pr esent and the potential commitment must be seen in the context of the types of milit ary assistance which might be requested in escalating scenarios the machinery of gov ernment may have broken down in parts of the country and there may be requirem ent to provide help to main tain the commercial life of host nation as well as humanitarian aid 22 normally at least skeleton work force and managerial staff will remain loyal to the civil administration nd stay at their posts reducing the demand for specialist service reinforcements however if the local labour has been intimidated to such an extent that none dare go to work the bill for specialists may be beyond the armys resources or perhaps of all three services put together even if the host nation is supported by number of allies the combined coalition resources may prove insufficient at least initially practicable compromise may be achieved if at least some of the labour can be coaxed back to work with guarantee of protection from t he local forces as the arrival of outside reinforcements begins to bolster confidence whether sufficient labour can be persuaded to return depends on the attitudes and cu stoms of the host state and whether the insurgents are prepared to concede t hat individuals have choice in the matter in the face of determined administrative action 23 there may be occasions when civil adminis tration considers that it is necessary to impose curfew in such circumstances the author ities will almost certainly call on military forces to help run the minimum services necessa ry to maintain the essentials of daily life planning 24 contingency planning for t he restoration or maintenance of essential services is lengthy process that should be c onducted as soon as is feasible so that military options can be prepared an re military wor ks force stationed in uk is t he military focal point for all such contingency planning and this unit should be included in any planning where this type of contingency can be anticipated 25 when contingency plan is executed the css staff ement in the reconnaissance party will establish in conj unction with the civil authoritie s and advised by the high commission or embassy staff in the host count ry the precise requirement to suite the circumstances the following factors will be of relevance breakdown of the civil authorities request for assistance in terms of specialists tradesmen and unskilled labour taking into account the size of the labour force which has remained at work b in the event of the requirement bei ng in excess of the planned reinforcement figure to place them in order of priority the priorities will reflect the order of issue 20 mar 07 b 8 9 importance of the utilities and services to be maintained as perceived by the civil authorities and agreed by the reconnaissance party c the requirement will be signalled to t he appropriate uk authorities who will arrange to meet as much of the bill as is f easible and report shortfalls to the reconnaissance party who in turn will inform the civil authorities 26 it is possible that some of the excess demand may be met from specialists and units nominated for other contingency plans which ar unlikely to be activated additional specialists and tradesmen may be found from css units in the home base or other theatres the training or ganisation or from the other two services military civil relationships 27 command military forces employed to maintain utilities and essential services are used solely as organised labour under their ow n commanders the latter effect liaison with the appropriate civil authorit ies and plant management to dec ide how best the troops can be employed as mentioned earlie r military specialists will need protection if possible by the local police or security forces but in certai n high risk circumstances from british forces the civil authorities should be warned if there is possibilit that the troops might be withdrawn if higher priority ci vil or military commitment shoul d arise as such drastic action may have serious consequences any proposal to withdraw military specialist support should first be discussed in the appropria joint civilmilitary committee 28 civil authority action on the logistic aspects of military operations the corollary to military aid to the civil ministries is the need for liaison with the civil authorities to ensure that the latter warn the armed forces of any decision they may take which might require carefully prepared security force reaction the closure of factory the removal of squatters the dismantling of an illegal settlement or the clearance of sl um might lead to serious confrontation for which the security forc should be well prepared an intention to dispense with or restore street lighting would affect resupply movement timings as well as night patrolling tactics and dden unnotified change might endanger soldiers lives and give away surveillance plan again in ideal circumstanc all such matters could be discussed in the forum of the local joint committee 29 g1 and g4 liaison with the local population the local committee system also provides point of contact which can be us ed to explain government and security force requirements to local leaders and to explain the need for measures which might cause quite unnecessary friction such matters might include the need to block off an approach which might be used by insurgents to attack both civili an and military targets the need to restrict movement in the interests of security and to explain how damage and compensation claims might be processed and complaints considered properly 30 meeting the essential needs of civilian population under curfew if curfew is imposed the civil authoritie s are responsible for taking measures to meet the problems

it is of great import ance that commander maintains close working relationship with his chief pinfo officer when speaking to the media and in accordance with qrs individuals should restrict themselves to matte rs of fact at their own level military commander should not normally make any st atement concerning government policies political decisions or on topics wh ich are likely to be politically sensitive in todays world almost any topic raised to commander is likel to be sensitive and thus more than ever commander will need to use his common sense when questioned and should take advice on the spot or by reference to the mod th question as to whether or not communication with the media is desirable from both the political and operational points of view should also be considered care too will need to be taken to ascertain whether there are any legal or security restraints on an item of information before it is released pinfo staff should always be consulted before statem ents are made to the media the rule of thumb to adopt is not to talk above our appointment and grade 2 the chief pinfo officer at headquarters is the source of all operational information for the media and it is he who au thorises contact with them to this end his office has to provide continuous day and ght information service manned by staff who are fully in the operational picture if the ffice is to provide an authorit ative considered consistent and credible information service the press office should receive prompt and accurate information from subordinate headquarters and unit s it should also receive early warning of projected operations together with clear instructions on how to deal with media enquiries preferably in the form of question and ans wer brief however provided that the information is received in time in notes or narrative form the pinfo staff will be able to polish the brief and provide suitable answers to all likely questions 3 large number of journa lists representing the press radio and television can be expected to report on counter insurgency operations section 2 media reporting clearance attribution and embargoes 4 to facilitate an effective twowa passage of information and to minimise unnecessary media queries standing orders s hould give guidance on the limits of the information which may be disclosed there are also conventions to be observed when journalists pose questions on cert ain sensitive subjects 5 before any information is passed to the dia it should be cleared for release by the appropriate military agency eg g2 g3 and the appropriate host nation authorities or police authorities where this is applicable and appropriate 6 conventions also cover the way in whic h information may be attributed to source mutually understood and accepted by both sides they help to promote good working relations between the army and the media before briefing jour nalists need to be told if there are any reporting restrictions if journa list does not wish to abide by them he will issue 20 mar 07 b 9 2 refuse to attend for the purposes of defini ng what may be reported and to whom it may be attributed briefings are divided into three categories attributable this means that the information given can be used as direct quotation and attributed to par ticular source or individual journalists will assume that any statement is attributable unless they are clearly told otherwise those not in fulltime pinfo appointments should only speak to journalists attributably the term attributable means the same as on the record however it is ambiguous and should not be used b nonattributable this means that the informa tion given may be used but its origin must not be revealed and it should not therefore be attributed to any individual or spokesperson c not for use this means exactly what it says it applies to the issue of information in the form of an explanatory brie fing which cannot be published such briefings will only be giv at the highest level 7 information may also be given to the media under cover of an embargo usually for security or privacy reasons the embargo spec ifies that the information may not be used before given time and date the restricti on should be used sparingly and never merely for convenience 8 the above directions and restrictions pply equally to off duty informal and social contacts with the media section 3 handling the media general 9 the journalist in an operational area has tough highly competitive and sometimes dangerous job his or her pr imary purpose is to get be tter story than his or her competitors and to get it in for the earliest possible public ation the basic precepts to be applied in dealing with the media are unnecessary hindrance is to be offered to journalists freedom to operate it is in the interests of law and order that the press should have facilities to expose terrorism acts of violence and the inti midation of civilians b member of the media has the same rights

mar 07 b 9 3 into political areas the same applies to ma tters concerning the security forces operations or when life is endangered 11 in practice this means that the media may conduct their business subject to the following caveats they have right to enter mod proper ty without the permission of the officer responsible for that property b the final decision as to whether or not to give an interview rests with the soldier and then only with the concurrence and guidance of pinfo staff c journalists may normally photograph ll personnel and equipment in public places from public places they ma not photograph personn equipment or property within mod premises if there is security reason why the security forces do not wish photograph to be published eg an eod team at work this should be explained to the photographer who is then in the wrong if he or she persists if necessary journalist may be removed from the scene and any film may be confiscated but should be handed to the po lice in connection with any arrest action deemed appropriate d if commander on the ground believes that the media are prejudicing security during an operation he should deal with the matter by pers uasion admonition or as last resort and only if crimi nal offence is suspected by physical restraint or arrest it is possible that reporters may delib erately wish to expose themselves to danger against the advice of the security forces if they do not yield to persuasion clear warning must be given in front of witnesses of the possible consequences of their actions and that they must accept responsibility for them f reporters may ask for priority at checkpoint they have right to this but they have deadline pressures where practicable operationally and when the request is seen to be reasonable the repo rter should be allowed to pass without delay information for the media 12 all operational information fo r the media is to be given by the pinfo staff or upo or by those authorised to do so when accompanied by one of these officers 13 commanders or those authorised by th em may communicate directly with the media when the information given is strictly factual and relates solely to that commanders formation and does not touch on any politically controversial area 14 pinfo staff approval is requi red before any member of the security forces agrees to give statement or interview to the media before considering any request for facility pinfo staff must be aware of who the in terviewer is what agency publication or programme he represents and agree the sc ope and line

forces are satisfied that journalist is bona fide facilit ies should not be granted 16 in certain circumstances members of t he media may be accredited to the security forces and be given au thenticated credentials military families 17 official restriction can be placed on service families in dealing with the media however they should be advise d by their heads of family to seek advice

cooperation cimic section 1 the place of cimic in military operations 1 background in world with growing populat ion and increasing urbanisation military forces when deployed on operations ar more likely than before to have contact with the civilian population the relationship of the m ilitary with and their treatment of the local population in the area of operations inevitably will be bject to media scrutiny furthermore the conditions an d prospects of any indigenous po pulation will probably be dominant consideration in det ermining the desired conclusion of any campaign particularly in coin operations commanders can expec t to be bound by political and humanitarian imperatives to discharge internat ional moral and legal obligatio ns to civilians counter insurgency operations can be disr upted by the deliberately hosti actions of the populace the failure of the population to cooperate fully with the security forces or the uncontrolled displacement of civilians as result of insu rgency however civilians can also help to substantially enhance military effo rt and effectiveness gaps in combat service support can be closed by use of local civilian re sources and if commanders recognise the potential synergistic advant ages can be obtained by harnessing government and community support as potential force multipli er although core element of military operations for many years cimic has gained in prominence with increased uk involvement in complex operations normally stab ility and counter insurgency operations 2 multidimensional environment any operational environment is likely to be complex unstable and unpred ictable when planning an d conducting operations intolerance of collateral damage casualties and materiel damage to the environment and legal issues will be constraining fa ctors as will social political cultural religious economic and humanitarian considerations military success alone will achieve little beyond containment of situation unless the conditions for the pursuit of civil objectives by civil actors are created1 3 harmonisation of effort the civil actors engaged in conf lict or crisis situation will have varying mandates competencies and capac ities the harmonisation of civil and military efforts will increase cohe rence and synergy in generating the effects required by the strategic objectives cimic is the process by which this harmonisation is achieved the nature and extent of which will vary depending on the specific operati onal circumstances collaboration across government and beyond in accordance with the principles of the comprehensive approach will harmonise all contributions enabling better identification and achievement of desired outcomes this approach is supported at the operational and tactical level by integrating cimic staff and the cimic process into the chain of command because cimic is command led process section 2 the purpose of cimic 4 purpose cimic is function of operations conducted to allow the commander to interact effectively on daytoday basic with the civil environment in the joint operations 1 the term civil actors may be taken to include ios donor organisations eg

provides fundamental input to military planning processes and contributes to the setting of conditions for mission success b support to the force by influencing the attit udes and conduct of civil

commander in addition cimic contributes to fulfillment of the commanders obligations to ensure that operations are conducted within ll applicable law c support to the civil community support to the civil community can involve information personnel materiel equipment communications specialist expertise or training any support given should contribu to the military mission although civil objectives may be supported where civil au thorities and agencies would otherwise be unable to carry out their tasks hence the military mission may be expanded to include the conduct of tasks normally the

litary commanders and their national and international political and policy decisionmaking bodies should be governed by the principles of the comprehensiv approach such an approach at the strategic level ensures that planning is consistent with the wider political objectives and strategy this consistency has to be maintained at the operational and tactical levels 2 the term cimic is only applied
