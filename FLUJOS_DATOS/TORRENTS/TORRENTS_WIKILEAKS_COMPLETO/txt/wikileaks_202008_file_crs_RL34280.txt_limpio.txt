established new voluntary prescription drug benefit under new medicare part d effective january 1 2006 prescription drug coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans pdps or medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans beneficiaries must enroll in one of these private plans in order to obtain their drug benefits the program relies on these private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal subsidies covering the bulk of the risk are provided to encourage participation at minimum plans offer standard coverage or alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits they may also offer enhanced benefits all plans are required to meet certain minimum requirements including those related to beneficiary protections however there are significant differences among plans in terms of benefit design drugs included on plan formularies ie list of covered drugs costsharing applicable for particular drugs and monthly premiums in general beneficiaries can enroll in plan or change plan enrollment when they first become eligible for medicare or during the annual open enrollment period the open enrollment period for 2008 was from november 15 2007 to december 31 2007 plans can change from year to year beneficiary needs may also change therefore beneficiaries should review their plan choice annually to make sure that their chosen plan continues to meet their needs as of january 2008 approximately 254 million medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in pdp and mapd plans of these approximately 94 million were receiving lowincome subsidy assistance an additional 67 million beneficiaries had prescription drug coverage through former employer that is receiving federal subsidy for portion of such coverage approximately 75 million beneficiaries had drug coverage through another source an estimated 46 million or 104 of medicare beneficiaries had drug coverage major focus of the drug benefit is the enhanced coverage provided to lowincome individuals who enroll in part d lowincome enrollees including persons known as dual eligibles those persons enrolled in both medicare and medicaid who previously received drug benefits under medicaid have their prescription drug costs paid under part d persons with incomes below 150 of poverty have assistance with some portion of their premium and costsharing charges persons with the lowest incomes have the highest level of benefits dualeligibles as well as certain other lowincome enrollees are enrolled in plans with premiums at or below the lowincome subsidy level for the region they pay zero premium for such plans though they may select plan with higher premium and pay the difference some plans with premiums below the lowincome subsidy level in 2007 longer qualified as zero premium plans in 2008 as result effective january 1 2008 16 million beneficiaries were assigned to new plan with new organization and an additional 965000 were

2006 prescription drug coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans pdps or medicare advantage prescription drug mapd plans at minimum these plans offer standard coverage or alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits beneficiaries are required to enroll in one of these private plans in order to obtain their drug benefits the program relies on these private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal subsidies covering the bulk of the risk is provided to encourage participation unlike other medicare services the benefits can only be obtained through private plans further while all plans have to meet certain minimum requirements there are significant differences among them in terms of benefit design drugs included on plan formularies ie list of covered drugs and costsharing applicable for particular drugs major focus of the drug benefit is the enhanced coverage provided to lowincome individuals who enroll in part d lowincome enrollees including persons known as dual eligibles those persons enrolled in both medicare and medicaid who previously received drug benefits under medicaid have their

pl 110275 which became law july 15 2008 made few modifications to the part d program crs2 enrollment in part d all persons enrolled in medicare part andor medicare part b are eligible to enroll in prescription drug plan under part d beneficiaries enrolled in the original medicare program obtain drug coverage through pdp beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plan through medicare advantage ma organization generally have to obtain drug coverage through their ma organization if the ma enrollee wants to enroll in pdp he or she must drop their ma enrollment there is one major exception to this rule while most ma organizations are required to offer mapd plan private feeforservice ma plans are not required to do so1 an individual enrolled in plan not offering drug coverage may purchase coverage through pdp plan information different pdp and mapd plans are available in different parts of the country some organizations offer national plans information on plan availability and characteristics can be obtained from number of sources these include the medicare tollfree information number 1800medicare and the website httpwwwmedicaregov other organizations may also be able to provide assistance these include state health insurance assistance programs ships and other local organizations beneficiaries must enroll with the organization offering their selected plan they can enroll by mail in person or on the web beneficiaries and persons assisting them can look for plan meeting their needs by going to the medicare drug plan finder on httpwwwmedicaregov an individual using the web tool should have list of all the medications the beneficiary currently takes together with dosage units the plan finder will then show the beneficiary the five plans in the area with the lowest total annual cost for the package of drugs the individual takes it is important to note that plan with the lowest premium andor deductible may not in fact be the lowest cost plan overall further the lowest cost plan for one member of couple may not be the lowest cost plan for that persons spouse beneficiaries should review their plan choice annually plans can make changes effective january 1 each year by october 31 of the previous year plans are required to provide plan enrollees with summary of the benefits for the following year and an outline of changes made from the current year plans can make number of changes from one year to the next including changing drugs included in the plans formulary andor changing the required costsharing charges for certain drugs therefore enrollees should review materials provided by the plans to make sure that their chosen plans continue to meet their needs 1 see crs report rl34151 private fee for service pffs plans how they differ from other medicare advantage plans by paulette c morgan hinda chaikind and holly stockdale crs3 enrollment periods initial enrollment period in general medicare beneficiaries need to enroll in plan during their initial enrollment period in order to avoid the delayed enrollment penalty persons on the medicare rolls when the drug program began had until may 15 2006 to enroll in part d plan for 2006 persons eligible for medicare at later date have an initial sevenmonth enrollment period beginning three months before the month of medicare eligibility this initial enrollment period is the same as that applicable for medicare part b coverage for these individuals begins on the first day of the first month following the month of enrollment but earlier than the first month they are entitled to medicare annual open enrollment period in general an individual who does not enroll during their initial enrollment period is only able to enroll during the annual open enrollment period which occurs from november 15december 31 each year coverage begins the following january 1 creditable coverage persons who fail to enroll during their initial enrollment period are subject to penalty if they decide to enroll in part d at later date however they are not subject to the penalty if they have maintained creditable drug coverage through another public or private source creditable coverage is defined as drug benefits whose actuarial value equals or exceeds that of standard coverage sources of possible creditable coverage are retiree health coverage offered by former employer or union and military coverage including tricare beneficiary who has creditable coverage may wish to enroll in part d plan after the conclusion of their initial enrollment period care must be taken to assure that any noncoverage period between the two events does not exceed 63 days otherwise the beneficiary could be subject to late enrollment penalty for example retiree who is enrolled in plan offered by his former employer decides in july 2008 that he wants to drop the employer coverage and enroll in part d the individual is not able to enroll in part d plan until the annual election period november 15 to december 31 coverage will not begin until the following january 1 he will probably want to keep his employer coverage through the end of 2008 special enrollment periods in general individuals can only enroll in part d during their initial enrollment period or during the annual open enrollment period however there are few limited occasions when an individual may have special enrollment period including moving to new geographic area involuntary loss of creditable coverage inadequate information provided on creditable coverage status federal error termination of pdp contract and plan failures special enrollment periods also apply for lowincome enrollees deemed eligible for subsidy outside of the initial or annual enrollment periods see lowincome discussion below late enrollment penalty the part d delayed enrollment penalty provision is intended to prevent adverse selection adverse selection occurs when only those persons who think they need the benefit actually enroll in the program when this happens per capita costs are driven up thereby causing more persons presumably the healthier and less costly ones to drop out of the program over time as more crs4 persons drop out program costs become prohibitive the intention of the penalty is to encourage all persons who do not have creditable coverage to enroll those who have creditable coverage are maintaining insurance protection and are not deferring coverage until they will actually need it the late enrollment penalty is assessed on persons who go for 63 days or longer after the close of their initial part d enrollment period without creditable coverage and subsequently enroll in part d the penalty is based on the number of months the individual does not have creditable coverage the premium that would otherwise apply is increased for each month without creditable coverage the late enrollment penalty is frequently described as being equal to at least 1 of the otherwise applicable premium for each uncovered month the actual calculation is somewhat more complicated the law specifies that the penalty is the greater of 1 the amount cms determines is actuarially sound for each uncovered month or 2 1 of the base beneficiary premium for each uncovered month the base beneficiary premium is national figure it may therefore be different than the premium for the plan selected by the beneficiary for uncovered months occurring during 2006 and 2007 the 1 calculation applies the penalty applies for as long as the individual is enrolled in part d the dollar amount of the each individuals penalty is expected to increase each year as noted above individuals first eligible for medicare on or before january 31 2006 who failed to enroll by may 15 2006 were not able to enroll until november 15 2006 with coverage beginning january 1 2007 if these individuals did not have creditable coverage during the period they would have seven uncovered months their penalty would therefore be 7 of the base beneficiary premium 191 7 of the base monthly beneficiary premium of 2735 for 2007 if these same persons waited an additional year their penalty would be 19 of the base monthly beneficiary premium 531 19 of the base beneficiary premium of 2793 for 2008 special rules apply for persons who qualify for the lowincome subsidy outside of their initial enrollment period or the annual open enrollment period these individuals can enroll in part d plan at any time during the year and not be subject to the late enrollment penalty otherwise applicable to persons who miss the enrollment periods part d benefits qualified coverage pdp sponsors and mapd plans are required to offer minimum set of benefits referred to as qualified coverage qualified coverage is defined as either standard prescription drug coverage or alternative prescription drug coverage with at least actuarially equivalent benefits ie having at least equivalent dollar value in both cases access must be provided to negotiated prices for drugs crs5 defined standard coverage standard prescription drug coverage is defined as follows deductible paid by the beneficiary 275 in 2008 75 of costs paid by the program and 25 of costs paid by the beneficiary up to the initial coverage limit 2510 in 2008 in 2008 this represents 83375 in total outof pocket costs paid by beneficiary and 2510 in total spending 100 of costs paid by the beneficiary for drug spending falling in the coverage gap up to the catastrophic threshold between 251001 and 572625 in 2008 in 2008 this represents 4050 in total outof pocket costs paid by the beneficiary and 572625 in total spending all costs paid by program over the catastrophic threshold or trigger 572625 in 2008 except for nominal beneficiary cost sharing nominal costsharing is defined as the greater of 1 copayment of 225 in 2008 for generic drug or preferred multiple source drug and 560 in 2008 for other drugs or 2 5 coinsurance each year the dollar amounts are increased by the annual percentage increase in average per capita aggregate expenditures for covered outpatient drugs for medicare beneficiaries for the 12month period ending in july of the previous year table 1 shows the standard benefit as well as costs paid by lowincome beneficiaries discussed later in this report true outofpocket troop costs beneficiaries must incur certain level of outofpocket costs 4050 in 2008 before catastrophic protection begins costs are only considered incurred if they are incurred for the deductible cost sharing or benefits not paid because they fall in the coverage gap sometimes referred to as the doughnut hole incurred costs do not include amounts for which benefits are provided because drug is excluded under particular plans formulary costs are treated as incurred and thus treated as true outofpocket troop costs only if they are paid by the individual or by another family member on behalf of the individual paid on behalf of lowincome individual under the subsidy provisions or under state pharmaceutical assistance program any costs for which the individual is reimbursed by insurance or otherwise do not count toward the troop amount crs6 table 1 part d standard

certain requirements these plans have the same actuarial value as the standard benefit but different benefit structure for example they may eliminate the deductible but have costsharing requirements higher than the 25 amount under basic standard coverage they may also used tiered costsharing under which generics have the lowest costsharing preferred brands have the next level of cost sharing and nonpreferred brand have higher cost sharing requirements some plans may have specialty tier for very high cost drugs crs7 cms recognizes two types of actuarially equivalent plans plans labeled actuarially equivalent standard offer different costsharing structure plans labeled basic alternative standard may reduce the deductible change costsharing andor change the initial coverage limit in 2007 51 of enrollees were in plans offering actuarially equivalent benefits enhanced coverage plans may offer enhanced coverage which exceeds the value of defined standard coverage this coverage includes both basic coverage and supplemental benefits supplemental benefits may include some coverage in the coverage gap for example coverage of generic drugs andor reductions in cost sharing that increase the actuarial value of the package in 2007 35 of enrollees were in plans offering enhanced coverage pdpsponsor cannot offer an enhanced plan unless it also offers basic plan in the service area as noted above ma organizations offering ma coordinated care plans are required to offer at least one plan in the service area with drug coverage the drug coverage can be either basic coverage or enhanced coverage with premium for the supplemental benefits2 access to negotiated prices all plans are required to provide beneficiaries with access to negotiated prices for covered part d drugs this access must be provided even when part d benefits are payable because the beneficiary has not met the deductible or the beneficiary is in the coverage gap negotiated prices are to take into account negotiated price concessions for covered drugs that are passed through to enrollees at the point of sale such price concessions include discounts direct or indirect subsidies rebates and other direct or indirect remunerations special provisions for lowincome populations major focus of part d is the enhanced coverage provided to lowincome individuals persons with incomes below 150 of poverty and assets below specified levels have assistance with some portion of part d premium and costsharing charges persons with the lowest incomes have the highest level of assistance eligibility for lowincome subsidy lis assistance definition of eligible groups special premium and costsharing subsidies are available for lowincome persons this population is divided into two main groups with the first group divided into subgroups for purposes of determining costsharing requirements the two main groups are defined as follows 2 the only way that there could be premium for supplemental benefits is if the plan applied credit of rebate dollars under the plans part c bid against the otherwise applicable premium crs8 full subsidy eligible individuals this group includes all persons who 1 are enrolled in pdp plan or mapd plan 2 have incomes below 135 of the federal poverty level 14040 for an individual and 18900 for couple in 2008 and 3 have resources in 2008 below 6290 for an individual and 9440 for couple increased each year by the percentage increase in the consumer price index or cpi the 2008 resource limits are generally publicized as 7790 and 12440 because 1500 per person is excluded for burial expenses the following groups of persons are also defined as full subsidy eligible individuals dual eligibles these are persons entitled to the full range of benefits under their states medicaid program prior to january 1 2006 these persons received their drug benefits under medicaid effective january 1 2006 their drug benefits are provided through part d all full benefit dual eligible individuals are deemed to be in the full subsidy eligible group regardless of whether they meet the other eligibility requirements recipients of supplemental security income ssi benefits or enrollees in medicare savings program msp mma permitted the secretary to extend full subsidy eligible coverage to enrollees in msp implementing regulations extended coverage to this group there are three medicare savings programs that provide medicaid assistance for medicare premiums and costsharing charges the three groups are 1 qualified medicare beneficiaries qmbs3 2 specified lowincome medicare beneficiaries slmbs4 and 3 qualifying individuals qis5 3 qmbs are aged or disabled persons with incomes at or below the federal poverty level in 2008 the monthly level is 887 for an individual and 1187 for couple these levels include monthly 20 disregard for unearned income assets must be below 4000 for an individual and 6000 for couple qmbs are entitled to have their medicare costsharing charges and the medicare part b premium paid by the federalstate medicaid program medicaid protection is limited to payment of medicare costsharing charges ie the medicare beneficiary is not entitled to coverage of medicaid plan services such as long term care unless the individual is otherwise entitled to medicaid 4 slmbs meet the qmb criteria except that their income is between 100 and 120 of the federal poverty level in 2008 the monthly income limits are 1060 for an individual and 1420 for couple medicaid protection is limited to payment of the medicare part b premium ie the medicare beneficiary is not entitled to coverage of medicaid plan services unless the individual is otherwise entitled to medicaid 5 these are persons who meet the qmb criteria except that their income is between 120 and 135 of poverty further they are not otherwise eligible for medicaid in 2008 the monthly income limit for qi for an individual is 1190 and for couple 1595 medicaid protection for these persons is limited to payment of the monthly medicare part b premium note that in 2010 the resource limits under the msp programs are raised to the level applicable for full subsidy eligible part d enrollees crs9 other subsidy eligible individuals this group includes all other persons who 1 are enrolled in pdp plan or mapd plan 2 have incomes below 150 of poverty 15600 for an individual and 21000 for couple in 2008 and 3 have resources in 2008 below 10490 for an individual and 20970 for couple increased in future years by the percentage increase in the cpi the publicized resource limits of 11990 and 23970 include 1500 per person burial allowance definition of income and assets the definitions of income and assets generally follows that used for determining eligibility under the qmb slmb and qi1 programs which in turn link back to the definitions used for purposes of the ssi program there are however few items that should be noted family size currently the federal poverty level fpl used for income determinations is that applicable for an individual or for couple mma specified that the fpl is to be that for the family of the size involved therefore the regulations define the family size to include in addition to the applicant and spouse additional persons related to the applicant who live in the same residence and depend on the applicant or spouse for at least onehalf of their financial support the income of these additional persons would not however be used in the determination of eligibility resources mma provides for the development of simplified application in which applicants attest to their level of resources and submit minimal documentation only liquid resources or those that could be converted to cash within 20 days and real estate that is not the applicants primary residence are considered liquid resources include such things as checking and savings accounts stocks and bonds vehicles are excluded because they are not considered liquid assets more generous state standards the law section 1902r2 of the social security act allows states to use more generous income and assets rules for determining eligibility for the qmb slmb and qi1 programs few states have elected this option as noted above mma permitted the secretary to include all persons meeting qmb slmb and qi1 criteria in the full subsidy eligible group the secretary elected to do so however only persons on qmb slmb or qi1 rolls are actually included states are not permitted to use the less restrictive methodologies for other subsidy eligibility determinations the standards will be the same nationwide for these persons exemptions from income and resources effective january 1 2010 support and maintenance furnished in kind will be excluded from the definition of income further any part of the value of any life insurance policy will be excluded from the definition of resources crs10 lis benefits subsidies are provided for both premiums and costsharing charges premium subsidies premium subsidies are available for both full subsidy eligible and other subsidy eligible persons however the amount of assistance is less for the second group full subsidy eligible individuals all full subsidyeligible individuals receive premium subsidy equal to 100 of the lowincome benchmark premium amount see following discussion but in case higher than the actual premium amount for basic coverage under the plan selected by the enrollee in addition the premium subsidy amount can not be less than the premium for the lowestcost pdp plan in the region thus all full subsidy eligible individuals are entitled to full premium subsidy for at least one plan in their region however if beneficiary selects plan with premium higher than the benchmark the beneficiary is liable for the additional costs full subsidy eligible individuals but not other subsidy eligible individuals also have premium subsidy for any part d late enrollment penalty equal to 80 for the first 60 months of delayed enrollment and 100 thereafter other subsidy eligible individuals all other subsidy eligible individuals have sliding scale premium subsidy ranging from 100 of the premium subsidy amount at 135 of poverty to 0 of such value at 150 of poverty specifically the subsidy is 75 for persons with incomes above 135 but at or below 140 of poverty 50 for persons with incomes above 140 but at or below 145 of poverty and 25 for persons with incomes above 145 but below 150 of poverty calculation of lowincome benchmark premium the lowincome benchmark premium for region is the weighted average of the monthly beneficiary premiums for basic prescription drug coverage the lowincome benchmark is defined as the weighted average premium with the weight based on plan enrollment for 2006 the programs first year all pdps were assigned an equal weight mas were enrollment weighted if they had 2005 enrollment beginning in 2007 the bid amounts were to be weighted by plan enrollment in the previous year however since many beneficiaries selected lowcost plans in 2006 using weighted average would have the effect of reducing the regional lowincome benchmark premium amounts instead cms decided to transition to the weighting methodology using the secretarys demonstration authority medicare demonstration to transition enrollment of lowincome subsidy beneficiaries for 2007 it used the same methodology used for 2006 beginning for 2008 it is implementing transition from the 2006 methodology and the weighted average method based on actual plan enrollments in 2008 50 of the regional benchmark is based on the 2006 averaging methodology and 50 on the enrollmentweighted average for determining the enrollmentweighted average part d enrollees in pdps and mapds in june 2007 are used table 2 shows the applicable 2008 amount by pdp region crs11 table 2 lowincome benchmark by region 2008 monthly monthly region states subsidy region states subsidy 1 nh 3064 18 mo

coverage gap ie doughnut hole and costsharing over the catastrophic threshold full benefit dual eligibles who are residents of medical institution or nursing facility have costsharing other full benefit dual eligible individuals with incomes up to 100 of poverty have costsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket threshold of 105 in 2008 for generic drug prescription or preferred multiple source drug prescription and 310 in 2008 for any other drug prescription all other full subsidy eligible individuals have costsharing for all costs up to the outofpocket threshold of 225 in 2008 for generic drug or preferred multiple source drug and 560 in 2008 for any other drug see table 1 other subsidy eligible individuals have 56 deductible in 2008 15 coinsurance for all costs up to the catastrophic trigger level and costsharing for costs above this level of 225 in 2008 for generic drug prescription or preferred crs12 multiple source drug prescription and 560 in 2008 for any other drug prescription see table 1 each year the costsharing amounts for full benefit dual eligibles below 100 of poverty are increased by the increase in the cpi the costsharing amounts for all other persons and the deductible amount for other subsidy eligible individuals are increased by the annual percentage increase in per capita beneficiary expenditures for part d covered drugs enrollment generally there is twostep process for lowincome persons to gain part d coverage first determination must be made that they qualify for the assistance and second they must enroll or be enrolled in specific part d plan special procedures were established to make the process easier the procedures are different for different categories of lowincome enrollees dual eligibles there were more than 6 million dual eligibles who needed to be enrolled in part d plan effective january 1 2006 cms established an auto enrollment process which was intended to assure there was gap in coverage though the program did encounter some problems in the early stages the autoenrollment process was random among plans with premiums at or below the lowincome benchmark premium persons becoming dually eligible after january 2006 are also autoenrolled into part d plan there are number of differences among available plans key differences are drugs included in plan formularies and pharmacies participating in the plan as network pharmacies some dual eligibles may find that they are autoenrolled in plan which may not best meet their needs for this reason they are able to change enrollment at any time with the new coverage effective the following month it should be noted that if an enrollee selects plan with premium above the low income benchmark he or she is required to pay the difference enrollees in medicare savings programs cms established process labeled facilitated enrollment for enrollees in medicare savings programs msps ssi enrollees and persons who applied for and were approved for lowincome subsidy assistance the basic features applicable to autoenrollment for dual eligibles ie random assignment to plans with premiums below the lowincome benchmark and assignment of ma enrollees to the lowestcost mapd plan offered by the ma organization were extended to facilitate enrollment beneficiaries eligible for facilitated enrollment in 2006 were sent notices informing them of the plans they would be enrolled in if they took action if the beneficiary failed to select another plan and did not decline part d enrollment he or she was considered to have enrolled in the assigned plan effective may 1 2006 facilitated enrollment also applies for persons becoming eligible for msp after that date as is the case for dual eligible an msp enrollee can change plan enrollment throughout the year crs13 other lowincome persons mma extended lowincome subsidies to all persons with incomes below 150 of poverty and assets below specified levels persons not identified as dual eligibles msp enrollees or ssi recipients may qualify but they need to submit an application the social security administration ssa generally makes eligibility determinations for those who fill out the applications though an individual may request the state medicaid agency to make the determination cms facilitates enrollment in part d plans for persons identified as qualifying for extra help however unless they are dual eligibles or msp enrollees they are only able to switch plans once during the year with the new coverage effective the following month 2008 enrollment there are several circumstances under which lowincome subsidyeligible person experienced change from 2007 to 2008 these include cases in which an individual 1 was enrolled in plan in 2007 whose 2008 premium would longer fall below the lowincome benchmark premium 2 was enrolled in plan that terminated its participation in part d 3 lost automatic eligibility for the lowincome subsidy in 2008 or 4 fell into different subsidy category individuals enrolled in plans in 2007 that longer have premiums below the benchmark or in plans that terminate cms established process for reassigning these beneficiaries to different part d plan beneficiaries that were reassigned had to meet all of the following criteria they were deemed eligible for subsidy in 2007 because they were dual eligibles participants in msp ssi recipients or because they applied and were found eligible for the full subsidy they would continue to be eligible for subsidy in 2008 they were originally autoenrolled or had their enrollment facilitated into pdp they did not elect to enroll in different plan their 2007 plan had 2008 premium that was above the minimus amount which is the benchmark plus 1 or terminated at the end of 2007 beneficiaries meeting all of these criteria were reassigned to different pdp in the region as follows the beneficiaries were assigned to another plan in the same region offered by the same pdp sponsor if the sponsor had plan with premium at or below the benchmark or if there was none available plan below the minimus amount if such plan existed cms randomly assigned beneficiaries among pdp sponsors with at least one plan with premium at or below the benchmark cms notified beneficiaries in early november 2007 of their plan assignment they were reassigned to new plan effective january 1 2008 however beneficiaries could voluntarily elect to stay in their existing plan if it was still offered or select different plan from the one assigned by cms crs14 beneficiaries who changed plans after they were either autoassigned to plan or had their enrollment facilitated into plan did not have their selection changed by cms however they were informed that their plans premium was rising above the regional lowincome subsidy amount by more than the minimus 1 in 2008 and would therefore be liable for any excess if they stayed with their current plan the beneficiary was free to change his or her selection on october 29 2007 cms announced that it was sending reassignment notices to 16 million persons who would be reassigned to new plan outside of their current organization and an additional 965000 persons who were to be reassigned to new plan within their current organization it also announced that it was sending chooser notices to the 442000 persons who qualified for full premium subsidy but the 2007 plan they had selected would have premium in 2008 above the minimus amount individuals losing automatic eligibility for lowincome subsidy persons automatically qualifying for lowincome subsidy are dual eligibles persons enrolled in msp and ssi recipients in september 2007 cms sent letters to those beneficiaries losing their automatic eligibility for lowincome subsidy in 2008 because they longer fell into one of these categories at the same time these beneficiaries were told they still might qualify for assistance and were encouraged to file lowincome subsidy application with ssa the application and postage paid envelope were enclosed with each notice individuals falling into different subsidy category beneficiaries who would experience change in their lowincome subsidy level in 2008 received notice in october 2007 informing them of the change these beneficiaries are subject to different costsharing requirements interaction with state pharmacy assistance programs number of states have had state pharmaceutical assistance programs spaps in place for number of years these programs were set up to offer prescription drug benefits to lowincome individuals who did not have medicaid drug coverage many but not all persons enrolled in spaps are eligible for lowincome subsidies under part d spap payments made on their behalf to cover part d costsharing charges count toward the individuals true outofpocket troop costs trigger mma defines an spap as one that provides assistance to persons in all part d plans and does not discriminate based on the part d plan in which the individual is enrolled cms interpreted the part d language to mean that if an spap offers part d premium assistance or supplemental part d costsharing assistance it must offer equal assistance for all pdp and mapd plans available in the region and may not steer beneficiaries to one plan or another through benefit design or otherwise violation of this nondiscrimination rule would violate the spaps status with respect to counting troop the inability to steer beneficiaries to selected plan or plans effectively meant that an spap could not autoenroll its participants in preferred part d plans this proved to be concern for some states who argued they should be able to enroll their beneficiaries in preferred plans if they gave individuals the option to switch to other plans if they wanted to crs15 cms established policies intended to balance the need to adhere to the nondiscrimination requirement with state concerns it generally required spaps to provide wraparound benefits namely fill in the gaps for their part d beneficiaries regardless of the plan the beneficiary chose to enroll in and permitted spaps when acting as authorized representatives to enroll their beneficiaries in part d plans using only beneficiaryspecific criteria to limit the selection of part d plans in its 2008 call letter to plans cms refined the policy to explicitly permit states to adopt reasonable coordinating criteria spaps with authorized representative status are allowed to facilitate enrollment of their beneficiaries into plans that agree to the state specific coordination criteria such as offering similar formularies and pharmacy network structures such criteria must be of the kind that any part d plan could meet if it chose spaps must continue to permit beneficiaries who wish to enroll in plan not meeting the coordinating criteria to do so they must provide the same wraparound benefits or assistance part d plans pdp regions mma required the secretary to designate pdp regions the service area for pdp plan must include the entire pdp region plan can be offered in more than one pdp region including all pdp regions the secretary designated 34 pdp regions region is smaller than state twentyfive states are individual regions twelve states are part of two state regions there is one region with two states and the district of columbia one region with four states and one region with seven states see table 2 for states in each region approval of pdp plans each year cms issues call letter to contractors planning to offer pdp andor ma plans in the coming year the 2008 call letter issued in april 2007 combined contracting guidance for both programs potential pdp and ma sponsors are required to submit bids by the first monday in june of the previous year each potential pdp sponsor is required to submit bid and supplemental information for each part d plan it intends to offer the following information is to be included with the bid 1 the coverage to be provided 2 actuarial value of qualified prescription drug coverage in the region for beneficiary with national average risk profile 3 information on the bid including the basis for the actuarial value the portion of the bid attributable to basic coverage and if applicable the portion attributable to enhanced coverage and assumptions regarding the reinsurance subsidy see discussion on financing below and 4 service area cms reviews the information to conduct negotiations regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed bid and benefit plan private feeforservice plans under medicare part c are exempt from the negotiation requirements crs16 mma specified that the negotiating authority is similar to the authority the director of the office of personnel management has with respect to federal employees health benefits fehb plans however the law specifically states that the secretary may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and pdp sponsors further the secretary may not require particular formulary or institute price structure for the reimbursement of covered part d drugs this is know as the noninterference provision cms can only approve plan if certain requirements are met the plan must comply with part d requirements including those relating to beneficiary protections cms must determine that the plan and the sponsor meet requirements relating to actuarial determinations further the secretary may not find that the design of the plan and its benefits including any formulary and tiered formulary structure are likely to discourage enrollment by certain beneficiaries for both 2007 and 2008 cms negotiated with plan sponsors to ensure that each bid submitted represented meaningful variation based on plan characteristics that would provide beneficiaries with substantially different options cms has stated that it would not expect that more than two bids from sponsoring organization would provide meaningful variation unless one of the bids is an enhanced alternative plan with coverage in the gap contracts the law and regulations establish requirements for pdp plan sponsors in general pdp sponsor must be licensed under state law as risk bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each state in which it is offering drug plan alternatively it could meet solvency standards established by cms for entities not licensed by the state the entity must assume its financial risk on prospective basis for covered benefits it may obtain insurance ie reinsure or make other arrangements for the costs of coverage pdp sponsors enter into contracts with cms the contract may cover more than one part d plan under terms of the contract the sponsor agrees to comply with part d requirements and have satisfactory administrative and management arrangements cms cannot enter contract with an organization unless it meets minimum enrollment requirements of 5000 individuals or 1500 individuals if the organization primarily serves individuals residing outside of urbanized areas cms may waive the minimum enrollment requirement during the first contract year for sponsor in region each contract is for period of 12 months an entity is determined qualified to renew its contract annually only if cms informs the entity that it is qualified to renew the contract and the plan sponsor has not provided cms of notice of its intent not to renew however renewal of contract is contingent on reaching agreement on the bid if the sponsor and cms cannot reach agreement renewal takes place crs17 plan monitoring cms monitors plan operations with particular emphasis on the following five performance measures telephone customer service wait times frequency and types of complaints timeliness and resolution of appeals completeness of enrollment information available to pharmacists and the percent of drug pricing changes available on the drug plan finder on the web and the percent of drugs on the finder with price increases drug payments part d plan sponsors or the pharmaceutical benefit managers pbms they have contracted with negotiate prices with drug manufacturers wholesalers and pharmacies the negotiated price ie the price that is available to the beneficiary is net of some or all of rebates discounts and other price concessions the plans negotiated price may reflect the same prices that health plan or pbm would get for its commercially insured members or it may be different part d plans are expected to negotiate on behalf of enrollees for price discounts these discounts may be passed on to beneficiaries and the program in many ways including lower copayment and coinsurance lower prices compared with retail prices and lower premiums portion of the manufacturers price concessions may be retained by the plan plan sponsors negotiate with pharmacies in order to include sufficient number and geographic distribution of pharmacies in their networks the plan reimburses the pharmacy for the cost of the drug plus dispensing fee pharmacies set their own rates for dispensing drugs but may give the plan discount on their usual rate plans negotiated prices may be found on the wwwmedicaregov website beneficiaries can also compare negotiated prices for different plans in their area by law the net prices charged to part d plans are not made public the amount of price concessions is reported to cms the 2008 medicare trustees report estimated the average rebate at 9 for 2008 it was expected to remain at that level through 2017 as noted above some but not necessarily all of these savings may be passed on to beneficiaries plan characteristicsbeneficiary protections the law and regulations establish requirements that plans must meet marketingbeneficiary communications plan sponsors are required to assure timely and accurate information in their marketing materials such materials must be approved by cms in its 2008 call letter to plans cms emphasized that organizations are responsible for the actions of crs18 sales agentsbrokers whether they are employed or contracted it stated that organizations must assure that these individuals are properly trained in both medicare and the details of the products being offered plan sponsors must provide strong oversight of marketing activities employees of an organization or independent agents or brokers acting on behalf of the organization may not solicit medicare beneficiaries doortodoor they must first ask permission before providing assistance in beneficiarys home prior to conducting any sales representations or accepting an enrollment form in person plan sponsors are required to provide enrollees with an evidence of coverage eoc document upon enrollment and annually thereafter the eoc gives the details about how the plan works covered benefits and related costsharing responsibilities plans are also required to provide current enrollees with an annual notice of change anoc document showing changes for the forthcoming year prior to the annual open enrollment period the anoc does not provide list of drugs added or deleted from the formulary or drugs whose tier has changed it does however note if such changes have been made for the 2008 plan year plan sponsors were encouraged to use combined model anoceoc document to be forwarded to beneficiaries by october 31 2007 in addition they were required to mail information on plan formularies alternatively plans could use separate anoc and statement of benefits with the eoc to follow by january 31 2008 in its draft 2008 call letter cms had considered allowing plan comparisons of ma and pdps in specific service area however cms stated that based on negative response to the proposal it was persuaded that it was not practical or meaningful to develop comparison that was not beneficiary specific as noted earlier beneficiaries can obtain targeted information about plans by using the medicare prescription drug plan finder tool on the wwwmedicaregov website information for 2008 was posted october 11 2007 covered drugs in order for drug to be paid under part d it must be drug that can be included under part d further it must be included in the formulary of the individuals part d plan covered drugs the law defines covered part d drugs as 1 outpatient prescription drugs approved by the food and drug administration fda and used for medically accepted indication 2 biological products which may only be dispensed upon prescription and which are licensed under the public health service phs act and produced at licensed establishment 3 insulin including medical supplies associated with the injection of insulin and 4 vaccines licensed under the phs act also included are drugs treated as being included in plans formulary as result of coverage determination or appeal crs19 excluded drugs the law specifically excludes drugs which may be excluded from coverage under medicaid except for drugs used for smoking cessation this exclusion applies to 1 benzodiazepines6 2 barbiturates7 3 drugs used for anorexia weight loss or weight gain 4 fertility drugs 5 drugs used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth 6 drugs for symptomatic relief for coughs and colds 7 prescription vitamins and minerals and 8 covered drugs when the manufacturer requires as condition of sale that associated tests be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer in addition drugs which are used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction are excluded unless they are used to treat another condition for which the drug has been approved by the fda off label uses for these drugs are not covered it should be noted that part d sponsor may elect to include one or more of these drugs in an enhanced part d plan however federal subsidy is available for the associated costs part b versus part d part d will not pay for drugs which are covered under part b even if the individual is not actually enrolled in part b some drugs and vaccines can potentially be covered under both part b or part d in this case determination must be made as to whether or not the drug can be covered under part b in the particular case part b covered drugs include drugs which are not usually selfadministered and provided incident to physicianss professional services immunosuppressive drugs for persons who have had medicarecovered transplant erythropoietin for persons with end stage renal disease oral anticancer drugs drugs requiring administration via nebulizer or infusion pump in the home and certain vaccines influenza pneumococcal and hepatitis b for intermediate or high risk persons vaccine administration beginning in 2008 part d plans not part b are required to cover the costs for the administration of part d covered vaccines physicians will need to bill the patients for these services the patient will then need to bill the part d plan formularies part d formularies are required to meet number of specific requirements pharmacy and therapeutic pt committee pt committee must develop and review the formulary majority of the members must be practicing physicians practicing pharmacists or both further they must come from clinical specialties that adequately represent the needs of beneficiaries the committee when developing and reviewing the formulary is to base clinical decisions on the strength of scientific evidence and standards of practice it 6 effective january 1 2013 plans will be required to include benzodiazepines in their formularies 7 effective january 1 2013 plans will be required to include barbiturates in their formularies for the indications of epilepsy cancer or chronic mental health disorder crs20 should also take into account whether including particular drug in the formulary or in particular tier in the formulary has therapeutic value in terms of safety and efficacy minimum requirements the formulary must include drug categories and classes that cover all disease states mma required cms to request the united states pharmacopeia usp to develop list of categories and classes which may be used by plans and to periodically revise such classification as appropriate part d plans that use classification system that is consistent with the usp classification system are deemed to satisfy safe harbor and will be approved by cms cms will review systems of plans proposing to adopt an alternative classification to determine if it is similar to the usp or other commonly used system plans formulary must include at least two drugs in each category or class unless only one drug is available in the category or class or two drugs are available but one drug is clinically superior the two drug requirement must be met through the provision of two chemically distinct drugs plans cannot meet the requirement by including only two dosage forms or strengths of the same drug or brand name and its generic equivalent however cms does expect plans to include multiple strengths and dosage forms where available six classes of clinical concern cms has required part d to cover all or substantially all of the drugs in the following six drug categories immunosuppressant antidepressant antipsychotic anticonvulsant antiretroviral and antineoplastic cms instituted this policy to mitigate the risks and complications associated with an interruption of therapy for vulnerable populations for 2008 the requirement applies to drugs available on april 16 2007 new drugs or newly approved drugs within these six classes that come into the market at later date will be subject to expedited pt committee review plan sponsors cannot implement prior authorization or step therapy requirements that are intended to steer beneficiaries to preferred alternatives within these classes for beneficiaries currently taking drug for beneficiaries beginning treatment in these categories such management techniques may be used for categories other than hivaids drugs beginning with plan year 2010 the secretary will be required to identify categories and classes of drugs which may be different from the six classes required by cms for which 1 restricted access to the category or class will have major or lifethreatening clinical consequences for individuals who have disease or disorder treated by the drugs in such category or class and 2 there is significant clinical need for such individuals to have access to multiple drugs within category or class due to unique chemical actions and pharmacological effects of the drugs within the category or class such as drugs used in the treatment of cancer prescription drug plan pdp sponsors will be required to include all covered part d drugs in the categories and classes identified by the secretary however the secretary may establish formal exceptions process that ensures that any exception is based on scientific evidence and medical standards of practice which for antiretroviral medications must be consistent with hhs guidelines for the use of antiretroviral crs21 agents in hiv1infected adults and adolescents and includes public notice and comment period cms review cms reviews and approves drug lists that are consistent with best practice formularies currently in widespread use it reviews formularies for at least one drug in each of the usp formulary key drug types it reviews tier placement to provide assurance that the formulary does not substantially discourage enrollment of certain beneficiaries it analyzes formularies to determine whether appropriate access is afforded to drugs or drug classes addressed in widely accepted treatment guidelines which are indicative of general best practice it also analyzes the availability and tier position of the most commonly prescribed drug classes for the general medicare population and the dually eligible population cms also looks to existing best practices to check plans use of utilization management tools such as prior authorization quantity limits and step therapy where lower cost drug is first tried before higher cost drug may be used for the 2008 contract year cms stated that it was expanding its review of drugs commonly used by the dual eligible population to 200 and incorporating the top 100 drugs used in the medicare drug discount card program the temporary program for the lowincome persons in place in 20042005 it was also expanding the number of treatment guidelines to ensure best practice drugs are included in the formulary finally it would use the presence of usp formulary key drug types as an outlier test to ensure these drugs are strongly represented on all part d formularies specialty tier part d plan is allowed to exempt formulary tier in which it places very high cost and unique items from tiered costsharing exceptions in order to ensure that the plan does not substantially discourage enrollment by specific patient populations cms will only approve specialty tiers under the following conditions there is only one specialty tier exempt from costsharing exceptions costsharing is limited to 25 in the initial coverage range or actuarially equivalent for plans with decreased or deductible basic alternative design only plans with negotiated prices exceeding threshold may be placed in the tier the level is 500 month in 2007 and 600 month in 2008 formulary changes during plan year mma provided that if plans removed drugs from their formularies during the year or changed their preferred or tiered status they were required to provide notice on timely basis to cms affected enrollees physicians pharmacies and pharmacists observers expressed concerns about the implications of formulary changes on plan enrollees in response cms emphasized that best practices call for limited changes during the plan year and outlined the following circumstances under which such changes can be made crs22 plans can expand formularies by adding drugs lowering the tier of drug thereby reducing copayments or coinsurance or deleting utilization management requirements plans can not change therapeutic categories and classes during year except to account for new therapeutic uses and newly approved part d drugs plans can make formulary maintenace changes after march 1 such as replacing brand name drug with new generic drug or modifying formularies as result of new information on safety or effectiveness these changes require approval and 60 days notice to appropriate parties plans can only remove drugs from formulary move covered drugs to less preferred tier status or add utilization management requirements in accordance with approved procedures and after 60 days notice to appropriate parties plans can make such changes only if enrollees currently taking the affected drugs are exempt from the formulary change for the remainder of the plan year plans are not required to obtain cms approval or give 60 days notice when removing formulary drugs that have been withdrawn from the market by either the fda or product manufacturer transition policies cms has established transition standards intended to assure that new plan enrollees do not abruptly lose coverage for their drugs specifically plans are required to provide temporary supply fill anytime within the first 90 days of beneficiarys enrollment in plan the supply must be for 30 days unless the prescription is written for less than 30 days for any nonformulary drug the requirement also applies to drugs that are on plans formulary but that require prior authorization or step therapy in longterm care facilities the transition policy provides for 31day fill with multiple fills as necessary during the first 90 days of beneficiarys enrollment in plan after the 90day period the plan must provide 31day emergency supply while an exception is being processed cms has specified 31 days because many longterm care pharmacies dispense medications in 31day increments for contract year 2008 sponsors are required to ensure that the transition process information is prominently posted on their website cms has noted that the purpose of the process is not just to provide temporary fill of nonformulary drugs but rather to provide enrollees with sufficient time to work with their health care providers to switch to therapeutically appropriate formulary alternative or to request an exception based on grounds of medical necessity formulary change notice in advance of upcoming year as noted earlier enrollees must receive an annual notice of change anoc by october 31 prior to the next contract year the upcoming years formulary is viewed as new formulary therefore cms does not require plans to identify specific drug changes crs23 impacting enrollees or require 60 days notice of change however enrollees have at least 60 days to review the new formulary and identify any changes cms has outlined two options for providing transition for enrollees whose drugs are longer on the formulary they may provide transition process for current enrollees consistent with the transition process for new enrollees beginning january 1 of the new contract year alternatively they can effectuate transition for current enrollees prior to january 1 however if plans have not successfully transitioned the affected enrollees to therapeutically equivalent formulary alternative or processed an exceptions request by january 1 they are expected to provide transition supply beginning january 1 until such time as they have effected meaningful transition pharmacy access pdp sponsors are required to establish pharmacy network sufficient to ensure access to covered part d drugs for all enrollees they must demonstrate that they provide 1 convenient access to retail pharmacies for all enrollees 2 adequate access to home infusion pharmacies for all enrollees 3 convenient access to long term care ltc pharmacies for residents of ltc facilities and 4 access to indian health service tribes or urban indian programs itu pharmacies operating in the sponsors service area cms can waive the standards in the case of 1 mapd plans that operate their own pharmacies provided they can demonstrate convenient access and 2 private feeforservice plans offering part d coverage for drugs purchased from all pharmacies provided they do not charge additional costsharing for drugs obtained from nonnetwork pharmacies retail pharmacy access mma defined convenient access to retail pharmacies as being less favorable than those standards specified for the department of defense tricare regional pharmacy program as of march 13 2003 the applicable part d standards are as follows in urban areas at least 90 of medicare beneficiaries in the plans service area on average live within 2 miles of retail pharmacy participating in the plans network in suburban areas at least 90 of medicare beneficiaries in the plans service area on average live within 5 miles of retail pharmacy participating in the plans network in rural areas at least 70 of medicare beneficiaries in the plans service area on average live within 15 miles of retail pharmacy participating in the plans network the inclusion of mail order pharmacies in part d plan networks is optional however such plans do not count toward meeting the retail pharmacy access requirements plans that include mail order pharmacies in their networks must allow enrollees to receive benefits such as extended eg 90day supply of covered drugs crs24 through network retail pharmacy however beneficiaries making this choice could be subject to higher cost sharing charges part d sponsors may not restrict access to part d drugs by limiting distribution through subset of network pharmacies specialty pharmacies except when necessary to meet fda limited distribution requirements or to ensure the appropriate dispensing of drugs that require extraordinary special handling provider coordination or patient education when such requirements cannot be met by network pharmacy longterm care ltc pharmacy access part d sponsors must offer standard ltc pharmacy network contracts to all ltc pharmacies operating in their service area that request such contracts the pharmacy must be able to meet performance and service criteria specified by cms as well as any standard terms and conditions established by the part d sponsor for its network ltc pharmacies part d sponsors may not rely on outofnetwork pharmacies to meet the ltc convenient access standards any willing pharmacy part d sponsors are required to permit any pharmacy willing to accept the sponsors standard contracting terms and conditions to participate in the plans network cms notes that the sponsors standard terms and conditions may vary to accommodate geographic areas and types of pharmacies however all similarly situated pharmacies are to be offered the same standard terms and conditions part d pharmacy may not require network pharmacy to accept insurance risk as condition of participation in its pharmacy network payments to pharmacies mippa included provisions directed at prompt payments and related issues for plan years beginning on or after january 1 2010 the negotiated contracts between pharmacies and pdp sponsors or mapd plans will be required to provide that payment will be issued mailed or otherwise transmitted with respect to all clean claims submitted by pharmacies within the applicable number of calendar days after the date on which the claim is received this requirement will not apply to pharmacies that dispense drugs by mail order only or are located in or contract with longterm care facility clean claims are defined as those claims that have defect or impropriety such as the lack of any required substantiating documentation or any circumstances requiring special treatment that prevents timely payment from being made claims submitted electronically will be considered to have been received on the date on which the claim is transferred claims not submitted electronically will be considered to have been received on the fifth day after the postmark date of the claim or the date specified in the time stamp of the transmission the term applicable number of calendar days will be defined as 14 days for claims submitted electronically and 30 days for claims submitted otherwise if payment is not issued mailed or otherwise transmitted within the applicable number of calendar days after clean claim is received the pdp sponsor or mapd plan will be required to pay interest to the pharmacy that submitted the claim crs25 mippa also provided that for plan years beginning on or after january 1 2010 contracts between pdp sponsors and pharmacies located in or contracting with longterm care facilities will be required to provide that the pharmacy has between 30 and 90 days to submit claims for reimbursement for plan years beginning on or after january 1 2009 contracts between pharmacies and pdp sponsors or mapd plans that use the cost of drug as the standard for reimbursement of pharmacies will be required to provide that the sponsor update the standard at least every seven days to accurately reflect the market price of acquiring the drug public disclosure of prices part d sponsors are required to ensure that their network pharmacies inform enrollees of any price differential between covered drug and the lowest price generic version of the drug that is therapeutically equivalent bioequivalent on the plans formulary and available at that pharmacy privacy confidentiality and accuracy of enrollee records plans must abide by all applicable federal and state laws regarding confidentiality and disclosure of any medical records that it maintains further it must maintain the records in an accurate and timely manner and ensure timely access by enrollees to records and information pertaining to them grievances coverage determinations and appeals part d plans are required to have procedures in place for handling grievances for making timely coverage determinations and for handling appeals of coverage determinations they must ensure that all enrollees receive written information about these procedures grievances grievances are complaints or disputes other than those involving coverage determinations expressing dissatisfaction with any aspect of the operations activities or behavior of part d plan regardless of whether remedial action is requested grievances may include such things as complaints about the plans customer service hours of operation time to obtain prescription or pharmacy charges grievance may also include complaint that the part d plan refused to expedite coverage determination or redetermination beneficiary with grievance should file the complaint within 60 days of the event the plan sponsor must respond on timely basis coverage determinations coverage determination is any determination either an approval or denial made by the plan sponsor with regard to covered benefits the following actions are considered coverage determinations decision about whether to provide or pay for part d drug that the enrollee believes may be covered this includes decision not to pay because the drug is not on the plans formulary the drug is crs26 determined not medically necessary or the drug is furnished by an outofnetwork pharmacy failure to provide coverage determination in timely manner when delay would adversely affect the health of the enrollee decision concerning tiering exceptions request mma provided that if part d plan includes tiered costsharing structure plan enrollee can request an exception to the structure under an exception nonpreferred drug could be covered as preferred drug if the prescribing physician determined that the preferred drug for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individual would have adverse effects for the individual or both decision concerning formulary exceptions request mma provided that beneficiary enrolled in part d plan can appeal determination not to provide coverage for drug not on the plans formulary the appeal can only be made if the prescribing physician determines that all covered part d drugs on any tier of the formulary for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individual as the nonformulary drug would have adverse effects for the individual or both decision on the amount of costsharing decision whether the individual has or has not satisfied prior authorization or other utilization management requirement request for coverage determination may be filed by the enrollee the enrollees appointed representative or the enrollees physician the sponsor must notify the enrollee of its determinations within 72 hours of receipt of the request or in the case of an exceptions request receipt of the physicians supporting statement an enrollee can request an expedited decision if the plan approves the request it must make the determination within 24 hours appeals if the plans coverage determination is unfavorable to the enrollee it must provide the enrollee with written denial notice that includes information on appeals rights there are five levels of appeals redetermination the first level of appeal is redetermination by the plan an enrollee or the appointed representative may request standard redetermination with respect to covered drug benefits or payments an enrollee the appointed representative or the enrollees prescribing physician may request an expedited redetermination for covered drug benefits the request should generally be filed within 60 days of the unfavorable coverage determination the sponsor must provide the enrollee or prescribing physician with reasonable opportunity to present evidence enrollees must be notified of the results within seven days in the case of standard redetermination enrollees requesting expedited redeterminations of request for covered drugs must be notified of the results within 72 hours if the plan accepts the expedited request crs27 the redetermination must be made by person not involved in the original coverage determination if the issue is the denial of coverage based on medical necessity the redetermination must be made by physician reconsideration by an independent review entity an enrollee dissatisfied with redetermination

drug utilization management sponsors must establish reasonable and appropriate drug utilization management program that 1 includes incentives to reduce costs when medically appropriate and 2 maintains policies and systems to assist in preventing overutilization and underutilization of prescribed medications crs28 quality assurance the sponsor must have established quality assurance measures and systems to reduce medication errors and adverse drug interactions and improve medication use such measures and systems must provide that network providers are required to comply with state standards for pharmacy practice they must also provide both for concurrent drug utilization review systems and retrospective review systems medication therapy management each part d sponsor is required to incorporate medication therapy management program mtmp into their plans benefit structure each year sponsors are required to submit mtmp description to cms for review and approval cmsapproved mtmp is one of several required elements in the development of sponsor bids for the upcoming contract year an approved mtmp must 1 ensure optimum therapeutic outcomes for targeted beneficiaries through improved medication use 2 reduce the risk of adverse events for targeted beneficiaries 3 be developed in cooperation with licensed and practicing pharmacists and physicians 4 be coordinated with any care management plan established for targeted individual under chronic care improvement program 5 describe the resources and time required to implement the program if using outside personnel and establish the fees for pharmacists or others the mtmp may be furnished by pharmacists or other qualified providers and may distinguish between services in ambulatory and institutional settings targeted beneficiaries under mtmp are enrollees who have chronic diseases are taking multiple part d drugs and are likely to incur annual costs for covered drugs that exceed level specified by the secretary 4000 in 2008 cms has outlined additional expectations for mtmps beneficiaries enrolled in mtmp cannot be disenrolled later in the year even if they longer meet one of the eligibility criteria plans will provide interventions for beneficiaries meeting all of the criteria regardless of the setting the plan will not include discriminatory exclusion criteria eprescribing mma required the development of electronic prescribing eprescribing standards for the part d program the first or foundation eprescribing standards which became effective in 2006 created uniform system requirements for several eprescribing functions such as eligibility and benefits queries between prescribers and part d sponsors in accordance with the mma cms also conducted pilot study to assess the feasibility of creating additional eprescribing standards on april 7 2008 cms issued final rulemaking to adopt standards for transactions related to formulary and benefit information and medication history providers and pharmacies are not required to use eprescribing however provider or pharmacy that does eprescribe for part d beneficiaries is required to comply with any applicable final standards that are in effect further all part d plans are required to maintain eprescribing systems that conform to the final standards crs29 mippa included incentives for eprescribing for 2009 through 2013 medicare professionals providing covered services to medicare beneficiaries and who are successful electronic prescribers will receive an incentive payment of 20 for 2009 and 2010 10 for 2011 and 2012 and 05 for 2013 payments to plans cms makes four types of payments to part d plans 1 direct subsidy payments 2 reinsurance payments 3 lowincome subsidy payments and 4 risk sharing payments direct subsidies medicare makes per capita monthly payments to plans for each part d enrollee the payment is equal to the plans approved standardized bid amount adjusted by the plan beneficiaries health status and risk and reduced by the base beneficiary premium for the plan plan bid as noted earlier plans are required to submit not later than the first monday in june bid for the following year the bid is to include an estimate of its average monthly revenue requirements to provide qualified prescription drug benefits including any supplemental coverage for part d eligible individual with national average risk profile the bid includes costs including administrative costs and return on investmentprofit for which the plan is responsible the bid is to exclude costs paid by enrollees payments expected to be made by cms for reinsurance and any other costs for which the sponsor is not responsible cms reviews the bids negotiates with plans and approves the bids national average monthly bid amount cms then computes national average monthly bid amount from approved bids this is to be weighted average of the standardized bid amount for each prescription drug plan for pdps the standardized bid amount is that portion of plans bid attributable to basic prescription drug coverage for mapds it is the portion of the accepted bid that is attributable to basic prescription drug coverage in calculating the nationwide average cms is to weight each plans bid by its share of total enrollment in 2006 the first year of part d there was prior pdp enrollment information therefore each pdp plan was weighted equally though ma pd bids were enrollment weighted if they had 2005 ma enrollment rather than immediately moving to full enrollment weighting in 2007 cms provided for phasein under its demonstration authority medicare demonstration to limit annual changes in part d premiums due to beneficiary choice of lowcost plans in 2007 80 of the national monthly bid amount was based on the 2006 averaging methodology and 20 on the enrollment weighted average in 2008 40 is based on the 2006 averaging methodology and 60 on the enrollment weighted average cms chose this phasein approach because with 2006 enrollment heavily weighted toward lower cost plans immediate use of the enrollment weighting crs30 methodology would have resulted in lower direct subsidies and by extension higher beneficiary premiums the calculation of the national average monthly bid amount does not include bids submitted by msa plans ma private feeforservice plans specialized ma plans for special needs populations pace programs and plans established through reasonable cost contracts the national average monthly bid amount for 2007 was 8043 it is 8052 in 2008 payment to plans individual plan bids are adjusted for expected case mix this adjustment takes into account variation in costs among plans for basic coverage based on the differences in actuarial risk of different enrollees being served per capita monthly direct subsidy payments equal this adjusted amount minus the base beneficiary premium see discussion below for how beneficiary premiums are calculated reinsurance subsidies as noted in the discussion of prescription drug benefits part d plans pay all drug costs above the catastrophic threshold 572625 in 2008 except for nominal beneficiary costsharing medicare subsidizes 80 of the plans costs for catastrophic coverage cms makes reinsurance subsidy payments to plans in behalf of those individuals who have actually incurred such costs payments are made on monthly basis during the year based on either estimated or incurred costs with final reconciliation made after the close of the year in the case of private feeforservice plans offering drug coverage cms determines reinsurance payments by basing the amount on cms estimate of the amount that would be paid if it were coordinated care plan and takes into account average payments for populations of similar risk in such plans risk corridor payments mma established risk corridors which were intended to limit plans overall risks or profits under the new program by using risk corridors medicare is able to limit plans potential losses by financing some of the higher than expected costs similarly medicare is able to limit plans potential gains by recouping excessive costs over time as more experience is gained with the program the risk corridors are widened thereby increasing the insurance risk borne by the plans the risk corridor provisions do not apply to private feeforservice plans risk corridors are defined as specified percentages above and below target amount the target amount is defined as total payments paid to the plan taking into account the amount paid by the cms and enrollees based on the standardized bid amount risk adjusted and reduced by total administrative expenses assumed in the crs31 bid payment adjustments are made if adjusted allowable costs for the plan are at least equal to the first threshold lower limit of the first risk corridor but not greater than the first threshold upper limit of the risk corridor for the year ie if the plans are within the first risk corridor portion of any plan spending above or below these levels is subject to risk adjustment if adjusted allowable costs exceed the first threshold upper limit then payments are increased if adjusted allowable costs are below the first threshold lower limit then payments are reduced adjusted allowable costs are reduced by reinsurance and subsidy payments see table 3 during 2006 and 2007 plans were at full risk for adjusted allowable risk corridor costs between 25 below and 25 above the target plans with adjusted allowable costs above this level received increased payments if their costs were between 25 of the target first threshold upper limit and 5 of the target second threshold upper limit they were at risk for 25 of the increased amount that is their payments equal 75 of adjusted allowable costs for spending in this range if their costs were above 5 of the target they were at risk for 25 of the costs between the first and second threshold upper limits and 20 of the costs above that amount that is their payments equal 80 of the adjusted allowable costs over the second threshold upper limit conversely if plans fell below the target they shared the savings with the government they have to refund 75 of the savings if costs fell between 25 and 5 below the target level and 80 of any amounts below 5 of the target for 20082011 the risk corridors are modified plans are at full risk for drug spending between 50 below and 5 above the target level plans are at risk for 50 of spending exceeding 50 but below 100 of the target level additionally they are at risk for 20 of any spending exceeding 10 of the target level conversely if plans fall below the target they have to refund 50 of the savings if costs fall between 5 and 10 below the target level and 80 of any amounts below 10 of the target beginning in 2012 cms may increase the target levels above the 5 and 10 levels table 3 plan liability under risk corridor provisions plan liability for costs above risk corridor and below target 20062007 costs below 95 of the target 80 refund costs between 95 and 975 of the target 75 refund costs between 975 and 1025 of the target full risk costs between 1025 and 105 of the target risk for 25 of amount costs over 105 of the target risk for 20 of amount 20082011 costs below 90 of the target 80 refund costs between 90

lowincome subsidy lis payments cms makes additional payments to plans on behalf of persons entitled to low income subsidies these payments are for premium and costsharing charges which would otherwise be paid by the beneficiary except for the fact that they are entitled to subsidies see lowincome individuals section below reconciliation cms makes prospective payments to plans based on their bids following the close of the calendar year cms makes retroactive adjustments to reflect actual plan experience prospective payments for reinsurance and low income subsidy payments are compared to actual incurred costs and other related data and appropriate adjustments are made to the plan payments the calculation is based on costs actually incurred and must be net of any direct or indirect remuneration including discounts chargebacks or rebates direct subsidy payments to the plans are adjusted to reflect updated data about beneficiary health status and enrollment in addition any necessary adjustments are made to reflect risk sharing under the risk corridor provisions in october 2007 cms announced that it would collect 4 billion from part d drug plan sponsors due to lowerthanexpected drug costs in 2006 it stated that it would be collecting these funds from plans due to the fact that actual drug costs for almost all part d plans were below expected levels in their 2006 bids it cited several factors leading to lower spending including the fact that 2006 marked the first time that plans were bidding on the new part d program and the fact there were higher levels of generic drug utilization in part d than had been anticipated it further noted that plans submitted their bids for the 2006 contracting year in june 2005 the 2006 bids were therefore somewhat uncertain predictions of what would actually happen when the drug benefit began in 2006 cms expects that as experience with part d grows plan bid submissions will more closely reflect actual costs it stated that the 2007 bid submissions were significantly lower than those submitted in 2006 and were reflection of the actual 2006 part d drug program experience therefore cms anticipates that amounts collected from or paid to plans in future years as result of final reconciliation and risk adjustment will be lower than that for the 2006 plan year8 beneficiary premiums beneficiaries pay monthly premiums for part d coverage payments vary by the plan selected on average beneficiary premiums are to represent roughly 255 of the cost of basic coverage 8 cms medicare expects to recover 4 billion from part d plans following 2006 plan reconciliation press release october 5 2007 crs33 the monthly premium is uniform for all persons enrolled in the plan except for those receiving lowincome subsidies or those subject to late enrollment penalty it equals the base beneficiary premium as adjusted to reflect the difference between the plans standardized bid amount and the nationwide average bid base beneficiary premium the base beneficiary premium for part d plan equals the product of the beneficiary premium percentage and the national average monthly bid amount see calculation under direct subsidies above the beneficiary premium percentage is equal to 255 divided by 100 minus percentage equal to total reinsurance payments divided by the sum of such reinsurance payments and total payments the secretary estimates will be paid to prescription drug plans in year that are attributable to the standardized bid amount taking into account amounts paid by cms and enrollees the base beneficiary monthly premium was 2735 in 2007 and is 2793 in 2008 adjustments once the base beneficiary premium is calculated it is adjusted up or down as appropriate to reflect any difference between the plans standardized bid amount and the nationwide average bid amount thus beneficiaries in plans with higher costs for standard coverage face higher than average premiums for such coverage while enrollees in lower cost plans pay lower than average premiums for such coverage premiums are further increased to reflect any supplemental benefits or any late enrollment penalty and decreased if the individual is entitled to lowincome subsidy additionally enrollees in mapd plans may see decrease if plans use rebates based on parts and b benefit costs to buy down the part d premium program financing medicare part d is financed through combination of federal general revenues beneficiary premiums and state contributions revenues are credited to separate account the medicare prescription drug account in the medicare part b trust fund general revenues and beneficiary premiums general revenues general revenues are transferred from the treasury to the part d account on an asneeded basis to support the portion of program expenditures funded by federal subsidies beneficiary premiums beneficiaries may have their premiums deducted from their social security or other federal benefit payments these are then forwarded to part d plans on their behalf alternatively they can pay their premiums directly to the part d plan both types of payments are shown in the statement of the part d account in the annual medicare trustees report crs34 state contributions effective january 1 2006 states are longer providing coverage for part d drugs for their dual eligible population under medicaid they could be expected to see reduction in their medicaid spending as result of this transfer however mma contained provision labeled by some as the clawback provision that requires states to continue to assume portion of these costs the formula specified in law is based on proxy for what states would otherwise be spending on drugs for the dual eligibles in the absence of mma in 2006 states assumed 90 of these costs over the next nine years the states contribution phasesdown to 75 in 2015 formula for state contribution amount states are required to pay the secretary each month an amount equal to the product of the following three factors the projected monthly per capita drug payment which is product of base year 2003 state medicaid per capita expenditures for covered part d drugs for full benefit dual eligible persons reduced by any rebates received and the current state matching rate this amount is increased each year beginning in 2004 by the applicable growth factor beginning in 2007 this is the per capita percentage increase in part d expenditures total number of full benefit dual eligibles for the state for the month the applicable percentage factor 90 in 2006 88 13 in 2007 86 23 in 2008 decreased each year by 1 23 percentage points until 2015 and later when it is 75 impact on states review for the national association of state medicaid directors found that most states report that the combination of the transition of dual eligibles to part d coupled with state clawback payments have not resulted in significant state savings only 10 states reported paying less in 2007 for dual eligibles than when the state provided drugs directly to this population further most states have not implemented wraparound coverage for part d costsharing amounts for lowincome subsidy beneficiaries9 part d account data mma created separate part d account within the medicare part b trust fund the 2007 medicare trustees report stated that in calendar year 2006 total part d revenues were 481 billion this included 35 billion in beneficiary premiums 391 billion in government contributions 55 billion in state contributions and 13 million interest on investments total part d benefits including employer subsidy payments were 473 billion with an additional 03 billion for federal administrative expenses see table 4 9 national association of state medicaid directors 2007 state perspectives medicaid pharmacy policies and practices november 2007 crs35 the trustees reported that the 2006 expenditures were less than had been predicted in the 2005 and 2006 trustees report they attributed this change to several factors including slowdown in the growth in prescription drug spending the fact that savings from retail discounts manufacturer rebates and utilization management were achieved in 2006 rather than over several years as had been previously assumed and the fact that significantly fewer beneficiaries joined the program than initially anticipated and that some who joined enrolled after the beginning of the year table 4 statement of operations of part d account calendar year 2007 in millions total assets at beginning of year 6870 revenues 521183

vf3 2008 annual report of the boards of trustees of the federal hospital insurance and federal supplementary insurance trust funds note totals may not add due to rounding employer subsidies mma included provisions designed to encourage employers to continue to offer drug benefits to their medicareeligible retirees it provided subsidy for portion of retiree drug costs and exempted these subsidy payments from federal taxes qualifications qualified plans cms makes the subsidy payments to employers or unions offering qualified retiree prescription drug coverage qualified plans are defined as those offering drug benefits at least actuarially equivalent to standard coverage crs36 qualifying covered retiree subsidy payments are made on behalf of an individual covered under the retiree health plan who is entitled to enroll under pdp or mapd plan but elects not to subsidies are linked to an individuals status as retired participant in the qualified group health plan or as the medicareenrolled spouse or dependent of the retired participant thus sponsor offering qualified coverage for dependants will be able to claim coverage for part d eligible dependent of retired participant even if the retiree is under age 65 and not part d eligible however the sponsor will not be able to claim coverage for part d eligible dependent of an active employee an individual retiree can elect to enroll in part d even if the former employer has elected to take the subsidy however this decision may have consequences it is possible the individual could lose employersponsored drug coverage or both employersponsored medical and drug coverage further any payments made by the employer plan would not count toward meeting the true outofpocket troop requirements see earlier discussion of part d benefits subsidy benefits subsidy payments equal 28 of retirees gross drug costs between specified levels 2755600 in 2008 the dollar amounts are adjusted annually by the percentage increase in medicare per capita prescription drug costs subsidy payments to employers and unions are not subject to federal tax alternatives employers or unions may select an alternative option instead of taking the subsidy with respect to part d they may elect to pay portion of the part d premiums they may also elect to provide enhanced coverage that may be provided through supplementary or wrap around benefits this approach may have some financial consequences for the employer or union since third party payments do not count toward troop thus if an employer chooses to pay some of the part d costsharing on behalf of its retirees this would have the effect of delaying the point at which the part d catastrophic coverage would begin the employer could therefore end up paying some costs which would otherwise be covered under the catastrophic portion of the part d benefit employers or unions may also contract with pdp or mapd to offer the coverage finally they may become part d plan sponsor themselves for their retirees subsidy data employer actions december 2006 survey by kaiser family foundation and hewitt10 noted that its survey of 302 large privatesector firms with 1000 or more employees showed that the majority of plan sponsors 78 would seek the 10 the henry j kaiser family foundation and hewitt retiree health benefits examined findings from the kaiserhewitt 2006 survey on retiree health benefits december 2006 crs37 subsidy in 2007 compared with 82 in 2006 six percent said they were likely to supplement the benefit another 6 said they intended to contract with pdp or ma pd to offer additional coverage and 2 said they intended to become pdp eight percent said they were likely to discontinue prescription drug coverage retirees covered in january 2008 the secretary of hhs announced that 67 million persons were in retiree plans receiving subsidy an estimated 15 million were in plans with coverage at least as good as medicares but without subsidy further an estimated 20 million beneficiaries were in tricare and the federal employees health benefits program fehb the federal government elected not to take the employer subsidy for these individuals on the grounds that it would be merely subsidizing itself issues in january 2008 part d began its third year of operation while early startup issues have generally been resolved some issues remain the following highlights few of these lowincome individuals major focus of part d is the enhanced coverage provided to lowincome individuals through the lowincome subsidy lis program despite extensive federal state and local outreach efforts not all persons potentially eligible have enrolled in the program as of january 2008 cms estimated that 26 million persons eligible for lis had neither signed up for part d nor had coverage through another source it is not immediately clear why some individuals have failed to enroll though several factors including lack of program awareness and the nature of the application process itself play role the assets limitations are viewed by some as being too low thereby precluding otherwise eligible persons from gaining coverage second issue of concern to the lowincome population is the large number of persons required to change plans each year because the premium for their current plan longer falls below the lowincome subsidy level some observers have suggested that when making the lowincome subsidy calculation see earlier discussion the mapd enrollment should be removed from the calculation their inclusion in the calculation has the effect of lowering the benchmark thereby forcing higher number of persons enrolled in pdps to change plans if they are to remain in zero premium plans highincome enrollees on average beneficiary premiums account for 255 of expected total part d costs for basic coverage federal general revenues account for most of the remaining costs some persons have suggested that higher income persons should pay higher percentage of their costs except for persons entitled to lowincome subsidies all persons selecting particular part d plan pay the same monthly premium amount crs38 the presidents fy2009 budget proposal together with the subsequent legislative proposal submitted in response to the medicare trigger requirement11 would establish incomerelated premiums for part d the percentage increases would be tied to the benchmark premium amount for basic coverage the addon amount also referred to as the subsidy reduction would be the same regardless of the particular plan selected by the beneficiary the total amount that beneficiary would pay in part d premiums would be the addon amount which would be the same nationwide plus the premium for the particular plan selected which would vary by plan under the proposal the income thresholds would be the same as those currently established for incomerelating part b premiums and therefore affect the same people further as proposed for part b in the fy2009 budget but not included in the proposed trigger legislation the income thresholds would not be updated in future years consequently each year the number of beneficiaries subject to the higher premium would increase the administration estimated that this provision would save 350 million in fy2009 and 318 billion over the fiveyear budget period an estimate of the number of beneficiaries who would be affected by higher premiums was not provided at the time the 2008 part b premiums were announced in october 2007 cms estimated that about 5 of beneficiaries would be affected by the income related premium increase in 2008 it is thought that slightly lower percentage would be affected by the part d proposal this is because some highincome medicare beneficiaries have alternative sources of prescription drug coverage such as through former employer and therefore do not enroll in part d some observers who had also opposed incomerelating the part b premium suggest that this approach would further move medicare from its entitlement nature beneficiary experience when mma was enacted few observers expected beneficiaries to have choice among so many drug plans some argue that the large number of plans available to beneficiaries may complicate their choices given that enrollment tends to be heavily concentrated in plans offered by limited number of sponsors it is likely that the number of available options will decline over time beneficiaries have tended to enroll in plans with low premiums and zero or low deductibles however in the absence of concrete data it is not clear whether this is always the best choice for the beneficiary most part d enrollees did not change plan enrollment from 2006 to 2007 as noted in the key facts section below premiums for the most popular plans rose in 2008 plan sponsors may also have made other changes including changing 11 see crs report rl34407 the presidents proposed legislative response to the medicare funding warning by hinda chaikind jim hahn jennifer osullivan and henry cohen crs39 copayments or utilization controls for particular drugs despite the fact that plans are required to notify beneficiaries of changes it is not clear how many are aware of the yeartoyear modifications cms reports 31 million part d enrollees or about 12 of the total changed plans from 2007 to 2008 of those 21 million were lis beneficiaries who were reassigned so they would not have to pay premium about 6 of nonlis beneficiaries made change at this point information is not available to assess the impact of part d over time on changes in drug utilization patterns and outofpocket costs drug prices noninterference clause some observers have recommended striking the noninterference provision in the law they claim that permitting cms to be involved in negotiating drug prices would result in additional savings other observers state that plans are already achieving price reductions the congressional budget office has stated that removal of the noninterference clause would be unlikely to achieve significant additional savings particularly if cms were not allowed to establish formulary or use other tools to reduce prices12 data considerable amount of planspecific data is available on the web however certain information for example information dealing with price trends or price concessions such as rebates is proprietary the gaps in data have made it difficult to provide complete picture of the programs impact this issue has been addressed by both cms and mippa on may 27 2008 the cms issued final rule that would allow the secretary to use the claims information that is now being collected for part d payment purposes for other research analysis reporting and public health functions some organizations that submitted comments on the rule questioned the cmss authority to use the part d data for other than payment purposes mippa grants cms authority to use and share data from part d as result of this modification information provided to the secretary in the administration of part d may be used for the purposes of improving public health through research on the utilization safety effectiveness quality and efficiency of health care services as the secretary determines appropriate and shall be made available to congressional support agencies in accordance with their obligations to support congress as set out in their authorizing statutes for the purposes of conducting congressional oversight monitoring making recommendations and analysis of the medicare program pharmacies plans have not been not required to process claims within specified time period thirty days has been considered the standard though some pharmacies particularly those located in rural areas allege that some claims have taken up to 45 days they stated that claims should be paid within 14 days some observers stated 12 congressional budget office s 3 medicare prescription drug price negotiation act of 2007 cost estimate april 16 2007 crs40 that some pharmacies particularly small pharmacies are unable to handle the lag and are being driven out of business as noted earlier mippa addresses these concerns by requiring prompt payment of pharmacy claims beginning in 2010 clean claims submitted electronically must be paid within 14 days and other clean claims paid within 30 days key part d

table 9 shows wide range in premiums for pdp plans plans with higher premiums typically offer broader coverage it should be noted that while essentially the same plan may be offered in number of pdp regions or nationwide the premiums for the plan are not likely to be the same in all pdp regions when comparing plans it is important to review number of factors including the breadth of the formulary the tier particular drugs are placed on the cost sharing amounts applicable by tier utilization tools and the extent of gap coverage premiums for 2008 plans with gap coverage generally are twice that
