incident hospitals physicians and other providers could be unde r considerable pressure to deliver care to uninsured individuals without clear source of reimburse ment proposals introduced in the 110th congress hr 6569s 3312 would aut horize the hhs secretary to use special fund to provide temporary emerge ncy health care coverage for uninsured individuals affected by public health emergencies several bills in the 110th congress would address the health care needs of re sponders and others who were exposed to hazards at the world trade center followi ng the 2001 terrorist attack and who are now experiencing health problems11 following hurricane katrina congress provided 2 billion to cover the state share of medicaid costs associated with evacuees and individuals living in declared disaster areas for states with approved federal wa ivers and to restore access to care in affected areas12 the louisiana health care redesign collaborative was developed to propose options for rebuilding th healthcare system in southern louisiana through medicaid waiver and medicare demonstration proposal13 health emergencies often involve scar cities of resources including personnel equipment drugs and vaccines prioritiz ing the use of these resources to maximize benefit requires careful study of scientific and medical evidence and raises complex legal and ethical questions that are best considered before emergencies arise14 also many are concerned that the nations health care syst em which is often ove rburdened by routine demands would not be able to handle surges in demand that could result from some types of disasters15 the pahpa requires the hhs secretary to assess national medical response capability in quadrennial national health security stra tegy and authorizes

some people may be at greater ri sk or more in need of special services during and following disaster the pahpa required the secretary of hhs to consider in planning the needs of atrisk individuals defined as children pregnant women senior citizens and others as determined by the secretary the pka required the head of fema to appoint disability coordinator char ged among other things with coordinating emergency management policies and practices for individuals with disabilities18 authorities to control communicable diseases the response to communicable disease threats may involve movement rest rictions business and school closures compulsory treatments and other c onstraints while state and local governments have the primary authority over these domes tic containment measures comprehensive response to public health emergency may i nvolve overlapping gove rnmental authorities and attendant legal and economic issues recent incidents have expanded congresss longstanding interest in the security of us borders to include concerns about communicable diseases in trav elers which is matter of federal jurisdiction these incidents have brought into question the di visions of authority and effectiveness of coordination among federal agenci that are responsible for disease control and for the security of the borders and the transportation infrastructure policy ma kers have noted that if these systems are unable to respond to comm on and expected infec tious disease threats such as tuberculosis they may also be unabl to respond to more serious threats such as pandemic flu or bioterrorism effective solutions are elusive but would ideally address scientific technical and economic constraints the bala nce of individual and collective rights and the roles of federal state and local authorities and foreign governments19 workforce surge capacity hhs manages several h ealth professions programs geared toward alleviating shortages and maldis tributions of
