of economic and social ramifications obviously the wealthier household is the higher standard of living it can maintain this is of particular importance with respect to the elderly population whose income typically falls in retirement data regarding the distribution of wealth are limited there are some data available from estate tax returns although they reflect only the small proportion of the population that is subject to the tax the federal reserve board conducts regular surveys of household wealth known as the survey of consumer finances this report examin data from this survey on the distribution of household wealth perhaps the two most general measures of household wealth available are mean and median household net worth in 2004 mean household net worth was 448200 and the median household net worth was 93100 the large difference between the mean and median suggests significant inequality in the distribution of household net worth although any characterization of the degree of inequality is necessarily subjective the distribution is nonetheless far from equal in 2004 the top 1 of the distribution accounted for onethird of total household net worth this wealth class includes all households with net worth of about 60 million and over the top 10 held over twothirds of all household wealth this wealth class begins with those households with net worth of at least 827600 wealth is much more unequally distributed than income number of studies have attempted to explain why the distributions of income and wealth are so different among important contributors to inequality in the distribution of wealth are variations in saving out of an unequally distributed income the incidence of entrepreneurs who may save at very high rates to finance business investments and among the wealthiest the desire to leave bequests this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33433g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g140g142g151g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g10g152

and the accumulation of wealth are important determinants of longrun economic prosperity consuming less and saving more out of current income allows for more growth in domestic capital larger capital stock allows workers to be more productive and contributes to higher living standards for that reason the national saving rate is frequent consideration in public policy issues whether it is raising household saving or reducing the federal budget deficit the low household saving rate is particular concern not only because it means less funds available for capital investment but also because it suggests households are not making adequate provisions for their futures whether that is th case depends on how wealthy they are perhaps the most important reason for households to save is to accumulate enough wealth so that they do not experience drastic decline in living standards on retirement the low household saving rate suggests that may not be happening 1 it is important to remember that saving out of current income is not the only way in which households may grow wealthier those who have ssets may see their wealth grow as result of rising asset prices appreciation in the value of household assets may substitute for household saving in that it satisfies households needs to accumulate wealth the rise in the stock market during the 1990s for example is widely believed to have contributed to the measured decline in household saving more recently appreciation in housing prices may also have substituted for household saving that might otherwise have been set aside as long as rising asset prices lead to greater household wealth the low saving rate may be less of concern however that reflects only the overall picture how wealth is distributed and which households may have benefitted from asset price appreciation are also important in interpreting the significance of the decline in household saving data regarding the distribution of wealth are limited there are some data available from estate tax returns but they reflect only the small proportion of the population subject to the tax 2 the best source for data on household wealth is survey the federal reserve board conducts every three years known as the survey of consumer fi nances scf this report examines data from these surveys

consumer finances 3 it is designed to gather detailed information on the level and composition of household assets liabilities and income high income households are sampled separately because 1 see

large share of total household wealth the current series of surveys began in 1983 the survey counts both financial and real assets financial assets include bank accounts stock and bond holdings individual retirement accounts and keogh accounts real assets include home equity and other real property such as automobiles liabilities include home mortgages and consumer credit excluded from these figures are the value of household furnishings and other durable goods as well as the present value of future benefits from social security or defined benefit pension plans

are mean and median household net worth mean net worth is simply total net worth divided by the number of households median net worth is the midpoint in the overall distribut ion of household wealth in other words if all the households are ranked from poorest to richest the median wealth would be that of the household in the exact middle of the distribution half of households are poorer than the median and half are wealthier the median is probably better indication of the wealth of the typical household than is the mean mean wealth can be significantly affected by changes at the very upper end of the distribution the ratio of mean to median can be an indicator of the degree of equality or of inequality in distribution table 1 presents mean and median household net worth from the scf in constant 2004 dollars 4 between 1989 and 2004 household wealth grew in real terms ie it grew faster than inflation real mean household net worth increased by 644 or at an average annual rate of 34 real median household net worth increased by 353 or at an annual rate of 20 the means are substantially higher than the medians which is indicative of considerable concentration of wealth in the upper end of the overall distribution moreover the ratio of mean to median net worth has risen suggesting that the distribution of household wealth has become more unequal since the survey began t able 1

the level of wealth that defines each wealth class the figures show clearly that some assets are much more equally distributed than others if an asset were equally distributed the proportion of that asset owned by each wealth class would equal the size of that wealth class if vehicles for example were qually distributed the top 1 would own 1 of the net worth of vehicles and the bottom 50 would ow

assets may have implications for the recent decline in the household saving rate number of studies for example found close connection between the decline in the household saving rate during the 1990s and the rapid rise in equity prices6 if that is what happened then it is likely that it tended to be the saving of those households at the top of the wealth distribution that was affected rather than those in the middle and bottom almost 80 of equity is held by the wealthiest 10 of the household distribution if equity price appreciation substituted for saving out of income it did so for small portion of the population since 2000 equity prices leveled off but saving did not recover some analysts have found evidence that housing price appreciation may now be substituting for saving out of current income and driving up household wealth housing w ealth is much more equally distributed than stock the wealthiest 10 of households accounted for just 382 of equity in principal residences in 2004 at the same time those in the next 40 of the distribution accounted for 501 of equity in principal residences if rising house prices substituted for saving out of current income it did so for

and distribution of wealth are closely related to efforts to explain household saving behavior most attempts to model wealth accumulation and distribution begin with the distribution of income and add to that base some model of household saving behavior most models of saving behavior begin with some variation of what economists refer to as the life cycle model this refers to the notion that saving behavior for some at least tends to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33433g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g140g142g151g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g10g152 g158g156g142g145g152

the course of life time early in life or career when earnings are relatively low most of if not more than current income is consumed and the rate of saving is low over the course of career however as income rises saving also tends to rise and wealth accumulates after retiring income falls and so does saving as retirees draw down wealth to afford consumption in retirement that model helps resolve an apparent inconsistency in saving behavior one at any given point in time those with higher incomes tend to have higher saving rates and two as incomes have risen over time the saving rate has not the model however falls short of completely explaining observed saving behavior it also falls far short of explaining why the wealth distribution is so much more unequal than the income distribution savers take more than retirement into consideration when deciding how much out of current income to spend and to save one reason people save is for precaution for the proverbial rainy day income may vary over the course of lifetime for unpredictable reasons such as illness or economic fluctuations over the course of the business cycle some wealth therefore is accumulated to dampen the effects of those events on living standards8 although such models can account for distribution of wealth that is substantially more unequal than the distribution of income they fail to accoun t for the observed characteristics of the wealth distribution for the most part they fall short of explaining the full extent of the inequality that suggests that there may be other variables in addition to the income distribution that should be considered9 one factor that seems to contribute to the overall inequality in the wealth distribution is the number of selfemployed relative to the rest of the population entrepreneurs may save at higher rate and accumulate greater wealth because of difficulties obtaining sufficient capital to start their own businesses using data from the 1989 scf one study found that entrepreneurs account for more than 60 of the wealth held by those in the top 1 of the wealth distribution10 the study also concluded that entrepreneurs even though they tend to be wealthy face constraints on borrowing and so they also tend to have higher rates of saving as way of accumulating capital the authors of this study found the incidence of entrepreneurship to be an important contributor to inequality in the wealth distribution there is also evidence that bequests may play an important role in explaining the concentration of wealth especially among the wealthiest in the distribution 11 while involuntary that is unplanned bequests added little to explanations of wealth concentration voluntary or planned bequests did the desire to leave bequests also helps to explain the high rate of saving observed in the wealthiest households 8 quadrini vincenzo and ríosrull josévictor understa nding the us distribution of wealth federal reserve bank of minneapolis quarterly

important in explaining why wealth is so much more unequally distributed than income12 parents it seems may also bequeath certain kind of human capital in addition to any financial or real assets they may leave to their children assuming that parents are able to pass on to their children earning power in some form seems also to contribute to explanations of wealth concentration among the very
