long standing statistically there was significant increase in congestion and delay throughout the national aviation system in 2007 the situation has been especially noticeable at certain key airports namely the new york region in general and john f kennedy international airport jfk in particular the department of transportation dot and its operating agency the federal aviation administration faa have promised to take actions aimed at reducing congestion and delay both in the short and long terms in the short term dot is proposing to address the jfk situation through administrative and economic measures that would likely restrict or otherwise provide for the allocation of flights into the airport during specific periods of time in addition to the proposals likely to be made by dot there are other potential nearterm fixes that can be considered to add systemwide capacity to the aviation system these include but are not limited to airspace redesign use of military airspace and airspace flow control over the longer term the faa is primarily relying on modernization of the air traffic control system through the next generation air transportation sy stem ngats or nextgen and the creation of new airport infrastructure to provide major reductions in aviation congestion and delay although recent faa capacity needs study has concluded that these enhancements are needed immediately especially in the new york region congress has taken an interest in this issue as growing concerns over airline service have paralleled ongoing legislative action to reauthorize the activities of the faa and the revenue mechanisms for funding the operations of the nati onal airspace system the bush administration and especially secretary of transportation peters favor examining market mechanisms as means to pay for infrastructure operations maintenance and development in all transportation modes when the administration submitted its proposals for faa reauthorization in early 2007 hr 1356s 1076 it included pilot program to evaluate marketbased mechanisms to relieve congestion at up to 16 airports the faa proposal was not adopted in either the house hr 2881 or senate s 1300 reauthorization bills still under consideration at the end of 2007 but the house bill contains provisions intended to help the faa deal with congestion problems at specific airports regulation of the national air transportation system is legally the domain of the federal government the operation and ownership of airports however is provided primarily by regional state and local entities neither the faa nor the dot have to date attempted to develop and impose congestion pricing scheme on the local authorities in the event that faa should decide to make such an attempt it appears that there are several legal issues that may arise this report will be updated as warranted by dot and congressional actions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34284g3g159g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g5g152g151

levels along with this gr owth flight delays and cancellations have also increased and statistics indicate that the percentage of flights delayed 15 minutes or more in 2007 may surpass the prior record set in 2000 the percentage of cancelled flights is also up although not quite as high as the percentage of cancellations experienced in 1999 2000 and 2001 see figure 1 some also point out that delay statistics alone do not tell the whole story this is because airlines have in many cases opted to lengthen scheduled flight times particularly along heavily congested and frequently delayed routes 2 comparison of present day airline schedules to 1997 schedules found that published trip times are about 10 higher than they were 10 years ago 3 additional schedule adjustments could be forthcoming and may further increase typical travel times particularly in response to recent administration announcements that it would consider operation of chronically delayed flights to constitute an unfair and deceptive practice4 1 wall matthew l belson ken us to limit flights at kennedy the new york times december 11 2007 p a31 2 see scott mccartney why flights are getting longer the wall

plannedfor trip times airline delays are still ticking upward as consequence of this increase in delays combined with airline schedule padding and passengers factoring additional wait times at security screening checkpoints into their travel plans airline passenger trips are getting longer on average and travelers often face more hassles consumer complaints and media coverage of air carrier service deficiencies and cases of extensively delayed flights have put the specific issue of air carrier flight delays in the spotlight during the summer of 2007 in response the dot has convened task force consisting of senior management to assess persisting problems with airline delays and consumer service and has convened special aviation rulemaking committee arc consisting of aviation stakeholders representing airlines airports general aviation users and airline consumers to specifically address delays and other airline service issues in the new york metropolitan area based on the findings and recommendations of these groups which are expected before the end of calendar year 2007 the dot intends to propose options to address and remedy airline delay and customer service problems 5 congress has taken particular interest in this issue as these growing concerns over airline service have paralleled ongoing legislative action to reauthorize the activities of the faa and the revenue mechanisms for funding the operations of the national airspace system while there are broad concerns over aviation congestion and delay at many of the nations busy airports there is particular concern regarding airline service and performance at major airports in the new york metropolitan area where delay problems are the most acute ontime arrival and departure statistics for the past two years compiled by the dots bureau of transportation statistics bts have consistently ranked the three new york metropolitan area commercial passenger airportsnewark liberty ewr john f kennedy international jfk and laguardia lgaat or near the bottom of the list among the busiest 32 airports in the united states from january 2007 through august 2007 abou t one out of every three flights arrived or departed more than fifteen minutes late at these airports between january 2002 and september 2007 at these three airports arrival and departure delays were typically around one hour in length at newark liberty airport wh ere delays have consistently been the worst among busy us airports departure delays averaged 67 minutes nd arrivals delays averaged 73 minutes over the time frame from september 2006 through september 2007 6 according to the faa over the summer of 2007 44 of all air delays experienced throughout the united states occurred in the new york new jersey and philadelphia region7 whats more there was dramatic increase in the percentage of flights cancelled at all three of these airports in 2007 compared to prior years from january through september 2007 jfk saw 318 of its flights cancelled lga had 481 of its flights cancelled and at ewr 365 of scheduled passenger flights were cancelled not only are these cancellation rates much higher than previous years but they are also considerably higher than the systemwide averages presented in figure 1 5 remarks for the honorable mary peters secretary of transportation aviation congestion relief plan media

delays directly attributable to severe weather conditions account for only relatively small portion of total systemwide delays about 6 of all air carrier delays from june 2003 through august 2007 rather delays are most readily attributable to combination of the current systems inability to cope with weather congestion and other factors affecting the efficient flow of traffic at major airports and along crowded airways these types of delays referred to as national aviation system delays account for about 31 of all air carrier delays and are the types of delays that the dot believes can be remedied through investment in new technologies and more efficient procedures for air traffic management other sources of delays include air carrier delays arising from maintenance difficulties and inefficiencies in air carrier operations which account for about one quarter 27 to be exact of all delays

data also the cascading effects resulting from aircraft arriving late that cannot be turned around in time to maintain outbound flight schedules account for 36 of all flight delays however the root causes of initial schedule delays that produce these cascading delays throughout an operational day can be primarily traced back to system inefficiencies and air carrier scheduling inefficiencies and constraints despite heightened aviation security security related delays have had negligible impact less than 1 of flight delays on air carrier operations see figure 2 analysis of airline schedule delays and cancellations across the entire system and more specifically at the three new york area airports point to one single cause but rather variety of potential contributing factors these factors can be grouped into three broad categories airline scheduling and equipage constraints on airport and air traffic control system capacity and business jets and other highperformance general aviation aircraft operations g3g146g155g149g146g151g142g561g21g140g145g142g141g158g149g146g151g144g561g138g151g141g561g7g154g158g146g153g138g144g142g561 the single leading cause of delays is the cascading effects of aircraft arriving late examining the trends in flight delay causes since june 2003 reveals that the largest increase among delay factors is also late aircraft arriving this may in part be an indicator of possible airline overscheduling andor increased fleet utilization in recent years efforts to cut operational cost at airlines have driven airlines to reduce turn times ie the time aircraft spend parked at the gate being serviced between flights these data suggest that either the airlines themselves the airport infrastructure

aviation system components cannot fully accommodate this increased operational tempo the result is cascading delays as an operational day progresses this is also evidenced in statistics showing an increase in delays as it gets later in the operational day see figure 3 figur 3 systemwide p er cent of flights arriving and depar ting on time as function of the time of da 2006 data source crs analysis of bureau of transportation statistics airline ontime performanc data it seems somewhat paradoxical that the increased operations tempo can actually contribute to increased delays to put this into perspective it is useful to examine air carrier fleet trends in 2000 mainline passenger airlines operated 4488 jets compared to an estimated 3886 in 2006 over the same period the number of aircraft operated by regional carriers which are primarily smaller regional jets grew from 2274 in 2000 to an estimated 2743 in 2006 taking these two industry components together the number of operating passenger aircraft declined from 6762 in 2000 to an estimated 6629 in 2006 roughly 2 decrease looking solely at large jets however the trend is much more evident large jets in service have

up about 66 of the total scheduled passenger service fleet in 2000 today large jets make up about 58 in terms of the percentage of jet aircraft in airline operations large jets made up about 88 of all jets used in scheduled passenger service in 2000 whereas in 2006 large jets comprised only 68 of all operating scheduled passenger jets the trend over the past five years has clearly been toward reducing the number of large jets and increasing the number of smaller regional jets8 so not only are there fewer aircraft in service compared to 2000 but the aircraft that are being utilized are on average smaller in size and hold fewer passengers as passenger demand for air travel continues to grow these two trends can contribute to increased congestion and the need to sustain increased operations tempo to handle this growing passenger demand with an increased operations tempo and utilization of smaller aircraft there is greater demand for airport gates so delays to one flightsay for weather or maintenancerelated issuescan have cascading effects on other flights because of lack of gate availability the shift toward using smaller aircraft has been major contributor to the increased traffic at the three new york metropolitan area airports for example comparison of august 2002 airline schedules to august 2007 schedules found that over the past five years there has been 128 increase in the use of aircraft with fewer than 100 seats and an increase of 120 in flights using aircraft with 100 to 200 seats at jfk over that same time period flights at jfk utilizing aircraft with more than 200 seats declined by 12 this illustrates dramatic shift in the type and scale of operations at jfk which has long been regarded as key origin and destination for international flight operations with widebody airc raft historically making up sizable portion of the flight activity at the airport the situation has been similar but somewhat less pronounced at lga and ewr over the past five years lga xperienced 49 jump in scheduled flights of aircraft with fewer than 100 seats but about 8 decline in operations using aircraft with more than 100 seats at ewr the shift hasnt been quite as dramatic but is nonetheless still considerable over the past five years utilization of aircraft with fewer than 100 seats at ewr has increased by almost 34 while there has been relatively little change in the number of flights using aircraft with more than 100 seats based on the comparison of august 2002 and august 2007 flight schedules 9 in addition to this increased operations tempo using smaller aircraft variety of other factors may influence airline scheduling practices some of which may run counter to initiatives for reducing congestion and delay for example current lga slot rules impose use it or lose it conditions on the airlines airlines have responded by continuing to operate unprofitable flights rather than concede these coveted slots to their competitors for example in june 2007 it was reported that there were three unprofitable markets comprising total of 13 daily flights operating at lga 10 while utilizing large aircraft with high load factors high percentages of filled seats would be best for optimizing limited available capacity at congested airports like lga reviews of airline scheduling practices indicate that continued use of smaller aircraft operating routes which generate low load factors leads to suboptimal utilization in scheduling rationales for such strategies among the airlines include offering consumers greater flexibility in 8 see federal

the aviation system in the united states suffers from the fact that flight operations are highly concentrated at relatively small number of airports the 35 busiest airports in the united states handle about 75 percent of all airline passengers this is largely because demand for air travel is highly concentrated within the countrys major metropolitan regions the new york area being the most highly populated metropolitan region generates demand for air travel that significantly strains available capacity this strain on capacity is not limited to commercial airline travel as it also extends to demand for access to airports and airspace by corporate and private jets and fractionallyowned and chartered aircraft the major new york area airports as well as general aviation reliever airports in the area have limited options for expansion an updated faamitre corporation study of capacity needs in the national airspace system released in may 2007 concluded that additional capacity within the new york metropolitan area is needed 12 while this conclusion may now seem obvious even to casual observers the faa was slow to reach this conclusion and the original capacity needs study released in 2004 did not identify the new york metropolitan area as immediately needing additional capacity many regard stewart international airport swf converted military airbase located about 55 miles north of manhattan as potentially providing needed capacity to this region although the faas capacity needs study concedes that it is too early to determine whether nynj port authority acquisition of swf will offset the need for additional capacity enhancements 13 distance from manhattan and lack of ground transportation infrastructure are two potential challenges for making effective use of swf to relieve congestion at the three major new york area airports yet many remain hopeful since options to otherwise expand capacity in the region appear quite limited while the focus of current media attention and policy debate has been on congestion and delay in the new york metropolitan area this region is not alone in its need for additional airport and airspace capacity the faamitre corporation 2007 capacity needs study identified 14 airports and eight metropolitan regions that will need additional capacity beyond that anticipated from ongoing and planned airport expansion projects over the next

the faa has sought to improve the efficiency of the current air traffic system through airspace redesign initiatives and procedural changes using currently available technologies for example in 2001 the faa implemented its natio nal choke point initiative to reduce airspace bottlenecks at several points in the eastern united states including in the airspace serving the new york metropolitan airports this initiative included procedural changes and adding new air traffic control sectors to better distribute controller workload it was reported that these initiatives had the effect of reducing delays by 20 16 also the recently appr oved nynjphl airspace redesign is an initiative to specifically restructure airspace and air traffic flows in the new york and philadelphia regions to improve efficiency and reduce delays according to the faa this redesign initiative could also reduce delays by 20 17 these initiatives have been combined with procedural measures such as ground delays and airspace flow programs as well as the implementation of various decisionaiding tools to assist in air traffic management these approaches are largely regarded as tactical stopgap measures to mitigate delay conditions but are not seen by themselves as complete long term solutions for reducing delays as traffic volumes continue to increase despite some success in reducing delays through these initiatives traffic growth is having the effect of offsetting many of the gains achieved by taking these steps to improve system efficiency faa airspace initiatives in the new york area appear to be having difficult time keeping up with the growth in demand for ai r travel in this region aviation experts largely agree that comprehensive systemsbased approach to implemen ting new technologies and flight procedures is needed to most effectively address capacity needs and reduce delays across the national airspace system particularly in the new york metropolitan region airspace

administration officials26 this prearranged opening of military airspace over the entire thanksgiving weekend was touted by some as an unprecedented step27 while dismissed by others as giving air traffic controllers power they already have and have used for years28 namely the authority to utilize military airspace during holiday periods when the military is typically not training the air transport association ta described the utilization of military airspace over this period as being moderate ranging between 10 to 40 aircraft per hour being routed along these temporary flight paths 29 whether the use of this airspace helped reduce or mitigate delays is hard to say particularly at the new york area airports where delays over the 2007 thanksgiving holiday were largely attributed to low ceilings and reduced visibility which impacted arrival and departure spacing in the past use of military airspace has been on more of casebycase basis such as to reroute traffic around weather leading some to consider whether more extensive use of military airspace along the east coast could be possible fix for airspace congestion and resulting delays experts have mixed opinions regarding the degree to which more extensive use of military airspace can relieve airspace congestion and mitigate delays especially if military airspace is opened only for sporadic temporary intervals this is because the faas airway structure and arrival and departure routes along the east coast have been designed in coordination with the dod taking into consideration those areas carved out for military use turning on and off civilian flight activity through these areas would require continued close coordination between the faa and the dod and this is not something that the relatively rigid current airspace structure and procedures were specifically designed for military airspace however is often inactive that is not utilized for any military purpose thus offering potential options for more direct routing of civilian flights and additional flight paths to alleviate airspace congestion the difficulty is knowing when military airspace will be inactive and could be made available for civilian use better coordination of airspace scheduling between the dod and the faa could potentially open additional routes and give air traffic controllers greater flexibility in routing flights during certain periods of the day particularly as more and more aircraft are allowed to utilize direct routing capabilities relying on satellitebased navigation and are thus not as dependent on the rigid legacy airway structure nonetheless most concede that the overall impact of such actions would likely be relatively small although perhaps not insignificant because they do not address the primary issue of airport capacity constraints at the busiest airports along the east coast

airspace flow programs afps have been used to limit congestion in specific airspace sectors ground delays and afps can also be imposed on general aviation aircraft to limit their disruption of traffic flows to and from major airports that could trigger delays other decisionaiding tools that the faa has developed for improving efficient utilization of airspace include the flight schedule monitor fsm for managing ground delays and airspace flow implementation and the flight schedule analyzer fsa used to assess the effectiveness of ground delay and airspace flow procedures thereby allowing incremental improvements also the traffic management advisor tma aids controllers in optimizing arrival sequences into major airports and an adaptive compression program can aid in identifying controllers and reallocating slots that might otherwise go unused 30 the faa has also relied on collaborative decision making tools and operational playbooks for minimizing disruptions and delays caused by severe weather and other factors improving upon these various operational tools and techniques for optimizing air traffic flows and airspace utilization is an ongoing faa initiative however there is concern that without accompanying technological advances in navigation and surveillance capabilities these efforts will yield diminishing marginal improvements in delay reduction

aviation system on the airport itself aircraft are constrained by the number of available gates and arrivals and departures are metered by runway occupancy and arrival and departure spacing requirements in the air specific entry and exit points into and out of terminal airs pace referred to as gates also constrict traffic flows in congested areas and aircraft separation requirements impose limits on air traffic density technology to improve navigation and surveillance accuracy is seen as longterm solution to safely increase traffic density and increase the flexibility of airspace utilization in congested terminal airspace and along busy routes while the faa has offered that the next generation air transportation system ngats or nextgen provides great hope for alleviating airspace capacity constraints and system delays even if the system development stays on schedule it will not as mentioned earlier be fully implemented for another 17 years by exploiting the improved navigational precision of aircraft satellitebased navigation systems using required navigation performance rnp and area navigation rna v procedures the faa and airline operators can achieve better utilization of airspace thereby increasing system capacity and potentially reducing delays examples include increased numbers of fanned departure headings to increase airspace utilization for departures more closely spaced approaches to parallel runways increased use of direct routing capabilities and greater flexibility for routing aircraft around weather systems these capabilities demonstrate how emerging satellitebased technologies have the potential to create opportunities for procedural changes that can significantly improve system efficiency thereby potentially reducing delays at the new york area airports and at phl rna vrnp arrivals and departures have recently been made available on limited basis and it is anticipated that they will be utilized to much greater extent as implementation of the nynjphl airspace redesign progresses 30 statement of robert sturgell acting administrator testimony before the house committee on transportation and infrastructure

larger aircraft is referred to in the airline industry as upgauging by upgauging aircraft in combination with schedule reductions airlines could serve the same number of passengers with fewer flights the airline trend in recent years however has been to downgauge rather than upgauge this has been particularly prevalent trend over the past five years as airlines have sought ways to increase load factor the ratio of seats filled with revenue paying customers to total available seats and reduce operating costs in highly competitive market at airports where there is significant co mpetition airlines have also sought to provide customers with the greatest amount of scheduling flexibility offering more frequent flights typically on smaller aircraft to keep load factors high and operations profitable without any particular incentives for upgauging airlines are lik ely to be reluctant to do so on their own accord for fear that by offering fewer flights to customers they would be put at competitive disadvantage airlines are also faced with the task of optimizing fleet composition in manner that serves broad array of markets in the most cost effective manner so while upgauging aircraft to serve highly competitive markets may help alleviate congestion and delay problems at specific airports these larger aircraft may not be the best options for particular airlines overall route structure determining an airlines optimum fleet mix is complex task for airlines that serve wide variety of markets so simply upgauging aircraft serving capacity constrained airports may not necessarily be in the best interests of the airlines g6g142g150g138g151g141g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g497g561g21g149g152g157g561g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g156g561g138g151g141g561

or economic mechanisms or combination of the two historically aviation usage of the term demand management is associated with airport slot controls and the allocation of slots over the last 4 decades slot controls have been imposed using both administrative and economic measures at 4 airports in the united states during this period as will be discussed below there were attempts to create market for slots but these markets have never lived up to the expectations of their proponents congestion pricing the focus of several policy statements by secretary of transportation mary peters can be viewed as form of demand management that tries to use pricing techniques to effect desired results in reducing congestion 31 congestion pricing can be imposed at the airport level for example as part of or as an adjunct to landing fees as will be discussed there is some limited experience with the use of these mechanisms in the united states and in the united kingdom uk congestion pricing could also be applied to air traffic control tc activities though to date this mechanism has not been specifically applied in the united states or elsewhere the use of demand management techniques to ration finite amounts of transportation infrastructure has long been supported by economists americans however appear to have an aversion to tolls and the other transportation pricing mechanisms that are the stock and trade of demand management practice roads in this nation for example are provided largely as free 31 white house confirms airline scheduling meetings for jfk aviation daily september 28 2007

for roads sufficiently through taxes at the gas pump this same framework also exists in the aviation world with the airline ticket tax and associated taxes serving as proxy for the highway fuels tax broadly based taxes such as fuel taxes however are viewed by economists as proxies for user fees rather than as true user fees as result taxes are generally seen as relatively poor mechanism for pricing infrastructure nonetheless some observers find it rather remarkable that nation that differentiates access to many of its infrastructure systems on price basis eg telecommunications peak period pricing has comparable mechanism that differentiates for use of the national aviation system congestion pricing is normally opposed by many groups in the aviation community historically the groups most vociferous in their objections to this mechanism are regional airlines business aircraft operators and general aviation aircraft operators all of these groups believe that congestion pricing could be used to discriminate against them and will have the effect of reserving what are publicly supplied assetsairports and atcfor large airlines it should be pointed out that the airline industry has also objected to certain demand management proposals and is objecting to the imposition of congestion pricing at jfk 32 residents of small and medium sized communities primarily served by regional airlines are also concerned that congestion pricing will price them out of major airports and further limit their access to the national aviation system

airport and airway development and revenue acts of 1970 pl 91258 1970 act the 1970 act is seen as milestone in that it created programmatic framework for the modernization of the national tc and airport systems and provided funding mechanism to pay for many of the needed upgradesthe airport and airway trust fund by the end of the 1960s stories about delays at major airports were staple of the evening television news and front page articles in major newspapers beginning in 1968 the faa chose to intervene by instituting capacity controls at four airports chicago ohare ord new york kennedy jfk new york laguardia lga and washington reagan national dca 33 the high density rule hdr as it was known instituted controls by allocating slots takeoffs or landings amongst the incumbent airlines serving each airport when the slot controls were implemented there was some hope that they could be removed at some not too distant point in time instead the controls would last for over 3 decades the slot controls system which was modified on several occasions over the years probably did constrain excessive growth in congestion at the 4 airports but it did not eliminate it 34 from 1968 until 1986 the allocation of slots was primarily handled by scheduling committee at each airport made up largely by representatives of the incumbent airlines the scheduling 32 schofield adrian debate over jfk

voluntary basis this somewhat cozy arrangement was viewed by many as major restraint on competition not surprisingly the scheduling committees failed to provide many slots to the new entrant airlines being created in the wake of airline deregulation in 1978 to the extent that new entrants did get slot awards they were provided through intervention by the faa in 1986 an attempt was made to use market forces to open up some of the slots at the airports this so called buysell rule allowed incumbent airlines the right to buy or sell slots in secondary market to insure that incumbent airlines actually gave up their slots the faa established minimum use rule for slots if the slot was not used over period of time the airline was supposed to lose control over it and return it to the faa in reality the system proved far less useful than hoped35 incumbent airlines proved largely unwilling to give up what they regarded as controlled asset especially to wouldbe competitors sales of slots did occur sometimes as result of an airline merger restructuring etc but largely in way that led to even greater control of the hdr airports by major airlines36 by the end of the 1990s it was clear that slot markets had not worked as hoped faa intervention over the slot control period mostly through the award of exemption authority for certain airlines to provide certain types of services also was seen as having only limited positive impact on competition at the hdr airports in the end it was this concern about lack of competition that led congress to legislate phase out of slot controls at all but washington reagan national as part of the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21 st century air21 pl 106181 air21 called for all slot controls to be eliminated at chicago ohare by july 2002 and controls at new york airports were to end january 1 2007 the law also provided certain exemptions from these deadlines for certain types of aircraft the first consequences of this phase out occurred at laguardia in 2000 when airlines took advantage of small regional jet exemptions provided for in air21 and rapidly initiated large number of new flights to and from the airport this jump in regional jet traffic was somewhat unexpected and the faa was forced to impose moratorium on new service in september 2000 the events of september 11 th temporarily alleviated what was then viewed as growing problem but the problem returned and capacity controls were reintroduced by the faa at chicago ohare the faa has been able to manage capacity since slot controls were eliminated only by seeking voluntary reductions in scheduled traffic from the incumbent airlines primarily american and united in late summer 2006 the faa adopted rule that limits operations at the airport until new airport capacity becomes available which is expected to occur in 2009 unlike laguardia and ohare jfk did not see the same rapid growth in traffic after passage of air21 for part of this period this was result of decreases in overall traffic after september 11 2001 in the last couple of years however there has been major increase in traffic at jfk to the point that the faa is now seeking to implement so sort of capacity controls at the airport 35 berardino frank history of the slot exchange market in the us and some implications presentation at nextor workshop on allocation

on the part of the airlines or implementation of peak period andor congestion pricing at the time of this writing the faa seems intent on limiting jfk flights on per hour basis37 the faa will attempt to meet this goal by asking individual airlines to limit their service at the airport accordingly but apparently will not allow the airlines to meet to discuss flight scheduling mass longer term however the faa still seems to be focused on creating congestion pricing scheme to allocate capacity at the airport 38 g3g151g157g146g157g155g158g156g157g561g11g150g150g158g151g146g157g162g561 on few occasions over the last three decades the now sunset civil aeronautics board and later the dot gave airlines limited antitrust immunity in order to discuss and coordinate schedules each of these grants was temporary in nature and related to specific events in the aviation industry such as the aftereffects of the 1981 air traffic controllers strike in early 2001 after the aviation system experienced massive delays in 2000 congress was considering legislation hr 1407 and s 633 that would have allowed airlines to ask the secretary of transportation for authority to discuss schedules when scheduled traffic exceeded airport capacity and gave the secretary the authority to approve the resulting agreements the authors of these bills viewed the provisions as short term solution to existing capacity problems which they hoped would be alleviated over time by the creation of new airport and atc capacity the events of september 11 however would abrogate the need for this legislation at that time early in 2007 concern about congestion at lga and other airports caused the bush administration and the house committee on transportation and infrastructure to include provisions in faa reauthorization legislation under consideration at that time hr 1356s 1076 and hr 2881 respectively to deal with this issue the bush administration approach seeks to study congestion pricing which will be discussed subsequently hr 2881 however contains provision which implies process that seems similar in some respects to limited grant of antitrust immunity in section 422 the faa administrator is given the authority to seek voluntary meeting of air carriers at congested airport for the purposes of schedule reduction if this meeting is unsuccessful the administrator is given the authority to facilitate schedule reduction as heshe sees fit similar conversation has now begun in conjuncti on with the jfk situation several parties have called on the faa to be more active in schedule coordination for the moment the faa has not sought antitrust immunity and is meeting with air carriers one at time in an attempt to reduce flights into the airport next year 39 should this effort fail to achieve its desired results it is quite possible that the various parties to the scheduling debate might ask for process that includes at least some form of antitrust immunity in 2001 there was considerable concern from some observers that antitrustcreated scheduling committees or mechanisms would be unable to avoid competitive issues that might lead to industry collusion on items such as service and fares there also were concerns that scheduling committees like those used at hdr airports might become semipermanent and anticompetitive feature of the industry 37 faa looks to cap

pricing is quite simple for example it may consist of modified landing andor air navigation fees to change behavior in way that uses the market to allocate available infrastructure it is the application of the concept in the aviation sector that has proved difficult to large extent the difficulty arises because airport runways and air navigation tc services within the united states are normally provided by the public sector and are regarded as public goods compounding this problem is the fact that airports are usually local andor regional monopolies while tc services are provided by national monopoly such as the faa in the us context pricing in the public sector is therefore not focused on creating profit as it would be for private firm but rather on providing for cost recovery or some other publically determined goal hence the forces that routin ely set prices in competitive marketplace are largely absent the concept of congestion pricing predates the invention of the airplane tolling which in certain instances is form of congestion pricing has been around for centuries over the last several decades there has been considerable research on the usefulness and application of congestion pricing mechanisms to transportation infrastructur worldwide most of this research however has focused on surface transportation in the surface transportation world there is large and growing body of academic literature on the subject the similar conversation in the aviation world is much more limited in scope with research on the subject being done by comparatively small number of individuals and groups and in fact several of the authors of studies on aviation pricing are doing so based at least in part on their research on surface transportation pricing issues the bush administration and especially secretary of transportation peters favor market mechanisms for infrastructure development and maintenance in all transportation modes 40 it was therefore not surprise that the administration made review of congestion pricing part of its proposal for faa reauthorization in early 2007 hr 1356s 1076 the faa proposal seeks to establish pilot program to evaluate marketbased mechanisms to relieve congestion at up to 16 airports including lga which was the subject of separate provision the faa proposal was not adopted in either the house hr 2881 or senate s 1300 reauthorization bills still under consideration at the end of 2007

aircraft weight these are generally fixed and do not vary over the time of day with couple of small exceptions there is correlation between the landing fee and congestion although there may be some correlation between fee levels and infrastructure needs at the airport typically in the absence of specific infrastructure needs airport landing fees are determined on the basis of the historicaladministrative costs associated with the airports provision of service to the airlines and its own operating cost requirements while landing fees are an important source of revenue for most airports they are not the only source and at many airports landing fees are not even the majority source of airport income at very large airports for example the airport may receive far 40

would meet the theoretical definition of true congestion pricing each of these experiences is discussed briefly below 41 g16g142g160g561g27g152g155g148g561 in 1968 the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority instituted 25 feesurcharge on all aircraft operations for aircraft with 25 seats or less during peak hours at the three air carrier airports it operated42 the specific intent of this first known instance of peak period pricing in the united states was to reduce ga operations at the three airports the hope was that ga operations especially those using lga would move to teterboro airport teb which was also operated by the port authority and had scheduled air service additional fees were to be imposed on ga aircraft that chose to use teb as substitute not coincidentally this action took place during the same time period that saw the implementation of the hdr slot controls discussed earlier ga interests attempted to overturn these surcharges in the federal courts but were ultimately unsuccessful in doing so 43 the court found that the intent of the surcharge was reasonable and that the port authority had not discriminated against ga in part this was because the court held that teb provided reasonable alternative for ga aircraft that wished to avoid the surcharge the peak period surcharge system at lga remains in place today the peak period pricing system using landing fee surcharges was successful in moving the majority of ga traffic out of lga and into teb in this respect the port authority experience can be viewed as having been successful it should however be recognized that the goals of the surcharge were modest when compared to the peak period pricing regimes promoted by economic theorists hence it would be difficult to draw on this experience as guide to how peak period surcharges might affect the movement of airline traffic in the context of the ongoing faadot slot allocation investigation at jfk 41 for more

1988 attempt at using pricing to modify airport traffic flow was not in fact an example of congestion pricing per the program for airfield capacity efficiency pace changed the landing fee structure at the airport by moving away from strictly weightbased fee and instead creating base fee unrelated to weight for all aircraft landings with an additional weightbased fee the net effect of this system was to significantly raise the landing fees paid by ga aircraft and smaller commuterregional airline aircraft as compared to those now paid by larger airline operated aircraft massport the state agency operating the airport believed that this pricing system would reduce congestion by providing an incentive for airlines to schedule fewer flights during the day using larger aircraft and cause ga and other aircraft to fly to other boston area airports in short massport was attempting to use landing fees as an upguaging strategy ga and the commuterregional airlines faced with higher fees mounted legal challenge to the pace program the complicated legal battle that ensued is discussed in more detail later in this report for the purposes of this discussion only the result of that process is addressed the final decision in the case was made by an administrative law judge alj at dot who decided that the pace program discriminated against ga and commuterregional airlines for several reasons 44 important among these was the lack of an acceptable alternative airport for the users being charged the higher fees interestingly however the alj specifically protected the right of the airport to adopt landing fee system different from the weight based system in place at later date there is nothing inherently sacrosanct about weightbased fees and nothing in the law that precludes massport from changing its method of cost allocation45 as result of the court action the pace program was only in place for six months and it is not clear that the reduction in flights during that period can be specifically attributed to the pace program46 in the intervening years massport has adopted but not implemented peak period surcharge methodology that it believes complies with dots requirements the surcharge itself will only be implemented when traffic delays reach predetermined levels g14g152g151g141g152g151g561 london heathrow lhr is one of the worlds most congested airports in an attempt to modify traffic flows it has imposed peak period pricing regime since 1972 at that time the airport created new landing fee structure that included flight length passenger load timeofday and weightbased elements the fees also were related to the individual airlines ability to pay the fee over time the specific elements of the lhr fee structure have evolved for example after numerous protests by international carriers the distance related portion of the fee was eliminated in 1978 to the chagrin of all air carriers at lhr the british airports authority baa which operated the airport responded by dramatically raising the fixed element of the fee so that many air carriers actually ended up paying higher fees than they had previously 44 leo flavio boston logan

were implemented since 1987 it has been private firm in the late 1980s us air carriers upset over the complicated and high landing fees at lhr successfully sought international arbitration over the fees the findings of that process concurred with the us air carrier view and baa was required to reach financial settlement with the carriers47 irrespective of the us air carrier experience other elements of the landing fee structure have continued to change but the single constant over time has been consistent increase in the landing fees lhr is heavily congested slot controlled airport with much of the capacity slots at the airport reserved as result of international aviation agreements therefore there are other mechanisms in place at the airport besides peak period pricing that allocate capacity to some degree airline access to lhr is one of the most sought after commodities in the world of aviation it is therefore an airport that nearly all international airlines regard as desirable destination regardless of the high landing fees and other costs associated with its use not surprisingly major airlines have continued to seek additional service opportunities at the airport this has not been the case for commuterregional airline service that has largely moved to alternative london airports such as stansted 48 most observers would suggest that the london example is the closest to true congestion pricing and has had some of the types of results that one might theoretically expect from its application the reality however is that lhrs peak period fees have never really created marketbased allocation of traffic amongst major airlines this is due primarily to the desirability of lhr as destination regardless of the high fees at the airport airlines appear to have been able to transfer all of the costs associated with the peak period pricing regime to their passengers through higher fares interestingly congestion is such at lhr that there is longer true peak period and the landing fees have been modified to recognize this reality g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 there are number of issues that will need to be considered as part of any consideration of congestion pricing each of these issues is potentially contentious what follows is brief discussion of several of these issues g8g142g142g561g21g142g157g157g146g151g144g561 although there are other airport related charges that might be modified or created to effect congestion pricing at an airport experience to date clearly shows preference for using landing fees as the principal mechanism for price setting in the united states the setting of landing fees has been the domain of the airport operator the legal discussion that follows this section will show that landing fees can be challenged on various grounds but nonetheless airports have wide discretion in setting these fees so long as they do not discriminate against specific users and the methodology employed in setting the fees is considered fair as result airport operators might contend and have in the past argued that they should determine the pricing policy to be used airport proponents might also argue that they can also effect the rationing of airport capacity by imposing fees on other types of airport airside infrastructure such as terminal gates 47 schank p 423 48 ibid

pricing has been focused on the use of specific airport or groups of airports it is possible to consider congestion pricing of the airspace in the proximity of the airport or region as an alternate pricing mechanism in this instance user fee might be set by the faa for access to an airports related airspace tracon terminal radar approach controlrelated user fees were part of the faas 2007 reauthorization proposal hr 1356s 1076 these proposed fees were not seen as congestion pricing fees however but rather as cost recovery mechanism g8g142g142g561g21g142g157g157g146g151g144g561g138g151g141g561g23g156g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 two important issues that will be raised in any congestion pricing environment are the related questions of what kinds of outcomes the fees are to achieve and how any money collected is to be used if the goal is true congestion relief the fees might have to be set quite high in order to prompt airlines to make schedule changes one possible result of high fees however is that certain user groups such as regional airlines providing essential air service eas or other services to smaller communities might be priced out of specific markets this result and other similar types of exclusions could be at odds with the existing public policy goal of providing broad access to the national aviation system how collected fees might be used also has potential implications that could determine whether or not congestion fees would enjoy public andor airline industry acceptance for example the use of landing fees to fund the operating costs of an airport and to pay for the creation of airport infrastructure is broadly accepted as an appropriate use for these funds this might not be the case if fees were instead designated for us treasury general funds without any specific designation for aviation purposes 49 also in question is how congestion fees might affect airline fares at an individual airport airlines ultimately transfer their costs to their passengers it is well understood that airline fares to and from airports where single air carrier dominates the market are higher than they are at airports with high levels of competition congestion fees could result in greater concentration at certain airports giving air carriers with the majority of service at an airport significant new market pricing power unknown is whether congestion fees could result in high airline fares leading to public unhappiness with the resultant capacity rationing system this especially would be the case in markets where substitute airports andor other transportation alternatives were lacking on the other hand if high fees did result in significant reductions in air carrier delay and improved flight reliability the public might accept the higher fares g3g149g157g142g155g151g138g157g146g159g142g561g8g142g142g561g15g142g140g145g138g151g146g156g150g156g561 since the hdr process was first implemented there have been numerous attempts to create market forces for their allocation as discussed earlier most of these attempts were seen as not having fully served their intended purposes some researchers however have suggested that these airportcentric mechanisms have not embraced the market sufficiently and that slotrelated charges are still viable option for the allocation of airport and airspace capacity 49 for further discussion of some of the issues associated with this issue see plavin z david using the revenues from airport pricing policy brief 68 the reason

in one instance the researchers suggest multilevel auction process to allocate capacity at congested airports using longterm leases of slots at congested airports one year or so with secondary market that allows airlines to trade these leases and an additional market that allows airlines to trade these resources amongst themselves on daytoday basis50 in this particular instance the market would likely be run by the faa with funds derived from the slot auctions reserved for airspace infrastructure improvements the researchers recognize significant number of issues that might arise from this process but believe it could be useful mechanism for the allocation of capacity 51 g14g142g144g138g149g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the consideration and potential imposition of congestion pricing or other related mechanisms at airports raises numerous legal issues and highlights longstanding tension in aviation law between federal uniformity and supremacy over airspace and air safety concerns on the one hand and local control over airports and ground facilities on the other this tension in addition to legal issues related to the ability of airports to use congestion pricing or similar mechanisms in conjunction with the federal financial support received through programs such as the airport improvement program aip may have significant impact on the type of mechanism suggested and considered as noted earlier it appears that the legal issues related to congestion pricing mechanisms have been primarily identified by the two local airport authorities who sought to impose such systems over the legal objections generally on preemption grounds of the faa and other adversely affected parties to date the faa has not suggested the imposition of federal congestion pricing mechanism on local airports as result it is unclear precisely what if any legal issues may arise should the situation reverse itself and congestion pricing become federal mandate as opposed to local solution seeking federal approval this section of the report will proceed as follows first it will review and survey the current laws that govern airports including the federal preemption statute as well as several other federal laws that constrain what local airports are permitted to do with fees charged and money granted by federal programs such as the aip second the report will discuss current law as it relates to airports proprietary powers in other words given the federal statutory structure what authority if any is left to the local governments and airport authorities with respect to implementing congestion pricing mechanisms third the report will review the two previous examples of alternative pricing mechanisms proposed by local airport authorities both of which resulted in federal litigation the first in 1969 at new yorks laguardia airport was approved by the federal court while the second at bostons logan airport was rejected by the reviewing court finally this section will discuss some of the legal issues that may arise should the faa attempt to offer congestion pricing as federal mandate these may include such issues as whether the faa has the proper statutory authority and whether laws related to the financing and use of funds by airports may need to be adjusted or amended 50 ball michael donohue george and hoffman karla auctions for the safe efficient and

establish coherent national aviation policy that places the primary responsibility for regulating the air transportation system with federal agencies while at the same time attempting to retain local control over certain groundrelated elements including monitoring of noise land use and zoning the caa set forth inter alia the encouragement and development of the air transportation system the regulation of air transportation to assure high degree of safety and sound economic conditions and the promotion of efficient service by air carriers without unfair competitive practices or unjust discrimination53 although replaced in 1958 by the federal aviation act54 the general policy language has largely been retained and the federal government has continued to assert primary control over much of the aviation sector especially with respect to airspace safety and discrimination related issues in addition the federal aviation act included specific preemption provision that prohibits state and local authorities including airport authorities from enacting and enforcing laws related to airline price route or service 55 moreover the statutory language expressly preserves state and local authority with respect to an airports proprietary powers which will be discussed in more detail below56 finally it should be noted that most economic regulation of the aviation sector was eliminated by the adoption of the airline deregulation act of 197857 with respect to airspace current law clearly establishes that it is the federal government that controls the sovereignty of us airspace58 specifically the federal aviation administration faa is charged with developing plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assigning by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace59 statutes such as these are generally considered field preemption statutes or instances where congress by the nature of its action can claim to have preempted or occupied an entire area of the law generally the supreme court has found field preemption in two types of situations 1 where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left room for supplementary state regulation60 or 2 where the field is one in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject61 as result of these statutes the states and other political subdivisions such as local

measures and policies that interfere with the federal governments ability to control airspace and other aviation related issues62 in addition to the federal preemption statutes local governments and

2000 the fifth circuit rejected an interpretation of the proprietor exception that would have permitted an airport owner to allocate traffic between two airports so as to preserve the shorthaul nature of one facility73 it is worth noting however that in the same fifth circuit court of appeals decision which involved the nowrepealed wright amendment the court did note willingness to review the exercise of proprietary powers with respect to advancing previously unrecognized local interests but not in this particular case 74 as none of these rulings appear to have addressed the issue of congestion pricing it is at best unclear whether such authority is permissible or within the socalled proprietor exemption

as previously mentioned there have been two attempts at imposing fee mechanisms that might be considered congestion pricing broadly defined these attempts both emanated from the local airport authorities and were met with resistence from adversely affected interests and in the case of bostons logan international from the faa primarily on federal preemption grounds we will discuss each

airports in and around new york city laguardia lga john f kennedy international jfk newark liberty international ewr and teterboro teb soughtfor the purpose of relieving congestion and achieving the maximum efficient operation at the airportsto impose 25 minimum charge for landing during peak hours 75 the fee applied to any aircraft that took off or landed during the peak hours and had seating configuration of less than 25 passengers76 the fee applies at the three major port authority aircarrier airports guardia jfk and newark but not at teterboro airport lawsuit was brought on the grounds that the socalled takeofffees impermissibly discriminated in favor of commercial airlines and against general aviation interests plaintiffs argued inter alia that the faa is vested with the sole authority to regulate and control the national airspace and therefore the port authority violated federal law in imposing the 25 takeoff fee77 in addition to the preemption argument plaintiffs argued first that the faa is required by law to expressly approve of the port authoritys regulations or at minimum is continued subject matter of local regulations to aircraft noise and other environmental

aid agreements78 second according to the plaintiffs teterboro is not reasonably convenient nor adequate facility as an alternate to the three major new york airports and therefore the diversion of general aviation to teterboro would result in practical exclusion from the new york area airports finally the plaintiffs asserted variety of nonlegal or policy arguments against the proposal these arguments included that it would be ineffective to remedy the airport situation which was due to overscheduling by commercial airlines and not general aviation 79 that diversion would not resolve the disparity between airport capacity and demand80 and that the record indicated that the commercial airlines were intimately involved in the proposal and even offered to subsidize ground transportation from teterboro to provide further incentive for moving general aviation away from the other airports81 in response to the preemption argument the court first noted that there exists room for the operation of port authority regulations which have the effect of curtailing activities not forbidden by federal regulation82 as result according to the court nothing in the proposed port authority regulations runs counter to the faa regulation in the sense that it seeks to authorize conduct which the federal regulation prohibits or requires the cessation of practice required by federal regulation83 in response to the argument that the faa was required to approve the port authority regulations the court held that there was enough evidence on the record to indicate that there was inherent incompatibility with federal law 84 next the court addressed the argument that teterboro is not reasonably convenient to new york city the court held that teterboro is not nil facility or purgatorial alternative and thus does provide valid basis for limiting the port authoritys attempts to relieve the regions congestion85 with respect to the other arguments raised by the plaintiffs the court found facts relevant to the dispute and entered judgment in favor of the defendants thereby allowing the fees to go into effect 86

filed an administrative complaint with the faa alleging that the fees were invalid because they were not fair and reasonable and they discriminated against smaller aircraft90 the secretary of the department of transportation dot agreed to review the complaint and commenced an investigation and requested that massport suspend implementation of pace91 massport declined and indicated that it would implement the new fees on july 1 1988 while the faa investigation was pending separate group filed suit in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief preventing massport from implementing the pace landing fees 92 in addition the opposition groups who had sought administrative relief also filed suits in federal court all three lawsuits contained similar allegations and were consolidated the suits alleged that by shifting the cost burden of the landing fees from the larger aircraft to the smaller the new method conflicts with various federal statutes that regulate the national airspace and were therefore preempted 93 the fees were also alleged to be constitutionally invalid not only because by placing an undue burden on interstate commerce they violated the commerce clause94 but also because they discriminated illegally against small aircraft in contravention of the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment95 the district court ruling orally from the bench found in favor of massport on the question of preemption the court found that there was preemption because congress in passing the airline deregulation act of 1978 96 intended the proprietor to set the landing fees97 with respect to allegations of unreasonableness the court found that the fees were reasonable because they were fixed according to uniform fair and practical standard and were nonexcessive in comparison with the governmental benefit conferred and were relevant to the operation of the airport and fairly consonant with the cost incurred98 finally regarding the alleged discriminatory effect the court held that because the objectives of the airport to reduce congestion and delay are rationally related to legitimate governmental interest the fees

not discriminatory99 as result of the district courts ruling the pace fee structure went into effect on july 1 1988 litigation then shifted to the dot who appointed an administrative law judge alj to recommend decision based on the evidence submitted the alj concluded that the pace fees were 1 in violation of massports grant assurances as they were not fair and reasonable 2 unjustly discriminatory and were in violation of various federal statutes100 and thereby invasive of the dots authority and 3 preempted by federal law101 in addition to these major findings the alj also held that hanscom field cannot be considered an alternative to logan international because it lacks the connecting opportunities that are otherwise available at logan102 on appeal to the secretary of transportation the secretary affirmed and adopted the aljs recommendations however the secretary indicated that the alj overstated the extent of the preemptive role of the federal government in the control of airport access and access to the national air transportation system 103 according to the secretary it is within an airport proprietors authority to impose reasonable nondiscriminatory landing fees or other user fees even if such fees may result in decline in usage by class of user or other indirect effects on users104 moreover while an airport sponsor has wide latitude in recovering costs and using fees to improve the efficient use of airport facilities the faa is vested with the authority to control regulate and manage air traffic105 as result of the secretarys decision massport suspended the pace fee on december 27 1988 pending the outcome of its appeal both the district courts decision and the secretarys affirmation of the aljs findings were appealed to the first circuit court of appeals the appeals court divided its analysis by statutory provision first the court addressed the allegations that the fees were unreasonable and in violation of section 511 of the airport and airw ay improvement act of 1982 the court affirmed the secretarys determination that the fees were unreasonable on agency deference grounds concluding that the record firmly supports the secretarys conclusions and that the issue is definitely an area of expertise primarily reserved to the secretarys discretion and not to be secondguessed by appellate courts106 next the court reviewed the findings of both the district court and the secretary with respect to the federal antihead tax act the district court had found the fees to be reasonable thus not in violation while the alj and ultimately the secretary had concluded that the fee was not head tax or its equivalent thus the statute was not implicated the appeals court upheld both holdings though it utilized the rationale provided by the secretary concluding that massports fee structure was outside the scope of the act as not being charge on persons traveling in air commerce nor is it levy on the carriage of persons so traveling on the sale of air transportation or on the gross receipts derived therefrom 107 99 id at 162 100 the statutes specifically cited were sections 307 and 105 of the federal aviation act of

raised by sections 105 and 307 of the federal aviation act of 1958 as amended on this issue the district court and the secretary had disagreed with the court finding the fees reasonable and hence not preempted while the secretary found them to be unreasonable and ther efore preempted by federal law the appeals court ultimately concluded that the district court erred not only in its decision but also in not deferring to the secretarys primary jurisdiction over this controversy as was requested by the dot in its last minute amicus intercession relying on the doctrine of primary jurisdiction the court held that in cases such as these when there is basis for judicial action independent of agency proceedings courts may route the threshold decisions as to certain issues to the agency charged with primary responsibility for governmental supervision or control of the particular industry or activity involved 108 in other words the district court should have deferred its judgment until after the faa and the secretary had investigated and completed their administrative review turning to the merits of the secretarys decision the court concluded that massports fee structure was an impermissible interference with air navigation and therefore preempted by federal law109 having decided the case on statutory grounds the court declined to address the constitutional issues raised by the commerce clause or the fourteenth amendment110 based on these two cases it is difficult to discern precisely where the courts are with respect to airport imposed pricing mechanisms intended to relieve congestion at one level it seems that perhaps the different results reached turned on the availability and feasibility of alternative landing sites for the smaller general aviation planes that were adversely affected by both pricing schemes in the case of new york and teterboro the court found that to be viable alternative whereas with respect to boston and hanscom the alj was not persuaded that the alternative location was reasonable resting on this distinction however appears to oversimplify many of the complex issues that the court and the alj dealt with in the massport case the development of aviation law and addition of new statutes in the 20 years between the two cases appeared to play an integral role in the difference between the results currently the law remains nearly identical to what it was in massport thereby making it unlikely that another attempt by local airport authority to impose similar pricing scheme without the faas express approval would succeed admittedly this analysis appears to render the fees at laguardia sui generis 111 however such conclusion appears to be reasonable way to reconcile what on their face seem to be two irreconcilable judicial decisions that said it does not appear to be per impossible for local airport authorities to take action it may be that fee structure could be developed that imposes feesdesigned to reduce congestionthat are reasonable nondiscriminatory and based on the airports historical operating costs assuming such fee structure could be developed it appears possible that it may not be in violation of either federal law or faa regulations 108 id at 171 citing port of boston marine terminal assn v rederiaktiebolaget transatlantic 400 us 62 68 1970 see also united states v western pacific r co 352

as the previous section indicated all of the prior attempts at imposing congestion pricing mechanisms have been locally generated by the airport authorities neither the faa nor the dot have to date attempted to develop and impose congestion pricing scheme on the local authorities in the event that faa should decide to make such an attempt it appears that there are several legal issues that may arise first there appears to be question of legal authority does faa have the legal authority to impose such system without change in the current statutes based on review of the statutes currently in place it appears that the faa has reasonable basis to proceed while it is true that there is specific statute that directly provides faa with such authority an argument can be made that by virtue of the agencys statutory mandate with respect to the airspace of the united states the legal authority exists phrased another way if the faa characterizes the imposition of congestion pricing scheme as an airspace air traffic or air navigation means of managing it may be argued that it would fall within the agencys existing authority provided by congress to develop plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace 112 this argument would also appear to be consistent with the secretarys finding in massport that the faa is vested with the authority to control regulate and manage air traffic113 yet another way of looking at this is potentially through negative preemption type argument114 in other words if as the dot argued in massport the local airport authorities are preempted by federal law from imposing unreasonable andor discriminatory feeseven to reduce congestionthen it stands to reason that the federal government through the faa is the only place where such regulation could originate in addition it should be noted that there appears to be generallyapplicable federal statute that permits the heads of agencies to prescribe regulations establishing the charge for service or thing of value provided by the agency 115 the statute requires that each charge shall be 1 fair and 2 based ona the costs to the government b the value of the service or thing to the recipient c public policy or interest served and d other relevant facts116 the supreme court has held that this authority extends to only specific charges for specific services to specific individuals or companies117 based on the plain language of this statute it appears possible for the faa to assert that the thing of value provid ed is access to the national airspace therefore imposing fees and charges provided they meet the requirements of the statute is arguably permissible although it does not appear that this statute has ever been used with respect to fees relating to airspace use during its existence the civil aeronautics board did use the statute to 112

use in the aviation context is not without precedent second question that arises has to do with the idea of reasonableness and nondiscrimination in setting airport fees if one accepts the authority argument that only the faa can impose congestion pricing system it appears to follow then that the restrictions currently in place that prohibit state and local authorities from discrimi nating and imposing unreasonable fees would not apply as the pricing scheme would be federally imposed and not locally mandated similarly none of the aip restrictions on local airport authorities appear to be implicated by an faa imposed congestion pricing scheme more complicated set of questions arise should the faa decide not to impose congestion pricing directly but rather to delegate the authority to impose congestion pricing to various local airport authorities in this situation it would appear that either faa would have to waive the restrictions on reasonableness and nondiscrimination or simply refuse to enforce the potential violations that may ensue from implementation of its mandate based on plain reading of both the antihead tax 119 and the airport and airway improvement act of 1982120 neither statute appears to provide the secretary or the administrator of the faa with the authority to grant waivers for states to levy taxes or from the nondiscrimination and reasonableness requirements in fact the airport and airway improvement act of 1982 seems to require that approval be granted only if the secretary receives written assurances satisfactory to the secretary that the airport will be available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust discrimination121 hence it would appear that should the faa attempt to delegate its authority over potential congestion pricing sche to the local airport authorities it will first have to seek statutory change from congress third question arises with respect to the use of any funds collected from the imposition of federally mandated congestion pricing scheme even if it is accepted that faa has the legal authority to implement congestion pricing scheme it does not automatically follow that the faa or the dot would be permitted to retain the fees collected it is generally accepted principle of federal appropriations law that absent statutory authority to the contrary the miscellaneous receipts statute122 requires agencies to deposit funds received for the government into the federal treasury otherwise known as the general fund an agency may only retain such moneys it receives if it has statutory authority to do so according to decisions of the comptroller general the miscellaneous receipts statute does not apply if there is specific statutory authority for the agency to retain the funds123 consequently absent such specific authority it would appear that even if the faa were to delegate congestion pricin g authority to the local airport authorities the money would still be required to go to the treasurys general fund this conclusion follows from principles of delegation namely that government entities cannot delegate authority that they themselves do not possess124 hence if faa does not possess the authority to keep the fees that it collects from congestion pricing scheme it cannot properly delegate the power to keep the fees to local airport authority in sum should it be desired that the funds collected from congestion pricing mechanism go anywhere but the general fund congress will have to pass 118 see air transport assn of america v cab 732 f2d 219 221
