abandonment 594111 description damage to submarine resulting from an explosion collision material failure or other event could lead to conditions that require abandoning the submarine while it is submerged whatever the cause extensive flooding of major compartments may prevent the submarine from surfacing under its own power under such conditions procedures for immediate rescue or escape must be initiated if rescue or escape is delayed depleted oxygen levels in the submarines atmosphere and rising carbon dioxide levels can ultimately lead to the death of the crew 59412 factors influencing submarine abandonment 594121 general most submarines have been fitted with at least two rescueescape trunks one for each main compartment ssbn 726 class trident submarines have three rescueescape trunks these trunks typically have all the features see section 4 necessary for either twomen escape evolutions using submarine escape appliances steinke hoods or collective group rescues by deep submergence rescue vehicle dsrv or submarine rescue chamber src the exterior hull structure around the upper access hatch of the rescue escape trunks incorporates strengthened flat machined seating surface rescue seat to allow for proper mating of dsrv or src for more information on the capabilities of and the requirements for using the dsrv or src rescue systems see navsea s9594aegtp010 disabled submarine requirements for employment of us navy submarine rescue systems 594122 rescue and escape operations listed below are general factors that influence how and when rescue and escape operations should be performed and how successful they will be these factors have to be considered before deciding whether to abandon the submarine by using the rescueescape trunks for individual escapes or to wait for collective rescue by dsrv or src collective rescue by dsrv or src is much safer than individual escape and in most cases is the preferred method of submarine abandonment 1 time required for search and rescue forces to locate the disabled submarine dissub survival time aboard the dissub is limited early location of the dissub provides more time for the crew to assess the situation and decide whether to await rescue or start escape operations 2 availability of dsrv or src and its associated surface support surface support is essential in order to safely and successfully conduct any submarine rescue operation depending on the location of the dissub and the rate at which conditions in it are deteriorating dsrv or src might be unable to reach the accident site before individual escape operations would have to begins9086t9stm010ch594r1 12 3 depth of the dissub safe and successful escape operations using the submarine escape appliance are limited by the depth of the dissub 4 pitch and roll angle of the submarine the dsrv and src can only mate with the dissub within set pitch and roll limits 5 current across the submarines hull the dsrv and src can only mate with the dissub within certain current limits 6 internal pressure of the submarine pressurization of the dissubs atmosphere affects the ability of the dsrv and src to mate with the dissub pressurization of the dissubs atmosphere also increases the risk that survivors will develop decompression sickness dcs upon returning to the surface see figure 59411 7 temperature of the surrounding water the temperature of the water and the temperature on the surface will affect the length of time that personnel after escaping the dissub can remain unprotected in the water before developing hypothermia 8 weather conditions on the surface surface support capability rescue operations and the safe recovery of escapees are affected by the weather conditions on the surface 9 condition of the submarines internal atmosphere the concentrations of carbon dioxide oxygen and toxic gases are major concerns that will influence the decision to escape or await rescue 10 extent of damage to the submarine flooding fire and extent of structural damage are key factors that will influence the decision to escape or await rescue 594123 rescue system deployment the following general factors should be taken into account by the onsite rescue mission commander when deciding which rescue system dsrv or src to deploy 1 location of the dissub 2 availability of dsrv src and support ships 3 pitch and roll angle of the dissub 4 current across the dissubs hull 5 weather conditions on the surface 594124 criteria for escape or rescue rescue whenever feasible is always preferred over escape from medical and physiological point of view there are conditions however that require individuals to escape using steinke hoods multiple factors must be considered when making the decision whether to escape or wait for rescue see figure 59412 of all these factors the greatest consideration should be given to the atmospheric conditions in the dissub particularly the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the air the rate at which these levels are changing and the dissubs internal pressure 5941241 criteria supporting the decision to escape escape should be considered if one or more of the following criteria are met 1 uncontrolled flooding or fire exists 2 the carbon dioxide concentration is approaching 6 percent and is continuing to increase after all means to control carbon dioxide buildup have been used waiting until the carbon dioxide levels are intolerable will give survivors only few extra hours to safely remain on board the dissub and will greatly complicate the escape sequence as the survivors mental capacities deteriorate 3 the oxygen concentration is approaching 13 percent and is decreasing after using all onboard reservess9086t9stm010ch594r1 13 figure 59411 submarine escape depth and probability of developing dcs s9086t9stm010ch594r1 14 figure 59412 factors affecting the decision to await rescue or to escape from dissub s9086t9stm010ch594r1 15 4 the internal atmospheric pressure of the dissub is increasing and rescue is not immediately anticipated escape should be made before the internal pressure reaches 23 feet of seawater gage fswg or 17 atmospheres to minimize the risk of dcs in survivors when they reach the surface the dissub crew should use figure 59411 to determine when escape should begin based on the internal atmospheric pressure and the depth at which the rescueescape trunk operations are to be conducted 5 persistent toxic atmosphere requires the use of emergency air breathing masks 6 surface support is present to retrieve and care for survivors especially in colder waters 7 rescueescape trunk operations are conducted at depth of 450 feet of seawater fsw or less successful escapes from greater depths are possible but are riskier 8 the crews physical condition will allow them to survive in the open ocean until rescue personnel arrive 5941242 criteria supporting the decision to await rescue the decision to await rescue should be considered if the following criteria are met 1 rescue assets are expected to arrive before conditions requiring escape develop 2 oxygen concentration is greater than 13 percent and carbon dioxide concentration is 3 percent or less and not rapidly increasing 3 internal atmospheric pressure exceeds 23 fswg 17 atmospheres and is not increasing 4 life support supplies such as carbon dioxide absorbent lithium hydroxide and oxygen are adequate to maintain breathable atmosphere until rescue 5 escape trunk operations would occur at depth greater than 450 fsw 6 there is surface support for survivors and surface conditions are unfavorable high winds high sea state or cold 7 the crew is not physically fit or equipped to survive in the open sea for long time 594125 communicating the submarines location the submarines crew should use all available means to broadcast the status of the dissub this will help locate the submarine and aid in making an early decision about the rescue method to be used the ships communication system or emergency communication transmitters can be used to signal that the submarine is disabled search and rescue ships can detect signals from various sources on the submarine including active sonar equipment underwater telephone emergency underwater telephone remote acoustic communication system racs or the crew hammering on the hull search sonar on surface ships and side look sonar towed by surface ships can be used to locate the submarine flares buoys or debris ejected from the submarine that can be seen on the surface by aircraft or surface ships can also indicate its location during actual rescue operations the anbqn13 submarine distress pingers are the primary means of broadcasting the location of the dissub to search and rescue parties and guiding dsrv to the submarine 594126 communicating the submarines condition informing rescue personnel of the condition of the dissub is vital knowledge of conditions in the submarine will aid rescue personnel in determining what rescue methods to use and how to protect themselves during actual rescue operations this information has also helped crews in the past during their escapes and is useful to salvages9086t9stm010ch594r1 16 personnel during salvage operations the following information should be recorded and transmitted to rescue personnel 1 location and extent of damage to the pressure hull main ballast tanks hull appendages internal equipment and ship systems 2 location and extent of flooding and the amount of nonflooded volume 3 condition of the atmosphere with regard to internal pressure carbon dioxide and oxygen levels presence of contamination etc 4 available services and equipment 5 availability of supplies such as carbon dioxide absorbent lithium hydroxide medical supplies food drinking water etc 6 ships depth pitch angle roll angle and true heading 7 number and general condition of survivors including the extent of injuries 8 internal air temperature and temperature of seawater at dissub depth 9 number of steinke hoods available 10 availability of air banks and current bank pressures oxygen banks and current bank pressures and atmospheric monitoring equipments9086t9stm010ch594r1 21 section 2 collective rescue using submarine rescue chamber 59421 submarine rescue chamber src 594211 general identification srcs

with manipulator arm deep submergence vehicle dsv or an atmospheric diving system ads for deeper depths 5942152 holddown devices four holddown devices stored in the upper compartment are used to hold the src securely to the rescue seat after seal is made between the src and the dissub these devices fit into beveled slots in reinforced circular ring welded around the inside circumference of the lower compartment the shackle or jaw end on the lower part of each device is secured to one of four attachment points located around the perimeter of the submarines upper access hatch three types of attachment points are used one type is permanently welded staple that is typically used on ssn 637 and earlier classes of submarines that have 25inchdiameter upper access hatches on these submarines the staples are normally attached to the outer hull another type of attachment point used is permanently welded padeye see figure 59422 ssn 688 ssbn 726 and ssn 21 class submarines have 30inchdiameter upper access hatches with the padeyes installed below the level of the hatch fairing cover to access these padeyes the hatch fairing cover must be removed these padeyes are being replaced with threaded eyebolt referred to as portsmouth interlock the threaded eyebolt is carried on the rescue vehicle and is installed by the src crew after seal is made with the dissub the eyebolts are installed into special threaded receivers that are welded into the submarines structure flush with the rescue seat the eyebolt and receiver has three advantages over the welded padeyes 1 it allows the rescue crew to install holddown devices before removing the hatch fairing cover on ssn 688 ssbn 726 and ssn 21 class submarines which have the permanently welded type of padeyes the hatch fairing covers must be removed to access the padeyes and to allow the 30inchdiameter hatch to be opened to the maximum extent within the src skirt 2 it is significantly stronger than the welded padeyes or staples 3 it allows for increased submarine hatch opening angles within the rescue vehicle skirt for easier access between the submarine and the rescue vehicle 594216 ballast tank the ballast tank surrounds the lower compartment and can change the buoyancy of the src by approximately 1360 kilograms 3000 pounds it is usually dry and kept at atmospheric pressure except when seal is being made

proper fitting on the src the air lines power cable and communications cable are bound together to 76millimeterdiameter 3inch nylon rope strength member this assembly is referred to as the umbilical to allow the src to operate freely the umbilical is kept slack during the descent and ascents9086t9stm010ch594r1 28 after all service connections from the support ship to the src are tested the src is lowered over the side of the support ship pressure in the air supply line is kept at least 345 kilopascals kpa 50 poundforce per square inch gage psig higher than the ambient sea pressure or 1379 kpa 200 psig whichever is greater 4 when the src is ready for the descent the operators board it through the upper hatch after the upper hatch is closed and the lower compartment is flooded the src descends to the dissub 5 in shallow water less than 61 meters 200 feet seal is made between the src and the submarine by flooding the ballast tank taking up the slack in the downhaul cable blowing the lower compartment and then venting the lower compartment to topside this method of forming seal can also be used at greater depths if the current or rescue seat conditions on the submarine will not allow seal to be formed as described below 6 the seal caused by sea pressure is enough to hold the src tightly against the rescue seat this type of seal is made by rapidly transferring water from the lower compartment to the ballast tank the src is intended for use in rescue operations in which the pressure within the dissub is at or near atmospheric pressure all pressurized rescue operations should follow current diving practices and safety precautions to ensure that any required decompression is done properly 7 after seal is made and the src lower chamber is drained the src crew instructs the submarine to drain the upper hatch cavity to equalize pressure between the submarine and the src see table 59421 for standard tap signals used between the src and dissub the submarine crew then drains the trunk if necessary the pressure in the trunk and the access compartment should be the same before the lower access hatch to the trunk is opened 8 on submarines that have been modified to use the threaded eyebolt the src crew installs them the src crew installs the holddown devices and removes the downhaul cable and fairlead assembly they then remove the submarine hatch

valves are shut and the src may prepare to unseal 14 convenient way for the support ship to direct the src crew to answer telephone call from the surface is to turn the master power switch off and on the blinking lights in the src direct the crew to man the telephone doing away with the necessity of keeping one operator tied continually to the phone the phone on the surface should be manned at all times the srcs emergency underwater telephone should be energized to provide communication between the src and the submarine and between the src and the support ship the emergency underwater telephone provides means of communication if the normal telephone system fails during actual rescue operations 29210 blanks9086t9stm010ch594r1 31 section 3 collective rescue using deep submergence rescue

individual escape using the rescueescape trunk 59441 individual escape 594411 definition individual escape is defined as individual abandonment of the submarine by buoyant ascent through the water to the surface with the use of submarine escape appliance steinke hood this kind of escape can be made without assistance from deep submergence rescue vehicle dsrv or submarine rescue chamber src 594412 method this buoyant freebreathing escape method is relatively safe and rapid way to make individual escapes from sunken submarine up to depths of 137 meters 450 feet this method has been used successfully in open sea ascents from depth of approximately 97 meters 318 feet and in simulated ascents from depth of approximately 137 meters 450 feet escape from depths as great as approximately 183 meters 600 feet is physiologically feasible but poses greater risk of injury to survivors see figure 59411 59442 submarine escape appliance 594421 general the submarine escape appliance is also

closing the upper hatch is springbalanced for manual opening and has mechanical or hydraulic mechanism to assist in operating the hatch from within the submarine on earlier classes of submarines with separate rescue and escape hatches the escape hatch has mechanism to assist in its operation 5944322 portable bubble skirt portable bubble skirt is installed in the rescueescape trunk for use during escape operations the skirt traps an air bubble at the top of the trunk this allows the escapees to maintain their heads above water after the trunk is flooded ssn 637 class and earlier submarines have fixed bubble skirts ssn 688 class and later submarines typically have portable bubble skirts the portable skirt has rubber gasket and manually operated dogs for sealing against mating surface in the trunk 5944323 flooding system the flooding system is used to fill the trunk with seawater to the bubble line in preparation for escape the system typically consists of manually operated twoposition ball valve and tailpiece with twostation operator the twostation operator permits the valve to be operated from either inside the trunk or from below the trunk in the access compartment 5944324 blow and vent system the blow and vent system is used to pressurize the trunk when it is flooded reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the trunk and reduce the pressure in the trunk at the end of the escape procedure this system can be operated from inside the trunk or from below the trunk in the access compartment the system typically has redundant piping penetrations with associated valves rather than single valve with dual controls 5944325 air charging system the air charging system which is supplied from the trunk blow and vent system is provided to charge the submarine escape appliances with breathable air the air is supplied through regulating valve that is normally set for 100 psi above ambient trunk pressure the air passes through an isolation valve to manifold typically containing two escape appliance charging connections 5944326 trunk drain system the trunk drain system typically consists of valve mounted at the bottom of the trunk below the level of the lower access hatch coaming any accumulated water can be drained to the main drain system trim and drain system or the compartment depending on the location of the trunk and the conditions in the submarine for detailed information on draining the trunk see the applicable ship systems manual 5944327 upper hatch cavity drain system the upper access hatch is recessed below the molded line of the submarines hull which creates large cavity in which water is trapped after the submarine surfaces the upper hatch cavity drain system provides the piping necessary to drain this area before opening the upper access hatch 5944328 overhead light lamp is installed in the trunk above the bubble line for light the lamp is energized by either the normal or emergency lighting system through

access compartment 59443212 allowable bottom time chart the allowable bottom time chart is installed in the trunk above the bubble line this chart provides list of times versus depths of the submarine that the escapees must not exceed after the trunk is pressurized similar allowable bottom time chart is located below the trunk in the access compartment 59443213 hammer hammer mounted above the bubble line is provided for communicating with personnel outside of the trunk in case all other communication systems have failed hammer is also located below the trunk in the access compartment 59443214 valve persuader short piece of pipe is mounted above the bubble line on some classes of submarines this piece of pipe is used to assist in opening and shutting the flood valve during escape operations the pipe is installed on the end of the valve handle for more leverage when attempting to open the valve 59443215 divers knife divers knife is stowed in the trunk and is used to clear away objects that may obstruct an escape or prevent proper seating of the upper access hatch 59443216 mechanical timer mechanical timer is installed in the trunk above the bubble line the timer is springdriven and comes equipped with knob that allows the timer to be wound up before use 59443217 steinke hood operating procedure plate the steinke hood operating procedure plate is mounted on the inside of the trunk above the bubble line the plate provides instructions on how to properly inflate and use the escape appliance 59444 individual escape procedure 594441 general because of the variety among submarine classes detailed escape procedures are not contained here to conduct successful individual escape operations refer to the applicable ship systems manuals for detailed instructions and procedures for using the rescueescape trunk 594442 physiological effects during individual escape escape operations subject the human body to certain physiological stresses that if not understood and accounted for can result in severe injury or death for detailed information on these physiological effects see navsea 0994lp0019010 us navy diving manual volume 1 air diving s9086t9stm010ch594r1 414 5944421 effects of increased pressure on the body increased atmospheric pressure in the submarine such as might occur during flooding casualty increases the amount of nitrogen that is absorbed in the body this increased amount of nitrogen can produce bubbles in the body upon depressurization during return to the surface these nitrogen bubbles can form in joints blood vessels and the brain if the body cannot eliminate the gas as it depressurizes these bubbles can cause extreme pain paralysis and even death this problem is called decompression sickness dcs or the ºbendsº the total atmospheric pressure and the time one is exposed to this pressure are interrelated variables that affect the amount of nitrogen dissolved in the body tissues the related risk of developing dcs and the need for decompression treatment upon reaching the surface in general body tissues are considered to have absorbed the maximum amount of nitrogen after exposure to pressurized atmosphere for 24 hours therefore personnel preparing to escape from pressurized submarine may already be saturated with nitrogen during the escape procedure personnel are rapidly exposed to higher pressures as the rescueescape trunk pressure is equalized with the surrounding sea pressure this will increase the amount of nitrogen in the body even more during the ascent to the surface the escapee will experience rapid decompression which may lead to the development of dcs the ascent rate when using the steinke hood is 1295 meters per minute 425 feet per minute to minimize the risk of developing dcs upon reaching the surface the elapsed time from initial trunk pressurization until exit of the last escapee must be as short as possible an allowable bottom time chart is posted in each trunk the maximum allowable exposure times listed on the chart apply to escape from an unpressurized submarine in general all escapees should exit the trunk as soon as possible after the trunk is pressurized 5944422 effects of rapid pressurization on the ears as the trunk is flooded and pressurized the rapid increase in air pressure may cause discomfort to the ears of individuals in the trunk an escapee who is unable to equalize the ear pressure may feel some pain this condition is temporary and must not be allowed to delay the escape procedure in extreme cases the eardrums may rupture escapees should continue the escape procedure and exit the trunk within the allowable bottom time limits despite any discomfort to their ears failure to do so may result in much more serious injury as result of dcs ruptured eardrum will cause shortterm physical discomfort but there is normally permanent damage unless the injury is left unattended 5944423 effects of increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the air pocket formed at the top of the rescueescape trunk after the trunk is flooded is relatively small unless this air pocket is ventilated breathing within the air pocket will increase the concentration of carbon dioxide to dangerous levels which could lead to asphyxiation as the rescueescape trunk is pressurized during the escape process even low concentrations of carbon dioxide in the air pocket can be hazardous since the body will tend to absorb more carbon dioxide as the pressure is increased 5944424 effects of increased concentrations of nitrogen on the body breathing inert gases at pressure can cause state of stupor or unconsciousness called narcosis the most common form is nitrogen narcosis nitrogen narcosis can occur while breathing compressed air at depth for example when conducting escape operations the narcotic effects of nitrogen will affect each individual differently varying with the depth at which the individual is located or thes9086t9stm010ch594r1 415 pressure of the air the individual is breathing the effects may first be noticed at depths greater than 100 feet of seawater fsw and will become more pronounced at depths greater than 150 fsw the symptoms of nitrogen narcosis include confusion impaired judgement sense of wellbeing or euphoria slower reaction time and reflexes lack of concentration and difficulty in reasoning remembering what to do remembering what has already been done and making accurate observations someone developing nitrogen narcosis may show signs such as loss of judgment or skill false feeling of wellbeing and tingling and numbness of the lips gums and legs the ability to concentrate and reason may become impaired affected individuals may be unable to follow instructions or perform simple tasks this may affect their ability to properly perform the steps necessary for escape there is specific treatment for nitrogen narcosis to alleviate its effects individuals must be removed from the pressurized environment or brought to shallower depths where the effects are not felt 594443 general steps taken when preparing to escape the following general steps are ordinarily taken when preparing to escape the submarine through the rescueescape trunk using the submarine escape appliance 1 all available hand lanterns and flashlights along with the rubber life raft are assembled in the access compartment below the rescueescape trunk 2 the support systems for the trunk are aligned and operating per the applicable ship system manual 3 the portable bubble skirt if applicable is installed inside the trunk 4 personnel put on extra clothing heavy socks and watch caps for protection from exposure after reaching the surface they button up their shirts turn up their collars and tuck their pant legs into their socks they remove shoes and leave keys coins and any other items that will weigh them down warning if wearing the escape appliance with the hood on before exiting the trunk the escapee shall breathe through the snorkel valve and mouthpiece to avoid buildup of carbon dioxide in the hood 5 personnel don adjust and properly test the submarine escape appliance as described in paragraph 594423 6 if available divers depth gage can be used to monitor the internal pressure of the disabled submarine dissub by knowing the dissubs internal pressure and depth figure 59411 can be used to monitor the probability that survivors will develop dcs upon reaching the surface 7 the dissubs roll and pitch angles should be verified the roll and pitch angle at which the dissub is resting can affect how far the upper access hatch will open during the escape process where the remote upper access hatch operating mechanism permits such as on ssbn 726 class submarines the crew below the trunk in the access compartment should help to open the upper access hatch during the escape 8 all personnel should familiarize themselves with the escape procedure and with the features of the rescueescape trunks9086t9stm010ch594r1 416 594444 general procedure for buoyant freebreathing method of submarine escape the following section provides general outline of the sequence of events that occurs when using the trunk and the submarine escape appliance for individual escape detailed procedures are contained in the applicable ship system manual note that the following general procedure refers to the portable bubble skirt which is not used on ssn 637 class and earlier submarines also the procedure does not refer to side escape hatches which are on rescueescape trunk designs that use three hatches such as those on ssn 637 class and earlier submarines see figure 59444 warning the trunk flood valve is to remain shut until the lower access hatch is closed and dogged to prevent inadvertent flooding of the access compartment 1 the trunk is drained and vented and the upper hatch cavity drain should be blown to clear any debris that may prevent rapid flooding of the trunk warning the trunk shall be ventilated with fresh air to prevent carbon dioxide from building up in the air bubble while personnel are in the trunk and breathing through the snorkel valves 2 one or two individuals enter the trunk wearing the deflated submarine escape appliance and breathing through the snorkel valve using the mouthpiece 3 the lower access hatch is shut and dogged after the escapees are in the trunk the trunk is ventilated with fresh air for approximately 1 minute to prevent the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air bubble from reaching toxic levels 4 the timer is set to agree with the time shown on the allowable bottom time chart for the depth indicated on the sea pressure gauge in the trunk 5 the escapees connect the escape appliances to the air charging manifold the valve that controls air to the manifold is left shut and the valves that control air to the charging hoses are opened 6 the escapees undog the upper access hatch and verify visually that the hatch locking ring lugs are centered between the trunk coaming lugs 7 the escapees flood the trunk to the bubble line inscribed in the trunk or to the lower edge of the portable bubble skirt if the disabled submarine is not at 0 degrees pitch and 0 degrees roll 8 the trunk is ventilated with fresh air for at least 15 seconds to prevent the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air bubble from reaching toxic levels 9 the trunk vent valve is closed 10 the charging valve manifold isolation valve is opened to allow the escape appliances to completely charge as the trunk is pressurized the appliances are completely charged when air passes through the buoyancy chamber pressure relief valves and into the hoods9086t9stm010ch594r1 417 warning to prevent developing dcs upon reaching the surface escapees shall exit the trunk as soon as possible after the trunk is pressurized and before the applicable time on the allowable bottom time chart is exceeded 11 the mechanical timer is started at the same time trunk pressurization begins the trunk is rapidly pressurized the upper access hatch will open as the trunk pressure equalizes with sea pressure and the rest of the trunk opposite the portable bubble skirt will fill with seawater 12 the pressurization of the trunk is secured when the upper access hatch opens 13 to begin the ascent to the surface the escapee exhales completely then takes deep breath and holds it the snorkel valve is shut and the mouthpiece is removed from the mouth the escape appliance is disconnected from the charging manifold and the escapee should start to breathe normally from the air volume in the hood the escapees should exit the trunk as soon as possible to avoid exceeding the allowable bottom time 14 the escapees duck under the skirt one at time and exit the trunk by passing through the upper hatch the last man out signals using the 31mc circuit or by hammer taps that the escapees have exited the trunk if the hammer is used it should be secured to the inside of the trunk before exiting not dropped to the bottom of the trunk if the hammer is dropped to the bottom of the trunk it may foul the lower access hatch and prevent it from opening warning failure to forcibly exhale during the entire ascent to the surface may cause an air embolism resulting in death 15 upon exiting the trunk the escapees extend their hands above their heads and clasp their thumbs together to help guide themselves to the surface and to avoid debris and other survivors during the ascent the escapees should forcibly exhale to ensure that pressure does not build up in their lungs the escapees can shout ºhohohoº as way to continually exhale during the ascent 16 upon reaching the surface the snorkel valve is opened and the escapees should breathe through the mouthpiece more air can be added to the escape appliance by using the oral inflation device survivors should stay together to be more visible to search and rescue personnel it is much easier to locate group of individuals in the water than single person survivors should use the toggle lines on their escape appliances to tie themselves together whistles should be used to signal approaching ships and personnel marker lights should be used at night to signal search and rescue personnel individuals should take turns using their seadye markers to make their location more visible from the air 17 if an inflatable raft is available any injured survivors should be placed in it and the rest of the survivors should hang onto the sides the inflatable raft should be sent to the surface last 18 death from hypothermia is major concern for survivors on the surface the body loses heat about 24 times faster in water than in air of the same temperatures9086t9stm010ch594r1 418 the effects of hypothermia are immediate and rapidly disabling hypothermia can occur in water as warm as 22 degrees c 72 f survivors should keep their hoods on and their heads out of the water to minimize heat loss through the head survivors should not swim swimming increases the loss of body heat survivors should maximize body contact by grouping together as much as possible hugging one another and intertwining their legs 19 if alone survivor should assume the heat escape lessening posture help position to cut heat loss from the head chest and groin to assume the help position the head should be kept out of the water and the legs should be pulled up to the chest and held in place by wrapping the arms around the knees 20 after waiting at least 1 minute after receiving an indication that the last man is leaving the trunk or 1 minute after the elapsed bottom time has expired the upper access hatch is shut from inside the submarine using the remote hatch operating mechanism 21 the trunk is vented and drained from inside the ship 22 when the trunk is empty and the trunk pressure equals the pressure in the access compartment the lower access hatch is opened for the next escape 23 the rescueescape trunks flood blow vent and drain cycles can be controlled from inside the access compartment if necessary see the applicable ship system manuals for more informations9086t9stm010ch594r1 51 section 5 submarine escape training 59451 submarine school 594511 general the submarine escape appliance is so simple in design and operation that its proper use can
