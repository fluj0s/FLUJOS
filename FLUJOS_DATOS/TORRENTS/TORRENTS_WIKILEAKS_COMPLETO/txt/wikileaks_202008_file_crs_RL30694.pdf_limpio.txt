criminal cases its use and capabilities have increased substantially since it was first introduced in the late 1980s that growth has led to the emergence of the following issues that were considered by the 106th congress in legislative initiatives elimina ting the nationwide backlog of unanalyzed dna samples expanding the kinds of offenders who are profiled providing opportunities for postconviction testing of dna evidence and continuing development of forensic science capabilities dna profile may provide powerful evidence in many criminal investigations either to incriminate or exculpate suspect dna evidence is very stable and can be extracted and profiled from sample many years after being deposited the technologies used are increasingly sensitive powerful fast and costeffective the cost of performing analyses and the time required continue to decline those features of the technology are likely to continue to improve over the next decade in 1994 congress enacted the dna identification act which provided for the establishment by the fbi of national index called codis of profiles of dna from convicted criminals and from crimescene evidence search of the index may match crime with known offender or with another crime all 50 states now require collection of dna samples from certain categories of offenders including persons convicted of sexual felonies however dna samples from offenders and crime scenes have accumulated in many states more rapidly than forensic laboratories can process them for entry into codis more than 700000 convictedoffender samples awaited processing at the end of 1999 in fy2000 and fy2001 congress appropriated funds to help address the backlogs and some states have also provided funding several bills in the 106th congress would have provided additional funds hr 4640 was enacted pl 106546 and authorizes 170 million over four years states vary in the types of crimes for which they collect dna samples for inclusion in databases several have broadened the offenses that qualify proponents argue that expansion will help solve crimes because offenders often commit more than one kind opponents argue that qualifying offenses should be limited only to crimes for which dna evidence is commonly used several bills in the 106th congress specified qualifying federal offenses for inclusion in codis and pl 106546 includes several crimes against persons and some property crimes dna evidence has helped exonerate more than 60 wrongfully convicted persons in many cases dna technology was not available or not sensitive enough to produce usable results at the time of trial and legal and other barriers exist to postconviction testing in many instances some states have established statutory right to postconviction dna testing and several bills in the 106th congress also addressed aspects of that issue although none were enacted aspects addressed included the time period during which testing would be permitted the degree to which evidence must be exculpatory how long it should be preserved whether exonerated persons should receive compensation and the degree to which states would be encouraged or required to provide postconviction testing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694contents introduction 1 features of dna evidence 1 prior federal law 2 legislative issues 4 sample backlogs 4 kinds of

forensic tool that can aid investigators in many criminal cases its use and capabilities have increased substantially since it was first introduced in the late 1980s that growth has led to the emergence of the following issues that were considered by the 106th congress in several legislative initiatives eliminating the nationwide backlog of unanalyzed dna samples specifying the kinds of dna profiles that should be included in law enforcement databases providing opportunities for postconviction testing of dna evidence and continuing development of forensic science capabilities this report discusses those and related issues and the legislation proposed and enacted to address them it begins by describing provisions in prior federal law and then discusses issues and the legislation proposed including the enacted dna analysis backlog elimination act of 2000 hr 4640 which became pl 106546 features of dna evidence dna profile may provide powerful evidence in many criminal investigations either to incriminate or exculpate suspect as with many kinds of forensic evidence profile from sample whose source is not known but may be suspected is compared to one whose source is known usually the suspect in such case if the two profiles do not match the suspect cannot be the source of the evidence if the profiles match the suspect may be the source of the evidence or the match might be coincidental the likelihood of coincidental match depends on how common that profile is among other people the characteristics of dna permit an expert to provide an estimate of that likelihood usually in the form of probability if the estimated probability is very small jury or judge might reasonably conclude that the suspect is indeed the source of the evidence other key characteristics of dna evidence are that it is very stable and can be extracted and profiled from sample many years after being deposited provided that the sample is stored appropriately that evidence can be extracted from many kinds of biological tissues including saliva hair tears and bone fragments and that the technologies used are increasingly sensitive powerful fast and costeffective usable dna can now be extracted from very small samples such as drop of blood the size of pinhead profile can yield probability of coincidental match of less than onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs2 1for

crs report rl30717 for more information on federal programs relating to dna identification in billions or even trillions and the cost of performing analyses and the time required continue to decline those features of the technology are likely to continue to improve over the next decade1 dna evidence also has significant limitations it is not pertinent and is unlikely to be deposited in many kinds of cases such as much nonviolent crime even for cases where it is present it might not be relevant if for example the identification of the perpetrator is not in question there might be more than one victim or perpetrator in which case the dna from different persons may be mixed making analysis much more difficult also the dna may be contaminated degraded in storage improperly collected or handled or tested inappropriately even with those limitations however dna evidence is an extraordinarily and increasingly important forensic tool prior federal law recognizing the great potential utility of dna evidence congress enacted the dna identification act of 1994 108 stat 2065 hereinafter called the dna act as part of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 1033222 the dna act established the dna identification grants program 42 usc 3796kk authorized through fy2000 to help state and local governments develop and improve their ability to analyze dna evidence and it authorized use of drug control and system improvement grants for similar purposes 42 usc 3751 those grants are part of the edward byrne memorial state and local law enforcement assistance programs3 the dna act provided for the establishment by the fbi of national index of profiles 42 usc 14132 the law authorized inclusion of profiles from convicted criminals from samples recovered from crime scenes and from unidentified human remains however it did not specify the crimes covered and did not specifically authorize collection of dna from convicted persons the consolidated appropriations act of 2000 pl 106113 additio nally provided for an index of profiles from samples voluntarily contributed from relatives of missing persons the resulting system of local state and national indexes is called codis combined dna index system the systems national index maintained by the fbi is called ndis national dna indexing system law enforcement agencies usually use codis in one of two ways if

also established requirement 42 usc 3753a12 3796kk2 14132b that participating laboratories meet qualityassurance and proficiency testing standards and permit access to dna samples and analyses only i to criminal justice agencies for law enforcement identification purposes ii in judicial proceedings if otherwise admissible pursuant to applicable statutes or rules iii for criminal defense purposes to defendant who shall have access to samples and analyses performed in connection with the case in which such defendant is charged or iv if personally identifiable information is removed for population statistics database for identification research and protocol development purposes or for quality control purposes section 811 of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 110 stat 13121313 hereinafter called the antiterrorism act authorized the expansion of codis to include federal crimes or those committed in the district of columbia although it did not specify particular offenses that would qualify the act also author ized the fbi to provide grants to states including the district of columbia to help them ensure that their dnatyping capabilities were compatible and integrated with codis and to develop computerized identification systems and automated fingerprint identifications systems that were similarly compatible with fbi systems to be eligible for any of those grants state was required to collect for analysis dna samples from each person convicted of felony of sexual nature eligibility did not however specifically require that those samples be analyzed section 102 of the crime identification technology act of 1998 pl 105521 112 stat 1871 established the state grant program for criminal justice identification information and communication authorized through fy2003 grants can be awarded for broad range of activities to among other things improve state capabilities in crime identification and promote compatibility and integration among local state and federal identification systems and including accreditation and certification programs relating to dna analysis those laws in conjunction with other factors have been very successful in increasing the use of dna evidence all 50 states now require collection of dna samples from sexual felons as stipulated in the antiterrorism act and many from other categories of offenders making profiles from those samples available for criminal identification purposes through codis hundreds of thousands of samples have been collected from convicted offenders nationwide and codis has assisted in hundreds of criminal investigations also over the past five years congress has appropriated more than 60 million to help state and local dna laboratories according to the bureau of justice statistics funding requests received from those laboratories have exceeded available appropriations4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs4 4continued special report ncj 179104 february 2000 2 available at

forensic science service annual report and accounts 19992000 25 july 2000 httpw wwforensicgovukforensiccorporateannual_repannual_report2000pdf 2021legislative issues the success of dna evidence and its increasing sophistication have led to the emergence of the four issues listed at the beginning of this report sample backlogs expansion of coverage in codis postconvic tion testing and support for forensic science those issues and legislative proposals that address them are discussed below sample backlogs for the past few years dna samples have been accumulating in many state and local jurisdictions more rapidly than forensic laboratories can process them for entry into codis the laboratories usually do not have the resources to process all samples quickly and they must prioritize those they receive with the highest priority usually being given to cases going to trial and those where suspect has been identifi ed in some instances released offenders have committed additional crimes that might have been prevented had the laboratories been able to process their dna more quickly kinds of backlogs the backlogs consist of hundreds of thousands of samples from convicted offenders and thousands of samples from cases for which there are currently suspects that does not include owed samples those that have not yet been collected of which there may be similar numbers in addition as states expand the crimes covered see below the backlog may well increase as of december 1999 only 35000 of the 750000 samples collected from offenders nationwide had been reported as profiled using the most uptodate dna markers nevertheless since its inception as pilot program in 1990 codis has aided in more than 1100 investigations nationwide5 by comparison britains national forensic dna database holds approximately 700000 profiles and has matched crimes to suspects more than 75000 times since its inception in 19956 there is also another kind of backlog resulting from improvements in forensic dna technology many thousands of samples must be reanalyzed because the profiles they yielded currently in many state and local dna indexes are based on an older dna technology called vntr or rflp technology and cannot be compared with those created with the newer str technology that has become the ndishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs5 7vntrs variable number of tandem repeats are kind of genetic marker that varies greatly from person to person and so can be used to help identify individuals rflp restriction fragment length polymorphism refers to the method by which vntrs are processed strs short tandem repeats are genetic markers that are not as variable as vntrs but have other advantag they are processed using pcr polymerase chain reaction technology although dna technology continues to advance the current str standards are expected to remain in place for several years see national commission on the future of dna evidence the future of dna testing predictions of the research and development working group national institute of justice ncj 183697 november 2000 available at httpwwwojpusdojgovnijpubssum183697htm 8analyzing dna to produce profile is often called dna typing 9 national commission on the future of dna evidence recommendation of the national commission on the future of dna evidence httpwwwoj pusdojgovnijdna codisrchtml 16 january 2000 standard7 use of strs permits faster typing from much smaller amounts of dna than vntrs it is also less expensive although conversion costs can be high failure to process backlogs may have several consequences crimes that might be solved with the help of database match may remain unsolved that is of particular concern in cases where perpetrator is likely to perform additional crimes or where wron gly accused person might otherwise be cleared by dna evidence also crimescene samples from unsolved crimes may eventually be destroyed permanently eliminating any possibility of analyzing any dna evidence cost of backlog elimination the cost of processing backlogs can be difficult to estimate because of variability in the circumstances involved the backlog of convictedoffender samples is much larger than the casework backlog however convictedoff ender samples are much less costly to process typing8 can be largely automated and outsourced costs may be substantially reduced if samples can be outsourced to private laboratories and analyzed in large batches but costs may be significantly higher if samples must be processed in small numbers or by government forensic laboratories for example in states with relatively small backlogs casework generally cannot be automated and can cost thousands of dollars per case whether or not it is outsourced such estimates do not include the costs of any new infrastructure that might be required for example if laboratory needs to convert from vntr to str technology commission established in 1997 by attorney general reno has examined the backlog problem and other issues the national commission on the future of dna evidence hereinafter called the dna commission recommended that grants be used to rapidly eliminate the backlog that common set of str markers and quality assurance standards be adopted by laboratories and that privacy issues be addressed with regard to outsourcing of samples9 the dna commission estimated that approximately 4500 00 convictedoffender samples had yet to be processed at the time of this recommendation and that 260000 needed conversion from vntr

state the judiciary and related agencies crs report rl30509 11 january 2001 13data on backlogs are from an fbi survey cited in adams statement 14see the section on legislation below for descriptions of individual billsstr profiles the commission also estimated that if samples were outsourced profiling would cost about 50 per sample with current technology10 combining the figures above yields an estimate of approximately 35 million to eliminate the convictedoffender backlog however that is likely to be low because of infrastructure needs and other costs as well as the variability mentioned above it also does not take into account owed samples or unprocessed casework according to the bureau of justice statistics publicl funded forensic laboratories reported backlog of 6800 unprocessed cases for 1997 alone11 funding options in appropriating funds for the department of justice for fy2000 pl 106113 and fy 2001 pl 10655312 congress specified backlog elimination as one use of the 30 million designated each of those years for state and local dna laboratories in fy2000 the office of justice programs allocated half of that funding to address the backlogs some states with large backlogs notably virginia 191750 convictedoffender samp at the end of 199913 california 132000 florida 55100 and illinois 15500 have also allocated millions of dollars in state funds to address them several bills introduced in the 106th congress authorized funding specifically to eliminate the backlogs those introduced during the first half of the first session provided 30 million to address the convictedoffender backlog hr 2810 s 254 s 899 s 90314 which had also been the first kind of backlog examined by the dna commission those introduced later provided from 60 million to 170 million over two or more years to address both the convictedoffender and casework backlogs hr 3087 hr 3375 hr 4640 h r 5000 and s 3130 one bill s 2859 provided 100 million over four years for the casework backlog only all those bills required that applicants satisfy quality assurance standards other conditions included using stateoftheart typing methods and providing privacy protections by restricting access in manner similar to that specified in the dna act as described earlier in this report hr 2810 hr 3087 hr 3375 s 254 s 899 s 903 s 2859 and s 3130 required the department of justice to develop plan to eliminate the backlogs addressed in the bills hr 4640 and hr 5000 required states requesting funds to develop individual plans hr 3375 gave preference to addressing the casework backlogs hr 3375 and s 3130 also required that all workhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs7 15 see adams statement for summary of qualifying offenses in all 50 states as of march 2000 on convictedoffender backlogs be outsourced to private laboratories the other bills either did not specify the kind of laboratory hr 2810 hr 3087 s 254 s 899 s 903 or explicitly permitted the use of either public or private laboratories hr 4640 hr 5000 the cost of eliminating backlogs depends substantially on economies of scale in fy2000 grants for backlog elimination were awarded to individual states which were then each responsible for processing the samples states with small backlogs would have higher persample costs those costs could be reduced significantly if samples could be pooled for processing one way of doing that is through voucher system as provided for in hr 4640 and hr 5000 whereby states send samples to private laboratory approved by the us attorney general that approach can also reduce state administrative costs and provide more uniform quality assurance pl 106546 the dna analysis backlog elimination act of 2000 hr 4640 hereinafter called the backlog elimination act was enacted at the end of the 106th congress it authorizes 45 million in grants over three years to address the convicted offender backlog and 125 million over four years to eliminate casework backlogs it requires that states receiving grants specify qualifying crimes for inclusion in codis and develop individual plans for eliminating the backlogs it permits the use of private laboratories and vouchers includes qualityassurance and privacy requirements and contains other provisions discussed later in this report see below for discuss ion of hearings and other legislative activity on bills discussed above profiles to be included in codis there were two main issues before the 106th congress with respect to profiles included in convictedoffender databases the kinds of offenses that should qualify for inclusion and authorization of sample collectio n from offenders those issues and bills that addressed them are discussed below qualifying offenses before enactment of the backlog elimination act federal law did not specify offenses except as discussed earlier with respect to sexual felonies states vary in the crimes for which they collect dna samples for inclusion in databases qualifying offenses include at minimum felony sex crimes but others specified by different states include murder offenses against children assaul t and battery kidnapping robbery and burglary and some states include all felonies15 many collec t samples from juveniles convicted of qualifying offenses most collect retroactively from incarcerated convicts and some collect from those previously paroled or on probation in britain samples can be collected from anyone suspected of recordable offense any crime punishable by imprisonment plus certain other specified offenses and their profiles added to the national dna database the profile is removed if the person is acquitted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs8 16states enacting such legislation in 2000 include arizona colorado florida georgia iowa new jersey south carolina south dakota and west virginia others where such legislation was considered but either failed or is pending include alaska california connecticut hawaii kentucky mississippi new york north carolina ohio and washington 17as of december 2000 20000 additional profiles and 100 additional hits had been added to the figures cited here virginia division of forensic science dna databank statistics httpwwwdcjsstatevausforensicdna_2000_graphhtm 10 january 2001 18source dr paul ferrara director virginia division of forensic sciences communication with author 28 august 2000 see also house committee on the judiciary dna analysis backlog elimination act of 2000 106th cong 2nd sess 2000 hrept 106900 part 1 24 34 the report also cites similar figures for florida ibidseveral states enacted legislation in 2000 that broadens the offenses that qualify and several others considered such legislation16 one argument often made in favor of such expansion is that offenders often commit more than one kind of crime for example burglary may be precur sor to violent offense such as rape while definitive studies appear to have been done to test that view available evidence does seem to support it for example suspects in more serious crimes have sometimes been identified after being typed in conjunction with lesser offenses also an examination of virginia data through june 2000 yielded the following results the state dna database which contained more than 115000 profiles of convicted persons at the time had yielded more than 180 hits matches between crimes or between persons and crimes since 199317 virginia profiles those convicted of any felony offense about half of the casetooffender hits identified would have been missed if the database were limited to violent offenders also nearly half the violent crimes solved with the help of the database were perpetrated by persons who had previous propertycrime convictions18 some argue that qualifying offenses should be limited only to those such as violent crimes for which dna evidence is directly relevant one concern is whether broadening the list of qualifying offenses is costeffective in comparison to other approaches to solving crime whether it is will depend on factors such as the cost of dna typing and the hit rate how often person typed for nonviolent offense will be matched to another crime for example if profile cost 50 and the hit rate were one out of 100 profiles then the cost per hit would be 5000 such costs will likely continue to decline as the technology improves another concern relates to protection of individual rights and privacy both of profiled person and family members for example unlike fingerprints dna sample contains much more information than that used in making the identification it contains persons entire genetic code and much of that code will be identical in close blood relatives related concern is that specific dna sequences from markers currently used for profiling might in the future be found to contain additional information such as an association with genes relating to disease or other conditions however the access restrictions that apply to codis 42 usc 14132b discussed above are intended to provide protections against such broader uses several bills introduced in the 106th congress listed specific qualifying offenses for inclusion in codis

that are equivalent to serious violent felonies hr 4640 also specified certain violent crimes and other felonies committed on american indian lands before enactment of the backlog elimination act federal law did not restrict the categories of qualifying offenses although the lack of specific authority to collect samples see below meant that persons had been profiled in codis as result of

contained several differences from the bill as introduced including increased funding for elimination of both convictedoffender and casework backlogs increased flexibility in how funds can be used for

certain sexual offenses offenses relating to peonage or slavery robbery burglary those and certain other offenses committed on american indian lands and attempts or conspiracy to commit covered offenses postconviction dna testing one use of dna evidence that has gained substantial prominence is to help exonerate wrongfully convicted person in criminal investigations where dna evidence is used it has been reported to exclude initial suspects in approximately onequarter of cases21 if the dna profile of suspect does not match that from an evidence sample the suspect cannot be the source of the evidence in many instances that means that the suspect cannot have perpetrated the crime even if other evidence such as eyewitness testimony is incriminating for many cases especially those that were tried before the mid1990s dna technology was not available at the time of the trial in others the technology that was available was not sensitive enough to produce usable profiles from the evidence in more than 60 cases wrongfully convicted persons have subsequently been exonerated through the application of modern dnaidentification techniques in some of those cases the dna analysis

such wrongful convictions are of particular concern in cases where sentence of death was imposed and concerns about some deathpenalty cases has tended to amplify the attention paid to the potential importance of postconviction dna testing however as of january 2001 there were cases where person had been shown through dna evidence to have been wrongfully executed difficulties in obtaining postconviction testing attorney general reno established the dna commission specifically in response to 1996 national institute of justice report on postconviction testing23 in 1999 the commission issued report on postconviction testing that included recommendations to prosecutors defense counsel the judiciary victim assistance units and laboratory personnel24 the report discussed the difficult legal issues often raised by postconviction testing and pointed out that postconviction requests for testing do not fit well into existing procedural schemes or established constitutional doctrine25 however it did not speci fically address possible legislative solutions but the commission did consider model legislation separately see below several factors may make postconviction testing difficult in many cases first few states permit motions for new trial based on newly discovered evidence more than three years after conviction which is the current federal limit fr crim p 33 and in most the time period is less than one year there are several reasons for such limits among them that the value and reliability of testimony and other evidence often diminishes over time however dna evidence if properly collected and stored is very stable and can often be analyzed with probative results many years after it was initially deposited many cases of postconviction exoneration have in fact involved tests done several years after the trial also as result of improvements in the technology dna evidence has become and may continue to become more rather than less probative with the passage of time second factor is that the evidence containing dna will often already be in the possession of the government it is not therefore what would normally be considered new evidence third factor is that dna testing of casework samples can be expensive and many of the prisoners who might seek it are indigent fourth policies on the preservation of evidence vary among jurisdictions and in some the evidence in case may be destroyed after appeals are exhausted in such cases opportunities for testing would be lost state laws some states have established statutory right to postconviction dna testing in 1994 new york amended state law to authorize such testing for dna evidence secured in connection with the trial if there is reasonablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs12 26a prima facie case is one that on its own merits is adequate to prevail unless the opposition specifically presents evidence to disprove it orans dictionary of the law httpwwwlawofficecompathfindoransoransasp 27this is known as the generalacceptance standard for scientific evidence or frye test from the 1923 case frye v united states 293 f 1013 in which the standard was first articulated the main alternative to frye is known as the soundmethodology or daubert test from daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals 113 sct 2786 broader and less restrictive standard based on the federal rules of evidence that was prescribed by the us supreme court in 1993 in considering motion for postconviction dna testing court would rely on such standards to determine whether to allow the use of any new dna technology that might be requested nonfederal jurisdictions vary in the standards they use and the standards are continuing to evolve probability that the results of such testing had they been admitted at the trial would have led to verdict more favorable to the defendant cpl sec 440301a however testing is available only to defendants convicted before january 1 1996 since 1998 illinois 725 ilcs 51163 has permitted postconviction testing for evidence secured in relation to the trial but which was not tested because the particular technology requested by the petitioner was not available at that time the defendant must present prima facie case26 that identity was at issue in the trial and the evidence to be tested has been subject to chain of custody sufficient to establish that it has not been substituted tampered with replaced or altered in any material aspect additional requirements are that the result of the testing has the scientific potential to produce new noncumulative evidence materially relevant to the defendant s assertion of actual innocence and the testing employs generally accepted scientific method27 illinois separately enacted legislation 725 ilcs 51164 in june 2000 extending the length of time that the state must retain physical evidence after conviction delaware sb 329 enacted similar statute effective september 2000 which however provides time limit on motions of 3 years after conviction tennessee hb 2490 enacted similar statute effective july 2000 that applies only to capital murder cases an arizona law on postconviction testing ars sec 134240 became effec tive in july of 2000 it is very similar to model statute drafted by the dna commission it applies to cases where evidence that is related to the investigation or prosecution and that may contain dna is in the possession or control of the court or the state is in condition that allows dna testing and was not previously tested or was not subjected to the testing that is now requested and that may resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing testing is mandatory if reasonable probability exists that the petitioner would not have been prosecuted or convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained and it is discretionary if reasonable probability exists that either it will produce exculpatory evidence or the verdict or sentence would have been more favorable to the petitioner if the results had been available at the trial in the latter case the petitioner may be required to pay for the testing the law also permits appointment of counsel for indigent petitioners evidence must be preserved during the pendency of the proceeding and sanctions can be imposed for intention destruction the law also provides for obtaining elimination sampl from third parties in the event that postconviction testhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs13 28dna commission postconviction dna testing 39excludes convicted person as the source of the dna evidence elimination samples may be needed to determine if the source was known third party such as consensual sex partner or codefendant rather than an unknown perpetrator28 california law sb 1342 that became effective in september 2000 permits convicted person who is incarcerated to request dna testing it requires testing if the court finds the followi ng the evidence to be tested is available in testable condition has been subject to sufficient chain of custody and has not been tested or would yield more discriminating or probative results with the testing requested identity was or should have been at issue in the case the convicted person makes prima facie showing that the evidence is material to the identity of the actual perpetrator or accomplice or certain other facto rs the results would raise reasonable probability that the verdict or sentence would have been more favorable to the convicted person had the results been available at trial the testing employs generally accepted scientific method and the request is not simply delaying tactic the court may also consider evidence that was not introduced at the trial the law also permits the state to pay for testing and to appoint counsel for indigent petitioners biological evidence from criminal case must be retained while anyone remains incarcerated in connection with the case unless the government first provides notice and an opportunity to request dna testing the law will remain in effect through 2002 some other states also enacted legislation in 2000 relating to postc onviction testing for example law passed in oklahoma permits indigent persons convicted of felony offense to request dna test from the oklahoma indigent defense system resulting claims of factual innocence are then presented to the appropriate prosecutorial agencyfactual innocence requires the defendant to establish by clear and convincing evidence that reasonable jury would have found the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt in light of the new evidence 22 13711 the law stipulates that persons who are not incarcerated are not required to provide samples in contrast to the arizona laws provision on elimination samples also washington state enacted law shb 2491 authorizing postconviction dna testing for convicted persons who are sentenced to life imprisonment or death if the dna evidence was not admitted into evidence because it did not meet acceptable scientific standards or the testing technology was not sufficiently developed to test dna in the case requests are submitted to local prosecutors who review them based on the likelihood that the dna evidence would demonstrate innocence on more probable than not basis connecticut pa 0080 now permits at any time motion for new trial based on dna evidence that was not discoverable or available at the time of the original trial current federal legislation there are currently federal laws that specifically provide for postconviction dna testing however several bills providing for it or addressing related issues were introduced in the 106th congress legislative provisions in those bills address several questions altogether can previously obtained evidence be submitted to testinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs14 should the chain of custody for the evidence be factor should retesting of evidence with newer technology be permitted must the evidence be potentially exculpatory for what time period should postconviction testing be permitted should the government be require d to preserve evidence that might contain dna how should testing and counsel be paid for should exonerated persons receive compensation should the provisions apply to states those questions and the provisions addressing them are discussed below evidence previously obtained potential gap in current legal procedure was identified by the dna commission in many cases any testing that might be done would be on materials that had been obtained as part of the original investigation which is arguably not new evidence ensuring that wrongfully convicted person has fair opportunity to prove actual innocence might require legislation to provide specifically for testing such materials most of the bills addressing postconviction testing applied only to evidence that was previously obtained the kind of evidence specified varied somewhat some applied to evidence that was specifically secured in relation to the trial hr 3233 s 1700 or to the investigation or prosecution hr 4980 hr 5000 s 3130 that resulted in conviction while others applied more broadly to evidence that is related to the prosecution s 2859 or to the investigation or prosecution hr 4078 hr 4167 s 2690 those alternatives could be subject to different interpretations by courts one bill referred to new postconviction dna evidence hr 4162 applied only to death penalty cases and provided the opportunity to produce any exculpatory dna or similar evidence which was not available to that individual at the time of the trial that resulted in the sentence of death s 2463 also applied only to death penalty cases it did not provide specifically for postconviction testing but rather for the establishment of national commission on the death penalty the commission would examine several topics including procedures to ensure that persons sentenced to death have access to forensic evidence and modern testing of such evidence including dna testing when such testing could result in new evidence of innocence retesting in some cases dna typing might not have been performed at all during the original investigation or trial and in others it might have been done but proved inconclusive one issue associated with the possibility of retesting using newer technologies is how useful the results are likely to be for example the result of the original test might have been inconclusive because there was too little dna to produce usable profile with the technology used in such case retest with more sensitive technology might show that the dna did not come from the person convicted of the crime if the dna could have come only from the true perpetrator such as in many rape cases then the person convicted could not have committed the crime alternatively the original test might have yielded strong identifying evidence such as coincidentalmatch probability of one in billions in that case new testhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs15 would be very unlikely to provide results favorable to the defendant another possibility would be that the dna in the evidence did not come from the convicted person but nevertheless was not exculpatory for example as tests become more sensitive it is increasingly possible that dna from persons unconnected with the crime will be found as is often the case with fingerprints several bills would have permitted the typing of evidence that was available at the trial but not tested for dna or that was originally analyzed with older dna technology some limited retesting to situations where the technology was not previously available hr 3233 s 1700 hr 4980 s 3130 others provided for retesting where new techniques could provide reasonable likelihood of more accurate and probative results hr 4078 hr 4167 s 2690 hr 5000 required that the evidence not have been subject to the testing that is being requested s 2859 required that retesting be able to resolve an issue that previous testing did not hr 3233 required that the testing to be done use method generally accepted within the relevant scientific community potential for exculpation most public attention has focused on the use of dna evidence to demonstrate actual innocence of the crime for which person was convicted because he or she was mistakenly identified such as through eyewitness testimony one issue is whether postconviction testing should apply only to such cases or more broadly for example had dna evidence been introduced at trial it might in some cases have led to lighter sentence however there is also concern that such broadening could lead to meritless claims that would waste resources the bills that were introduced in the 106th congress took several different approaches to this issue requiring that test results could potentially produce evidence that is new noncumulative and materially relevant to the assertion of innocence hr 3233 s 1700 is noncumulative exculpatory and relevant to the claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing hr 4078 hr 4167 s 2690 if favorable reasonable finder of fact would have found the applicant guilty beyond reasonable doubt or would result in mandatory sentence reduction hr 4980 or would assuming exculpatory results establish innocence of the crime for which the person was convicted or of uncharged conduct in cases where that would lead to mandatory sentence reduction hr 5000 and s 3130 one bill s 2859 provided like the arizona statute for both mandatory and discretionary testing testing would be mandatory if the court found reasonable probability that the requester would not have been prosecuted or convicted if the results of the test had they been available were exculpat ory it would be discretionary if there were reasonable probability that the outcome of the prosecution or sentencing would have been more favorable to the requester some bills further required that requests for testing be made to demonstrate actual innocence rather than to delay punishment s 2859 hr 5000 s 3130httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs16 29connors convicted by juries 12 30the chain of custody of piece of evidence is the complete history of its possession from the time it was originally received orans dictionary of the law httpwwwlawoff ice compathfindoransoransasp also some required that identity was an issue at the trial that resulted in conviction hr 3233 hr 5000 s 1700 s 3130 the requirements placed on the petitioner also varied some required petitioner to present prima facie showing that identity was at issue hr 3233 hr 5000 s 1700 s 3130 and that the chain of custody was sufficient hr 3233 s 1700 or that results if exculpatory would establish actual innocence hr 5000 s 3130 some required the petitioner to specifically identify the evidence to be tested and to present theory of defense hr 5000 s 3130 some also contained provisions for assessing penalties in response to perjurious applications hr 5000 s 3130 time limits the stability of dna means that it can provide usable profiles even after several years as has been demonstrated in many cases of postconviction exoneration rule 33 of the federal rules of criminal procedure currently permits motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence within three years of the verdict study sponsored by the national institute of justice29 found that for 28 convicted persons who were later exonerat ed through dna testing the average length of time served was almost 7 years however as the technology becomes increasingly available and sophisticated over the next few years the potential utility of providing for postconviction testing long after the original trial may decrease substantially especially for previously obtained evidence some bills did not specify time limits during which convicted person may petition for analysis of dna evidence hr 3233 hr 4162 hr 4980 s 1700 some expressly permitted such petition at any time s 2859 or at any time after convict ion hr 4078 hr 4167 and s 2690 two took different approach providing for postconviction testing during the 30 months after becoming law hr 5000 s 3130 chain of custody the integrity of the custody chain30 for evidence to be tested is vital to ensuring accurate results if it is not properly maintained after conviction the evidence could be compromised also if evidence has not been properl stored any dna present might have deteriorated and not produce usable results some bills specifically required that the evidence was subject to sufficient chain of custody hr 3233 hr 5000 s 1700 s 3130 others required that evidence be in the actual or constructive possession of the government hr 4078 hr 4167 s 2690 or in the possession hr 5000 s 3130 or possession or control s 2859 of the government or the court one required that evidence be in good enough condition to permit testing s 2859 several also had specific provisions relating to evidence preservation evidence preservation the stability of dna evidence and its demonstrated ability to exonerate wrongfully convicted person even several yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30694crs17 31cited in connors convicted by juries 4951after conviction raise the question of whether provisions should be made specifically to preserve evidence that might contain dna otherwise the evidence might not be stored in way that preserves dna or it might be destroyed while convicted person is still incarcerated for the crime in at least one case31 evidence that had been slated for destruction was instead tested and proved exculpatory some bills required that the government preserve evidence that might contain dna while convicted person remains incarcerated unless it first provides notice and an opportunity to request dna testing hr 4078 hr 4167 s 2690 s 2859 one required that reasonably necessary steps be taken to preserve such eviden ce during incarceration hr 4980 others prohibited destruction for 30 months after enactment of the legislation in cases in which the convicted person is incarcerated and identity was at issue during the trial hr 5000 s 3130 some did not explicitly address the issue of evidence preservation hr 3233 hr 4162 s 1700 s 2463 costs casework can cost several thousand dollars per case to analyze and many convicted persons who might request such analyses are indigent such persons would not likely be able to pay for testing or to afford counsel several bills provided for gover nment payment for indigent federal convicts of the costs of dna tests hr 4078 hr 4167 hr 4980 hr 5000 s 2690 s 2859 s 3130 and provision of counsel hr 4078 hr 4167 s 2690 s 2859 s 3130 some also required states receiving byrne formula grants to provide counsel in capital cases and provided grants to help provide such defense services hr 4078 hr 4167 and s 2690 compensation according to the dna commission only 14 states and the district of columbia provide for compensation to wrongfully convicted persons the maximum award under federal law is 5000 28 usc 2513 some bills increased the maximum award for unjust conviction and imprisonment to 100000 if the person was sentenced to death and 50000 per year for other cases hr 4078 hr 4167 and s 2690 they also required that states requesting federal assistance for the constru ction of correctional facilities provide procedures whereby person wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death could collect damages application to states only few states currently provide specifically for postconviction dna testing as discussed above the adoption of provisions in federal law could provide an impetus for states to implement similar procedures also federal law could include specific guidelines or granteligibility requirements to encourage states to adopt such procedures in addition some proponents of postconviction dna testing argue that there are constitutional grounds for making it available in state courts some bills applied only to federal courts and would have amended title 18 of the us code dealing with federal criminal procedures hr 3233 hr 4980 s 1700 hr 5000 s 3130 others would have amended the federal judicial code in title 28 hr 4078 hr 4167 s 2690 s 2859 and contained provisions encouraging states to provide postconviction dna testing by

there is reasonable probability that favorable result could establish that the person was wrongfully convicted or sentenced hr 4078 hr 4167 and s 2690 one bill would have imposed moratorium on both federal and state executions until postconviction procedures were established that met the standards laid out in the bill hr 4162 hearings both the senate committee on the judiciary june 13 2000 and the house subcommittee on crime of the committee on the judiciary june 20 held hearings on postconv iction testing witnesses at both hearings included state attorneys general district attorn eys defense lawyers and persons who had been exonerated by postconviction dna testing concerns expressed by some witnesses about federal legislation on postconviction testing included the possibility of prolonging the appeal process unnecessarily producing additional trauma for victims and their families interfering with state sovereignty by forcing changes to established state procedures and the potentially high costs and other impacts of testing and related activities including preservation of evidence some noted that the impacts of such factors will depend on the breadth of the standards that are established for perm itting motions for postconviction testing that abuse and erroneous exoneration is less likely with narrower standards other witnesses held that postconviction testing can ensure the integrity of the judicial process without placing undue burdens on it and that federal legislation is required to ensure that testing is available with appropriate standards in all states bills specifically addressing the issues discussed in this section were enacted in the 106th congress however the backlog elimination act contains provision indicating the sense of congress that grants to states for forensic science should be conditioned on the provision of postconviction dna testing by those states and that congre ss should work with states to ensure that defendants in capital cases have competent counsel other issues funding from fy1996fy1999 congress appropriated more than 30 million for dna identification grants authorized through fy2000 under the dna act the

programs separate office of science and technology which would assume the functions of the current office of science and technology at the national institute of justice its duties would include research and development of dna technologies statutes of limitations the stability of dna evidence has led to exoneration in some cases several years after conviction that same stability also raises the possibility of identifying perpetrators years after crime has been committed even after the statute of limitations for crime has expired that has led some states to consider extending statutes of limitations for some crimes and it has led prosecutors in some cases to seek john doe indictments of unknown persons based on the dna profiles obtained from crimescene evidence36 the bills discussed
