memo to scm approvals committee copy from michael keeley date 2 march 2007 subject project brontos barclays capital summary 1 scm seeks approval to present project brontos to the milan branch of barclays bank plc milan branch 2 project brontos involves milan branch entering into repo with an italian counterparty the counterparty over profit participating instrument ppi issued by barclays entity in luxembourg 3 the counterparties identified for the transaction are unicredito italiano spa group unicredito and intesa sanpaolo spa group intesa it is envisaged that the transaction with unicredito would be try based transaction of up to 2500m and the transaction with intesa would be gbp based transaction of up to 1000m the transaction with unicredito may comprise of separate repos with up to three separate entities in the unicredito group 4 overall under project brontos the counterparty will make an investment with milan branch the counterparty achieves an enhanced pre tax return and will receive distributions which should be largely tax exempt while their funding costs and associated expenses should be fully tax deductible barclays benefit arises through sublibor funding from the counterparty 5 subject to approval of the transaction it has been agreed that scm will provide resource to the milan branch locally in order to facilitate the milan branchs origination management and execution of the trade for as long as is necessary 6 the version of the transaction outlined in this paper involves try denominated ppi and an associated currency hedge the unicredito version it is envisaged that intesa will enter into version ofthe transaction using ppi denominated in another currency gbp eur or usd intesa may or may not require currency hedging for such transaction 7 as part of the transaction barclays will represent that the payments under the ppi would benefit from the italian tax exemption in the hands of milan branch were they to be received by the milan branch ie had milan branch not transferred the ppi under the repo the counterparties benefit is dependent on the repo seller milan branch being able to satisfy this condition as such barclays would indemnify the counterparties for any loss of benefit as consequence of the representation not being satisfied see paragraph 121 the maximum loss that would arise if the representation was incorrect is 528m per annum per 1000m investment for the unicredito trade and 142m per annum per 1000m investment for the intesa trade you will see from the italian tax opinion in appendix 2 that based on our facts the representation should be satisfied 8 diagrams showing the transaction steps including ongoing flows and unwind are provided in the detailed description which begins on page 3 economic benefit 9 key financial data is set out below page 2 of 21 product limit per annum 150m of wht across all jurisdictions with the outstanding reimbursement due not to exceed 100m at any one

size of 1000m for the purposes of illustration and benefit split of 7030 prior to the cost of funding the tax reimbursement which will be borne by barclays in favour of the counterparty it is assumed that the transaction terminates within 12 months the assumed corporate tax rates in italy and the uk are 33 and 30 respectively 11 this paper contains description of all significant tax credit market and operational risks detailed description this description assumes tryeur spot rate of try2eur1 euribor 5 and try libor 20 where the following description refers to try amounts in practice these amounts will be settled in euros for the euro equivalent of the given try amount translated at the prevailing spot rate 12 an investment company subsidiary of bbplc which is tax resident in the uk barsub establishes wholly owned subsidiary in luxembourg with 25000 ordinary shares luxparent luxparent will be sarl 13 luxparent establishes wholly owned subsidiary in luxembourg with 20000 ordinary shares luxsub luxsub will also be sarl additional luxsub entities may need to be established for each transaction with different counterparty 14 luxparent will use the 5000 of cash it retains to meet initial expenses and places the remainder on deposit 15 luxparent and luxsub place the subscription proceeds on deposit 16 luxsub will enter into an agreement with luxparent whereby luxsub must seek written consent from luxparent before any issuance or transfer of any profit participating instruments eg ppi 1 in 2007 other trades are expected to use approximately 225m of the wht limit 2 note that the 2007 revenue will be proportion of this number dependent on the close date for the transaction this number does not include cost of collateral expected to be approx 15m pa 3 note that the 2007

barclays bank plc london head office utilises try2000m overdraft facility to make deposit with milan branch the milan branch try deposit 18 milan branch subscribes for try2000m ppi issued by luxsub with term of 20 years 19 milan branch is the legal and beneficial owner of the ppi the key features of the ppi are provided in appendix 1 uk bare trust 20 luxsub will establish uk bare trust the trust and uses the proceeds of the subscription in the ppi to settle it with try2000m 21 the trust will have three assets the portfolio the portfolio will be funded by 10m loan from bbplc to luxsub 22 the trust agreement will also provide for the trustee to invest in fourth asset in the form of short term ie less than 365 days try2000m deposit with head office the barclays try deposit page 4 of 21 23 further details of the trust are provided in appendix 1 24 head office uses the proceeds of the barclays try deposit to repay its try overdraft facility counterparty repo and cross currency swap 25 counterparty raises 1000m of new funding from the market or sources this from surplus cash 26 milan branch enters into cross currency swap the ccs4 with the counterparty with the following features 261 the maturity of the ccs is equal to the term of the counterparty repo 262 an initial exchange of principal under which the counterparty pays 1000m and milan branch pays try2000m 263 ongoing payments under which milan branch plays euribor interest euro spread and counterparty pays try libor interest try spread5 264 final exchange of principal under which counterparty pays try2000m and milan branch pays 1000m 265 all payments under the ccs will likely be settled in euros 27 milan branch now has 1000m of cash and places this on deposit with head office in line with its normal business practice the milan branch eur deposit 28 head office makes deposit of 1000m with the market the market eur deposit 29 shortly thereafter but on the same date that it enters into the ccs milan branch enters into sale and repurchase agreement with the counterparty over the ppi the counterparty repo whereby it sells the ppi and agrees to repurchase it on the next distribution payment date6 30 the counterparty repo will roll into repeat repo transaction on the same terms via repo confirmation under the master repo arrangements signed by both parties 31 the counterparty may also provide notice that it intends to enter into repeat repo transaction over instruments with different total principal amount see paragraph 45 32 the repurchase price under the counterparty repo will be calculated in accordance with the following formula7 repurchase price p i gd where p the purchase price i try libor try spread gd the amount of distributions under the ppi gross of luxembourg withholding tax levied at source 33 as the amount of the distributions paid on the ppi is subject to cap see appendix 1 12 the difference between the initial purchase amount and the repurchase price will be either zero or positive amount specifically the repurchase price will be greater than the purchase price by the amount of the spread on the interest leg of the repurchase price calculation 4 the version of the transaction outlined in this paper involves try denominated instruments and an associated hedge other versions of the transaction using instruments denominated in other currencies including gbp eur and usd which the counterparty may or may not require hedging are also envisaged this is likely to be the case in the intesa trade 5 since the spread under the repo is in try the ccs also swaps the try spread into eur spread 6 other versions of the transaction using instruments denominated in other currencies including gbp eur and usd may have repo with longer term 7 as an alternative the repo price could be equal to p above and the flows i gd may be settled via swap agreement which will constitute one contract together with the repurchase agreement furthermore the formula may include amounts representative of interest on reinvestment amounts where appropriate page 5 of 21 34 where required milan branch will make representation to counterparty under the counterparty repo that it would itself have been able to benefit from exempt income for italian tax purposes on the return paid on the ppi had it not entered into the counterparty repo 35 milan branch and counterparty may also enter into foreign exchange hedging arrangement for notional amount equal to the try amount of the withholding tax levied on the ppi distributions and which provides for sum to paid received by counterparty on any depreciation appreciation of try against eur from inception to the next distribution payment date alternatively milan branch may enter into independent hedging arrangement with the market luxparent forward 36 at the same time that the ppi is issued to the milan branch an issuance which has been approved by luxparent luxparent enters into an agreement to forward purchase the ppi or ppi issued by luxsub on similar terms the luxparent forward from barsub 37 the luxparent forward can be accelerated by either party in any situation in which there is an early unwind the luxparent forward will be accelerated and the ppi ultimately redeemed where there is an early unwind before distribution payment date the counterparty repo and ccs will also be accelerated 38 the forward sale will be at the try par value of the ppi with ongoing flows under which luxparent pays i and barsub pays nd where i try libor adjustment nd the amount of distributions under the ppi net of luxembourg wht 39 the adjustment to the payment of i will be equal to barclays benefit from the transaction barsub warrant 40 barsub will be granted an american style warrant barsub warrant by luxsub giving it the right but not an obligation to subscribe at fair market value for ppi identical in their terms to those issued by luxsub to the milan branch the barsub warrant will be exercisable at any time up to the maturity or shortly thereafter of the last repo transaction entered into with the counterparty over the relevant ppi the granting of the warrant will require the consent of luxparent 41 it is envisaged that barsub will exercise the barsub warrant in order that it be able to satisfy its obligation to deliver the ppi under the luxparent forward collateral 42 should collateral be required by the counterparty for entering into the counterparty repo milan branch will use the amounts otherwise invested in the milan branch eur deposit to enter into reverse repo with head office over suitable securities eg oecd government securities and charge these assets to the counterparty head office will use the amounts received from milan branch to make back to back reverse repo with the market transaction timing and structuring 43 the counterpartys usage of tax capacity is variable with movements in try libor 44 this is because the counterparty receives largely exempt distributions on the ppi and has deductible expense on the ccs both of which are linked to try libor 45 in order to address the variability of capacity usage it is intended that there should be flexibility in the notional size of the transaction over time the actual arrangements will be subject to discussions with the counterparties as to their preferences however potential arrangements include 451 dividing the total principal amount of the ppi into number of tranches with 3month roll date therefore at any given roll date counterparty would have the option to roll the counterparty repo over only some of the ppi issued at the inception of the transaction were this to happen the ppi tranches which were not repoed on given roll date would page 6 of 21 be sold to luxparent under an acceleration of the relevant forward sale and ultimately redeemed as such were try libor to increase counterparty would have the option to roll the counterparty repo over smaller number of genussschein tranches than that issued at inception likewise should try libor decrease counterparty would have the option to roll the counterparty repo over great number of ppi tranches than that issued at inception new tranches would be issued by luxsub to enable this 452 structuring the transaction on 12 month basis but adding early repurchase rights that can be effected by either party subject to the ccyeur exchange rate being outside of specified range where any early repurchase may at the election of the holder under the terms of the ppi trigger distribution under the ppi such that the transfer can be made on clean basis at the option of the counterparty 46 depending on the selected approach the other transaction arrangements will have to be amended accordingly for instance the counterparty repo may take the form of 12 month master agreement and including provision for repeat repo transactions with term equal to the period from one dividend payment date to the next or in the case of the first roll from issuance to the first dividend payment date the luxparent forward may be tranched with the possibility to effect the forward sale on the individual ppi tranches issued by luxsub 47 in any event luxsub will establish programme under which it can issue tranches of ppi to enable new issues via issuepricing supplement and new subscription agreement figure 2 interim

transaction try swap rate of 20 is used as basis for the calculation of benefit the benefit is calculated using tryeur forward exchange rates assuming quarterly payments under the genussschein note that the scm benefit is in try and therefore subject to fluctuation in the absence of entering into forward with the counterparty or other hedging arrangement which could result in the benefit being known amount of euros there is requirement for shortterm funding and thus costs associated with the creditreimbursement of prepaid luxembourg corporation tax this is because on the basis of the numbers presented in the table the fee received will be larger than the shortterm shortfall tax analysis uk tax analysis the uk treatment has been discussed with slaughter and may and will be confirmed in an opinion which will follow bbplc milan branch 67 the ppi which is debt agreement under civil law should be loan relationship within the meaning of s81 fa 1996 this is on the basis that there is creditor and debtor in relation to money debt and there is transaction for the lending of money page 11 of 21 68 the ppi will be connected party loan relationship and thus taxed on an amortised cost basis exchange gains and losses will be brought into account under s84a fa 1996 69 since milan branch initially subscribed for the ppi subsequently sells the instrument and ultimately repurchases it under the counterparty repo the counterparty repo should qualify as repo falling within section 730a icta 1988 and s737ac icta 1988 the repo which is expected to have repurchase price equal to par plus small spread factors in interest and manufactured overseas dividends mods which will be deemed to be paid for uk tax purposes under s737a icta 1988the mods are fully taxable and the interest and spread is relievable as an increase to the repurchase leg 70 as the spot sale and forward purchase are in try s730bb icta 1988 applies and brings into accounts exchange gains or losses under the loan relationships regime s730bb6 71 one technical point which arises on repo transactions involving loan relationships is the interaction of s97 fa 1996 and paragraph 15 schedule 9 fa 1996 the latter provision treats the repo spot seller as continuing to be party to the loan relationship and hence presumably accruing income on that loan relationship but s97 also deems manufactured interest received by the spot seller to be interest on loan relationship in practice this point obviously arises on all repos of debt instruments and does not appear to give rise to any double taxation on the same income the basis for this sensible approach seems to be that there is still only one item of income in the sellers accounts 72 there is reverse charge in respect of the mod on the basis that the ppi are loan relationships and therefore reg 2b of the si 19932004 mod regs applies 73 any profit or loss on redemption of the ppi will be brought into account in accordance with the loan relationship rules under fa 1996 74 the ccs is derivative contract within the meaning of the schedule 26 fa 2002 with debits and credits brought into account in line with the accounts bbplc head office 75 the luxsub deposit will be connected party loan relationship and taxed on an amortised cost basis exchange gains and losses will be brought into account under s84a fa 1996 76 the market deposit will be taxed as loan relationship under fa 1996 in line with the accounting treatment barsub 77 there are potentially different analyses of the forward sale over the ppi which has an embedded coupon swap on the one hand the forward sale is related transaction under s84 fa 1996 such that profits and losses arising from the agreement should be brought into account under the loan relationship rules under this approach the receipts and payments under the coupon swap would be viewed as income and expense incurred in the disposal of loan relationship if the try payments were disembedded from the purchase price and paid separately under the forward by barsub they could alternatively be treated as manufactured interest payments under s97 fa 1996 78 on the other hand if and to the extent that the above payments are not brought into account under the fa 1996 regime the forward sale could be analysed as derivative contract governed by schedule 26 fa 2002 under this approach the tax treatment would again follow the accounting position page 12 of 21 79 whether the receipts and payments under the forward sale are brought into account under the loan relationships regime the derivative contracts regime or both it seems possible for the loan relationships regime to apply to one leg of the coupon swap and for the derivative contracts regime to apply to the other leg the overall result should be that the forward and coupon swap should be taxed in accordance with barsubs accounting treatment luxparent 80 the discussion below is premised on the basis that luxparents position must be analysed on the basis that it is uk tax resident based on the cfc assumptions in schedule 24 icta 1988 81 depending on the analysis adopted for barsub in respect of the forward and coupon swap luxparent will have symmetrical position taxed under the loan relationship regime andor the derivative contract regime 82 luxparent will also obtain creditreimbursement for an amount equal to the luxembourg wht paid by luxsub in respect payments on the ppi 83 the net position for luxparent should be flat before any spread as result of the expense under the coupon swap and the receipt together with tax creditreimbursement assuming the latter is taxable 84 it is envisaged that luxparent would pursue an adp 85 in any event there is motive to divert profits from the uk luxsub 86 under the assumption that luxsub is uk tax resident luxsub earns interest income on the barclays deposit via the bare trust and accrues an expense on the genusschiene loan relationship as such luxsub should be flat from tax perspective having an equal and opposite income and expense item 87 it is envisaged that luxsub would pursue an adp 88 in any event there is motive to divert profits from the uk treasury consentnotification 89 as the general consents do not apply to all the transactions which are contemplated notification under s765a icta 1988 will be required specifically 891 issue of ppi the general consents should apply as the issue is to bbplc for full consideration 3bii 892 barclays try deposit debenture is createdissued by nonuk resident 893 transfer of ppi by milan branch to barsub the general consents should apply as the transfer is between members of the uk resident group and 894 transfer of ppi to luxparent by barsub the general consents do not apply page 13 of 21 italian tax analysis the expected treatment has been discussed and agreed with freshfields milan and has been confirmed in an opinion which is attached herein see appendix 3 counterparty 90 the counterparty is subject to both ires the corporate income tax at 33 and irap the regional tax on productive activities at 425 91 subject to the next sentence the italian tax treatment of securities acquired under repo riporto or sale and repurchase agreement pronti contro termine is consistent with the accounting treatment it does not represent the acquisitiondisposal of the instrument and would not trigger capital gainslosses for the counterparty however under italian tax law the spot buyer is treated as the owner of any income received in respect of securities acquired under repo this principle has been reaffirmed by provision of law recently enacted art 219 of law decree 31006 n 262 converted into law by law 241106 n 286 92 the ppi qualify as instruments comparable to shares pursuant to art 442 of decree 91786 and will therefore benefit from the 95 exemption accorded by art 893 of decree 91786 93 under art 219 law decree 31006 n 262 an italian resident tax payer which acquires foreign equity securities under repo can rely on the 95 exemption from ires if the spot seller could have claimed the 95 exemption had it not disposed of the equity instrument in the form of repurchase agreement in this case counterparty should benefit from the 95 exemption because milan branch would have been able to claim the 95 exemption had it held the ppi 94 the deductibility of funding costs and any currency translation loss in relation to the repo which may arise where the repo is denominated in currency other than euros should not be impaired by the various provisions which have been recently enacted to limit the deductibility of costs and expenses 95 should the counterparty enter into currency swap to hedge the currency exposure arising from the counterparty repo against euro any currency gainslosses realised thereon should be taxabledeductible for italian tax purpose pursuant to the same rules which apply to the gainslosses realised on the hedged asset repo 96 italian withholding tax should be levied on the flows exchanged by milan branch and the counterparty under the currency swap should milan branch enter into similar currency swap with head office italian withholding tax should be imposed on the flows thereof 97 foreign tax credit for the counterparty should be available to the extent to which the distributions on the ppi are included in determining the taxable income of the counterparty for ires purposes ie 5 of the gross distributions milan branch 98 milan branch being the italian permanent establishment of foreign company is liable to both ires levied at the rate of 33 and irap levied at the basic rate of 425 with possible regional surcharges of up to an additional 1 as italian resident corporations 99 for italian corporate income tax purposes the taxable profit of the branch must be determined on the basis of specific profit and loss accounts iasifrs 100 the ppi will be shown as an asset and the counterparty repo will be reflected as liability in the branch accounts in the profit and loss of the branch the distributions on the ppi are accounted as positive item of income and the repo return being the algebraic sum of repo price differential less the distributions on the ppi among costs and expenses in the branches tax computation an adjustment will be made to ensure that the dividends are not subject to tax in the hands of the milan branch corresponding to the principle in paragraph 91 upon transfer or redemption of the ppi at maturity of the transaction gainslosses will be taxablerelievable at the level of milan branch page 14 of 21 101 any gainslosses arising from the currency swaps entered into by the milan branch with the counterparty and its head office will be taxabledeductible for italian tax purposes 102 should there be any transfer or redemption of the ppi in the hands of milan branch in exchange for the payment of its market value milan branch should be exempt from italian transfer tax since this would be transaction between nonresident subject and subject formally authorised to carry out investment services in italy 103 the counterparty repo should not be subject to transfer tax vat nor imposta di registro stamp duty provided that the agreement is executed outside the territory of italy or by way of exchange of letters anti avoidance 104 it should not be possible to challenge the transaction under discussion under article 37bis of decree 60073 since the transaction should be based upon valid economic reasons the counterparty obtains an economic return before considering any tax element associated to trade which is higher than return available for comparable transactions and in any case material compared to the tax benefit at stake luxembourg tax analysis corporate income tax 105 luxparent should be regarded for luxembourg purposes as the beneficial owner of the ppi in luxsub if certain conditions are met the most important of which is that the luxparent hedge will attribute sufficient control risk and rewards over the ppi to luxparent luxparent should be treated as entitled to and taxable on the gross ppi distribution 106 luxsub should be treated as earning exempt income as result of the income deriving from permanent establishment for luxembourg purposes uk bare trust 107 the withholding tax on the ppi is required under luxembourg tax law as withholding tax on the payment of distribution on securitised profit participation instrument net wealth tax 108 from luxembourg tax perspective neither luxparent nor luxsub should have any net assets subject to net wealth tax 109 luxsub has net wealth tax base because the permanent establishment is respected for net wealth tax purposes ie the exemption from corporate income tax is followed for net wealth tax purposes capital duty 110 capital duty will be due and paid on the creation of luxparent and luxsub 111 capital duty should be due on the issue of the ppi creditreimbursement 112 any creditreimbursement due would be paid to luxparent following the finalisation of luxparents tax assessment in accordance with luxembourg law it is currently envisaged that reimbursement would be available within two months of the end of luxparents accounting period we are currently also exploring the possibility of receiving reimbursements on the basis of anticipated filings ie accelerated reimbursements within two months of each underlying periodic withholding tax payment in connection with payments under the instrument tax capacity 113 project brontos does not require the use of uk tax capacity 114 the transaction does not require any luxembourg capacity the luxembourg wht paid by luxsub should be treated as prepayment of corporation tax at the level of luxparent this is on the basis that luxparent should be beneficially entitled to the coupon paid by luxsub from luxembourg tax page 15 of 21 perspective and hence is treated as having borne the wht on the basis that luxparent has net taxable income equal to the spread paid to luxparent the prepayment less an amount representing tax on the spread is expected to be refunded shortly after the assessment period is closed consequently this transaction does not require any luxembourg tax capacity 115 overall the only tax capacity usage is by the counterparty in italy tax risk luxembourg tax 116 the luxembourg tax treatment will be confirmed in ruling from the tax inspector the ruling is confirmation of the application and interpretation of the law as its stands rulings are binding on the basis of the principle of good faith in luxembourg law and are not limited to tax law the effect of this principle is that where taxpayer has relied on ruling the tax treatment which the ruling confirmed is applied by the tax administration the principle of good faith is specifically included in the abgabenordnung tax administration law and has been confirmed in several court decisions in other areas of law 117 the rulings are binding where the taxpayer i submits written request ii discloses all relevant facts iii transacts in accordance with the facts set out in the disclosure and the iv law remains current on the basis that these conditions are met the ruling obtained in relation to the brontos structure is binding 118 the tax reimbursement itself would not be subject to ruling from the luxembourg tax inspector but it is expected that the inspector would confirm that all relevant tax and administrative provisions which are relevant to obtaining timely reimbursement are applicable to the facts set out before the inspector this confirmation would have the aim of providing comfort that the reimbursement and its timing would be made in line with our expectations 119 scm will ensure that the reimbursement due from the luxembourg tax authorities does not exceed 150m at any one time uk tax 120 the only uk tax risk is the risk that luxparent and luxsub could be treated as cfcs this is considered to be very small risk on the basis that both companies will pursue adps and in any event there is motive to divert profits from the uk italian tax 121 as described in paragraph 34 barclays will represent that the payments under the ppi would benefit from the italian tax exemption in the hands of milan branch were they to be received by the branch ie had milan branch not transferred the ppi under the repo the counterparties benefit is dependent on the repo seller milan branch being able to satisfy this condition as such barclays would indemnify the counterparties for any loss of benefit as consequence of the representation not being satisfied the potential risk to barclays of the representation is 528m per annum per 1000m investment for the unicredito trade and 142m per annum per 1000m investment for the intesa trade ie assuming that the counterparty is indemnified on grossedup basis for its expected level of profit from the trade it is envisaged that the transaction with unicredito would involve an investment of up to 2500m and the transaction with intesa would involve an investment of up to 1000m accounting 122 the analysis below in respect of the solus accounts of barsub bbplc and the consolidated accounts of bbplc has been confirmed with scm finance luxparent and luxsub accounting has been confirmed with kpmg luxembourg and will be agreed with pwc in

currencies the kpmg accounting analysis will be reviewed by pwc prior to execution of the transaction solus accounts luxparent page 17 of 21 143 luxparent will show the luxparent forward as derivative and will recognise the marktomarket movements in the profit and loss account reflecting payments on the ppi and try libor payments due to barsub solus accounts luxsub 144 since the primary asset and liability of luxsub are in try it is likely that the functional currency of luxsub for luxembourg gaap purposes will be try 145 the barclays try deposit will be recorded as an asset and accounted for at amortised cost 146 the portfolio will be recorded liability either as loans and receivables or if the assets are securities treasury bills or debt securities interest income under the portfolio will be accrued in the profit and loss account 147 the trs will be accounted for derivative and marked to market 148 the ppi will be shown as debt liability with expenses reflected in the profit and loss account 149 if contrary to paragraph 144 luxsub has euro functional currency specific rules dealing with foreign exchange translations will apply luxembourg gaap has specific rules dealing with value adjustments eg foreign exchange translations etc in respect of principal amounts the general principle is that losses are recognised in the pl when they are probable but gains are only shown in the pl when they are certain as result luxsub discloses any downward value adjustments linked to the try the corresponding value adjustment on the ppi or try deposit is an unrealised gain which has pl impact on the basis that the gain is not certain and could unwind during the life of the try deposit bbplc consolidated accounts 150 for consolidation purposes luxparent and luxsub will have eur functional currencies being an extension of scms european business 151 barsub luxparent and luxsub will be consolidated by bbplc as they are wholly owned and controlled by bbplc and bbplc is exposed
