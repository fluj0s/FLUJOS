it should be stressed that the arms ex port control act as amended the foreign assistance act of 1961 as amended and pr edecessor acts do not define such critical terms as internal security and legitimate selfdefense it remains for the president or the congress as the case may be to define the meaning of such terms as they may apply to the question of possible violati on by foreign country of an applicable agreement governing the sale of us defense articles or defense services presidential report to congress on possible violations section 3c2 of the arms export control act require s the president to report promptly to the congress upon the r eceipt of information that substantial violation described in section 3c1 of the aeca may have occurred this presidential report need not reach any conclusion regarding the possible violation or provide any particular data other than that necessary to illustrate th at the president has received information indicating specific country may have enga ged in substantial violation of an applicable agreement with the united states that governs the sale of us defense articles or services procedures for making foreign count ries ineligible for receipt of us defense articles and services should the presiden t determine and report in writing to congress or if congress determines by joint resolution pursuant to section 3c3a of the arms export control act th at substantial violation by foreign country of an applicable agreement govern ing an arms sale has occurred then that country becomes ineligible for further u s military sales under the aeca this action would terminate provision of credits loan guarantees cash sales and deliveries pursuant to previous sales the president could under section 3c3b of the aeca continue to permit cash sales and deliveries pursuant to pr evious sales by certifying in writing to congress that termination of such sales and deliveries would have significant adverse impact on united states security such presidential waiver could not be invoked however if congress under section 3c3a had adopted or were to adopt joint resolution finding that country ineligible the president retains the prerogative of vetoing any such join t resolution congress would then have to override the veto in order to impose its will congress also has the option of adopting regular legislation imposing varying grees of penalties upon any country for violations of the conditions of an applicab agreement regarding use of ussupplied defense equipment such legislation woul d also be subject to the veto process4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30982crs4 4 continued violation of its agreement with the united stat not to take such an action without prior consent from the us and therefore could be subject to the penalties provided for such violation set out in section 3 of the aeca see section 3a2 of the aeca where the re transfer prior consent obligation is set out 22 usc 2753 a2restoration of eligibility once country is made ineligible for sales or deliveries under the arms export control ac t provisions it can regain its eligibility only when 1 under section 3c4 of the act the president determines that the violation has ceased the viola tion which led to the status of ineligibility in the first place and 2 the country involved has give n assurances satisfactory to the president that such violation will not recur alternatively congress could pass regular legislation that would exempt the partic ular country from speci fic sanctions imposed through aeca procedures although that legi slation would be subject to presidential veto suspension or cancellation of cont racts andor deliveries by the united states it should be noted that the united states has additional options to prevent transfer of defense articles and serv ices for which valid contracts exist short of finding foreign country in violation of an applicable agreement with the united states authority for suspension of deliv eries or defense ite ms or cancellation of military sales contracts is f ound in sections 2b 42e1 and 42e2 of the aeca section 2b of the arms export control ac t permits the secretary of state under the presidents direction to among other th ings determine whether there shall be delivery or other performance regarding sa or exports under the aeca in order that the foreign policy of the unite d states is best served thereby section 42e1 of the arms ex port control act states that each contract for sale entered into under sections 21 22 29 and 30 of this act and each contract entered into under section 27d of the act shall provide that such contract may be canceled in whole or in part or its execution suspended by the united states at any time under unusual or compe lling circumstances if the national interest so requires section 42e2a of the arms expor t control act further states that each export license issued under section 38 of this act shall provide that such license may be revoked suspended or ame nded by the secretar of state without prior notice whenever the secretary deems such action to be advisable thus all governmenttogovernment agreem ents or licensed commercial contracts for the transfer of defense articles or defe nse services may be halted modified or terminated by the executive branch should it determine it is ppropriate to do so use of this authority does not prejudi ce the larger question of whether substantial violation of an applicable agreement governing use of us arms did in fact occur that question can still be answered affirmatively or negatively or left unanswered depending on how th president or the congress chooses to deal with it to date the president has ne ver taken the next step and actually

military equipment in its occupation of the falkland islands islas malvinas on april 2 1982 may have substantially violated the applicable agreements with the united states governing use of this equipment in his april 30 report assistan t secretary moore noted that in light of these circumstances the united states was suspending until further notice all deliveries to argentina of defense articles and services for which commitments were made prior to october 1 1978 other restrictions on military aid to argentina were already in place the reagan administration removed the suspension on september 24 1982 israel questions raised regarding the use of ussupplied military equipment by israel in lebanon in june and ju ly 1982 led the reagan administration to determine on july 15 1982 that israel may have violated its july 23 1952 mutual defense assistance agreement with the united states tias 2675 concerns centered on whether or not israel had used uss upplied antipersonnel cluster bombs against civilian targets during its military operations in lebanon and the siege of beirut5 the pertinent segment of that 1952 agreement be tween israel and the united states reads as follows the government of israel assures the united states government that such equipment materials or services as ma be acquired from the united states are required for and will be used solely to main tain its internal security its legitimate selfdefense or to permit it to participate in the defense of the area of which it is part or in united nations collective security arrangements and measures and that it will not undertake any act of aggression against any other state it should be noted that none of the critical terms such as internal security legitimate selfdefense or act of aggression are defined within this 1952 usisraeli agreement the house foreign affairs committee held hearings on this issue in july and august 1982 on july 19 1982 the reagan administration announced that it would

the israeli use of americansupplied military equipment in this raid may have constituted substantial violation of the applicable 1952 usisraeli ag reement as consequence and pending review of the facts of the case the president chose to exercise the authority set forth in sections 2 b and 42e1 of the arms export control act to suspend for the time being the shipment of four f16 aircraft that had been scheduled for delivery to israel as the result of this decision the subsequent delivery of 10 f16 and 2 f15 aircraft to israel was also suspended however on august 17 1981 the reagan administration lifted its suspension on deliveries to israel and all of the planes were transferred on two other occasions april 5 1978 and august 7 1979 the carter administration chose to find that the is raelis may have violated their 1952 agreement with the united states through the use of americanorigin military equipment in operations conduc ted in lebanon however the us did not suspend or terminate any israeli arms sales credits or deliveries in either of these cases in two notable instances questions concerni ng the improper use by israel of us weapons were raised but the president
