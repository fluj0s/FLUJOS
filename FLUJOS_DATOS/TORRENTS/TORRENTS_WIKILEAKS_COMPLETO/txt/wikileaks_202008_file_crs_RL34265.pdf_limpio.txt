prices concerns over global climate change and the desire to promote domestic rural economies have greatly increased interest in biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the us transportation sector biofuels most notably corn ethanol have grown significantly in the past few years as component of us motor fuel supply et hanol the most commonly used biofuel is blended in nearly half of all us gasoline at the 10 level or lower in most cases however current biofuel supply only repres ents about 4 of total gasoline demand while recent proposals have set the goal of significantly expanding biofuel supply in the coming decades questions rema in about the ability of the us biofuel industry to meet rapidly increasing dema nd current us biofuel supply relies almost exclusively on ethanol produced from midwest corn in 2007 24 of the us corn crop was used for ethanol producti on to meet some of the higher ethanol production goals would require more corn th an the united states currently produces if all of the envisioned et hanol was made from corn due to the concerns with significant expansion in cornbased ethanol supply interest has grown in expanding the mark et for biodiesel produced from soybeans and other oil crops however significant in crease in us biofuels would likely require movement away from food and grain crops as feedstocks other biofuel feedstock sources including cellulosic biomass are promising but technological barriers make their future uncertain the energy independence and secur ity act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 requires everlarger amounts of biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch including sugarcane oil crops nd cellulose and promotes the development of these fuels eisa requires the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels annually in 2022 of which only 15 billion gall ons can be ethanol from corn starch the remaining 21 billion gallons are to be socalled advanced biofuels the previous rfs the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 required the use of only 75 billion gallons in 2012 increasing to an expected 86 billion gallons in 2022 of which only 250 million gallons of cellu losic biofuels would be required issues facing the us biofuels industry include potential agricultural feedstock supplies the associated market and environmental effects of major shift in us agricultural production the energy supply needed to grow feedstocks and process them into fuel and barriers to expanded infrastructure needed to deliver more and more biofuels to the market key question is whether renewable fuel mandate is

the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa in many cases the definition of advanced biofuel includes matu re technologies and fuels that are currently produced in large amounts for example the eisa definition of advanced biofuel includes ethanol from sugarcane despite the fact that brazilian sugar growers have been producing fuel ethanol for decades eisa define s advanced biofuels as biofuels other than ethanol derived from corn starch possible fu els include biodiesel from oil seeds ethanol from sugarcane and ethanol from cellulosic mate rials including nonstar ch parts of the corn plant such as the stalk selected issues related to an expansion of the renewable fuel standard rfs introduction high petroleum and gasoline prices concerns over global climate change and the desire to promote domestic rural economies have raised interest in biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the us tran sportation sector biofuels most notably cornbased ethanol have grown significan tly in the past few years as component of us motor fuels nearly half of all us gasoline contains some ethanol mostly blended at the 10 level or lower howe ver current supply represents only about 4 of annual gasoline demand on volume basis and only about 3 on an energy basis in 2006 the united states consum ed roughly 5 billion gallons of biofuels mostly ethanol this 5 billion gallons was blended into roughly 65 billion gallons of gasoline total annual gasoline c onsumption is roughly 140 billion gallons recent proposals including president bu shs goal in his 2007 state of the union address aim to expand biofuel s upply significantly in the coming decades the presidents goal would be to expand consumption from 5 billion gallons in 2007 to 35 billion gallons in 2017 while this proposal included not just biofuels but alternative fuels in general including fuels from coal or natural gas it would likely mean significant growth in biofuels production over the next 10 years other legislative proposals would require signif icant expansion of biofuels production in the coming decades some proposals would require 30 billion gallons of biofuels alone by 2030 or 60 billion gallons by 2050 the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 require s the use of 36 billion gallons in 2022 including 21 billion gallons of advanced biofuels1 the law limits ethanol from corn starch to 15 billion gallons beginning in 2015 current us biofuel suppl relies almost exclusively on ethanol produced from midwest corn table 1 other fuels that play smaller role include ethanol from brazilian sugar biodiesel from us soybeans and ethanol from us sorghum significant increase in us biofuels would likely require movement away from food and grain crops for example us ethanol producti on in 2006 consumedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34265crs2 roughly 20 of the us corn crop if only corn is used expanding ethanol production to 35 billion gallons would requi re more corn than the united states currently produces which would be infeasib corn and other grains have myriad other uses and such shift would have dr astic consequences for most agricultural markets including grains since corn w ould compete with other grains for land livestock since the cost of animal feed would likely increase and land since total harvested acreage would likely increase in addition to agricultural effects such an increase in cornbased ethanol would likely affect fuel costs since biofuels tend to be more expensive than petroleum fuels energy supply natural gas is key

in the united states is ethanol produced from us corn4 approximately 65 billion gallons of ethanol were produced in the united states in 2007 mostly from corn other domestic feedstocks for ethanol in clude grain sorghum and sweet sorghum imported ethanol 435 million gallons in 2007 is usually produced from sugar cane in brazil ethanol is generally blended into gasoline at the 10 level e10 or lower ethanol can be used in purer forms such as e85 85 ethanol and 15 gasoline in vehicles specially designed for its use lthough e85 represents less than 1 of us ethanol consumption after ethanol

adva nced biofuels is limited to ethanol derived from sugar and biodiesel previously the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 required starting in 2006 the use of 40 billion gallons of renewable fuel in gasoline increasing to 75 billion in 2012 although the rfs has been called an ethanol mandate there is explicit re quirement to use ethanol although there are specific requirements for the use of bi odiesel and other renewable fuels it is expected that in the early years the va st majority of the rfs will be met using ethanol produced from corn starch rfs as public policy the expansion in the rfs could have significant policy implications issues include questions of energypetroleum security pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions agricultural co mmodity and food market effects land use and conservation and infrastruct ure costs proponents nd opponents of mandated biofuel use both claim that an rf s would promote or run counter to the general public interest on several different policy front s for example supporters of an rfs claim it would serve several public policy interests including reduced investment risk by gu aranteeing demand for projected period such risk would otherwis keep significant investment capital on the sidelines enhanced energy security via th production of liquid fuel from renewable domestic source resulting in decreased reliance on imported fossil fuels the us currently imports over half of its petroleum twothirds of which is consumed by the transportation sector and enhanced environmenta l benefits nontoxic biodegradable etc critics of an rfs have taken issue with many specific aspects of biofuel production and use but general public policy criticism of the rfs is that by picking the winner policymakers may excl ude or retard the velopment of other potentially more preferable alternative energy sources5 they contend that biofuels are given huge advantage via billions of dollars of annual subs idies which distort investment markets by redi recting venture capital and ot her investment dollars away from competing alternative energy sources instead these critics have argued for more technology neutral policy such as carbon tax capandtrade system of carbon credits or floor pr ice on imported petroleum the expanded rfs defined this report examines the specific issues regarding the implementation of an extended rfs as contained in the

issues the us ethanol industry has shown rapid growth in recent years with national production increasing from 18 billion gallons in 2001 to 65 billion in 2007 this rapid growth which is projected to continue for the foreseeable future has important consequences for us and in ternational fuel f eed and food markets corn accounts for about 98 of the feedst ocks used in ethanol production in the united states usda estimates that 32 billi on bushels of corn or 24 of the 2007 corn crop will be used to produce et hanol during the september 2007 to august 2008 corn marketing year6 as of february 22 2008 existing us ethanol plant capacity was reported 82 billion gallons per year with an additional capacity of 52 billion gallons under construction7 thus total annual us ethanol production capacity in existence or under construc tion as of february 22 2008 was 134 billion gallons this production capacity exceeds the 130 billion gallon supply required in 2010 by eisa the current pace of plant construction suggests that annual cornfor ethanol use will likely require more than 4 billion bushels in 2008 and approach or possibly exceed 5 billion bushels by 20108 in 2007 us corn production was record 131 billion bushels the ethanoldriven surge in corn demand has been associated with sharp rise in corn prices for exampl the futures contract for march 2007 corn on the chicago board of trade rose from 250 per bushel in september 2006 to contract high of over 416 per bushel in january 2007 rise of 66 although record us corn harvest eased upward pressure on corn prices

their annual agricultural baseline reports project corn prices to remain well above 300 per bushel through 2016 compar ed with an average farm price of 215 during the previous 10year period 19972006 this sharp rise in corn prices owes its origins largely to increasing corn demand spurred by the rapid expansion of corn based ethanol production capacity in the united states since mid2006 the rapid grow th in ethanol capacity has been fueled by both strong energy prices and variet of government incentives regulations and programs major federal incentives include tax credit of 51 cents to fuel

cellulosic ethanol much of the advanced biofuels com ponent of the eisa rfs may be met by essentially any noncornsta rchderived biofuel ne ws reports often refer to cellulosic ethanol as nearing

washington dcbarrier to cellulosic fuel production is that production costs remain significantly higher than for corn ethanol or other alte rnative fuels currently various production processes are prohibitively expensive including physical chemical enzymatic and microbial treatment and c onversion of these feedstocks into motor fuel unintended policy incentives of th advanced biofuels mandate the uncertainty concerning cellulosic et hanol production raises the stakes for government mandate on its use if cellulosic ethanol pr oduction is unable to advance rapidly enough to meet the rfs mandate for noncornstarch ethanol then other unexpected biofuel sources may step in and fill the void such as domestic sorghumstarch ethanol whose production may expand across the prairie states and in other regions less suitable for corn production costly domestic sugarbeet ethanol or even costlier domesticbiodiesel production may be undert aken to fill the mandate or imports of brazilian sugarcane ethanol could expand potential benefits are vast ethanol and biodiesel produced from cellulosic feedstocks such as prairie grasses and fast growing trees or agricultural waste have the potential to improve the energy and envi ronmental effects of us biofuels while offering significant cost savings on the pr oduction side eg highyielding grown on marginal land perennial rather than nnual further moving away from feed and food crops to dedicated energy crops c ould avoid some of the agricultural supply and price concerns associated with corn ethanol as discussed later in this report key potential benefit of many cellulosic feedstocks is that many can be grown without chemicals reducing or elimina ting chemical fertiliz ers would address one of the largest energy inputs for cornb ased ethanol producti on using biomass to power biofuel production plant could furt her reduce fossil fuel inputs improving the net energy balance of ethanol would also reduce net fuelcycle greenhouse gas emissions although land use change has so been raised as potential cause of increased greenhouse gas emissions depending on the type of land used for the feedstock production cellulosic biofuel production uncertainties there are substantial uncertainties regarding both the costs of pr oduction for such feedstock as well as the costs of producing biofuel from them perennial crops are of ten slow to establish and can take several years before market able crop is produced crops heavy in cellulose tend to be bulky nd represent significant probl ems in terms of harvesting transporting and storing seasonality is sues involving the operation of biofuel plant yearround based on four or five month harvest period of biomass suggest that bulkiness is likely to matter great deal in addition most marginal lands ie the lowcost biomass production zones ar located far from major urban markets bringing the plant location choice versus ethanol transportation issue into

manufacturers likely would need to develop one pass harvesters that could collect and separate crops and crop residues at the same timefurthermore increases in peracre yi elds would be required to make most cellulosic energy crops for fuel produc tion economically competitive questions remain whether high yields can be achieved without the use of fertilizers and pesticides another question is whether th ere is sufficient feed stock supply available usda estimates that by 2030 13 billion tons of biomass could be available for bioenergy production including electricity from biomass and fuels from corn and cellulose14 from that enough biofuels coul d be produced to replace roughly 70 billion gallons of gasoline per year about 45 million barrels per da however this projection assumes significant increases in peracre yields and according to usda should be seen as an upper bound on what is possible further new harvesting machinery would need to be developed to guarantee an economic supply of cellulosic feedstocks15 in addition to the above concerns ot her potential environmental drawbacks associated with cellulosic fuels must be addressed such as the potential for soil erosion runoff and the spread of invasive species many potential biofuel crops are invasive species when intr oduced into nonnative localities in the near term the obvious choice of using corn stover to fuel

issues biofuels are not primary energy sources energy stored in biological material through photosynthesis must be converted into more useful portable fuel this conversion requires energy the amount and types of energy used to produce biofuels and the feedstocks for biofuel production are of key concern because of the input energy requirements the energy nd environmental benefits of corn ethanol particularly may be limited energy balance frequent argument for the use of ethanol as motor fuel is that it reduces us reliance on oil imports making the us less vulnerable to fuel embargo of the sort th at occurred in the 1970s howe ver while corn ethanol use displaces petroleum its overall effect on total energy consumption is less clear to analyze the net energy consumption of ethanol the entire fuel cycle must be considered the fuel cycle consists of all inputs and processes involved in the development delivery and final use of the fuel for cornbased ethanol these inputs include the energy needed to produce fertilizers operate farm equipment transport corn convert corn to ethanol and distribut the final product some studies find significant positive energy balance of 15 or

combustion review of research studies on ethanols energy balance and greenhouse gas emissions found that most st udies give cornbased ethanol slight positive energy balance of about 1216 if instead biomass was used to produce biofuels the energy balance could be improved it is expected that most biofuel feedstocks other than corn will require far less nitrogen fertilizer produ ced from natural gas furthe r if biomass were used to provide process energy at the biofuel refine ry then the energy balance could be even greater some estimates are that cellulosic ethanol could have an energy balance of 80 or more17 similarly high energy balances have been calculated for sugarcane ethanol and biodiesel an expanded rfs would certainly disp lace petroleum consumption but the overall effect on fossil fuel consumption is stionable especially if there is large reliance on cornbased ethanol eisa re quires an increasing amount of advanced biofuels resulting in reduced fossil fuel consumption relative to gasoline as the share of advanced biofuels grows this effect accelerates however by 2022 advanced biofuels will likel represent less than 10 of gasoline energy demand so the total amount of fossil energy displaced would be less than the expected growth in fossil energy consumption from passenger transportation over the same time period18 natural gas demand as ethanol production in creases the energy needed to process the corn into ethanol which is derived primarily from natural gas in the united states can be expected to increas for example if the entire 49 billion gallons of ethanol produced in 2006 used na tural gas as processing fuel it would have required an estimated 240 to 290 billion cubic feet cu ft of natural gas19 if the entire 2006 corn crop of 105 billion bushels were converted into ethanol the energy requirements would be equivalent to approximately 14 to 17 trillion cu ft of natural gas this would have represented about 6 to 8 of total us natural gas

by 202523 further as long as ethanol remains dependent on us agricultural supplies any threats to these supplies such as drought or increases in crop prices would negatively ffect the supply andor cost of biofuels in fact that happened in 1995 when high co rn prices due to strong export demand contributed to an 18 decline in ethanol production between 1995 and 1996 moreover expanding cornbased etha nol production to levels needed to significantly promote us energy security is likely to be infeasible if the entire 2007 us corn crop of 131 billion bushels were used as ethanol feedstock the resultant 35 billion gallons of ethanol 236 billion ga solineequivalent gallons geg would represent about 167 of estimated nati onal gasoline use of approximately 141 billion gallons24 in 2007 an

and alternative fuels use april 2007 farrell et althe specific definition of advanced biofuel affects the overall energy security picture for biofuels fo r example ethanol from garcane is allowed under an expanded rfs as in eisa this provides an incentive to increase imports of sugarcane ethanol especially from braz il the expanded rfs also provides an incentive for imports of biodiesel and other renewable diesel substitutes from tropical countries energy prices the effects of the expanded rfs on energy prices are uncertain if wholesale biofue ls prices remain higher than gasoline prices when all economic incentives are taken into account then mandating higher and higher levels of biofuels would likely lead to higher ga soline pump prices however if petroleum prices and thus gasoline prices rema in high the use of some biofuels might help to mitigate high gasoline prices current costs are so high for some biof uels especially cellulosic biofuels and biodiesel from algae that significant technological advances or even greater increases in petroleum prices are n ecessary to lower their production costs to make them competitive with gasoline without cost reductions mandating large amounts of these fuels would likely raise fu prices if price were placed on greenhouse gas emissions perhaps through the enactment of cap and trade bill then the economics could shift in favor of these fuels despite their high production costs as they have lower fuelcycle and lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions see below greenhouse gas emissions biofuels proponents argue that key be nefit of biofuel use is decrease in greenhouse gas ghg emissions however some question the overall ghg benefit of biofuels especially cornbased ethanol there is wide range of fuelcycle estimates for greenhouse gas reductions from cornbased ethanol however most studies have found that cornbased etha nol reduces fuelcycle ghg emissions by 1020 per mile relative to gasoline27 these estimates vary depending on several factors including the cultivation practice eg minimumtillage versus normal tillage used to grow the corn and the fuel used to process the corn into ethanol eg natural gas versus coal these same st udies find that biofuels produced from sugar cane or cellulosic biomass could reduce fu elcycle ghg emissions by as much as 90 per mile relative to gasoline however fuelcycle analyses generally do not take changes in land use into account for example if previously uncu ltivated pi ece of land is tilled to plant biofuel crops some of the carbon stored in th field could be rel eased

that this provision may not be relevant to large share of conventional ethanol since mu ch of the capacity to meet the 15 billion gallon cap is currently existing or will come from expansions of existing plants agricultural issues continued expansion of cornbased et hanol production could have significant consequences for traditional us agri cultural crop production and rural economies supporters of an expanded rfs claim that increased biofuels production and use would have enormous agricultural and ru ral economic benefits by increasing farm and rural incomes and ge nerating substantial rura l employment opportunities30 however largescale shifts in agricultu ral production activities will likely also have important regional economic c onsequences that have yet to be fully explored or understood as corn prices rise so too does the incentive to expand corn production either by expanding onto more marginal soil environments or by altering the traditional cornsoybean rotation that dominates corn belt agriculture this shift could displace other field crops primarily soybeans and other agricultural activities further corn production is among the most energyintensive of the major field crops an expansion of corn area would likely ve important and unw anted environmental consequences due to the increases in fertilizer and chemical use and soil erosion the national corn growers association estimates that us cornbased ethanol production could expand to between 128 and 178 billion gallons by 2015 without significantly affecting agricultural markets31 however as noted below other evidence suggests effects are already being felt in the current expansion in corn production food versus fuel many critics of federal biofuels subsidies and the rfs argue that

products because most food prices are largely determined by costs and profits after the commodities leave the farm34 basic economics suggests that the price of particular retail food item varies with change in the price of an underlying ingredient in direct relation to the relative importance in value terms of that ingredient for example if the value of wheat in 100 loaf of bread is about 10 then 20 rise in the price of wheat translates into 2 rise in loaf of bread as result of corns relatively small valueshare in most retail food product prices it is unlikely that the ethanoldriven corn price surge is major factor in current food price inflation estimates35 furthermore economists generally agree that most retail food price increases are not due to ethanoldriven demand increases but rather are the result of two major factors sharp increase in energy prices which ripples through all phases of marketing and processing channels and the strong increase in demand for agricultural products in the international marketplace from china and india product of their larg populations and rapid economic growth36 feed markets most corn grown in the united states is used for animal feed from 1995 through 2005 domestic feed use account ed for 58 of us corn use as cornbased ethanol production increases so do total corn demand and corn prices as result prolonged higher corn prices likely will have significant consequences for traditional feed markets and the lives tock industries hog cattle dairy and poultry that depend on those feed market s corn traditionally has represented about 57 of feed concentrates and processe d feedstuffs fed to animals in the united states37 persistently high feed costs will tighten profit margins and likely squeeze out marginal livestock producers because

rthermore not all livestock species are well adapted to dramatically increased consumption of ddgs in their rations dairy cattle appear to be best suited to expanding ddgss share in feed rations poultry and pork are mu ch less able to adapt also ddgs must be dried before it can be transported long distances adding to feed costs there may be some potential for largescale livestock producer s to relocate near new feed sources but such relocation likely would have important regional economic effects domestic food prices although corn primarily is used as livestock feed or for ethanol production it is also used wi dely as an ingredient albeit minor in many processed foods eg soft drinks snack foods and baked goods since corn prices are relatively small share of the pr ice of most retail f ood products their price impact is concomitantly small higher corn prices have their largest impact on meat prices the feedprice effect will first translate into higher prices for poultry and hogs which are less able to use alternate feedstuffs dairy and beef cattle are more versatile in their ability to shift to alternate feed sources but eventually sustained rise in corn prices will push their feed costs upward as well recent economic study estimated that 30 increase in the price of corn and associated increases in the prices of wheat and soybeans would increase egg prices by 81 poultry prices by 51 pork prices by 45 beef pri ces by 41 and milk prices by 2740 the effect on all food consumed was 11 increase 09 on athome food and 13 on awayfromhome food consumption thus the price impact of higher corn prices is small but important for most livestock products and probabl much smaller for most other retail food products the overall impact to consumers from higher food prices depends on the proportion of income that is spent on food since food costs represent relatively small share of consumer spending for mo st us households about 10 food price increases from whatever sour ce are absorbed relatively easily in the short run however lowincome consumers spend much greater proportion of their income on food than do highincome consumers their larger share

threat it poses to the countrys food security similarly humanitarian groups have expressed concer n for the potential difficulties that higher grain prices imply for developing c ountries that are net

the 200910 marketing year septemberaugust ethanols share of us corn production is expected to reach nearly 36 while the export share falls to 1346 f apri projections clearly suggest that higher corn prices will result in lost export sales it is unclear what type of market adjustments will occur in global feed markets since several different grains and feedstuffs are relatively close substitutes pricesensitive corn importers may quickly switch to altern ative cheaper sources of feed depending on the availability of supplies and the adapta bility of animal rations in contrast less

are issues involving biofuel distribution and infrastructure expanding ethanol production likely will strain the existing supply infrastructure further expansion of ethanol use beyond certain levels will require i nvestment in entirely new infrast ructure that would be necessary to handle higher and higher percentage of ethanol in gasoline if biomassbased diesel substitutes are produced in much larg er quantities some of these infrastructure issues may be mitigated distribution issues ethanolblended gasoline tends to separate in pipelines further ethanol is corrosive and may dama ge existing pipelines therefore unlike petroleum products ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline cannot be shipped by pipeline in the united states another issue with pipeline transportation is that corn ethanol must be moved from rural areas in the midwest to more populated areas which are often located along the coasts this shipment is in the opposite direction of existing pipeline transportation which moves gasoline from refiners along the coast to other coastal cities and into the in terior of the country while some studies have concluded that shippi ng ethanol or ethanolblende d gasoline via pipeline could be feasible major us pipeline has made the investments to allow such shipments52 thus the current distribution system for ethanol is dependent on rail cars tanker trucks and barges these deliver ethanol to fuel terminals where it is blended with gasoline before shipment via tanker truck to gasoline retailers however these transport modes lead to higher prices than pipeline transport and the supply of current shipping options especially rail cars is limited for example according to industry estimates the number of ethanol carloads has tripled between 2001 and 2006 and the number is expected to increase by another 30 in 200753 significant increase in corn based ethanol production would further strain this tight transport situation because of these distribution issues some pipeline operators are seeking ways to make their systems compatible with et hanol or ethanolblended gasoline these modifications could include coating the in terior of pipelines with

for terminal tanks tanker trucks re tail tanks pumps etc in addition epa would need to certify that the fuel will not lead to increased air quality problems there is also interest in expanding th use of e85 85 ethanol 15 gasoline current e85 consumption represents only bout 1 of ethanol consumption in the united states key reason for the re latively low consumption of e85 is that relatively few vehicles operate on e85 the national ethanol vehicle coalition estimates that there are approximately six million e85capable vehicles on us roads54 as compared to approximately 230 million gasoline and dieselfueled vehicles55 most e85capable vehicles are fle xible fuel vehicles or ffvs an ffv can operate on any mixture of gasoline and between 0 and 85 ethanol however owners of large majority of
