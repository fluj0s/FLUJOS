accuracy following section provides brief overview of nec fingerprint technology specifically the automated fingerprint identification system afis 341 nec afis fingerprint search accuracy necs afis unsurpassed fingerprint matching algorithm provides high accuracy and selectivity regardless of the database size and print quality utilizing the most robust set of fingerprint features this enhances significantly the chances for matching fingerprint against its file print counterpart regardless of whether the print is distorted or smudged many of our installed systems have been upgraded to increase the database capacity beyond the original design size while continuing to pass accuracy and throughput tests automated fingerprint identification is based on the matching of fingerprint minutiae such as ridge endings and ridge bifurcation as these minutiae are simple patterns it normally is quite easy to detect them and identify their relative position and direction as basis for matching ministry of internal administration department of registration of pe rsons develop supply install implement and maintain the requested software hardware and communication infrastructure for national identity card project enicncb001 section 3 proposed solution private confidential section 3 79 minutiae position and direction are influenced however by image distortion inherent in all fingerprints this makes position and direction by themselves insufficient for the identification of fingerprints and in this regard many current afis systems are found lacking as result nec found it necessary to introduce identification factors that are unaffected by distortion and thus consistently establish the relation between the minutiae of fingerprint in manual identification the fingerprint expert uses the number of ridgelines between minutiae for this purpose to incorporate these capabilities in an afis system nec has successfully developed and implemented relational encoding and matching alg orithm the relation is expressed by four ridge counts in this algorithm each ridge count is measured from the concerned characteristic to the closest identical characteristic within its relative quadrant in local coordinate system using this additional data relation significantly enhances the chances for matching fingerprint against its file print counterpart regardless of whether the print is distorted or smudged our patented ridge count detection system provides the most accurate fingerprint matching capability available the proof is in actual performance our customers identify millions of fingerprints each year this outstanding system performance is realized and continues even with larger databases this holds true for our customers whose average database size is triple that of other afis vendors nec has proven its systems ability to maintain performance even on older generation systems ministry of internal administration department of registration of

key points of this test are as follows the test is conducted by the national institute of standards and technology well known and independent testing authority the tes t is sponsored and supported by government and commercial authorities from all over the world including the us europe etc while eighteen 18 separate afis companies participated the important fact is that the big four namely nec sagem cogent and motorolaprintrak all participated it should be noted that the purpose of fpvte2003 was to test accuracy only it is not test of matching performance or cost of afis systems the results clearly showed nec as the world leader in afis accuracy plus established the fact that there is significant accuracy differences between the first placed vendor nec and those that came second and third in the forty four 44 large scale afis tests nec came first in forty 42 of the tests and second in the remaining t wo 2 tests in the seven 7 medium scale afis tests nec came first in six 6 of the tests and second in the remaining one 1 test necs overall accuracy rate for the large scale test of more than one billion fingerprint comparisons was an astonishing 9968 error rate of 100 9968 032 the second placed vendor scored 9902 error rate of 098 while the third placed vendor scored 9878 error rate 122 quick comparison of the error rates between the top three vendors shows that for every one 1 error the nec algorithm makes the second placed vendor will make three 3 times as many 098 032 3 times while the third placed vendor will make four 4 times as many errors 122 032 4 times as the nec

effective use of resources operational issues below shows the accuracy statistics between single flat fingerprint and two flat fingerprints as general guide line we use the following data with frr fixed at 01 enrolle d fingerprint far in far in frequency of false hit est false hits per day based on 10000 transaction and 10 million db records single flat print 0000025 1 in 4 million matches

solution private confidential section 3 91 false acceptance rate far which is the probability that an identity fraudster will be accepted by the system false rejection rate frr which is the probability that legitimate person will be rejected by the system by adjusting the threshold of acceptance the far can be lowered at the expense of the frr and vice versa in highly confidential application like the national id program higher frr and lower far are required in this example we used far of 0000001 at frr of 01 for 2 flat print matching in this context far or false unmatched of 0000001 means that there will be random one falsely accepted fraudulent application for every 100 million recor d matches it is important to note that far and frr rates and the accuracy of the system are direct result of the quality of the fingerprint of the individual user actual far and frr figures may differ due to poor quality of the captured fingerprint i mages as seen above the accuracy of two flat prints is much higher than single flat print assuming if rolled fingerprint is 50 more accurate than single flat print two flat prints matching is still much more superior in accuracy in terms of r esources rolled fingerprint will take up 50 more matching resources compared to flat fingerprint while two flat fingerprints will take up 100 more resources while two flat fingerprints resources is double that of single rolled fingerprint its matching accuracy is more than 12 times better operationally it is more difficult to capture good rolled fingerprint compared to flat fingerprint the officer administering the fingerprint capture will need to be adequately trained if rolled fingerpri nt is not captured properly the 50 increase in accuracy will be impacted resulting in less accurate system those matches that returns high score high probability of match would be consolidated in hit list or false hits human intervention w ill be required to determine whether its real hit or false hit real hit means an exact match or duplicate found using the same illustration if we go with single flat print the hit list would be 25x as long as that of 2 finger in another words if it takes 1 operator to clear 1000 record hit list per day 2 finger scenario you would require 25 operators to do the hit list management for 1 finger operationally 1 finger is not desirable

applications such as operating systems it is practically impossible to iron out every single bug before releasing it both from difficulty point of view and due to time constraints different software applications require different approaches when it comes to testing but some of the most common tasks in software qa include i validation testing validation testing is the act of entering data that the tester knows to be erroneous into an application for instance typing hello into an edit box that is expecting to receive numeric entry ii data comparison comparing the output of an application with specific parameters to previously created set of data with the same parameters that is known to be accurate iii stress testing stress test is when the software is used as heavily as possible for period of time to see whether it copes with high levels of load often used for server software that will have multiple users connected to it simultaneously also known as destruction testing iv usability testing sometimes getting users who are unfamiliar with the software to try it for while and offer feedback to the developers about what they found difficult to do is the best way of making

identifies number of project reviews these reviews can be broadly categorised into one of the following groups quality reviews quality reviews take place during all phases of the project lifecycle their overall purpose is to examine and check each of the project deliverable documents prior to delivery to the customer examples of such documents include project plan software requirements specification or user gui as the name implies quality reviews examine documents from quality viewpoint with the main focus being their overall content and readability plus their adherence to the organisations quality management system quality reviews involve quality reviewer and the author of the document concerned ministry of internal administration department of registration of persons develop supply install implement and maintain the requested software hardware and communication infrastructure for natio nal identity card project enicncb001 section 4 project approach and methodology private confidential section iv 50 b technical reviewer the primary responsibility of the technical reviewer is ensuring that technical details within the deliverable documents are technically correct and feasible as result the technical reviewer must have good technical background and be able to use this knowledge to critically assess the deliverables from technical viewpoint heshe must also have good understanding of quality management system in order to ensure that all the required technical details are addressed in view of the above technical reviewer within this organisation is whoever deemed to have the appropriate technical skills for the project at hand the appointment is made by the project manager after consultation is being made with the related person and hisher relevant manager where appropriate more than one technical reviewer may be appointed in cases where there are number of different technical issues to be reviewed c user reviewer the primary responsibility of the user reviewer is to take an active interest in the custom development process and the deliverables that are produced for this involvement to be beneficial user reviewers must have good knowledge and understanding of their requirements and be able to communicate these effectively the appointment of user reviewers normally occurs at the commencement of the project but may also take place during the project it is the responsibility of the project sponsor to nominate such people and to schedule time for their involvement in the review activities during the project 4912 the scheduling and conduct of project reviews ministry of internal administration department of registration of persons develop supply install implement and maintain the requested software hardware and communication infrastructure for natio nal identity card project enicncb001 section 4 project approach and methodology private confidential section iv 51 in normal circumstances reviews are conducted against each of the deliverables that have been produced by the project team hence it is recommended that the user reviews be conducted the most essential review is the final one that provides the users stamp of
