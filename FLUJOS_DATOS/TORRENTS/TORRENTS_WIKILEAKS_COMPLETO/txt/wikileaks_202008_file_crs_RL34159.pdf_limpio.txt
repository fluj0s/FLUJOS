knowledge services grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34159private activity bonds an analysis of state use 2001 to 2006 summary state and local governments often issue bt instruments in exchange for the use of individuals and businesse s savings this debt obligates state and local governments to make interest payments for the use of these savings and to repay at some time in the future the amount borrowe d state and local governments finance capital facilities with debt rather than out of current tax revenue in order to match the time pattern of benefits from these capita l facilities with the time pattern of tax payments the federal government subsidizes the cost of most state and local debt by excluding the interest income from federa l income taxation this tax exemption of interest income is granted because it is believed that state nd local capital facilities will be underprovided if state and local taxpayers have to pay the full cost generally state and local governments issue two types of taxexempt bonds 1 governmental bonds and 2 private ac tivity bonds portion of private activity bonds are subject to federally legislat ed statespecific annual limit the annual limit for each state is the greater of 1 state population from the previous year multiplied by an inflation adjusted dollar amount 85 in 2008 or 2 an inflation adjusted annual minimum 262095 million in 2008 most private activity bond volume 624 however is not subject to the state volume cap this report identifies how each state over the previous several years has allocated private activity bond volume including abandoned volume capacity the report also discusses the expansion of the types of projects eligible for private activity bond financing since 2001 approximately 55 billion in new private activity bond volume has been created by c ongress since 2001 series of estimates by the joint committee on taxation suggests that the new bonds would reduce federal tax revenue by as mu ch as 56 billion in the 110th congress various new proposals would further expand the types of private activities eligible for taxexempt financing and modify the rules for existing qualified private activities

group tax exempt state and local government bonds into two broad categories g overnmental and private activity1 broadly speaking congress limits the use of tax exempt private activity bonds pabs to selected activities recently the opport unity to issue pabs has expanded as congress has increased the range of projects and activities that qualify for taxexempt status this report focuses on state us of private activity bonds and the recently added activities eligib for taxexempt financing approximately 55 billion of additional capacity has been added since 2001 in separate estimates the joint committee on taxation jct projected that these new provisions would reduce federal tax revenue by approximately 56 billi on over 10year period2 in the 110th congress several legislative pr oposals have been introduced that would likely expand the volume of privat activity bonds including housing stimulus legislation that would increase housin g pab volume by 10 billion hr 5720 and hr 3221 the next section describes governmental and private activity bonds in more depth and is followed by presen tation of recently published bond data the last section disc usses legislation governmental bonds governmental bonds are issued by stat and local governments to finance governmental activities and public infrastructure construction such as roads courthouses and schools the bonds are taxexempt meaning the holder does not have to pay income taxes on the interest income earned on the bonds there is federal limit on the volume of govern mental bonds in 2005 roughly 19591 governmental bonds were issued with total volume of 3113 billion3 this total includes new money and bonds used to refund outstanding debt in 2005 14939 new money bonds were issued with face value of 151 billion refunding bonds are typically issued during periods of relatively low interest rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34159crs2 4 for more see crs report rl31457 private activity bonds an introduction by steven maguire 5 irs data are all from cynthia belmonte taxexempt bonds 2005 soi bulletin fall continuedprivate activity bonds in contrast to governmental bonds cong ress places restrictions on the issuance of private activity bonds pabs to limit th eir use pabs are bonds where 1 more than 10 of the activity financed by the bonds is private activity and 2 more than 10 of the revenue used to repay the bonds is generated by activity at the financed facility congress has identified subset of private activities that can be financed with taxexempt bonds the socalled qualified pabs thus are more like governmental bonds some qua lified pabs are subject to federally imposed annual statebystate limit or cap other qualified pabs are s ubject to national limit separate state cap or cap at all the irs reports that in 2005 total pa b new money volume was 547 billion and of that 205 billion was subject to the volume cap each stat is free to select the mix of qualified activities and to dete rmine the total amount of private activity bond volume under the cap most states use the total annual volume cap though some states do abandon capacity th at is leave some capacity unused state use of pabs is of interest to congress as the number of activities eligible for taxexempt financing has expanded si gnificantly since 1986 and accelerated since 20014 if additional new activities are subject to the same cap as existing activities competition for cap space could limit the eff ectiveness of the tax preferences for these activities in addition expanding th number of private ac tivities eligible for taxexempt financing particularly proposal s with separate caps may influence the market for governmental bonds as the new bonds would put upward pressure on market interest rates higher interest rates in turn may constrain the ability of some state and local governments to issue debt and finally issuing more taxexempt bonds would reduce federal revenues cont ributing to larger budget deficit congressional action in the taxexempt private activity bond ma rket will have disparate impact on the states as each state has different objectives for pabs the next section uses two data sources to analyze the activities financed by private activity bonds in each state the fi rst set of data from the internal revenue service irs examines all state and cal bonds issued in 2005 the second set of data from survey administered by the bond buyer publication unit of thomson financial inc is more narrowly focuse d on bonds subject to the volume cap and includes data for 2001 through 2006 use of private activity bonds periodically the internal revenue service irs co mpiles bond data contained in the information return form 80385 this form is filed by issuers of

in contrast to refunding bonds new money means the bond proceeds are to be used for new project and are not used to retire outstanding debt by comparison also in 2005 state and local governments issued 547 billion of longterm new money private activity bonds about 265 of new money longterm taxex empt debt most private activity bond volume is issued for nonprofit organi zations and hospitals 27969 billion private activity bond issuance by state not all pabs are subject to the fede rally imposed cap notably the bonds issued for nonprofit activities are not subject to th volume cap see table 1 in fact just over half of the amount of priv ate activity bonds are subject to the state volume cap 55 of the 547 billion after bonds issued for nonprofit organizations the next two largest categ ories are housing related bond issues the variation among states however is significant the variation is due in part to the timing of large projects and the preferences of citizens for example in idaho montana and nebraska over 50 of pr ivate activity bond volume was used for mortgage bonds considerably higher than the average across all states of 10586 the irs data in table 1 though generally instructive do not provide sufficiently detailed information on the amount and allocation of private activity bonds that are subject to the statebysta volume cap to permit detailed analysis more detail about the bonds subject to the cap would help federal policymakers analyze options for either expanding or reducing the private activities eligible for tax exempt

refunding is the practice of i ssuing bonds to replace existing bonds issuers typically do this to lockin lower interest rates or more favorable borrowing terms current refunding is allowed as long as the old bonds are redeemed within 90 days of the issuance of the refunding bonds advance refunding is the practice of issuing new bonds to replace existing bonds but not immediately within 90 days retiring the old bonds thus two sets of taxexempt bonds are outstanding for the same projectthe volume cap was originally introduced to limit the use of taxexempt private activity bonds and to encourage states to prioritize projects as volume cap space was intentionally scarce since 2001 however congress has enacted legislation creating new types of private activities not subject to the existing statebystate cap congress has also allowed selected private activ ity bonds to advance refund existing debt under the same recently passed legislation8 the total new volume capacity of these

is for bonds subject to the cap the difference between the tw amounts is likely attributable to two factors first the bond buyer data include the bond capacity carried forward from previous years and second th definitions used by the bond buyer are not the same as the irs definitions for more robust analysis the irs data would need to include more detail on the type of activity financed by state but for taxpayer confidentiality reasons the irs has not reported these data9 thus to assess more than the magnitude of private activity bond volume for each state one must rely on data provided by the bond buyer table 5 reports the sixyear total 2001 to 2006 amount of bonds allocated to selected activities by state as reported by the bond buyer the total volume capacity is the sum of each years

for new proj ects may entice states to us capacity that would have otherwise been abandoned the dist ribution of abandon capacity could be instructive from 2001 to 2006 20 states and the district of columbia were subject to the cumulative volume capacity minimum of 13607 million over those six years see table 2 12 these are the less populous states where the statutory annual minimum amount was greater than the population base d minimum in these states the abandon capacity was roughly 58 of their cap acity 16 billion the 30 more populous states abandoned considerably less 19 of their capacity 22 billion from these data it appears the volume cap is relativel less binding for the less populous states there is excess capacity in these states thus increasing or expanding the amount available for new projects would be re latively less effectiv in inducing new investment in less populous states relative to more populous stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34159crs12 table 5 state use
