enforcement agency to deal with spam related issues typically these agencies are telecom regulators consumer protection agencies data protection authorities and criminal prosecutors such as the police moreover the international bodies like organization for economi c cooperation and development oecd recommend having nodal agency and proper coordina tion between the various enforcement agencies at the national and international levels in fact oecd urges antispam regimes to ensure that spam enforcement authorities have the necessary authorit to obtain evidence sufficient to investigate and take action against spammers based on the countries experiences international bodies recommendations and saudi domestic laws it was decided that the telecommunication act and t he anti ecrime act are the applicable spam related laws in the kingdom accordingly two enfor cement agencies were designated in the kingdom to enforce antispam policy framework while the nistry of interior moi deals with spam associated with anti ecrime act violations ie c riminal and objectionable content the telecom regulator the communication and information techno logy commission citc will be in charge of spam messages with unobjectionable content although moi and citc will have joint responsibilit ies at the national level for instance ensuring the adherence by all parties to the antispam polic framework only citc

moi to report the spam case based on the following categories of spam content 1 directly to citc if the complaint is coming from ou tside the kingdom 2 to the service providers spam content of nuisance nature such as messages that include an unobjectionable content and the messages that cause damage to the public telecommunications networks or the messages which re indecent or menacing in nature or which cause panic or disturbance these t ypes of messages are prohibited in section 37 of the telecom act 3 to the moi spam content that breaches the anti ec rime act such as messages that contains criminal and objectionable content there are four ways to report spam to service provi der moi these are email or fax or online form or in person victims can use these means to lodge complaints regarding violations of the antispam regulatory policy framework of the kingdo m of saudi arabia upon the recipient of spam complaint by service pro vider it will be reviewed to determine

does not lead the enforc ement agency to automatically start the investigation process admittedly some spam compl aints might refer to 1 or 2 spam messages sent by mistake while other complaints might be ass ociated with criminal and offensive content consequently priorities will be set taking into co nsideration the flowing factors message contains false or deceptive claims eg ph ishing scams claims about health performance message contains virus message contains offensive or criminal content eg child pornography unsolicited commercial email degree of damage suffered specific example of d amage provided volume of messages sent repeat offender mobile phone spam and message originates from outside ksa when moi citc receive complaints they should sta rt analyzing and investigating the

the au thority to collect evidence enter premises where appropriate and examine or obtain copies of record s found on any premises decision would be taken based on the evidence and investigation conducted powers for investigation it is proposed that the moi citc should be respon sible for enforcing the saudi antispam policy framework the moi citc should have specif ic powers witch enable them to undertake investigations in an efficient manner moreover mo i citc will forward spam cases which do not fall under their jurisdiction to the appropriat authority for instance spam messages violating the anticommercial fraud law will be forwarded to the ministry of commerce moc therefore it is proposed that the antispam policy framework confers the following powers on the moi citc the power to obtain from any person information or documents relevant to the mois citcs investigation of contravention or suspecte d contravention of the antispam policy framework the power to enter premises and to seize remove or detain any computers telecommunications device documents or any other t hings upon obtaining warrant from magistrate the obligation of the moi citc not to disclose an

guidelines for saudi arabia final version page 17 of 27 confidential internal use only 7 appendix countries experiences and international bodies guidelines 71 countries experiences enforcement agencies according to the majority of the countries having ntispam frameworks in place either having spamspecific law or multiple related laws it is n oticed that multiple agencies are in charge of enforcing the antispam related laws the principal reason behind the plurality of enforcement agencies with responsibility for spam however is that the variety of abuse committed through electronic communications may violate protections p rovided for under various laws each attributing responsibility to different agency as follows consumer protection law by deceptively inducing recipients into paying fo r worthless wares or tricking recipients into various kinds of scams and frauds criminal law in case emails are used to send viruses or high volumes of electronic messages to the same email account disabling or disrupting the recipients ability to use it or again in the case of fraudulent behaviour when it is also violation of criminal laws such as the case of phishing data protection law in case spammers are sending unsolicited commerci email for the purpose of marketing without the recipients prior consent ie using personal information the email addresses without the permission of the own er telecommunication law and data protection law when emails contain false return addresses and misleading subject lines or fail to ffer an optout service or to respect optout requests the
