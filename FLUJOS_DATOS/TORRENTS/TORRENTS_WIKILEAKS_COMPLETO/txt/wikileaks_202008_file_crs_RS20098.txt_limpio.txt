domicile under certain circumstances establishes national association of registered includes sense of congress resolution that if agents and brokers for multistate insurance states have not implemented uniform insurance licensing purposes unless the majority of states licensing within three years congress should take have enacted uniform laws governing insurance steps to rectify the problems licensing including reciprocity within three years states would continue to regulate insurance with similar except explicit provision applying mandatory licensing special temporary exemption

regulations respecting the sales of insurance products and not in hr 10 is one relating to the tying of the purchase of financial product to obtaining enhanced service from an affiliate there are other similar distinctions between the two bills state laws would preempt unless the federal bank state laws would preempt unless the federal bank regulators jointly determine that the federal regulators jointly determine that the federal regulations provide greater protection regulations provide greater protection and consider comments by state regulators and notify the states of federal preemption such preemption would not go into effect if within three years the state overrides the preemption by statute na includes requirement that federal regulations not have the practical effect of discriminating against insurance sales by persons not affiliated with an insured depository institution insurance companies would be prohibited from similar provision disclosing individually identifiable medical health and genetic information subject to certain exceptions crs4 both bills would preserve functional regulation of insurance by state regulators and prohibit states from restricting bank affiliations permitted by federal law the standard for determining whether state law or regulation discriminates against banking concern would be stated in terms of whether it distinguishes by its terms between depository institutions and other persons in way that is more adverse to the depository institution than to the others with respect to insurance sales activities the bills include preemption standards that differ according to date of enactment of state law and type of activity being restricted in some instances the preemption provisions refer to the barnett bank

institution or subsidiary or affiliate thereof to engage in any insurance sales solicitation or crossmarketing activity these preemption standards are as follows type of state restriction standard of

confidentiality is the subject of crs issue brief 98002 which elaborates on the relevant provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of l996 3 critics have raised concerns about the breadth of the exceptions to the consent requirement and whether or not the language of the provisions preempt the requirement in the health insurance portability and accountability act of
