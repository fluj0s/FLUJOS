divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428productivity growth recent trends and future prospects summary while there are many economic variables over which policymakers have at least some direct or indirect influence pr oductivity growth may be among those that remain relatively removed from the influence of deliberate economic policy although many policy proposals are advo cated on the grounds that they will help boost productivity it may be that productivity growth rates have greater influence on policy than policy does on the growth of productivity it seems that variations in the productivity growth rate are so inco mpletely understood that there is clear consensus among economists about the be st way for policymakers to promote it nonetheless an important question for po licymakers is whether or not the surge in productivity growth of the late 1990s will continue high er productivity growth means higher real incomes which in combination with progressive income tax rates yields higher federal revenues as long as social security operates on payasyou go basis productivity growth also extends th date of reckoning as far as the trust fund balances are concerned because the in comes of those paying social security taxes will grow more rapidly than the be nefits whether or not productivity growth continues at the rate it did in the late 1990s is critical concern for those making and using longterm economic forecasts productivity is highly cyclical variable so that assessing its rate of growth at any single point in time requires knowing th particular stage of the business cycle however it is the long run tr end rate of growth of produc tivity that is of particular interest because that is the source of rising standards of living following the business cycle peak in the fourth quarter of 1973 productivity growth slowed substantially unfortunately that sl owdown remains poorly understood which makes it difficult to design po licies that might counteract it in the second half of the 1990s however productivity growth appears to have accelerated this is unusual in mature economic expansion which suggested to more than few observers that it was not just shortterm phenomenon but rather sign that there was an increase in the longterm economic growth rate the recent pickup in productivity growth is largely due to the rapid rate of decline in the prices of computers and ot her information technology it equipment the rapid drop in price of it equipment stimulated substantial investment spending raising the amount of capital per worker an important factor in those price declines has been innovation in the manufacture of microprocessors whether or not that rapid pace of innovation keeps up and prices continue to fall will be

recent trends and future prospects of all the economic variables policymak ers keep an eye on productivity growth may be one of the most important at leas t over the long run because it measures the rate of improvement in our national standa rd of living economywide increases in productivity indicate increases in real production and incomes which have been achieved without an increase in work c onsumers can buy more of those goods and services or leisure that make their lives easier or more enjoyable even where productivity growth is limited to certain industries every one benefits from the lower prices or the improved quality for those goods and services while there are many economic variables over which policymakers have at least some direct or indirect influence pr oductivity growth may be among those that remain relatively removed from the influence of deliberate economic policy although many policy proposals are advocated on the grounds that they will help boost productivity it may be that productivity growth rates have greater influence on policy than policy does on the growth of productivity it seems that variations in the productivity growth rate are so inco mpletely understood that there is clear consensus among economists about the be st way for policymakers to promote it nonetheless productivity gr owth rates do have impor tant consequences for policymakers the budget process for exam ple typically looks at least five if not 10 years ahead in setting spending and tax po licies with respect to social security the time frame is even longer over such an extended period of time some insight into the outlook for productivity growth is critical to projecting other economic variables and establishing an economic baseline on which to base budget decisions without at least some understanding of underlying factors projections of productivity may simply reduce to quantifying forecaster optimism in the second half of the 1990s productivity growth accelerated that it happened well into an econo mic expansion was unusual and it raised hopes that it was more than temporary phenomenon and represented an increase in the longrun trend rate of growth this report ex amines both the cyclical and longrun characteristics of productivity growth disc usses the recent beha vior of productivity and considers the factors that may determine its future performance the cyclical nature of productivity distinguishing variations in productivity growth that are due to shortterm economic conditions from those that might be indicative of change in longterm trends can be difficult productivity is cyclical variable and tends to fluctuate considerably over the short run changes in longerterm trends can only be identified by comparing growth rates ove r successive business cycleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs2 productivity is most often measured by output per manhour it is typically procyclical in recession pr oductivity tends to decline or grow less rapidly as the recession ends and the economy begins to expand productivity growth usually picks up at the beginning of an economic cont raction demand for goods and services declines but firms may be slow to lay off workers both because they may have invested considerable amount of time and money in thei r recruitment and training and because there are costs associated with laying those workers off and then re hiring them when business recovers th other input to production physical capital is relatively fixed in the s hort run so at th beginning of an economic downturn output tends to fall more rapidly than either labor or capital and so measured productivity declines if the contraction continue s and production falls enough firms will begin to lay off workers but at first they will tend to be those most recently hired with the least amount of training and who were relativel less productive than those hired before reducing the quantity of labor employed nds to moderate any initial deceleration in measured productivity growth as the contraction comes to an end and the economy begins to expand again firms can increase their output initially by putting idle capital back to work and taking advantage of any underutilized labor already on hand this increase in output with little or increase in either labor or capital is reflected in relatively rapid productivity growth once increasing mand can longer be satisfied with existing capacity additional labor will be added those hired first will tend to be those relatively more experienced as more and more labor is hired the contribution to output of each additional hire tends to drop thus as the expansion ages productivity growth slows from the rates earlier on in the expansion measuring productivity productivity is ratio of the quantity of output produced to the quantity of inputs used in its production an increase in the quantity of output with increase in either labor or capital w ould be an increase in productivity as long as output is rising faster than the contribution of labor and capital meas ured productivity will rise there are two different measures of productivity published by the federal government both are published by the bur eau of labor statistics of the department of labor bls the measure of output us ed by bls in the calculation is based on data from the national in come and product accounts published by the bureau of economic analysis of the partment of commerce bea the first and probably the one most often cite d in press reports is labor productivity labor productivity is measured in terms of aver age output per hour it is ratio of the quantity of output to the hours of work done if the quantity of output rises by the same proportion as the amount of work then the economy is only producing more either because there are more workers or workers are putting in longer hours and there is productivity growth if output rises faster than hours worked labor productivity is also increasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs3 1 j steven landefeld and bruce t gri mm note on the impact of hedonics and computers on real gdp survey of current business december 2000 pp 1722the second measure known as multifactor productivity also referred to as total factor productivity accounts for increases in both hours worked and growth in the capital stock multifactor productivity typically rises more slowly than labor productivity because there is more comple accounting of inputs the difference between the two measures is mainly attribut able to increases in the ratio of capital to labor problems in measuring real output production of goods and services is necessarily measured in terms of dollar values because that is the only unit of measure common to all of the factors invol ved the dollar value of output however reflects both prices and quantities distinguishing between changes in output that are real ie indicative of changes in quantity and changes that are only due to variations in the general pri ce level is difficult problem productivity measures are ba sed on inflationadjusted measures of output the way in which price change is measured can thus affect measures of productivity growth if existing price indexes understa the rate of inflation that will cause estimates of productivity gr owth to be overstated few goods or services stay the same from year to year over time most products acquire new characteristics that make it difficult to compare them with earlier models an increase in the price of car for example may reflect rising prices throughout the economy but it may so reflect new featur such as catalytic converters or airbags ideally those price increases due to the addition of these new characteristics would not affect the pri ce index for cars even though the same number of cars might be sold in succe ssive periods the newer model car might provide better eg safer or less polluting service over its useful life more difficult problem is the introduction of an entirely new product because there is price from an earlier period with whic h to compare the introductory price of all the goods and services produce d computers may be changing the most rapidly from year to year the prices of computers have been falling and their performance has been improving dramatically rather than simply track change in the price of computer from one year to the next the bea attempts to track changes in the price of computing power1 that means that it tries to take into account changes in memory processing sp eed and other features when estimating price change in successive models of computers some sectors of the economy may be easier to measure than others in the case of manufactured goods there is at least tangible product that can be counted even though there may be difficulties in asse ssing changes in its quality or other characteristics in the case of services it can be difficult even to define what is being produced take medical care for example in the case of physician services what should be measured as production the num ber of office visits per hour should success at treating various ilments be taken into accounthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs4 2 zvi griliches productivity rd and the data constraint american economic review volume 84 issue 1 march 1994 pp 123 3 robert j gordon recent productivity puzzles in the context of zvi griliches research paper presented to meetings of the am erican economic association jan 5 2002 17 ppsome have argued that because the rvice sector accounts for growing share of total national output and b ecause it is more difficult to measure productivity in the service sector that overall measures of productivity have b ecome more prone to error at one time it was suggested that at least part of the slowdown in productivity growth that began by most accounts in 1973 may ve been due to measurement problems associated with the increased size of the service sector2 more recent evidence suggests that is unlikely to have been the case those sectors considered to be harder to measure account for some of the larger productivity gains since 19953 productivity growth historical patterns how does productivity growth in the ec onomic expansion of the 1990s compare with those of the past table 1 presen ts data for annual ra tes of growth in labor productivity between successive business cycl reference dates for the postwar era two observations are apparent from the data in the table first there is clearly tendency for productivity growth to be procyclical that is to say that productivity growth is higher during expansions troug h to peak than during contractions peak to trough second it is clear from the data that since the business cycle peak in the fourth quarter of 1973 productiv ity growth has been quite bit slower than was the case before in order to separate changes in longterm trends from those changes that reflect more variable

of labor bureau of labor statistics for much of the postworld war ii era the us experienced relatively rapid rates of productivity growth between th fourth quarter of 1948 and the fourth quarter of 1973 output per labor hour in the pr ivate business sector grew at an annual rate of 32 between the fourth quart er of 1973 and the first quarter of 2001 that rate fell to 17 per year most economists point to 1973 as the beginning of an extended period of slower pr oductivity growth this drop in the rate of productivity growth has been the focus of much econo mic research thus far the slowdown remains poorly understood the economic expansion which began in march 1991 and nded in march 2001 120 months was the longest us expansion on record 4 only two other expansions have been long enough to allow meaningf ul comparisons the expansion of the 1960s began in february 1961 and ended in december 1969 106 months and the expansion of the 1980s began in november 1982 and ended in july 1990 92 months figure 1 compares productivity growth in the latest economic expansion with those two earlier expansions for each expansion represented productivity is set equal to 100 at the initial cycle trough i the starting point of the expansionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs6 figure 1 labor productivi ty in 3 long expansions source department of labor bureau of labor statistics the chart shows that the expansions of the 1960s and the 1980s followed more or less the typical pattern scribed earlier rates of grow th tended to be more rapid earlier in the expansions than was the case towards the end of the expansion it is also clear that productivity grew much mo re rapidly in the expansion of the 1960s than in the 1980s the expansion of the 1990s did not follo w the typical pattern for about the first half of the expansion it did seem to be typical with productivity growth slowing from its pace at the start but afte r about four years productivity growth unexpectedly accelerated that productivity growth accelerated at the midpoint of the expansion has been interpreted as eviden ce that there has been shift in the long run trend multifactor productivity bls also publishes an alternative set of productivity measures which account not onl for labor used to produce goods and services but also for the role that cap ital plays in the production process multi factor productivity as described above capital comes in two forms physical capital and human capital physical capital refers to the land plant equipment and inventories that are used in the production of goods and services hu man capital results from investments in education and training which yi eld more capable workforcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs7 figure 2 multifactor productivity laborin calculating the multifactor measure of labor productivity the input of labor takes changes in labor quality into account in other words an adjustment is made which reflects investments in educati on and training otherwise known as human capital figure 2 compares growth in this measure of labor productivity in the current expansion with previous business cycles these data are onl available annually source department of labor bureau of labor statistics figure 2 shows again that the expans ions of the 1960s and 1980s exhibited more or less typical pattern s of productivity growth that is to say growth rates were relatively more rapid early in the expansions and relatively less rapid as the expansions drew to close as was th case with the previous measure of labor productivity the expansion of the 1990s wa s atypical although productivity growth was slower in the second third and fourth year than in the first year of the expansion productivity growth accelerated in the fifth year and continued at relatively rapid pacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs8 5 remember that productivity is ratio of output produced to the inputs used in its production by adding capital to the inputs the ratio fallsfigure 3 multifactor productivity totalfigure 3 compares growth in multi factor also known as total factor productivity over each of the three long pos twar expansions this measure accounts for contributions of both labor and capital in the production of goods and services because capitals contribution to the production of goods nd services is also taken into account it rises by less than do the ot her measures which take only labor hours into account5 source department of labor bureau of labor statistics the chart like the two earlier ones show s that the expansions of the 1960s and 1980s were fairly typical in terms of the cyclical behavior of productivity and that productivity growth in the 1960s was much faster than it was in the 1980s it also shows that the cyclical behavior of pr oductivity growth in the 1990s expansion was typical through the first 4 years but was much weaker than in the other two long expansions after the fourth year however productivity growth accelerated the unexpected acceleration in productivity in the sec ond half of the 1990s exhibited by all of these measures prompted many observers to speculate that there had been an important change that some ch aracterized as the new economy it was claimed that with the expansion of the inte rnet and the widespread use of computers we were on the verge of an era of much more rapid economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs9 6 martin neil baily productivity and the services of capital and labor brookings papers on economic activity 1 1981 pp 150 7 department of

123accounting for past changes in productivity growth the longterm trend rate of growth in productivity apparently slowed in the early 1970s the search for causes attracted the atte ntion of many analysts if there is to be any hope of designing polic ies likely to stimulate grow th in living standards or of making projections of productivity grow th it would seem that some understanding of past variations would be cr itical it would be particular ly gratifying if some single dominant factor could be identified so that policies to counteract it could be designed unfortunately results to date mig ht be described as unsatisfying the prime suspect at least initially was the opec oil price hikes which in 1973 roughly doubled the price of crude oil the fact that this price shock was more or less coincident with the slowdown in productivity growth made it likely candidate the theory was that because of the suddenly higher cost of energy much of the existing capital stock became obsolete6 since 1973 however there have been dditional oil price shocks with appreciable effect on the rate of pr oductivity growth between 1979 and 1981 oil prices more than doubled again in 1986 the pr ice of oil fell by nearly half in real terms the average price of oil in 1998 was less than it was in 19737 that only one of the large oil price changes was associ ated with change in productivity growth suggests that if there is single factor to blame for the 1973 slowdown it is likely to be found elsewhere another potential cause which has been ex amined is spending on research and development griliches ex amined the role of rd spending in the productivity slowdown8 he found decline in rd spending relative to gdp beginning in the mid1960s that timing would seem to make it good suspect in the 1973 slowdown but other countries that also experienced productivity decelerations had corresponding drop in rd spending th at doesnt mean rd played role but it would be easier to implicate rd spe nding if there had been other instances griliches also points out that in the 1970s the number of patents granted in the us declined that paired with an increase in the dollar level of rd spending resulted in decline in the number of patents per rd dollar griliches suggests that this decline in the number of patents re lative to rd spending leaves open the possibility of diminishing returns to rd sp ending and wonders if it is possible that there exists some sort of technological frontier near which the opportunities for invention become scarcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs10 9 angus maddison growth and slowdown in advanced capitalist economies journal of economic literature volume 25 number 2 june 1987 pp 649681 10 robert j gordon

39 august 1957 pp 312320in an attempt to identify causes of the post1973 slowdown in real output growth angus maddison analyzed range of likely factors and tried to estimate the contribution of each one9 maddison was only able to explain 41 of the 14 per year deceleration in real output of the 14 separate factors examined the largest was found to have accounted for less than oneseventh of the slowdown thus while it might be satisfying if single cause for the productivity slowdown could be found it seems more likely that there are mu ltiple factors at work if the slowdown in productivity d affected all industries more or less equally that might have favored the cas for single cause for the slowdown although one factor would not necessarily be expected to affect industries to the same degree however when productivity trends are examined for individual industries some are found to have fared quite well in comparison with others10 economist robert gordon has offered s lightly different perspective on the 1973 productivity slowdown he maintains that rather than explaining why productivity growth slowed in the 1970s and 1980s the focus instead should be on why it was so rapid earlier in the century11 gordon argues that in the 1970s productivity growth simply fell back to its long run trend rate and that the growth experienced earlier in the century was unusually rapid due to number of technological advances among the advan ces he cites are the spread of electric motors the internal combustion engine and the telephone and its derivatives gordon argues that together these innova tions had much greater economic effect than the electronic computer gordon go on to suggest that the economy may be on longrun curve of diminishing returns to technological advancement and that the various modifications and improvements to devices such as computers are less important than their initial introduction it may be that there will always be some portion of productivity growth or variation in productivity growth that w ill remain unexplaine d early theoretical models of economic growth treated that part of productivity not due to capital accumulation as exogenous which is ec onomic jargon for variable which does not react to the internal infl uences of an economic system but rather is external and independent12 if that is true there will always be limits to the extent of influence public policy can have on productivity growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs11 13 robert solow wed better watch out new york times book review july 12 1987 p 36 14

productivity growth robert solow major contributor to th theory of economic growth is often quoted for his remark that the effect of computers can be seen everywhere but in the productivity statistics13 through the 1980s and early 1990s there seemed to be big payoff from the growing stock of comput ers that presented puzzle to those who expected significant returns but it is now believed that computers have had much to do with the acceleration in productivity growth since the mid1990s whether or not that is the case and how computers have affected pr oductivity growth are important in trying to assess how durable the acceleration will prove to be it is getting to the point where consum ers expect the rapid pace of innovation in the manufacture of computers to continue it is also widely assumed that the speed and memory capacity of those computers w ill continue to improve at steady pace this rapid rate of technological adva nce in the development and manufacture of computers was predicted in 1965 by gor don moore one of the cofounders of intel corporation14 specifically moores law predicted that the number of transistors that could be put on com puter chip would double every 18 months whether or not that prediction was selffulfilling prophecy may be open to question but the fact is that the pace of technological advance in the manufacture of computers has vindicated moores law over time because of the rapid innovation in the pr oduction of computer chips the prices of computers as well as other goods related to information processing and communications sometimes referred to collec tively as information technology it have been falling steadily for some time figure 4 shows the chainweighted price index published by bea for computer s and related equipm ent from 1959 through early 2003 because the changes are so large the chart is plotted on logarithmic scale prices for comput ers have clearly been on steady downward trend between 1959 and 1995 computer

bureau of economic analysis these price declines reflect substantial improvements in the quality of computers bls has developed proce dure for estimating price indexes for goods whose characteristics are changing rapidly these are referred to as hedonic price indexes hedonic price indexes attempt to estimate statistical relationship between prices and set of characteristics such as memory and processor speed these price indexes are important to the measurement of productivity because estimating price change is necessary to estimating change in real output and thus productivity if the rate of price dec line in computers is overestimated then measures of productivity will be overstated most studies estimate that in the late 1990s prices for personal computers alone fell at an annual ra of somewhere between 30 and 4015 rapid declines in computer prices have not surprisingly stimulated surge in investment figure 5 shows the chainlinked quantity index for investment in computers and related equipment from the national income and product accounts nipa although there are data ba ck to 1959 production of computers was negligible until the 1980s thus even though real output of it

first there has been rapid productivity growth in the production of computers which as computers accounted for an in creasing share of total pr oduction tended to raise the overall measure of productivity growth s econd the sharp drop in computer prices has stimulated increased investment in computers which has contributed to an increase in the overall amount of capital availa ble to the workforce this is often referred to as capital deepening increas in the capital stock generally tend to raise worker productivity in part because of increased spending on it equipment the overall rate of investment spending rose significantly in the 1990s figure 6 presents real fixed investment as share of total gdp since 1987 since the nd of the 1990s expansion the ratio has fallen but it remains

acceleration in produc tivity growth most analyses found that computers were not yielding much benefit one reason for that is that until recently computers accounted for relatively sm all share of the total capital stock16 but that view has now changed althoug h perhaps not yet embracing all of the claims of proponents of new economy economists are encouraged that the acceleration in productivity growth of the late 1990s may mean that the economy is on higher growth path and that co mputers have had lot to do with it two recent studies discussed below found considerable evidence that the computer or more generally it equipment is behind most of the recent acceleration in productivity growth there is also evid ence of modest sp illover into other sectors of the economy in other words investment in computers can raise the productivity of the workers who use them but it may also lead firms to change the way they operate leading to further productivity gains the first study by oliner and sichel at the federal reserve board found that of 09 percentage point increase in the gr owth rate of total factor productivity from the first half of the 1990s to the second half all of it could be accounted for by advances in the production of computers them selves and the also by the use of those computers17 table 2 presents breakdown of oliner and sichels accounting for productivity growth

the it sector itself contributed anot her 020 percentage point of the acceleration the evidence suggests that increased productivity in the sector producing it equipment has had modest direct effect on total factor productivity by far the more important factor has been the dec lining price of it equipment stimulating surge in investment and increasing the size of the capital stock remember that total factor productivity measures changes in output that are not accounted for by changes in economic inputs such as labor and capital there is doubt that computers are raising productivity of many firms but as long as economic statistics measure them correctly the increased share of work that computers do will not show up in increased multifactor productivity because that measure of productivity tracks the increase in output not associated with the increase in investment in computers19 it is unclear whether or not computers have had any spillover effects on multi factor productivity beyond their direct contribution to growth in output there is some evidence to suggest that those spillover effects of computers on total factor productivity ar fairly small jorgenson and stiroh found that those sectors of the economy that invest most h eavily in computers and it equipment such as financial services had among the lowe st rates of productivity growth measured20 jorgenson ho and stiroh also estimated pr ojections of growth in average labor productivity they projected that produc tivity growth would range between 114 and 238 over the next decade with base case of 178 just below the 1995 2001 rate of growth in another study robert go rdon f ound that most of the acceleration in labor productivity was attri butable to capital deepening nd faster productivity growth in the production of computers and it equipment21 of the roughly 02 percentage point increase in total factor productivity most was accounted for by faster productivity growth in the manufacture of durable goods that suggests that any spillover effects of computers on the ove rall economy were limited will the surge in productivity growth persist perhaps the most important question fo r policymakers is whether or not the surge in productivity growth of the late 1990s will continue higher productivityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31428crs18 22 paul w blauer jeffrey l jensen

recent slowdown what does it an for future living standards by marc labontegrowth means higher real incomes which in combination with progressive income tax rates yields higher fede ral revenues as long as social security operates on payasyougo basis it also extends the da of reckoning as far as the trust fund balances are concerned because the incomes of those paying social security taxes will grow more rapidly than the benef its whether or not productivity growth continues at the rate it did in the late 1990s is critical concern for those making and using longterm economic forecasts22 it seems likely that the increase in pr oductivity growth of the late 1990s was shift to higher longrun trend rate of growth rather than an event limited to the most recent cyclical expansion but there is still guarantee that faster growth will endure through the next expansion23 the major difficulty in projecting pr oductivity growth remains an imperfect understanding of past varia tions some of the sources of productivity growth are clearly understood increased investment and growing capital stock raise labor productivity increased educa tion and training also contribute but aside from the contributions of human and physical capital much less is certain to great extent projections of productivity still reflect the optimism or pessimism of the forecaster it is clear however that the recent pic kup in productivity is largely attributable to the rapid rate of decline in the prices of computers and other it equipment an important factor in those price declines has been innovation in the manufacture of microprocessors whether or not that rapid pace of innovation keeps up and prices continue to fall will be im portant factors in future rates of productivity growth however ultimately there may be limits to the number of transistors that can be put on single computer chip as computer prices have fallen their use has become much more widespread because of falling prices it has become pr ofitable to put computers to uses with smaller and smaller returns but as long as recent rates of innovation in the production of computers and it equipment continue productivity might at least be expected to continue growing more rapidly than it did between 1973 and 1995
