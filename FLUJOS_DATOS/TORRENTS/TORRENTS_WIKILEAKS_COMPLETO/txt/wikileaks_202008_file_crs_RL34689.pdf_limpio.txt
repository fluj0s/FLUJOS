performance and the windfall profits tax summary over the past 10 years surging crude oil and petroleum product prices have increased oil and gas industry revenues and generated record profits particularly for the top five major integrated companies also known as the supermajors exxon mobil royal dutch shell bp chevr on and conocophillips these companies which reported predominant share of those profits generated more than 100 billion in profits on nearly 15 trillion of revenues in 2007 from 2003 to 2007 revenues increased by 51 net income pro fits increased by 85 oil output by the five majors over this time period dec lined by more than 2 from 985 to 963 million barrels per day being largely pricedriven with increase in output and with little new production re sulting from increased oil industry investment many believe that portion of the increased oil industry income over this period represents windfall and unearned gain ie income not earned by any additional effort on the part of the firms but due primarily to r ecord crude oil prices which are set in the world oil marketplace numerous bills have been introduced in the congress over this period to impose windfall profits tax wpt on oil most of the bills were introduced in the 109th and 110th congresses after the enactment of the energy policy act of 2005 which provided oil and gas industry tax incentives in addition to the industrys traditional tax subsidies an excisetax based wpt would tax only dom estic produc tion and like the one in effect from 19801988 would increase marginal oil production costs which theoretically could reduce domestic oil supply and raise petroleum imports making the united states more depende nt on foreign oil undermining goals of energy independence and energy security by contrast an incometax based wpt would be more economically neutral less distortionary in the shortrun sizeable revenues could be raised wit hout reducing domestic oil supp lies neither the excise tax based or incometax based wpt are expected to have significant price effects neither tax would increase the price of crude oil which means that refined petroleum product prices such as pump prices would likely not tend to increase in lieu of these two types of wpt an administratively simple way of increasing the tax burden on the oil industry and th erefore recouping some of any excess or windfall profits particularly from major integrated producers would raise the corporate tax rate by for instance rep ealing or reducing the domestic manufacturing activities deduction under irc 199 this deduction is presently 6 of firms net income and is available generally to all domestic manufacturing businesses service firms are excluded including almost all il firms repealing this deduction for the major integrated oil companies and freezing it at 6 for the remaining qualifying oil companies is estimated by the joint committee on taxation to generate bout 10 billion over 10

breaksoil industry financial performance and the windfall profits tax introduction over the past 10 years the price of crude oil has been increasing volatile and has recently attained record high levels the results of those price increases which led to high gasoline prices have been weakening of the us economy and financial hardship for many american families who have also been buffeted by the housing slowdown the credit crunch risi ng unemployment and other economic factors while much of the american econom has suffered as result of high oil prices those prices generated record profit levels for the oil industry five companies exxonmobil royal dutch shell bp chevron and conocophillips earned predominant share of those profits record oil and gas industry profits ve raised the cern of many public policy experts and federal policymakers including many in congress who have questioned whether these profits were justified or whether they constituted windfall to the industry an excessive unearned and unfair gain important factors in considering this issue might include th ultimate source or reason for the price increases and what was the industrys role in generating them ie whether it was through the direct result of the industrys fforts in terms of employing its resources decisionmaking or risktaking or whether it was the result of fortuitous factors and events also important to the public policy question might be the actual size of the profits and what the industry did with th em if an industry invests profits into increased production capacity the increased supply may ultimately cause prices to fall and the profits to dissipate as the analysis in this report shows the experience between 2003 and the first lf of 2008 is not encouraging investments in oil exploration and developmen t have not managed to keep company output from declining by some 7 over the fiveyear period numerous bills have been intr oduced in the congress over this period to tax the oil and gas industrys record profits th bills generally ta ke one or more of four approaches first some bills have proposed rescindi ng or taking back the tax incentives or subsidies enacted under th energy policy act of 2005 epact 05 pl 10858 which not only expanded preexis ting oil and gas industry tax subsidies but enacted several new ones1 to be sure epact05 also reinstated two excise taxeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs2 2 epact05 reduced taxes provided additional tax subsidies valued at 2633 billion over 11 years it also reinstated two excise taxe s the oil spill liability trust fund tax and the leaking underground storage tank trust fund tax both of which are imposed on oil refineries according to the joint committee on taxation over 11 years the value of the tax increase was 2857 million 224 million 28572633 more than the tax cuts also the tax increase prevention and reconciliation b ill of 2006 pl 109222 enacted on may 17 2006 reduced one of the industrys tax subsidies ie it increased taxes on the oil industry by about 189 million 3 there is an important economic distinction between subsidy and tax benefit as is discussed elsewhere in this report busine ss firms including oil and gas companies generally receive variety of tax benefits that are not necessarily targeted subsidies or tax expenditures because they are available generally 4 see crs report rl33578 for more detailon petroleum that were larger than the tax subsidies2 but policymakers asked 1 why should the federal government provide any subsidies at time when oil and gas prices and oil and gas industry profits ar not only rising but reaching higher and higher record levels and 2 why should th level of oil and ga s industry subsidies be increased for an already profitable i ndustry at time when consumers and energy intensive industries trucking airlines etc and the general economy are burdened by the high crude oil and gasoline prices another policy option proposed in cong ress to raise the tax burden on the oil and gas industry would repeal or cutback the preexisting oil and gas industry tax subsidies ie those that predated ep act05 some of which were also expanded under epact05 and which generally are still in effect since the inception of the federal income tax system in the early 20th century the oil and gas industry has benefitted from sizeable some estimates exceed 100 billion in real terms federal tax subsidies primarily for upstream activities such as exploration and development and extrac tion and production as compared to the downstream activities such as refining and marketing for example the domestic oil and gas industry is able to expense ie write off in the first year as compared to capitalize intangible drilling costs idc s and independent producer s qualify for the percentage depletion allowance rather than cost pletion and while these traditional subsidies have been significantly pared back over th years and are not now large relative to the size of the industry some feel that subsidies should be available to the industry at time of surging record profits third policy option that would raise taxe s on oil and gas is to amend or reform certain income tax code provisions that although legally and economically not subsidies they would not be defined as subsidies in the tax expenditure sense by the joint committee on taxation may c onfer undue or disp roportionate and unnecessary tax benefits to the oil and gas industry3 as an example some bills propose to repeal the industrys use of th lastinfirstout lifo system of inventory accounting under irc 472 this method values the goods sold as the most recent inventory purchase during period of rising prices this method of inventory accounting increases production cost s and reduces taxable income and tax liabilities4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs3 5 as discussed below on p 18 the marginal corporate income tax rate is presently less than 35 for most domestic manufacturing activities due to the 6 domestic manufacturing activities deduction which typically applies to large corporations such as oil and gas producers and refiners and which is equivalent to marginal corporate income tax rate of 329 35 x 094 rather than 35 in addition present federal tax law imposes minimum tax on corporations and individuals to the extent that their minimum tax exceeds their regular tax liability 6 the low of 1082barrel was reached on december 10 1998 7 the 147 is in nominal or current dollars crude oil prices also reached record high in real terms or inflation adjusted termsa second example is the proposed reform of the foreign tax credit many of the major energy tax bills that the congress has considered over the last two years proposed to reform the tax treatment of foreign oil and gas extracting income fogei and foreign oilrelated income fori the proposed reforms are apparently focused on reducing instances in which such income is not measured correctly overstated so as to overstate foreign income taxes and overstate their foreign tax credits which tends to reduce the us tax liability ie the tax on us source income finally fourth option the one that is discussed in this report is to impose windfall or excess profits tax ie supplemental or additional tax on the oil industry one based on windfall or excess profits in addition to other income or other taxes that the industry might pay while some congressional legi slators envision this as totally new type of tax on windfall gain s others would model it after the windfall profits tax on oil that existed from 1980 to 1988 while still others propose higher corporate income tax burden either through raising the corporate rate or eliminating deductions either way windf all profit tax would be in addition to the current tax on corporate and business income that applie s to the oil and gas industry and which tax profits at rates as high as 355 this report discusses the fourth option

period 2003 to 2008 while revenues increased by 51 from 2003 to 2007 net income increased by 85 these percentages suggest that price increases for crude oil and petroleum products increased at higher rate than costs and taxes for the five major firms analogously to the observed increase in revenues the increase in net income experienced by the five firms was largely pricedriven the previous measures of financial performance focus on absolute levels absolute levels of revenue and absolute net income perhaps better measure of performance is the profit rate which may also be measured in variety of ways one measure of the profit rate is the operating margin essentially net income divided by revenue as result of the increasing pri ce of oil driving up both total revenues and net incomes the return on revenue or the profit rate increased slightly for both the major integrated oil companies as well as for the industry as whole as shown in table 5 this indicator of industry performance is not out of line with the rate in the manufacturing industry genera lly which in 2007 has prof it rate of 89 however more appropriate measure of the relative profit rate may be the rate

complete analysis of this topic as well as more complete datathe oil and gas industrys roe was only 2 per centage point higher by this measure the industrys recent high profits measured both in absolute terms and relative to roe suggest the presence of excess or windfall profits the data in table 1 table 2 table 3 and table 4 characterize an industry that was unable to respond to the market signal of higher price by increasing output as predicted by economic theory as result their revenues and net incomes increased proportionately possibly supporting the judg ement that those profits constituted windfall at least in the sense that th ey were not earned through output expansion or improvement risktaking or investments leading to cost reductions in production however the data in table 5 could be taken to suggest that the major oil companies did not earn more net income respective to the value of their product than many other industries and the value of their product was determined on world market beyond their control from this point of vi ew oil was attaining its fair market value the net income data presented in table 4 was earned in three sectors of the industry upstream operations the explora tion and production of il and natural gas downstream operations the refining tran sportation distribution and marketing of petroleum products including motor gasoline diesel jet fuel and other petroleum products and chemicals and all other nonoil activitie s over time the relative importance of these sectors may shift in rms of potential to generate net income for example while downstream activities were very strong in 2005 and 2006 they weakened in 2007 and 2008 in terms of general corporate income taxation this cyclical pattern of change is likely to have little effect since it is overall corporate net revenues that form the tax base in terms of possible wi ndfall profit taxation however this cyclical pattern of change might be important as it is netincome from crude oil ownership and pr oduction that is likely to have windfall gain or unearned income component use of profits11 in economic theory when firms earn returns in excess of the market rate of return they are likely to reinvest in their businesses to expand output and improve their technologies to meet the challenge of new firms that might choose to enter the industry as new competitors in the theory of corporate finance firms that seek to maximize shareholder value use profits to invest in business projects that offer higher potential rate of return than that currently earned by the firm increased investment capital expenditures for the five major oil companies were 486 billion in 2 003 487 b illion in 2004 572 billion in 2005 and more than 80 billion in 2006 and

invested in explora tion development and produc tion those investments have not met with not iceable success table 2 shows that the companies have failed to expand or even maintain their oil production rates cash reserves and dividend payouts the major oil companies accumulated cash reserves from 2003 through 2007 the five firms held 194 billion in cash in 2003 and 5227 billion in 2007 an increase of almost 170 while cash holdings declined in 2007 compared to 2006 this was the result of reduced balances at only one company chevron13 the other four major oil companies continued to build their cash balances from one point of view cash balance accumulation gives firms flexibility and positions them to take advantage of opportun ities quickly it is also likely that the rapid increase in the price of oil and profits from 2003 to 2007 exceeded corporate plans and strategies on how to use it ho wever the theory of corporate finance suggests that extraordinary cash returns to shareholders are appropriate only when the management feels that individual shareholders are likely to have access to higher return investment alternatives than management can identify activities that represented direct returns to stockholde rs in the form of increased dividend payments and stock buybacks also claimed share of earned profits legislative history of windfall profits tax proposals almost from the outset of the surge in crude oil and petrol eum product prices many in congress became concerned over th level of oil indus try profits and bills were introduced to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry by imposing some type of windfall profits tax these proposals are vi ewed as way of generating tax revenue to fund subsidies for low income persons and offset the burden of recent high petroleum prices and programs for ergy conservation and alternative and renewable fuels also they are viewed from the perspective of basic equity or fairness the overall distribution of the ta x burden could be viewed as being more fair when taxes on the record unearned incomes of business enterprises are used to reduce the tax burden of lower income pe rsons burdened by the higher prices that contributed to those record earningshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs10 14 hakken john excess profits tax the encyclopedia of tax policy joseph j cordes and jane gravelle eds the urban institute

lazzari march 9 2006 16 as noted above the 1980 wpt was imposed as part of compromise to decontrol crude oil prices quid pro quo from control regime level of about 6barrel before the tax crude prices were allowed to rise gradually to market levels as influenced strongly by opec which at that time were about 24barrel by contrast today there are price controls on crude oil and prices are determined in generally competitive global crude oil market one in which the united states is price taker and one in which opec plays relatively smaller but still important role also more recently crude oil prices have increased for significantly different reasons than was the case in the 1970s unlike the 1980s when crude oil prices declined sharply to predecontrol levels just after the wpt was imposed and for most of the life of the tax crude oil prices since the trough of 19981999 have increased fairly steadily and consistently and have surpassed the levels of 1982 in real terms 17 from the beginning of july 1990 to august 1990 domestic oil prices the spot price of west texas intermediate nearly doubled increasing from just over 16 per barrel to nearly 32 per barrel the concept of windfall profits tax is not new tax on windfall or excess business profits has been one the instruments of fiscal po licy used by both state and federal governments whenever business profits either rise too fast or rise to levels that are either considered too high bove normal or fa ir or which reflect excessive rates of return at the federal level however such taxes have been used sparingly being viewed as extraordinary measures their use limited to wartime or other periods characterized by economic em ergencies and instabilities such as hyper inflations such was the case with the surtax on business profits imposed as temporary measure to control large profits earned during world wars i and ii and the korean war14 type of windfall profits tax on domestic crude oil production was in effect from april 1980 to august 1988 this tax wh ich was actually an excise tax not profits or income tax was part of co mpromise between the carter administration and the congress over the decontrol of crude oil prices it is discussed and analyzed in detail in crs report rl3330515 some have proposed reinstating this tax although it should be underscored that the cu rrent situation giving rise to

in windfall or excess profits tax on the oil and gas industry in tensified in fact most of the bills to impose some type of windfa ll profits tax were introduced in the 109th congress there were more than dozen such bills after epact05 was enacted into law many of these bills proposed to use the revenues from the wpt to offset the burden of higher gasoline prices for consumers19 there were two types of windfall profits tax bills in the 109th congress those that would have imposed an excise tax on windfall profits based on the price of crude oil and those that would have imposed an income tax on windfall profits based on either the existing tax laws definition of corporate taxable inco or excessive rates of return excise tax type of wpt as noted above the wpt that was in effect from 19801988 was not an income tax but an exci tax it was not type of tax that most economists would consider true tax in windfall gains or income the tax was imposed on the difference between the ma rket price of oil which was technically referred to as the removal price and statutory 1979 base price that was adjusted quarterly for inflation and state severance taxes almost every barrel of domestically produced crude oil ie every barre l of domestic production that was not specifically taxexempt was subject to this excise tax the excise tax type of wpt was the type proposed in most of the wpt bills in the 109th congress these bills would have generally imposed an excise tax equal to 50 of the windfall profits not reinvested in 1 oilgas exploration and drilling 2 increased refinery capacity 3 renewable electricity property or 4 facilities for producing alcohol fuels or biodiesel th bills would have defined windfall profit as the difference between the market price of oil at the wellhead and an inflationadjusted base price of 40ba rrel in other words they would have effectively defined windfall as the diffe rence between the market oil price and 40 s 1631 hr 3752 hr 4203 hr

income tax system to assess the tax or defining the tax ba in terms of taxable income under the existing corporate income tax typical of the income tax type of wpt were those that would have imposed 50 tax on the excess of the adjusted taxable income for taxable year over the average taxable income during the 20002004 period the 50 tax would have applied to crude producers nd integrated oil companies with sales in 2005 or 2006 above 100 million the tax would have b een temporary and would apply to petroleum products as well as crude oil s 1809 schumer and hr 4276 larson in the house were

proposals some wpt proposals are not easily classified for example hr 2070 kuc inich hr 3664 kanjorski and hr 3544 defazio would have imposed gra duated tax with the rates 50 75 or 100 dependent on the extent to whic h profits exceed reasonable level as determined by specially created board or commission these bills differ however on how the taxs proceeds would be used20 whether these wpt would have been excise tax based or income tax based or whether they w ould have used some other tax base is unknown since the bills did not provide definition of either profits or reasonable profit windfall profit tax legislation in the 110th congress wpt proposals have been introduced in the 110th congress although there are fewer excise tax based and more income tax based than in the 109th congress also many of the income tax based proposals have focuse d on repealing the irc 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities which is effectively equivalent to an increase in the existing marginal corporate tax rate and is not really tax on windfall profits as discussed in more detail below the corporate income tax systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs13 21 s 3044 would also roll back 17 billion in existing oil and gas industry tax breaks over 10 years for the largest oil companies revenues would be earmarked to expanding renewable energy development in addition to the tax provisions s 3044 would prohibit and provide penalties for price gouging by th oil and gas industry tighten regulation of speculators in offshore oil and suspend f illing of the strategic petroleum reserve could be used as an administratively simple way to increase the tax burden on the oil and gas industry and approx imate wpt without the risk s of adverse economic and energy market effects excise tax type of wpt s 1238 casey would impose 50 excise tax on any major integrated oil company based on the difference between the market price of oil and 50 this 50 would be adju sted annually for inflation this bill is the only bill to propose an excise type of wpt in the 110th congress income tax type of wpt on the senate side two bills introduced by senator clinton s 701 and s 2971 would tax half of the excess profits of major integrated oil producers and oil produ cers with gross re venues above 100 million per year excess profit woul d be defined as taxable income above 110 of the average taxable incomes over the 20002004 pe riod thus these bills would use the existing tax law definition of taxable inco which as discussed below not only facilitates tax administration and co mpliance but also minimizes economic distortions and adverse s hortrun economic effects s 2991 and s 3044 reid take similar approach to the clinton bills but would 1 tax excess profits at lower rate 25 instead of 50 and 2 use 20012005 20022006 in s 3044 as the base period rather than 20002004 also any increased i nvestment in renewable energy over the same base period would be credited toward the tax and hence reduce the windfall profit tax liability s 3044 reid is the mocratic leadership bill it was introduced on june 11 200821 other types of wpt proposals hr 5800 kanjorski and hr

company income statements available at httpwwwhooverscom such taxes however do not belie the ex istence of windfall gains or unearned income and do not necessarily undermine the case for wpt well designed and structured wpt tax however would tax only the true windfall component of oil industry incomes moreover such tax w ould be simple to administer and comply with and would avoid or minimize any adve rse economic and energy market effects as the discussion below suggests while in theory the concept of windfall profit seems simple and intuitive in practice it can be difficult to measure accurately and so the actual implementation of wpt i nvolves compromise over differing fiscal policy objectives 1 administerability collecting the excess revenues or windfall gains in the least costly manner in terms of tax administration and compliance 2 economic efficiency devising and structuring the tax in way that minimizes economic distortions including adverse output and price effects and adverse impacts on petroleum imports energy inde pendence and energy security the remaining sections of this report discuss some of the more important economic issues surrounding proposed gislation and draw relevant policy implications the final section discusses alternative policy options defining and measuri ng windfall gains the most vexing problem in designing wpt is how to define true windfall ie the tax base in theory there is di fference even if s ubtle difference betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs15 windfall gain excess profit and an earned gain windfall gain applies to income or wealth that is unexpected ga in which arrives fortuitously possibly due to factors outside of the control of the institution in questi on this can be distinguished from excess profits which might be considered to be more subjective and are based on defining an acceptable prof it and attributing everything above that level as excessive this difference might be illustrated with hypothetical example firm might be so efficient that its boveaverage prof itability or returns might be considered excessive but not windfall however if its pr oduction waste which formerly was costly to dispose of became valuable that gain might be considered windfall finally one might differen tiate both windfall profit and an excess profit from an economic rent technical term for the return to fixed factor of production or resource for such resources that are in fixed supply economic analysis suggests that earned profits are not necessary for the services of that factor to be available to the market the record profits reported by the oil and gas industry have characteristics of both windfall gains excess profits and even economic rents although they are more in the nature of quasirents than pure economic rents because some industry investment effort and risk is required for production oil supply is not perfectly inelastic thus for purposes of taxing this income from the perspective of merely raising revenues it matters little whether the tax is an excise tax or income tax type or whether it is based on industry rate s of returns compared to rates of return in other industries manufacturing for exam ple or in the general economy since the profits are pricedriven and since there is little or output or investment effect either the excise tax or income tax or rate of return type could be used to collect the windfall rather the critical difference in the type of wpt tax to implement is in the firms economic response to the tax and in the cost of administration and compliance costs the next two sections of this repor t examine the output and price effects of the two different types of wpt it also ex amines the effects on the demand for oil imports and therefore energy independence and energy security finally this section examines variety of other tax options for increasing the tax burden on the oil and gas industry options that have been offered as alternatives to the wpt in general the conclusions of this analysis are that an excise tax is nonneutral and could have adverse economic effects particularly on the level of depe ndence on foreign oil while the income tax approach is relatively neutral in the short run thus minimizing economic distortions and othe r adverse economic effects the nonneutral economic effects of the excise tax type of wpt as discussed in more detail below an excise tax on domestically produced crude oil may only appr oximate windfall profit tax and may have certain adverse energy market and economic effects in other words depending on how wpt were structured an excise tax type of wpt for instance by reinstating the wpt of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs16 1980s might make the united states mo re dependent upon fore ign oil which in turn might have implications for energy security output effects economic theory suggests that wpt in the form of an excise tax eg hr 3752 and s 1631 in the 109th congress s 1238 in the 110th congress could reduce domestic oil production in economic terms oil producers would likely view the tax as an increase in the marginal or incremental cost of domes tic oil production the marginal cost of producing every barrel of taxa ble crude oil would be higher by the amount of the excise tax an increase in the marginal cost of production might be viewed as an incentive to produce less oil however this effect is likely to be mitigated in the us oil market by other factors the theoretical analysis assumes that the difference between price and marginal cost is relatively small implying that the imposition of tax would reduce profits to or below the competitive level in the current oil market oil prices are typically far above the marginal cost of production implying that even after paying tax profitability could remain high continuing to provide an incentive for production the economic anal ysis also assumes that some cheaper alternative source of oil is available to substitute for taxed domestic production firms are unlikely to pay the market price for oil in the international oil market instead of using domestic production if they did this they would lose the difference between the price and cost of domestic oil substituting foreign oil for which price is effectively equivalent to marginal cost finally marginal production adjustments are unlikely to be made to existing oil we lls once an oil well goes into production the maximum sustainable flow rate is likely to simultaneously be the maximum economic flow rate allowing for oil fi eld management to be based on physical factors related to output oil imports and energy independence if the domestic supply of oil were reduced in response to an excise tax on domestically produced oil the demand for imported oil and petroleum pr oducts would likely increase unless some other policy would concomitantly reduce the demand fo r petroleum to offset taxinduced reduced supply this is because oil im ports to the united states are residual adjusting to reflect the difference between aggregate demand for oil and aggregate domestic oil supply price effects one of the concerns and one of the arguments made by opponents of wpt is that such tax would raise prices wpt on crude oil would raise the price of crude oil whic h would then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher petroleum product prices higher prices of gasoline diesel jet fuel and other products if true then this might defeat one of the purposes of imposing such tax to relieve consum ers both personal and business consumers such as truck drivers from the burden that recent high gasoline and diesel price have had on them as noted an excise tax only on oil pr oduced domestically in the united states would increase marginal or incremental production costs and in theory profit maximizing firm would respond to this type of tax by reducing output and attempting to raise prices to offset th higher marginal production co sts however in the case of domestic crude oil the higher marginal cost cannot be shifted forward as higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs17 23 there may be some small price effects if the export supply curve is not perfectly elasticoil price because oil is priced in the international world oil market23 oil producers would not be able to shift the tax forwar d as higher oil selling price because the first purchaser generally the refiner would merely substitute imported crude which would be taxexempt instead this type of wpt would reduce the net selling price paid to producers as noted earlier the fi rst purchaser would subtract the tax from the price paid to the producer supplier the producers net selling price of each barrel of oil would be less by the amount of the wpt the neutrality of the corporate income tax type of wpt output effects from an economic perspective the income tax based wpt such as those that use the existing corporate tax system to define excess or windfall taxable income w ould be relatively neutral in the short run it would have or few output or price effects nd other economic effects the reason for this is that firm maximizes profit at the point at which market prices are equal to marginal production costs and neither are ffected in the short run by an increase in the corporate tax burden the profit max imizing level of output and price are unaffected by the tax thus to the extent that surtax on the corporate income of crude oil producers on their upstream operati ons could approximate such tax this would not raise crude oil prices and woul d not tend to increase petroleum imports in the short run in the long run however all taxes or almost all taxes distort resource allocation and even corporat profit tax either of the pur type or the surtax on the existing rates would raise average long term production costs reduce the rate of return and reduce the flow of capital into th industry relative to other industries and move resources away from the corporate form of business organization all these effects could adversely ffect domestic production possibly resulting in increased petroleum imports oil imports and energy independence because the income tax type of wpt does not create incentives to reduce dom estic production in the short run there is increase in the demand for imports unde r such tax in the short run although it could if the tax were still in effect in the long run price effects from an economic perspective that is to say in theory increasing marginal tax rates on corporat income would have or few price effects the reason is as before firm maximizes profit at the point at which market prices are equal to marginal production costs and neither are affected by an increase in marginal tax rates the profit maximizing level of price is unaffected by such tax alternative policy options as mentioned above should congress decide to tax oil industry surpluses there would be several alternative policy options to increase taxes on the domestic oil and gas industry including eliminating the i ndustrys several targ eted tax subsidieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs18 24 see crs report rl33763 oil and gas taxes and subsidies current status and analysis by salvatore lazzari 25 repealing this deduction has been part of almost every major energy tax bill in the congress over the last two years section 199 re peal is also part of the socalled gang of 16 draft energy bill number yet which would also open up much of the outer continental shelf to oil and gas production and restrict speculation in the oil commodities futures markets 26 crs report rl32652 the 2004 corporate tax and fsceti bill the american jobs creation act of 2004 by david l brumbaugh 27 corporations are currently taxed at 15 of the first 50000 of taxable income 25 of the taxable income from 50001 to 75000 34 of the taxable income from 75001 to 10 million and 35 of taxable income above 10 millionreducing tax benefits provided through the general or nontargeted provisions of the tax code or even elimina ting the tax incentives enacted under epact05 these options are discussed in separate crs report24 rather the remaining sections of this report address alternatives that are really variations on the two wpt options discussed before rescinding the 199 deduction one option that has been proposed frequently in congressional bills is the repeal of or reduction in the irc 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities this option does not actually attempt to measure or tax windfall profits but uses the existing corporate income tax system to effectively increase the marginal corporate tax rate on domestic oil and gas producers targeting primarily the major integrated oil companies25 enacted in 2004 as an export tax incentive this provision allows deduction as business expense for specified pe rcentage of the qualif ied production activitys income or profit subject to limit of 50 of the wages paid that are allocatable to the domestic production during the taxable year the deduction was 3 of income for 2006 is currently 6 and is scheduled to increase to 9 when fully phased in by 2010 for the domestic oil and gas indus try which qualifies for this deduction ie it is not excluded from claiming it the deduction applies to oil and gas or any primary product thereof provided that such product was manufactured produced or extracted in whole or in significant part in the united states note that extraction is considered to be manufacturing for pur poses of this deduction which means that domestic firms in the business of extrac ting oil and gas from underground reservoirs or deposits qualify for the deduction this deduction was enacted under the american jobs creation act of 2004 pl 108357 so known as the jobs bill it was originally substitute for repeal of the export tax benefits unde r the extraterritorial income tax exclusion which was ruled to be in violation of trade laws26 repealing or cutting back this deduction would be effectively equivalent to an increase in the marginal income tax rate and as noted earlier change in the corporate tax burden in the short run is re latively neutral for example at the top marginal corporate tax rate of 35 which typically applies to large corporations such as major oil and gas producers and refiners the current duction of 6 is equivalent to marginal corporate income tax rate of 329 35 x 094 rather than 3527 the proposed elimination of this deduction w ould be thus equivalent to an increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs19 28 the proposed repeal or cutback in the 199 deduction could also be way of funding other provisions in the bills 29 s 3044 also restricts the ability of major il and gas companies to claim tax credits for taxes and other payments to foreign governments against the us tax on foreign source income which also is way of in creasing the corporate tax burdenin the marginal tax rate from 329 to 35 for those major oil companies to which this would apply all other large corporations would continue to face top marginal tax rate of 329 with the exception of nonmanufacturing enterprises services for example which do not qualify for the 199 deduction thus as noted this option does not attempt to measure and tax the oil industrys windfall prof its it is just way of using the existing corporate income tax system to increase the tax burden on the oil industry nd recoup some of the windfall or excess profits in the form of corporate income taxes28 as before eliminating the deduction that is to say raising the corporate tax rate would increase total or average business costs and therefore reduce profitability among the major oil and gas pr oducers as long as marginal production costs are unaffected there would be price effects in the short run similarly the demand for imports is likely to remain the sa in the shortrun thus this type of corporate income tax increase would arguably be an administratively simple and economically effective way to capture at l east some of the oil industrys windfalls in the short run however at current deduc tion of 6 and marginal corporate tax rate of 35 only small portion of the i ndustrys likely windfalls would likely to be captured under this option the market price of crude oil and natura l gas or even of refined petroleum products such as gasoline would not be exp ected to increase very much if at all by such change in the short run in gene ral also the income tax increases are not expected to have real output effects in the short run although they could cause resources to flow to other industries in the long run as long as these other industries are allowed the manufacturing deduction which is quivalent to lower marginal tax rate an income type wpt tax and 199 repeal some wpt proposals combine the wpt with repeal or re duction in the 199 manufacturing activities deduction this effectively uses two instru ments to raise the corporate tax rate on domestic oil and gas producers which as not ed before would be relatively neutral in terms of its price output and import eff ects one bill that takes this approach is s 3044 which would rescind the irc 199 deduction for major integrated oil companies and assess 25 tax on the di fference between profits in any one year and 110 of the average of profits over the 20022006 period29 this bill follows many of the earlier bills in th at it attempts to recoup for the federal taxpayer some of the windfall or excess prof its reported by the oil and gas industry as result of unprecedented high petroleum prices tax on imported and domestically produced crude oil if instead an excise tax were to be imposed broa dly on both imported as well as domestically produced oil as proposed in the early 1980s by the reagan administration this taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs20 30 eliminating the gasoline tax would deny th highway trust fund of its principal source of revenue unless some adjustment were made see crs report rl30497 suspending the gas tax analysis of s 2285 by salvatore lazzari and crs report rl34475 transportation fuel taxes impacts of repeal or moratorium by john w fischer and robert pirogwould produce upward price effects the price of crude oil in the united states would tend to be higher than under the wpt on domestic oil alone this is because the tax would be imposed on imports which are the marginal source of oil supplies and therefore the benchmark for crude il prices the effect on domestic production and the level of imports dependence on foreign impor ts would depend on the size of the tax and the price elastic ities of domestic suppl and import demand an excise wpt and gas tax suspension an excise tax holiday suspension of the 184gallon tax on gasolin combined with an equal revenue wpt on oil would be comple tely counterbalanced or offsetting eliminating the gasoline tax might cause refiners to reduce prices over time by the amount of the tax depending on the state of the energy mark et at the time of suspension or somewhat less depending on tax incidence which depends on the ratio of price elasticities of the demand and supply schedules but the excisetax based wpt on all crude oil ie one imposed on both imports and domes tic production would be shifted as higher price of crude oil bought by refine rs thus offsetting the decline in product prices30 possible revenue effects wpt on crude oil could generate siz eable revenues dependi ng on the tax rate and the tax base ie whether it was exci tax based or income tax based and depending on crude oil prices at the time the tax were imposed this section of the report does not provide reve nue estimates because crs ne ither has the data nor the estimating models to do so the excise tax based wpt probably s the greatest revenue potential merely because of the high recent level of crude oil prices and because the tax base is not adjusted for operating costs operating co sts are not deducted from the tax base as in the case of the incometax based wpt to illustrate s 1238 casey would tax any major integrated producer on the diffe rence between market price and 50barrel at 50 rate if oil prices remain over 100 per barrel this tax could generate substantial revenues the income tax type of wpt generally has smaller revenue potential again because 1 taxable income is used as the tax base which is generally much smaller than book income which is the net income measure reported in table 4 also the income tax based proposal typi cally uses the average of taxable income over lagged fiveyear period thus in period of gene rally rising prices the base tends to progressively decline finally there are revenue estimates related to repeal of the irc 199 deduction these have been estimated several time in recent years by the joint committee onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34689crs21 taxation for several differe nt congressional proposals the figures reported in table 7 are the most recent available and show that over 10 years nearly 10 billion in additional revenue c ould be collected from repealing the 199 deduction for major integrated oil producers it should be noted that the figures in table 7 would
