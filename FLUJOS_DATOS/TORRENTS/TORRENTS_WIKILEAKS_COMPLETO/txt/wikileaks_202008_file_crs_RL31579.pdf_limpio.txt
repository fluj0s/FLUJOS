widening range of economic activities such as accounting and legal services banking transportation tourism and telecommunications services are significant sector of the us economy accounting for almost 70 of us gro ss domestic product gdp and for over 80 of us civilian employment services have become an important element of us foreign trade consistently generating surpluses the european union is by far the most important us trade partner in services accounting for more than 50 of us trade in services the increasing importance of services in domestic and global trade have placed them on the us agenda for bilateral and regional trade agreements and services trade occupies prominent place on the agenda of the united states and the other 152 members of the world trade organization wto in the doha development agenda round of multilateral nego tiations furthermore disputes related to trade in services have arisen increasingly between the unite d states and the european union japan canada and other majo r trading partners the congress will have number of trade agreements to consider and services will be an important part of the deliberations an overview of barriers of the disputes in services trade and of the rapi dly changing characteristics of the services sector suggest that the negotiations nd the agreements they produce will become increasingly complex the united states presses its trading partners to liberalize their services sector as much as possible because us servi ces providers are very competitive in world markets however to accomplish its objectives the united states is pressed by its partners to make concessi ons that might adversely affect importsensitive industries in the united states us ne gotiators and ultimate ly congress will have to

activities not directly associated with the manufact ure of goods mining or agriculture they typically involve the provision of human va lueadded in the form of labor advice managerial skill entertainment tr aining intermediation and the like1 services differ from manufactured goods primarily in that they are intangible so they cannot be stored and must be consumed at th point of production trips to the doctor enjoying meal at the re staurant however rapi d changes in technology are reducing even these restrictions on services computer software that can be stored online on disks tape etc2 illustrative examples of services include wholesale and retail trade transportation and warehousing informati on finance and insurance professional scie ntific and technical services education arts and entertainment health care and social ssistance food and accommodation services construction communication and public administration3 services are an increasingl significant sector of the us economy in 1976 they accounted for 55 of us gdp in 2006 they accounted for 68 of us gdp4 in 2007 workers in the services sector accounted for 84 of the total civilian workforce5 the significance of services to na tional economy and to the global economy go beyond what can be measured by data many services not only have intrinsic value but are also critical to running othe r parts of large economies for example financial services banking investment insurance are the means by which capital flows throughout an economy from those who ve it savers investors to those who need it borrowers financial services are often called the lifeblood of an economy there is symbiotic relationship between many services providers and manufacturers demand for one creates demand for the other many manufacturers are dependent on transportation communica tion and distribution services networks to ensure that inputs are available for th production of goods and to deliver final goods to consumers for example car manufacturers depe nd on transportation services trucking rail etc to make re that component pa rts are available for assembly and that completed cars are delivered to dealers at the same time demand for services creates demand for manufact ures for example the production of communication services leads to demand fo r telephones radios computers and other communications apparatuseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs3 6 us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis us international acc ounts data july 1 2008 us trade in services us trade in services as narrowly meas ured plays an importa nt role in overall us trade albeit much smaller role than domestic services play in the overall us economy and the relative importance of trade in services has remained quite constant between 1986 and 2001 for example the share of services in overall us exports in goods and services remained at around 28 although it increased to 30 by 2003 where it has remained from 1986 to 2007 the sh are of us imports of goods and services accounted for by servi ces has been 1618 these data are presented in table 1 these shares are substantially lower than one might expect from sector that dominates the domestic economy6 table 1 also shows that the united states continually realizes surpluses in services trade which have partially offset large trade deficits in goods trade in the us current account these figures only measure trade in services that take place across borders as presented in the us official balance of payments data table 1 us trade

department of commerce bureau of economic analysis because most services re quire direct contact betw een supplier and consumer many service providers prefer to establish or must establish presence in the country of the consumer for example hotel and restaurant services by their very nature require presence in the country of the consumer providers of legal accounting and construction services prefer direct presence because they need access to expert knowledge of the laws and regulations of the country in which they are doing business and they require proximity to clients thus crossborder services trade data do not capture all of the trade in services httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs4 7 bureau of economic analysis us department of commerce sales of services to foreign and us markets through crossborder trade and thr ough affiliates httpwwwbeagovdata on sales of services by foreign affiliates of usowned companies and by us affiliates of foreign owned firms help to provide more accurate albeit still incomplete measurement of trade in servi ces in 2005 the latest year for which published data are available us firms sold 529 billion in services to foreigners through their majorityowned foreign affilia tes in 2005 foreign firms sold to us residents 389 billion in services through their majorityowned foreign affiliates located in the united states7 the data for crossborder trade and for sales by majorityowned affiliates are not directly compatible therefore it is difficult to derive an accurate overall measure of services trade even these two sets of figures do not capture the total value of trade in services two other modes of services delivery are through the temporary movement of consumers to the location of the provider and the temporary movement of the provider to the location of the consumer us data on the sales of services via these two modes of delivery are not readily available see text boxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs5 8 the following description and examples of modes of delivery is based on and adapted from the description contained in oecd gats the case for open services markets paris 2002 p 60the four modes of delivery for trade in services international agreements on trade in services including the general agreement on trade in services gats which is administered by the world trade organization wto identifies four modes of supply of services8 mode 1 crossborder supply the service is supplied from one country to another the supplier and consumer re main in their respective countries while the service crosses the border example us architectural firm is hired by client in mexico to design building the us firm does the design in its home country and sends the blueprints to its client in mexico mode 2 consumption abroad the consumer physically travels to another country to obtain the service ex ample mexican client travels to the united states to obtain the services of us architectural firm mode 3 commercial presence the supply of service by firm in one country via its branch agency or who llyowned subsidiary located in another country example us architectural firm establis hes subsidiary in mexico to sell services to local clients mode 4 presence of natural persons individual suppliers travel temporarily to another country to supply services example us architect travels to mexico to provide design services to her mexican client identifying the various modes of deliv ery of services is important for measuring the volume of services trade that takes place each mode requires different method of measurement and th data derived from these measurements are not likely to be compatible across the four modes that is one cannot combine the data on services traded via mode 1 w ith data derived from services traded via mode 3 in order to obtain total iden tifying the modes is also important for policy purposes because issues raised by trade in mode1can be different from issues raised by trade in another mode for example the trade barriers faced by providers in mode 1 are not necessarily the same as those faced by providers in mode 4 therefore knowing the different modes helps to frame policy issues and solutions source the description and examples of modes of delivery are based on and adapted from the description contained in oecd gats the case for open services markets paris 2002 p

providers strive to incr ease foreign trade us policymakers are faced with number of challenges in constructing an international environment that is conducive to increased trade in services one challenge is identifying the foreign government laws regulations and policies that impede trade flows and prevent the international system of trade in services from operating efficiently while some of these barriers are similar to those that exis t in goods trade many are different and more complex and therefore sometimes difficult to iden tify second challenge derives from the first working with trading partners to build and administer rules of the road to facilitate trade in services the current rules the general agreement on trade in services gats are recen t phenomenon and are at an early stage of development third challenge is managing disputes that arise when trading partners do not agree on how trade in rvices should be conducted barriers to trade in services because of the fundamental differences between goods and services the barriers that foreign service providers face are different from thos faced by goods suppliers many barriers in goods trade tariffs nd quotas for example are at the border restrictions on services trade occur largely within the borders of the importing country and are in the form of government regulations the right of governments to regulate some services industries is widely recognized as prudent and necessary to protect consumers from dangerous or unqualif ied providers for example doctors and othe r medical personnel must be licensed by government appointed boards lawyers fi nancial services providers and many other professional service providers must be also certified in some manner governments regulate to protect the economy from sudden and potentially harmful shocks for example controls on foreign currency transactions are designed to protect the economy from panic capital f light and to maintain stable exchange rates the question in foreign trade is whether these regulations are applied in discriminating and unn ecessarily restrictive manner because services transactions more often require direct contact between consumer and provider than is the case with goods trade many of the trade barri ers that foreign companies face pertain to the establishment of commercial presence in the consumers country in the form of direct investment or to the temporary m ovement of people m ode 4 sellers and consumers across borders general trade barriers some trade barriers are evident across services industries in most cases the restrictio ns are ostensibly gitimate but may have unintentional adverse affects on foreign services trade examples of such barriers include restrictions on international pa yments including repatriation of profits mandatory currency convers ions and restrictions on current account transactionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs11 9 world trade organization guide to the gats kluwer law international boston 2001 oecd working party of the trade committee assessing barriers to trade in services revised consolidated list of crosssectoral barriers paris february 28 2001restrictions on

local nationals permission for entry and provision of services contingent on local labor supply requirements restrictions on information transf er imposed to protect data and maintain privacy buy

equity ceilings local employment and sourcing re quirements restrictions on the form of investment that is bran ch subsidiary joint venture etc net national benefit requireme nts quotas imposed on number of foreign service suppliers requirements that the chief executive officer or other high level compan officials be local nationals or that certain proportion of compan ys directors be local nationals and licensing requirements to market and sell services9 industryspecific barriers in most cases service industry confronts barriers that are largely speci fic to that industry the following examples of major service industries and the barrier s they confront are illustrative construction and related services this category includes firms that are involved in the construction of both residential and comme rcial buildings firms that are involved in the construction of trans portation infrastructures such as roads bridges airports tunnels and similar stru ctures firms that install prefabricated structures and firms that provide finishing work to structures it is category of services in which us firms have proved highly competitive in the global market construction and related engineering serv ices is very labor intensive work combining low and highly specializedskilled labor firms that provide services in foreign markets usually require presen ce in the country either temporarily orhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs12 through foreign direct investme nt often in the form of partnership with local firm that has knowledge of local laws and other requirements b ecause these firms compete by offering specialized skills they frequently must be able to move highly skilled workers across borders in most countries the construction nd related services industry is tightly regulated for quality control and safety reasons governments require construction firms to meet technical standards and may so require developers to adhere to land use and environmental controls some restrictions might be applied ostensibly on nondiscriminatory basis but may be great er burden to foreign suppliers eg requirement that certain percentage of labor be cally sourced in number of countries local or regiona l trade associations have the authority to rule on applications of construction firms for required permits thereby creating conflict of interest as association members would have an interest in limiting competition some countries employ buy national policies that favor domestic construction firms in bidding on gove rnment projects in addition some governments tolerate private company collusive practices for example in japan local construction companies have practiced bidrigging called dango under this practice small group of japanese construction firms agree which of them would submit the lowest bid and therefore get the contract they rotate the winning bidder among them from project to pr oject the practice would guarantee work among the participants but would keep foreign and other domestic competitors out travel and tourism travel and tourism is multifaceted industry it encompasses lodging and restaurants including catering travel agencies and tour operators and tourist guide services it ranks among the top five service industries in more than 75 of the countries and is among the top sectors in us crossborder services trade for many smaller countries it is the primary means of earning foreign exchange travel and tourism is laborintensive industry that is highly dependent on other service sectors tran sportation construction to insure that sufficient and appropriate lodging and other facilities ar available to tourists advertising telecommunications and distribu tion services among others it is an industry that is undergoing major changes as the use of th internet and the introduction of other technologies change how tourism and travel services are delivered the industry faces few direct trade barriers but is indirectly affected by regulations pertaining to the movement of people immigration visa s transportation for example the distribution of slots to foreign airlines at major airports movement of money for example foreign exchange requirements and construction standards for example the quality of hotels and ot her tourist necessities banking and financial services banking and financ ial services cover wide range of economic activities maintaining deposits lending money brokering of securities stocks and bonds brokering of many types of insurance health life auto home and specialized insurance ma naging pension funds and other assets financial planning nd more it is also an industry in which american firms have proved to be highly competitive and have growing global presence in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs13 10 world trade organization pp 331352 for more information on us foreign trade in financial services see archived crs report rl31110 us trade in financial services an overview by patricia wertman and william h cooperamong the industries that comprise the servi ces sector it is perhaps the most complex not only because of its scope of activities but also because of its importance viable financial sector is critical to an economy it functions primarily to protect the financial assets of residents and to facilitate the flow of capital from savers and investors to borrowers the sector has undergone rapid changes recently technology especially the emergence of the internet has facilitated sales of insurance the transmission of deposits and the purchase and sale of securities across international borders furt hermore many countries ve liberalized regulation of financial industries allowing for increased foreign ownership and the reduction of firewalls between fi nancial industries at the same time because of their im portance to the maintenance of economic stability financial services are heavily regulated sector many regulations are applied to protect investors and depositors and to ensure the viability of the sector these regulations such as deposit insurance reserve requirements capitalization requirements and the like are considered prudent to maintaining healthy financial system however fine line exists at times between prudent requirements and requirements that are used to protect th domestic industry from foreign competition for example governments often require in surance brokers and ot her financial agents to be licensed to protect customers from unqualified or othe rwise questionable providers but licensing can also be used to restrict competition and protect favored companies foreign banks frequently face restrictions on the type of direct investment they can make in country the types of services they can provide or the number of facilities they can establish in th country or in re gion of the country foreignowned insurance companies may confront restrictions on the type of insurance they can sell for example some countries prohibit foreign companies from selling life insurance or auto insurance10 establishing rules on trade in services the united states is working with trading partners to develop and implement rules on trade in services on several fronts the broadest and most challenging are the multilateral rules contained in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gats that is administered by the wo rld trade organization wto rules on trade in services are also part of the north american free trade agreement nafta and other regional nd bilateral free trade agreements furthermore they will likely be an aspect of free trade agreements ftas now under negotiation or discussion the wto and gats the seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted more than quarter century ago in the trade act of 1974 the congress instructed the administration to push for an agreement on trade in services under the general agreement on tariffs nd trade gatt during the tokyo round negotiations while the tokyo round concluded in 1979 without serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs14 11 feketekuty geza international trade in services an overview and blueprint for negotiations american enterprise institute ballinger publishers 1988 p 194 12 this description of the gats is based on wt secretariat trade in services division an introduction to the gats october 1999 http wwwwtoorg not all services issues were resolved when the uruguay round was completed in 1993 negotiations on financial services and telecommunications services c ontinued until agreements were reached in 1997 13 the gats differs from the gatt in that it has allowed members to take temporary exemptions to mfn treatment the exemptions are listed in special annex to the gats the gats allows only these onetime exemptions the gats as is the case of the gatt also allows mfn exemptions in the cases of regional agreementsagreement the industrialized countries led by the united states continued to press for its inclusion in later negotiations veloping countries w hose service sectors are less advanced than those of the industr ialized countries were reluctant to have services included eventually services we re included as part of the uruguay round negotiations launched in 198611 at the end of the round countries agreed to new set of rules for services the gats and new agency the wto to administer the gats and other agreements reached the gats the gats provides the first and only multilateral framework of principles and rules for government po licies and regulations affecting trade in services among more than 100 countries representing many levels of economic development the gats remains work in progress and its expansion is part of the new round of wto negotia tions launched in novemb er 2001 in doha qatar the gats agreement most of which was completed by december 1993 is divided into six parts12 part i article i defines th scope of the gats it provides that the gats applies to all services except those supplied in the routine exercise of government authority to all government barriers to trade in services at all levels of government national regional and local and to all four modes of delivery of services part ii articles iixv presents the principles and obligations some of which mirror those for trade in goods while others are specific to servi ces these principles and obligations include unconditional mostfavorednation mfn nondiscriminatory treatment that is services impor ted from one member country cannot be treated any less favorably than the services imported from another member country 13 transparency that is governments must publish rules and regulations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs15 14 archived crs report 951051 services trade and the uruguay round by arlene wilson p 17reasonable impartial and objective administration of government rules and regulations that apply to covered services monopoly suppliers must act consistently with obligations under the gats in covered services member incurring balance of payme nts diffi culties may temporarily restrict trade in services covered by the agreement and member may circumvent gats obligations for national security purposes part iii articles xvixviii of the gats establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members the gats binds each member to its commitme nts once it has made them that is member country may not im pose less favorable treatment than what it has committed to prohibits membercountry governments from placing limits on suppliers of services from other mber countries regarding the number of foreign service suppliers the total value of service transactions or assets the number of transactions or value of output the type of legal entity or joint venture through which services may be supplied and the share of foreign capital or total value of foreign direct investment requires that member government s accord service suppliers from other member countries national treatment that is foreign service or service provider may not be tr eated any less favorably than domestic provider of the service and allows members to negotiate further reductions in barriers to trade in services importantly unlike mfn treatment and the othe r principles listed in part ii which apply to all service providers mo re or less unconditiona lly the obligations under part iii are restricted they apply only to those services and modes of delivery listed in each members schedule of co mmitments thus unless member country has specifically committed to open up its market to service suppliers in particular service that is provided via one or more of the four modes of delivery the national treatment and market access obligations do not pply this is often referred to as the positive list approach to trade commitments each member countrys schedule of commitments is contained in an annex to the gats14 the schedules of commitments are in essence the core of the gats httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs16 parts ivvi articles xixxxix are technical but important elements of the agreement among other things they in clude the requirement that later than 2000 the gats members start ne w negotiations which they have done to expand coverage of the agreement and establish the requirement that conflicts between members involving implement ation of the gats be handled in the wtos dispute settlement mechanism the gats also includes eight annexes including one on mfn exemptions another annex provides prudential carve out that is recognition that governments ta ke prudent actions to prot ect investors or otherwise maintain the integrity of the national fina ncial system these prudent actions are allowed even if they conflict with obligations under the gats evaluations of the gats in its first ven years range from those who view the glass as half empty to those who see the glass as half full the more pessimistic school argues that not much has been acco mplished in gats that at best members committed themselves to maintain the status quo before the gats went into effect these critics argue that some countries actually made commitment s that were more restrictive than their current practices furthermore critics question the value of the socalled positive list approach to members commitments which can lead to slower and more tedious trade lib eralization negotiations the more optimistic school considers th mere establishment of the gats to be an important accomplishment considering that many countries strongly resisted even negotiating on services at the begi nning of the uruguay round in addition even though the initial commitments may have only locked members in at the status quo they are bound by those commitments from sliding back into more protectionism and may actually open up th eir services sectors as negotiations proceed continuing negotiations article xix of the gats required wto members to begin new set of negotiations on services in 2000 as part of the so called wto builtin agenda in so doing it guaranteed that wto members will pursue negotiations on services even if th ey are not able to begin new full round article xix stipulates that participants work to resolve some conceptual and procedural issues for example how to give negotiating credit to governments that had unilaterally liberalized their services sectors since the conclusion of the first set of negotiations and whether to provide speci treatment to leas t developed countries the new set of gats negotiations be gan in february 2000 and during the remainder of that year the members reviewed the status of commitments already made and developed t of guidelines in addition to the issues mandated by article xix the guidelines stipulate that negotiators will continue to use the servicespecific modespecific positive list approach wto members successfully launched the doha velopment agenda dda round in november 2001 the ministerial declaration that announced the mandates for the round folded the services negotia tion into the agenda of the dda round by most accounts the participants in the dda services negotiations have made little progress at the december 2005 biennial ministerial meeting in hong kong wto negotiators were supposed to have good indication of what final agreementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs17 will look like if the doha round is to be completed by the nd of 2006 participants have expressed widespread disappointment with the offers that have been made the prospects of the negotiations were set back even further when wto directorgeneral pascal lamy susp ended the dda including the services negotiations on july 24 2006 after meetin g of the g6 wto members consisting of the united states the european union japan australia brazil and india failed to agree on the basic conditions or moda lities for conducting the agriculture and nama negotiations although the negotia tions resumed in 2007 progress on the services negotiations rema ins stagnant at best several possible reasons can be cited for the lack of progress one is the division between developed countries that ve advanced services sectors employing highlyskilled labor and th developing countries w ith lessdeveloped services industries the former group seeks mark et opportunities for its services providers and is more willing to open its markets to competition the latter group is more protective of its domestic services providers the halting progress in the agricultu re and nonagriculture market access nama negotiations in the dda has also ffected the services negotiations some developing countries have sserted that they will not improve their offers until the united states and the european union commit to reduce their agriculture subsidies third reason could be the complexity of the agenda of the services negotiations and the number of players i nvolved services includes broad range of economic activities many with few characteristics in common except that they are not goods the trade barriers exporters face differ across services sectors making the formulation of trade rules significant cha llenge furthermore services negotiations include many participants in addition to trade ministers they include representatives of regulatory agencies many of whom do not consider trade liberalization primary part of their mission the prospects for the negotiations are difficu lt to evaluate at this point it is not unusual for negotiations to lag as partic ipants wait to place their best negotiating positions on the table until just befo re crucial deadlines are reached several factors will determine if and when the services negotiations will be completed one factor is the political will the wto members can muster to overcome the obstacles that plague the nego tiations another factor is the extent to which the various participants are w illing to compromise on goals to reach agreements and third factor is how quickly the issues in agriculture and non agriculture market access are resolved the s ooner they are reso lved the sooner negotiators can devote their full attention to the services negotiations in september 2007 the chairman of the tr ade in services negotiations began process to develop draft text of an agreement and called on membercountry negotiators to submit contributions howe ver by the end of 2007 it was clear that the countries were still sharply divided on basic objectives developed countries including the united states have argu ed for membercountries at minimum to commit to binding their current practices on tr ade in services veloping

services in us regional and bilateral free trade agreements the united states has in place several bilateral and regional free trade agreements and is conducting negotiati ons on others this section provides brief overview of the treatme nt of services in these agreements and negotiations the north american free trade agreement nafta nafta which went into effect on january 1 1994 is the largest free trade agreement in which the united states participates naftas cove rage of services trade is very broad reflecting the comprehensive integration of the three participating economies chapter 12

services sectors and subsectors listed in annex ii and certain nondiscriminatory quotas listed in annex v in annex vi the three parties list their specific commitments to liberalize cross border trade in services major controversy erupted over trucking services as part of nafta the united states made commitment to permit mexican trucke rs to transport goods to the southern us border states beginning in 1995 and to the entire united states by january 2000 however in 1995 the clinton administration banned mexican truckers access beyond the border regions b ecause of concerns raised by the us trucking industry and others over the safety of mexican trucks the issue became source of tension between the two nafta partners httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs19 16 for more information on this

mplaint filed by mexico against the us ban an arbitration panel formed under nafta determined that the united states was violating its obligations but also ruled that the united states could impose

required system of certifying the safety of mexican trucks before they would be allo wed access to the rest of the united states on june 27 2002 secretary of transportati on norman mineta indicated that the system was almost complete and that certification of mexican trucking companies would probably begin before the end of the summer of 200217 the department of trans portation launched pilot program in september 6 2007 that allows some mexican trucks to deliver goods in the united states the program has been opposed by the teamsters union and some members of congress18 other ftas the usisraeli fta the first in which the united states has participated went into effect in au gust 1985 because rvices are small component of usisraeli trade they are not significant part of the agreement in the agreement the united states and israel committed themselves to provide national treatment to each others services and to make their laws and regulations affecting services transparent the usjordan fta entered into force on december 17 2001 usjordan trade is small and services are not significant part of that trade but are nevertheless covered in article 3 of the agreement ar ticle

been signed but have not been considered by congress most of these ftas contain provisions dea ling with services trade19 implications for us trade policy and the congress the background information and analysis presented here indi cate that services are significant component of the us economy accounting for major portion ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31579crs20 us employment it is also component in which us firms have proved to be globally competitive the services sector is also very broad and encompasses an ever expanding range of economic activities of varying types the broad scope of the services sector presents policy challeng to us policymakers including the congress as the united states works with trading partners to build regimes under which they will conduct trade in services the number and variety of negotiations planned or already underway suggests that congress will have number of trade agreements to consider and that services will be an important part of the deliberations an overview of barriers of the disputes in services trade and of the rapi dly changing characteristics of the services sector all suggest that the negotiations and the agreements they produce will become increasingly complex the united states presses its trading partners to liberalize their services sector as much as possible because us servi ces providers are very competitive in world markets however to accomplish its objectives the united states is pressed by its partners to make concessi ons that adversely affect importsensitive industries in the united states us negotiators and ultimately congress w ill have to judge whether the agreements strike an ppropriate balance fo r us interests
