master monograph rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 47 know thyself and thou shalt know the universe and the gods 2006 supreme grand lodge of the ancient mystical order ros√¶ crucis 009 published by the grand lodge of the english language jurisdiction amorc inc 0707first atrium 4 concurrence 2among the scientific postulates that marked the ren aissance the most celebrated is indisputably that of nicolaus coperni cus who in his work entitled revolutinibus orbium coelestium on the revolutions of the celestial spheres established the heliocentric conception f our planetary system and revolutionized the science of astronomy the excerp t below is taken from this work it reflects the sagacity of the scientists of this era and the importance they accorded to the study of natural phenomena it also shows how difficult it is to fight against false beliefs and to let new truths b admitted earth is the place from which we observe the revolu tion of the heavens and where it is displayed to our eyes this motion seem s to embrace the whole world in fact everything that is outside of earth with the single exception of earth itself and yet if one admits that the heavens possess none of this motion and that earth rotates from west to east and if one should consid er this seriously with respect to the seeming rising and setting of the sun of th moon and the stars then one would find that it is actually true since the heav ens which contain and retain all things are the common home of all things it is t at once comprehensible why motion is ascribed to the thing containing rather than to the contained to the located rather than to the locating why are we not willing to acknowledge that the appe arance of daily revolution belonging to the heavens is in actualit earth the relation is similar to that of which virgils aeneas says we sail out of the harbor and the countries and cities recede f or when ship is sailing alon g quietly everything which is outside of it will appear to those on board to have motion corresponding to the movement of the ship and the voyagers are of the rroneous opinion that they with all that they have with them are at rest thi s can without doubt also apply to the motion of earth and it may appear as if the wh ole universe were revolving if one admits the motionlessness of the sun and tr ansfers the annual revolution from the sun to earth there would resul t in the same manner as actually observed the rising and setting of the co nstellations and the fixed stars by means of which they become morning and evening s tars and it will thus become apparent that also the haltings and backward and forward motion of the planets are not motions of these but of earth whic h lends them the appearance of being actual planetary motions nicolaus copernicus 1471543rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 4 dear fratres and sorores in previous monographs we explained to you that our perception and interpretation of things do not affect what they ar outside ourselves because the concept we have of them cannot change their vib ratory nature in this regard it is important to understand that everythi ng we know in the material world depends upon the way in which we perceive and interpret the vibrations of spirit our conception of the world also depends on our culture education and beliefs following is an example of grave error s that can be committed when we remain imprisoned by our false beliefs and place our faith in what we perceive through our objective faculties the theories of copernicus for centuries people believed that earth was flat and that it was the center of the iverse that erroneous belief was based on what they saw and on poor interpretation of what scripture revealed on this subject this point of view was unanimous even among scientists until the day when copernicus polish scientist expres sed doubts about this and about the theories concerning the rising and settin g of the sun day and night the seasons the origin of winds the effect of tid the apparent motions of celestial bodies etc as ptolemy had done in greec copernicus claimed that earth is round like ball and that human beings li ved on its surface moreover he established the heliocentric conception of our s olar system he asserted that the sunand not earthis the center of our planetar system adding that the seasons are due to the continual motion of earth wh ile revolving around the sun and that the alternation of day and night resu lts from earths rotation on its axis he did err in thinking that the trajector of the planets around the sun was circular whereas kepler major supporter of copernicus demonstrated nearly half century later that planetary orbits re elliptical even stating that the sun does not constitute the center of our plane tary system but rather one of its foci popular thought promptly rejected cope rnicuss theories however science gradually accepted them as they clarified phenomena that had remained misunderstood and unknown until then copernicus was more than mere scientist he was great mystic and sage sage being able to give valid explanations for pr eviously misunderstood facts without trying to impose them on others he was not absolutely certain about his theories and did not attempt to c onvince anyone else about their validity in the preface to one of his treatises copernicus stated that if anyone doubted the accura cy of his propositions and asked him for objective proof he could supply 4rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 4 none as most of his ideas had been inspired during his numerous meditations moreover he was very aware of the influence exerte d by religion on popular beliefs and on the study of cosmogony and thus he waited years before publishing his heliocentric theory of the universe copernicus knew that he would be persecuted as he retic he wrote if earth is truly the center of the universe and the w hole center of gods creation then humanity on earth might well be one of the gre atest objects of gods care however if my theory is correct and earth is only one of many planets revolving in space and not even the largest of them and if these others are also inhabited by humans then this earth upon which we live and t he human beings upon this earth may not be so important in gods scheme it is quite obvious that such an idea could only displease the leaders of th christian church because it challenged the religious dogmas of the era and g ave universal dimension to creation in 1540 copernicus officially announced his theorie s on may 24 1543 just as they were being published in the form of book he died after having incurred criticisms attacks and moral ordeals inf licted by catholic authorities and by minority of scholars blinded by the old do ctrines fortunately copernicus did not experience the fate later reserv ed for galileo or giordano bruno two of his greatest defenders the latter be ing burned at the stake as heretic in 1600 publication of copernicuss work w as prohibited in 1616 and this interdiction lasted almost two centuries gr eat number of his postulates are now taught as established facts in schools and universities whereas during his lifetime he was denigrated and compelle d to admit that he could not provide any scientific proof and his postulate s were rejected due to their incompatibility with religious doctrines this exam ple demonstrates to what extent cosmically inspired theories can be denied nd opposed because they do not correspond to the accepted ideas of an era nd because they find satisfactory proof in the objective faculties of hu man beings however time is the master of evolution and light always triump hs over darkness human ignorance due to intolerance and tendency to bel ieve only what we see cannot oppose forever the coming of knowledge copernicus giordano bruno and galileo were not th only ones who were victims of their wisdom and intellige nce history is replete with mystics and scholars who were conde mned during their lifetimes and ridiculed by the religious and scientific opinion of their day 5rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 4 on more personal level it is obvious that you ca n gain access to the knowledge of the mysteries only if you are able to question yourself regularly and to recognize that your conception of things may be erroneous ou must understand that human truths are relative as they n ecessarily evolve with time and with the discoveries of science to deny this i mplies that human beings know everything and have nothing more to learn we would be saying that everyone has attained perfection and that our earth ly evolution has been completed yet the reality is quite different in th at humanity is still far from having accomplished its cosmic mission as long as we have not received illumination and the supreme wisdom that it confers we must question our understanding of things and not believe that human knowledge is at standstill this also applies to our teachings because each mo nograph is primarily basis for reflection and meditation since the renaissance science has evolved greatly and the discoveries it has made in numerous areas have considerably improv ed living conditions in modern societies however we must not infer that s cience has penetrated all mysteries of the universe and that its explanations in various fields of research are always correct experience proves that science still has much to learn and that large number of its postulates are false it cannot be otherwise because scientific research is reflection of those who co nduct it it is necessarily limited and imperfect the merit of science lies pr ecisely in its striving toward perfection and in its desire to extend the boundari of the unknown we do hope that science will begin to give more spiritu direction to its work so as to contribute to the raising of consciousness to ward the divine cause of all that exists if the science of the 21st century doe s not free itself from its overly materialistic conceptions it runs the risk of over stepping its bounds and causing the destruction of the human species that is why w truly hope that tomorrows scientists will take into account the mystical know ledge available to them spirit the energy to which we have devoted the fir st monographs of this atrium constitutes good example of what we have just said this energy has been part of the research undertaken by science notably by physicists because science has been striving for years to unde rstand the origin of the forces of adhesion cohesion attraction and repul sion acting in matter only recently has science admitted that all energy manifested as adhesion cohesion attraction or repulsionhas vibratory nature in physics science has mastered most of the effect s produced by these forces and yet it has not succeeded in estab lishing unity 6rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 4 among them placing that unity in evidence will all ow science to determine the boundaries beyond which it should not cross in the application of its discoveries such truths were taught long ago in th ancient mystery schools finally we must recognize that many scientists pay attention to the philosophical principles that result from mystica l approach to material creation it is not because they are incapable of d oing so it is because they refuse to admit that everything tangible arises fro m world that is intangible contemporary science is still rejecting the concept of god such as rosicrucian may conceive it however time will come when sci ence will recognize the existence of cosmic intelligence of great arch itect of the universe of primordial energy to explain the unexplainable we will then witness fusion of the best of what science and mysticism have to ffer humanity the concept of property before summarizing the important laws you should remember in connection with our stu dy of spirit we will now consider philosophical problem that is connec ted with the mystical application of this study this involves the concep t of property if you accept that the whole of the material world owes its origi n to spirit and that this energy is of cosmic origin it then follows that ev erything that is part of our surroundings is the work of godor if you prefer of universal intelligence therefore in an absolute sense human beings have right of possession over things of this world from mystical point of view this means we can possess nothing as our own and that we cannot exert coercive power over any being or any thing because everything that was is and will be on the material plane is the property of all this constitutes he ritage which humanity in its collectivity received from the cosmic for example from the standpoint of human laws we can obtain certain rights to various material goods which make us thei r proprietors thus person may have house constructed and take possession of it legally by paying the price set for its construction however if we cons ider this principle from its philosophical aspect is it really possible to clai m ownership indeed what is house it is an assemblage of various materials w hich all have their origin in nature whether this involves stones bricks sa nd wood or tiles all these elements were taken from our earth who originally paid nature to obtain them one because it is impossible to bu anything from the energy which is the source of all matter we ca n only seize the object and decide arbitrarily that it belongs to us consequently we 7rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 4 cannot deny that human beings created the concept f property and made that concept the basis of commerce and of those laws growing out of it yet nature never sold anything to humanity because it gives w ithout counting the debt we owe it is impossible to repay if we pursue this philosophical reasoning we shall say that although it is true that nothing can be bought from nature it is normal to give compensation to those who work for us returning to our example the construction of house requires certain amount of work and conseq uently the employment of competent personsarchitects bricklayers plast erers electricians roofers etc on the human level and by implementing laws t hat govern modern societies we compensate their work by means of mon ey however everything they do is possible only because they received from the cosmic the ability to do it architects for instance owe their skill to their intelligence and that intelligence is gift of god likewise bricklayer s may demonstrate great physical strength and stamina however once again they owe such strength to the fact that they received good health from the cosmic yet none of them purchased their respective qualities from god humanity is indebted to the cosmic because everyth ing we possess on the material plane has its origin in the various ma nifestations of spirit thus the goods at our disposal during our existence on arth belong to us only from the standpoint of human laws because from mystic point of view they are given to us so that we may best utilize them for ou r own spiritual evolution and for that of others to illustrate this point let u s quote what pythagoras who played great role in our heritage said on this s ubject these great ideas came to as an inspiration from god god gave these ideas they rightfully belong to god god granted to an understanding f cosmic laws and ideas therefore they do not belong to so i will pass them along to others for their use and benefit as gift from god the ws of spirit to close this monograph we will summarize the fundamental laws governing nature and the manif estations of spirit we shall return to this study in the first temple degr ee however what we have already explained in this lesson and preceding less ons constitutes sufficient foundation for understanding what this energy consi sts of and how it manifests on the earthly level 1 the entire universe is permeated by vibratory energy which rosicrucians call spirit8rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 4 2 spirit is the basis of the material world for ll forms of matter owe their existence to it 3 all material substances vibrate inwardly and out wardly through the action of the vibrations of spirit 4 after having affected our five objective senses the vibrations emitted by our earthly environment are transmitted to our brain wh ere they are interpreted 5 our understanding of the material world depends upon the interpretation that our objective consciousness gives to the vibra tions emanating from the material world that interpretation is influenced b our culture education and beliefs 6 from mystical point of view material thing can belong to us because all our earthly possessions owe their existence to spirit which by nature is the work of the cosmic in the next monograph we shall approach another sub ject of studythe mind and its faculties we truly hope that this sub ject will satisfy the interest that you have in our teachings and will allow you t catch glimpse of the infinite possibilities of human consciousness with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 9what we have said in this monograph regarding the c oncept of property must not be misunderstood as the explanations we h ave given take place exclusively on the philosophical level we are not advocating any particular political or economic concept and we do not seek in any way to preach an equal distribution of earthly goods it is importan t to make distinction between what things should be in the absolute sense and what they can be at given moment of human history we cannot deny that the possessions of each individual are not the same and this is true matter what country we live in however such difference is not systemat ically connected with the economic social or political direction given to t he various states composing our world the lives of individuals and nations are also governed by cosmic decrees which as we will explain to you later hav their origin in karmic law it is this law which justifies to great extent th apparent inequality that may be observed among people in bringing up the matter of the distribution of wo rldly goods and the right to own them we may presume that not all individual s possess the same degree of intelligence and that some are more zealous than others experience proves that if we divided certain amount of wealth equal ly between all members of society at the end of few months some of them wo uld possess nothing whereas others would still have in their possession nearly all the goods distributed to them at the beginning some would even have more we alth at their disposal all of this occurs because some individuals are unable to manage what is entrusted to them because of this generosity remains one of our finest virtues in the coming days we suggest that you meditate on this immense problem by considering its philosophical and mystic aspects thus you will understand that the concept of property arose in hu man consciousness and that it does not have its origin in cosmic intelligence when humanity has evolved sufficiently this concept will give way to more iversal and hence less individualistic valuessummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 10 for centuries people believed that earth was flat and that it was the center of the universe this belief was based on what they saw and on poor interpretation of what scripture revealed on this s ubject in his work revolutionibus orbium coelestium nicolaus copernicus presented in detail his heliocentric theory of the universe it was rejected because of its incompatibility with religious dogma s of the time human truths are relative and evolve with time and with the discoveries of science human beings should not believe that hu man knowledge is at standstill if the science of the 21st century does not free i tself from its overly materialistic conceptions it runs the risk of over stepping its bounds and causing the destruction of the human species scientists will someday find themselves compelled to recognize the existence of cosmic intelligence of great arch itect of the universe of primordial energy to explain the unexplainable w will then witness fusion of the best of what science and mysticism ve to offer humanity in an absolute sense human beings have right f possession over things of this world because everything in the mat erial world owes its origin to spirit the possessions at our disposal during our earthly existence belong to us only from the standpoint of human laws because fr om mystical point of view they are given to us so that we may best u tilize them for our own evolution and that of others the debt humanity owes nature is impossible to rep aynotes 11first atrium 5 concurrence 12as this monograph deals with the mind and brain wav we suggest that you read this excerpt taken from the work entitled the brain revolution written by marilyn ferguson as you will note the study of the brain is relatively recent and science recognizes that it s till has much to learn in this field regarding the complexity of mental processes the electrical activity of the brain is measured in microvolts or millionths of volt the activity was first observed via cr ude galvanometer devised by an english doctor richard caton in 1875 the firs t true eegs were recorded by hans berger german psychiatrist probably in 1924 berger kept diary but did not report his findings until almost five ears later berger called the regular rhythm the most prominen t of the patterns alpha the shorter smaller waves he called beta bergers report published in 1929 was virtually ignored for five years finally two minent english scientists edgar adrian and bch matthews undertook an inve stigation because as they admitted we found it difficult to accept the view that such uniform activity could occur throughout the brain in cons cious subject when they found to their surprise that berger had been right they proposed renaming the alpha waves the berger rhythm which he opposed the alpha pattern is markedly regular the most pro minent of the brainwaves in typical waking eeg alpha usually ppears only in brief bursts rather than for sustained period alpha co nditioning or training refers to the deliberate increase in the percentage of alp activity in given period alpha ranges from eight to twelve or thirteen cycle s per second and usually is associated with an alert but relaxed sta of mind most people produce alpha when they close their eyes but the t ypical waking eyesopen eeg shows alpha mixed with the other patterns stea dy alpha is uncommon in one whose eyes are open it may happen just as ne is falling asleep and typically is blocked by sudden stimulus or by tur ning ones attention to specific problem especially mathematical problem the fast tight beta pattern ranges from fourteen t thirty cycles per second it appears in intense concentration and mental agit ation continued on page 2113rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 5 dear fratres and sorores in previous monographs we devoted ourselves to the study of matter and we saw that it owes its existence to the vibrations of spirit we hope that you have good understanding of the explanations given to you on the subject of the perception and interpretation of these vibratio ns because they constitute the foundation of what rosicrucian philosophy has t aught for centuries on the subject of the material world we will return to th is study in one of the other degrees of our order and will consider it from ne w angle and in greater depth thus you will find that our teachings are transmit ted according to method that takes into account the mental and spiritual chemy gradually operating within you between your sanctum periods this metho d may be symbolized by spiral that progressively raises your consciou sness toward heights from which it can contemplate the same truths from an in creasingly greater distance if you demonstrate patience and perseverance in you r studies there will come time when you will attain panoramic view of tho mysteries still eluding your comprehension mind ou now know that matter as it manifests on the ma terial plane is collection of vibrations that have their origin in spirit the human body is itself vibratory manifestation of this energy however each human being is also conscious individuala thinking entity yet what is thoug ht from scientific point of view it is the result of brain activity this definition is accurate yet incomplete as it does not explain how the brain w hich is material in nature can produce so subtle phenomenon as mind in this res pect science has too great tendency to limit its research to the study of ntal processes such study is of obvious interest yet it does not take into s ufficient account the spiritual dimension of laws and principles underlying those p rocesses for rosicrucians thought is special expression of cosmic conscious ness incarnate in humans to be more precise we say that it results from the interaction taking place within the brain between the vibrations of spirit nd those of soul the preceding remarks deserve fuller explanation f or they have direct bearing upon the mystical definition of mind we ve just stated that thought is the result of the interaction occurring in the b rain between the vibrations of spirit and those of soul yet in earl ier lessons we have seen that spirit is an energy that underlies our ea rthly environment and our sensory perceptions soul is spiritual ergy which while it is incarnate in us radiates from the very depth of our beings thought 14rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 5 originates from the encounter of these two energies one of which has its source outside of us and the other inside of us as these two energies are vibrations in motion it follows that our mental activity is i tself of vibratory nature this point now seems obvious because scientists ve perfected various deviceselectroencephalographs to be specificwhic h allow reproduction upon graph of those waves produced by the brain notably by the various neurons forming it although the rhythm of these br ain waves varies from one individual to another there exist certain norm s which make it possible to define in both children and adults the rhythm cor responding to perfectly balanced physical and mental state moreover curre nt experiments prove that an electroencephalogram eeg can vary conside rably when the subject is tired ill or depressed thus the eeg is val id means of determining the origin and nature of many physical or mental compla ints the rhythm of brain waves differs according to whet her the individual is awake in coma or asleep there again the in formation obtained by an eeg is very useful because it allows us to measure and define the levels of consciousness where persons mental activity is s ituated at given moment clinical death is reflected by flat eeg with the graph taking the form of straight line whereas the graph for living ind ividual consists of series of curved or broken lines for physicians flat g raph indicates that the brain longer functions if the brain does not function any longer it is because the soul has left the body and because the vibrator interaction it produced with the spirit longer exists as we shall see l ater this detail deserves your attention because it will enable you to understand that death corresponds only to the disappearance of one form of consciousness the objective consciousness not to the total and definitive annihilation of the human personality thus you should not confuse the words thought and consciousness because the former concerns primarily the activity of the brain where as the latter is associated with the totality of the souls faculties scientists currently distinguish four major categor ies of brain waves delta waves theta waves alpha waves and beta waves the frequency of delta waves varies between 05 and 4 hertz thet waves between 4 and 8 hertz alpha waves between 8 and l3 hertz and beta waves between 13 and 50 hertz if not more th figures are slightly different from those indicated in the concurrence 15rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 5 of this monograph as scientific research is evolvi ng every day in this area thus the currently accepted frequencies are not ab solute and new discoveries might bring further modifications to them moreover it is very difficult to define precisely what cerebral activity is associat ed with each of these waves because there exist numerous interactions between t hem depending upon the state of consciousness we happen to be in they do not always have the same significance for example the delta rhythm is the one characterizing normal sleep however in state of wakefulness it indic ates pathological state nonetheless it is possible to bring out certain ge neralities and to get an idea of the relationship between the rhythm of our brain wa ves and the profile of our mental activity according to research undertaken in our orders lab oratories delta waves express very weak mental activity usually co rresponding to state of dreamless sleep they are especially apparent upon the approach of death or in the case of very great physical weakness theta waves are characteristic of an intermediate state of state of consciousne ss that is situated between the subjective consciousness and the subconscious it is in that state that we generally find ourselves just before going to sleep or upon awakening it is also recorded in certain periods of meditation or w hen we are in deep sleep interspersed by striking dreams as for alpha waves they occur in state of wakefulness when we are perfectly calm and relaxed experience proves that this cerebral rhythm is generated by merely closing the eyes and relaxing it is interesting to note that measurements taken on r osicrucians show that in the first phases of meditation they emit mental wav alternating between the theta and alpha rhythms generally between 6 and 9 hertz finally beta waves reflect sustained brain activity they characterize the purely objective phase of our consciousness and are apparent when our attenti on is concentrated on the outside world the preceding information concerns brain waves regi stered by an electroencephalograph when we are in an objectiv subjective or subconscious state of consciousness in light of wh at you have learned in the postulant section you may wonder to what rhyth m state of cosmic consciousness corresponds we may think that the eeg obtained during this time would reveal waves having vibratory frequencies far exceeding those of beta waves beca use they 16rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 5 are associated with extremely high vibrations howe ver the opposite is true because an eeg reflects the intensity of our brain activity and not the nature of our state of consciousness an eeg primarily allows us to record and amplify material waves from mystical point of view it is easy to unders tand that the closer our state of consciousness is to cosmic consciousne ssas when we are engaged in deep meditationthe weaker our purely ce rebral activity is that is why the eeg is flat at the moment of death alth ough we have definitive proof of this we can surmise that state of cosmi c consciousnessthough corresponding to very elevated spiritual waveswo uld be characterized on the electroencephalogram by rhythm ranging betwee n 0 and 05 hertz it has been impossible to record such rhythm up till now precisely because of the very weak frequency of the vibrations emitted by ou r brain at that moment the brain the brain is not the seat of human consciousness b ut rather the center where the vibrations of spirit interact with those of the soul to give rise to thought its role is essential becaus mental activity cannot take place without it when studying the way in which we interpret the vibrations emitted by the material world we pointed out that this interpretation was made by an area specializing in the analysis of our sigh t hearing touch smell and taste sensations however our mental processes are obviously not limited to such analysis because independently of the outsid world we are capable of speaking thinking remembering imagining etc yet there also exist areas of the brain specializing in such activities as spe ech thought recall and imagination etc science has localized most of tho areas which had been known to the ancient egyptians as you will see whe n beginning the study of the sixth temple degree the members of mystery schools possessed considerable knowledge about the human body and the way to heal great many diseases we will transmit that knowledge to ou at the appropriate time when you have the opportunity we recommend that u consult reference work to obtain precise idea of the various areas of the brain while doing this you will note that some of them aside from those w have just mentioned concern psychomotricity the control exerted by tho ught upon the voluntary motions of the head trunk arms legs nd in general on all parts of our body we are aware that an inju ry to the skull or shock to the head may cause partial or total lysis thus after 17rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 5 an accident we may lose the use of the right arm or the left leg or of hand or foot or of portion of the spinal columnor sometimes unfortunately even the whole body some brain lesions produce mem ory losses that may cause total oblivion of our past others may prod uce diminution for some period of time in the ability to speak our native tongue and any other foreign languages we may have learned later all of these f unctional anomalies are due to suspension of activity of one of the cerebral areas today physicians can remedy some of them however in many cases they c annot act without running the risk of causing even more severe damage that i s why brain surgery is an art that is very difficult to master point we want to stress is that the inactivity of certain areas of the brain is not always due to accidents many laboratory exp eriments prove that such areas must be constantly activated and stimulated s as to maintain their activity potential many people complain of losing their mem ory of having limited imagination of being unable to think effectively bout certain problems of lacking inspiration to speak or write etc quite ften such deficiencies originate because we do not make sufficient use of our mental processes perhaps we are not in the habit of engaging in enough intellec tual exercises which may result in notable weakening of our subjective fac ulties as an analogy when fractured or broken limb is immobilized in plaste r for several months its muscles atrophy to the extent that rehabilitation of several weeks is often necessary likewise individuals who adopt passiv mental attitude gradually lose their intellectual abilities finally all cer ebral effort becomes painful and is reflected in increasingly mediocre results in such extreme cases we eventually become incapable of exercising our own potential fo r reflection we advise you to always maintain your intellectual faculties by devoting yourself to reading thinking and meditating ou must absolutely avoid spending too much time escaping while seated befo re movie or television screen for the condition of spectator paralyzes ou r mental processes and impairs our power of concentration to make another analogy it is easier to watch someone work than to do it ourselves yet th satisfaction derived from activity whether physical or mental is far greate r than what we experience in passivity or slothfulness naturally it is essential that we set aside periods for rest and recreation since they offer an opportunity for us to change our ideas and to regen erate ourselves 18rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 5 on all levels however such periods must not becom constant thus leading to indolence which constitutes in itself form of pa thology in our next monograph we will continue the study of mind and begin our examination of several mental faculties important t mystic through

thought is the result of brain activity from mystical point of view mind results from the inter action taking place within the brain between the vibrations of spirit nd those of soul as spirit and soul are two vibratory energies it follows that mind is unification of these vibrations this point can be made evident by the use of an electroencephalograph science currently distinguishes between four major kinds of brain waves delta waves theta waves alpha waves and beta wav the study of brain waves provides valuable data on persons physiological state it also makes it possible to p rovide profile of an individuals mental activity at given moment an eeg can only record and amplify material wave s emitted by brain activity the closer our state of consciousne ss is to cosmic consciousness the weaker our purely cerebral activ ity is that is why it is not possible to record spiritual vibrations corre sponding to such state of consciousness the brain is not the seat of human consciousness but rather the center where the vibrations of spirit interact with those of the soul to give birth to thought its role is essential because mental ctivity cannot take place without it the brain contains great number of areas each f which concerns certain specific activities some of them are involved with the interpretation of sensory impressions others are associated with trolling the voluntary movements of our body while others involve our men tal processes thought memory imagination etc it is very important to constantly use and stimula our mental faculties so as to maintain

as we explain in this monograph that t he mind has creative power human being as conscious individuality is one of the highest manifestations of cosmic intelligence from an alle gorical point of view humans are made in the image of god for each indiv idual is animated by the divinity and possesses some of its attributes the most important being consciousness itself if we assume that the univers is the work of the creative power of divine thought it is logical to recognize that humans are reflection of this thought and that they are likewise endowed with creative thought thus we can reply in the affirmative to the question pos ed by thomas troward at the end of the following quotation one of the great axioms in the new order of ideas of which i have spoken is that our thought possesses creative power and sinc the whole superstructure depends on this foundation it is well to examine i t carefully now the starting point is to see that thought or purely mental acti on is the only possible source from which the existing creation could ever have co into manifestation at all and it is on this account that in the precedin g addresses i have laid stress on the origin of the cosmos it is therefore not ne cessary to go over this ground again and we will start this mornings enquiry on the assumption that every manifestation is in essence the expression of div ine thought this being so our own mind is the expression of divine thought the divine thought has produced something which itself is capable of think ing but the question is whether its thinking had the same creative quality as that of the parent mind thomas trow ard 1847191623rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 6 dear fratres and sorores the rosicrucian concept of thought allows us to mak clear certain interesting ideas indeed if we assume that though t results from the interplay taking place in the brain between the vibrations of spirit and those of the soul you will understand that thought corresponds to process situated between two worldsthe material world and the spiri tual world according to the state of consciousness in which we find ours elves either the vibrations of spirit or those of soul predominate the alterna tion of that predominance suffices to explain how our mental faculties depen ding on circumstances are more oriented toward the outer world or on the contrary toward the inner world thus in wakeful state our attention is m ostly concentrated on our surroundings our thought is under the domination f the vibrations of spirit and corresponds to the objective activity of our co nsciousness when we pray or meditate the vibrations of the soul predominate we are under the direct influence of our subconscious or even of the cosmi c consciousness which is within us when we consider the phenomenon of thought from m etaphysical angle we can understand truths which purely rational an alysis cannot reveal that is why after having considered what science says n specific subject we often bring it back to philosophical and mystical level in order to highlight laws you must remember so that the knowledge we are transmitting to you will be truly useful to your spiritual quest as we emphasized in previous monograph human knowledge is relative what scient ists state today regarding thought and mental processes reflects their underst anding of the moment thus it is probable that their research will compe l them to revise some of their postulates in the near future ten years from now one hundred years from now thousand years from now the definition rosicruci ans give to thought will still be valid as long as human beings are incarna ted on earth the human brain will be the seat of an interplay between the vibrations of spirit and those of soul this knowledge comes to us from the teachi ngs that were perpetuated in the mystery schools of ancient egypt those who dispensed such teachings were masters most of whom had received illuminatio n therefore the learning they transmitted to us cannot age because it is t the result of their intellectual speculations it is the result f wisdom acquired through perfect harmonization with the universal consciousness24rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 6 the power of thought the time has come to begin the study of some of the mental faculties most useful to the hum an being before doing so let us consider an important point the power f thought itself is very broad however this power necessarily involves lim its we emphasize this point because this matter is subject to numerous ex aggerations for instance some schools of philosophy teach that it is possibl by means of sustained concentration to dematerialize oneself and thereby go through walls to explain this possibility they claim that human beings can act upon the subatomic particles of their body and make them separate from one another when in contact with another substance according to these schools the only obstacles to such dematerialization are the fear apprehension or doubt it arouses within us the problem is not so simple from rosicrucian po int of view it is impossible to go through wall physically matter owes its structure and its solidity to the forces of cohesion adhesion ttraction and repulsion vibrating within it under the impulse of spirit if these forces were not exerted continuously in material substances houses would s ink into the ground objects would pass through tables our body would collapse in on itself etc for us to dematerialize it would be necessary for the atomic structure of our entire being to disintegrate into its component particles suppo sing that such disintegration were possible we would become spirit and soul in t he pure state we would longer be subject to the limitations of time and space and there would be reason for us to want to go through walls such p rocess would be irreversible because we would longer have the power to materi alize our body dematerialization is thus impossible and therefore it cannot be the way to conquer the limits imposed upon us by the material world the only value in this kind of speculation is to awaken our imaginati on and to draw attention to the unity of our mental faculties in the postulant section we stated that it was pos sible to go beyond the barriers of time and space we will gradually prove to you that this is true however you will discover for yourself that such possibility does not apply to our physical body only to our psychic bod because it is that body and that body alone which can pass through walls t ravel considerable distances perceive manifestations of the invisible etc when the moment arrives we will teach you how to proceed ccessfully let us consider another exaggerated example of the power of thought we frequently hear or read that the pyrami ds of egypt 25rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 6 were built solely through the power of levitation it is true that the placement of enormous blocks of stone was facilitated by the use of certain faculties and knowledge mastered by the initiates of the period however their construction also required considerable amount of labor and chnical skill calling upon human physical strength countless legends have app eared to explain how such monuments were erected because historians until t he present time have been unable to describe the exact methods that were used on the psychological level the unknown opens the doors to the imaginati on because human beings often seek to forget their weaknesses and limitatio ns by envisioning the powers they would like to possess thus heroic myth has t he goal of objectifying the physical mental and spiritual qualities which eac h individual in his or her innermost self dreams of acquiring we could cite numerous other examples to show that the power of thought is the object of much speculation certainly such power exists and it is often misunderstood the power of thought is freque ntly applied to things or to situations having direct connection with i t it is true that the human consciousness in its entirety possesses faculties enabling human beings to exert considerable control over matter however ch faculties can operate only within the limits of natural and universal law s if we were capable of using our mind to act on the material world as we s aw fit permanent chaos would result in all realms of existence because ea ch of us according to our whims and desires could transform our material env ironment to suit ourselves however we cannot substitute ourselves for cosmic consciousness which acts only within the limits of its own laws contributin g without exception to the maintenance of universal harmony as stated by the hermetic emerald tablet that which is below is like that which is above nd that which is above is like that which is below thus human consciousnes s in the image of cosmic consciousness has at its disposal creative power that can be applied only with respect for certain natural and universal laws concentration we now come to the study of the first of the mental faculties we will examine in this atrium concentra tion many works have been devoted to this faculty and yet it is often treate d solely from psychological standpoint it is just as important to consider its mystical application because such an application forms the basis of most of the experiments you will perform within the framework f our order from rosicrucian point of view concentration is the ability to channel our physical mental or psychic energy so as to attain 26rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 6 specific objective we distinguish three forms of concentration physical mental and psychic physical concentration consists of channeling all ur muscular energy in that part of the bodyshoulders arms back leg s etcwhich is about to be used thus when athletes are in state of c oncentration before race considerable amount of their energy potential is directed toward specific area of their body which results in enhancing the physiological performances of that area considerably mental concentration may be directed toward the outer world or may concern abstract ideas originati ng within ourselves as for psychic concentration it consists of channe ling our psychic energy toward given point this is only possible when ou r psychic consciousness is sufficiently awakened this awakening will be the s ubject of the work we shall undertake during this neophyte section when our mental concentration is directed toward th outer world it concerns itself with things we perceive by means of our five objective senses its purpose is to give full attention to what we hear touch smell or taste what matters is that our thought is concentrated ex clusively on the object of our attention if it concerns thing we are lookin g at only our sense of sight should be called upon to the exclusion of the othe rsand that thing alone must be the center of our visual and mental activity if our concentration involves some sound or noise to which we listen we must see to it that we are only sensitive to the sound impressions transmitted by ur hearing the principle is the same when we focus our mind on an odor fl avor or the form of an object we can generally say that concentration sists of being fully one with the thing upon which we focus our attention when t his unity is fully realized there comes time when we completely lose consciou sness of what we are of the place where we are and of all sensory impressi ons with the exception of those impressions coming from that thing experiments in the next few days we suggest that you carry out the experiments outlined below as regularly as possible their purpose as you will note is to develop your power of concentration an d more particularly that power as it relates to the outside world give them your undivided attention because they constitute the basis of you r future work when walking along the street look for few mom ents at store window of your choice concentrate and try to mentally 27rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 6 photograph the objects that are on display after few minutes turn away and enumerate the objects one by one v erify your succe ss and resume this process until you are able to reassemble the entire window display choose piece of music of your choice and listen to it carefully while doing so isolate each instrument that is used and name each one aloud as soon as you recognize it what matters in this expe riment is not your ability to distinguish these instruments rather it is your ability to maintain your concentration throughout the musical composition go for stroll in public park forest or an other place where you can smell the fragrances emanating from the flowers and vegetation sit down close your eyes and concentrate only on the odors that reach you during the course of this concentration think only about thos odors to such degree that you have the sensation of merging with them during your walk stop at place where there are stones and without looking at them pick one up at random with your yes closed concentrate on its shape by feeling it with your fingers defin by touch its angles curves hollows rough parts smooth parts etc while doing t his try to see it mentally in its entirety after few minutes of concentrati on open your eyes and verify whether the shape of this stone corresponds to what you imagined as you touched it the next time you eat piece of fruit take the time to savor itin other words to concentrate on its taste most of the tim we do not pay sufficient attention to the flavor of food this is unfortunat because the awakening of our sensitivity to taste can produce interesting psychological and psychic experiences therefore perform this simple experim ent whenever you have the opportunity ou may also use more complex dish in that case concentrate on its taste and try to determine the various ingre dients composing it it is with these few experiments that we will close todays study in the next monograph we will continue our examination of concentration and we will pass to new stage in its practical applicati on with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 28let us emphasize once again the importance of the xperiments that have been suggested to you today despite their apparent simplicity they are very effective for developing your power of concentratio n as you will note as you progress through the degrees of our order this pow er forms the basis for most of those mystical faculties that you will be taught as part of your rosicrucian studies telepathy psychic projection absent heal ing vibroturgy telekinesis etc thus it is important that you learn right way how to concentrate your mental energy toward specific goal ou will note that each of these experiments requir the use of one of your five objective sensesnamely sight hearing touch smell or tasteand they are quite useful for increasing the clarity in volving these senses thus allowing you to acquire sharper perception of the material world we suggest that you now train yourself to memorize the sensory impressions coming to you from your environment because such memorizatio n is indispensable to visualization faculty that we will study soonsummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 29 since thought results from the interplay occurring in the brain between the vibrations of spirit and those of the soul it corresponds to process situated between two worldsthe material world and the spiritual world according to the state of consciousness in which we find ourselves either the vibrations of spirit or those of soul predomina in the first case our mental activity is rather objective in the sec ond it is under the direct influence of our subconscious or even of the cosmi c consciousness within us dematerialization is impossible and is not the way to conquer the limits imposed upon us by the material world human consciousness as whole possesses facultie s which enable humans to exert control over matter however such faculties can only be exercised within the limits of natural and universa l laws from rosicrucian point of view concentration is the ability to channel our physical mental or psychic energy so as to at tain specific objective mental concentration may be directed toward the out er world or it may concern abstract ideas originating within ourselves when our mental concentration is directed toward th outer world it concerns things we perceive through our five object ive senses its purpose is to give our complete attention to what we see h ear touch smell or taste30first atrium 7 concurrence in concurrence with this monograph we suggest that you read an excerpt from the golden bough written by james george frazer in this work the author describes admirably the importance of fire mong primitive tribes what he said on the subject of the damaras and hereros llows us to understand how and why prehistoric people venerated fire and made it an object of worship fire radically transformed their life and symbolica lly marked the beginning of human civilization millennia have passed since then and still fire exerts great fascination over us this is because the my stical experience resulting from its discovery is forever engraved in the consc iousness of the human soul the damaras or hereros tribes in southwestern af rica maintain sacred fires in their villages and their customs and beli efs in this respect present close resemblance to the roman worship of v the sacred fire is regarded as the centre of the vi llage from it at evening the people fetch light to kindle the fire on thei r own hearths for every householder has his own private hearth in front of his hut at the holy hearth are kept the most sacred possessions of the tribe to wit the bundle of sticks which represent their ancestors here sacrifices ar offered and enchantments performed here the flesh of the victims is cooked here is the proper place of the chief here the elders assemble in council and judgment is given here strangers are received and ambassadors entertained so great is the veneration felt by the natives for the sacred heart h with its hallowed bough that they dare not approach it without testifying t heir deepest respect when man goes forth from the village with his fam ily and servants to herd the cattle on distant pasture or to found nother village he takes with him burning brand from the sacred hearth wherewit h to kindle the holy fire in his new home if the sacred fire should go out through the neglec t of the priestess sudden shower of rain or any other accident the h erero deem it very evil omen the whole tribe is immediately summoned and l arge offerings of cattle are made as an expiation james george frazer 1854194131rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 7 dear fratres and sorores in the previous monograph we taught you the princip for concentrating your objective faculties on impressions linked to ur material environment we hope that you have paid due attention to the experi ments that were suggested to you for this purpose as they are very effective for developing your power of concentration and increasing the potential of your sensory perception we will now enter into new stage and ask you to c oncentrate on medium having an intermediate nature between the material and immaterial worlds to accomplish this we will use candle flame becaus it truly constitutes an ideal focal point for developing certain form of mental concentration the candle flame has been associated for centuries with an imp ortant symbolismthat of fire although candle flame is very small manif estation it possesses all of the physical and metaphysical virtues thus we will be gin by examining the reasons that have contributed to making fire the symbol of laws that are particularly important in the realm of esotericism of the four elements fire is the one to which the mystics of the past have devoted the grea test veneration because as we shall see its properties apply to matter as wel l as to consciousness the symbolism of fire since the dawn of human civilization fire has been regarded as source of warmth and light ne can say exactly at what moment or how early human beings discovered it how ever it is certain that their ability to produce fire of their own free wil l counts among those events which revolutionized their lives on the physical l evel it brought incalculable wellbeing people could stay warm when it was cold cook their food and protect themselves more efficiently against predato rs this feeling of protection exerted positive influence on their emotional sta because the fear in which they livedespecially at nightyielded to feeling of safety finally fire was the source of their spiritual awakening by allowin g fire to burn in the cave they used as shelter early human beings prolonged their hours of wakefulness and used it as basis for their first meditations thus the discovery of fire made it possible for them to conquer not only the uter darkness but also the darkness which for millennia had prevented them f rom contemplating their own inner light fire was the source of profound mystical experien ce because while it contributed to the physical wellbeing of populations it also allowed them to reflect on their own condition and to gain awareness of the spiritual dimension of their being it was natural 32rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 7 for this element to become an object of veneration and to serve as basis for the first primitive religions we shall soon see ho w religious cults were born and how they marked the gradual evolution of human consciousness according to classical literature the mystical use of fire dates back to zoroastrianismto approximately the 10th century bc for zoroaster fire was the representation of ahura mazda the ang of light and of good which opposed ahriman the demon of darkness and of evil many hermetic writings indicate that from the most remote antiqui ty fire was an integral part of religious ceremonies in the temples of ancient egypt sacred flame burned continuously in the holy of holies under circum stances was this flame to be extinguished because if such an event occurred it was thought to be the sign of curse and the temporary victory of forces of vil over those of good chosen persons most often young girls had the duty of wa tching over the flame they had to keep watch day and night and were held respo nsible before god and the kherihebs for what would happen if the flame were extinguished the importance attached to the perpetual fire is so found in the temples of ancient greece where special cult was devoted to hestia who among the greeks was the goddess of fire once again tr adition indicates that it was young girls who under the protection of hestia watched over the sacred flame in ancient rome the same principle was appl ied to the deity v the guardian of fire and the hearth the cult of this d eity was ensured by young priestesses who were called v estals today we may still see among the ruins of some roman temples the remains of small houses which served as the residences of the v estals due to its profound symb olism such tradition has been perpetuated in our era in certain rituals in the lodges and chapters of our order young girl has the role of lighting the ca ndles located on the shekinah the central altar of the temple for centuries she has been designated by the traditional name of colombe today in temples dedicated to various religionsin cluding those of judaism buddhism christianity islam and other r eligious denominations we find that fire is always present in one form or another in certain instances it is represented by candleholders in others by tap ers and candles in yet others by oil lamps matter what implement is used its symbolism remains the sameto represent the cosmic light on t he earthly plane the mystical use of fire dates back to the t ime when humans began to distinguish good from evil and associated the former with light and the latter with darkness this idea is found in many 33rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 7 religious texts and they have made fire the symbol of human virtue or the expression of divine perfection in the v edas for example the deity is itself cons idered to be fire that lights and warms bodies as well as souls in the ol d and new testaments the symbolism of fire and flame is used many times onc again it is related to good and to all the qualities people must demonstra to reflect the celestial light many verses of the koran compare the human s oul to flame ceaselessly consuming itself and containing within the attribut of divine fire the sacred scriptures refer to these attributes and associate them with the spiritual nature of human beings the alchemy of fire let us consider another aspect of the symbolism associated with fire fire is not limited to the representation of good or to the presence of god on earth in all tra ditions and in most religions power of purification and regeneration is also at tributed to it that is because fire in its earthly expression is an agent that c an consume large number of material substances in this respect fire is the nly element capable of totally transmuting one form of matter into anotherand eve n reducing it completely to ashes or steam moreover it is used to sanitize and purify objects or places because impurity whether of mineral or organic origin can resist its action all of these physical properties made fire the basi c element of material alchemy which became the basis of modern chemistry in their laboratories alchemists used fire to purify certain base metals particularly leadso as to transmute them into gold this purification and tra nsformation took place in several stages which became increasingly difficult as the operation progressed yet this material alchemy was only the counterpart of spiritual alchemy that was based on the gradual purification of the human soul alchemists knew that the purpose of existence is to evolve toward perfec tion and that this evolution requires that human beings purify themselves of the ir faults and transmute them into their opposite qualities furthermore alchemi sts understood that such purification and transmutation could only be done b contact with the mundane world because it alone furnishes us with the exper iences necessary for our physical mental emotional and spiritual regenera tion in the original version of the sacred scriptures we find very specific references to the alchemical power of fire all these references clearly establish that this power was pr imarily associated with the various transmutations that people must ex perience in the 34rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 7 course of their earthly evolution unfortunately t he statements were corrupted by literal interpretations thus giving rise to dog mas that were longer connected with the mystical principles involved mo st presentday religions refer to the fires of purgatory and of hell sugges ting that such are real places where the soul of the dead is purged of its faults and purified of its sins before being admitted to heaven or paradise this involves an erroneous interpretation of the true symbolism of fire for it is obvious th at such places do not exist and are purely symbolic from rosicrucian point of view earth itself cons titutes the purgatory and the hell of humanity as alchemists have claimed an d as mystics have taught for centuries it is during our earthly existence t hat human beings face the trials necessary for the purification of our personality nd the gaining of awareness of our divine self the material world is thus the cru cible in which the evolution of our spiritual nature is wrought moreover it is in the here and now that each of us experiences the physical moral and spiritua l sufferings that are the lot of all human beings incarnate on this plane for rosicrucians fire symbolizes the laws and prin ciples that rosicrucian masters have associated with it since the earliest times in its mundane appearance fire corresponds to the highest expression of the v isible manifestations of spirit it is precisely because of its high vibratory frequ ency that it has the power to transmute material forms placed in contact with it furthermore this frequency makes it an intermediate agent between the material world and the spiritual world because its vibrations are such that it is b oth substance and essence while being neither one nor the other although we may and observe the colors of fire it is impossible to seize fire to contain it or to impose form on it unless of course we resort to special technical means on the alchemical level fire represents the mystic process operating continuously in human beings and which at the end of each individuals successive incarnations allows that person to rece ive illumination the influx of wisdom resulting from perfect harmonization with cosmic consciousness such illumination can be obtained only after we hav completely purified ourselves of our imperfections through contact with the divine fire illuminating the altar of our inner temple it is this divine fi re which constitutes the philosophers stone alluded to by alchemists in their writings thus contrary to what many believed and still beli eve it does not designate and has never designated stone of mater ial nature but rather the divine essence animating our being and w hose radiance 35rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 7 and virtues we must learn to express in each of our thoughts words and actions in that sense it is the most precious of jewels we have to discover on the spiritual level rosicrucians give to fire t he symbolic meaning that has been always associated with it the presence on ear th of cosmic light and the presence of universal good in addition to the alchemical and spiritual symboli sm that the teachings of our order attribute to fire rosicrucians also u the flame to represent life such as that manifesting in the universe inc luding on our planet in this regard we note that all living beings draw their v itality from the air they breathe likewise fire cannot burn when this eleme nt is absent it is because of this special symbolism that rosicrucians do not extinguish candle flame by blowing upon it we feel that the breath is the expression of vital life force animating our beings and it should not be use d to make the symbol of life itself disappear thus when rosicrucians exti nguish the flame of one or more candles during the course of ritual we use snuffer because that flame represents for us the spark of life illuminating th body heart and soul to conclude our study of the symbolism of fire we bring to your attention the following text that is taken from the archives of our order and shows the interest that mystics attach to this symbol think of the forms taken by fire when it flickers s oundlessly when it winds twists widens lengthens and then dips and cts note its changes of color as it increases its ardor see the imaginary forms shooting forth from its flames propelled into space as lightning flash toward earth behold the sky lit by thousands of stars like sparkling sea reflecting single flame the latent heat of generative fires is found in the col dest flint in the clearest and purest air in oxygen in ozone in each thing and in all things because fire is truly royal principle of supernatural splendor it purifies all things and makes them become invisible the sacred ceremony of fire prevails in all religious cults it is universal symbol visible represen tation of the invisible for just as fire is everywhere god is also everywhere arou nd us and within us and thus we are humans enlightened by god that is why the unknown god was worshiped in the last form that humans could imagin fire which was known as their shadow in all this it is not the natural fire we contemplate but the mystical celestial divine fire experiment after these general considerations on the symbolism of fire here is the experiment that you should carry out 36rosicrucian order amorc neophyte section atrium 1 number 7 as regularly as possible during the next few days in doing this we ask that you extinguish one of the two candles on your sanctum nd place the other in the middle of the altar after doing this sit approxim ately 2 meters 65 feet away from the lit candle and observe the following instr uctions put your hands on your knees and place your feet fl at on the ground slightly apart from each other keep your back as s traight as possible and relax for few moments while taking three deep neutral b reaths in other words inhale and exhale deeply through the nose without i nterruption between inhalations and exhalations as soon as you feel fully relaxed concentrate your gaze on the candle flame and avoid blinking your eyes if possible mai ntain this concentration until you experience the feeling of being one with the candle flame at that moment you must longer be conscious of who you are or the point where you are only have the feeling of being the flame i tselflight and heat when your concentration is at its peak and when you have succeeded in creating perfect unity between yourself and th candle flame stop this experiment if you wish observe brief pause and repeat the experiment entirely whatever the results obtained definitely stop at the end of your second attempt at least for this sanctum period when you have finished put the lit candle back in place and light the other one again this experiment is very effective in developing your power of mental concentration moreover it will aid in t he special work you will carry out during our next meeting after reading th practical application and the summary have brief period of meditation and then close your sanctum period with the simple ritual presented to you in t he first monograph of this atrium before closing this ritual you may wish to read th is monograph second time because single reading is not sufficient to assimilate its contents fully this recommendation is also valid for all of the achings that are transmitted to you within the framework of your affiliation wit h our order with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class masterpractical application whatsoever thou resolvest to do do it quickly defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish unto thee i grant 37in connection with the study of the symbolism that mystics have attributed to fire and flame for centuries we feel that it is important to make few remarks regarding the importance you should give to the use of incense especially when you prepare to study monograph or retire to your sanctum to meditate for obvious reasons incense is associated with the alchemical power of fire because it is impossible to burn incense without re sorting to source of heat moreover as it is consumed its transmutation give s rise to scent which on the vibratory plane is in perfect harmony with the consciousness of the soul this explains why smelling such an odor awakens wit hin us desire and need for introspection or contemplation some people do not like the scent of incense or can not even tolerate it often it is not the odor itself which causes their aversion rather incense is associated with religious context they may dislik ou will note that many individuals who have certain allergy to incense do not like the atmosphere of churches and generally do not feel attracted to mysticism in some cases it may involve mental block or form of superstitio n concerning everything connected with religion among people interested in spirituality it is very rare to find an individual who dislikes the odor of incense and who does not t ake pleasure in burning some regularly at home to the odor is added the sy mbolism that may be seen in the motion of incense vapors as they rise i n room materializing the elevation of consciousness the spiritual ascen t that allows the individual to receive illumination the use of incense is an xtra element for creating in ones home or sanctum an atmosphere favorable to th study and application of mysticism of course it is not matter of burn ing some in just any place or at all times for it must be used respectfully and in proper contextsummary of this monograph after carefully reading this monograph read the fo llowing summary it contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and ditate in coming days if any of the points are difficult to understand refer to the ex planations given in this monograph moreover we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period 38 of the four elements fire is certainly the one to which the mystics of the past devoted the greatest veneration as its proper ties apply to matter as well as to consciousness the discovery of fire is one of the events that mos t revolutionized the life of early human beings on the physical emotional nd spiritual levels from remote antiquity fire has been an integral pa rt of religious ceremonies in the temples of ancient egypt greece and rome sacred flame burned continuously under the protection of oung priestesses today in temples consecrated to various religions including those of judaism buddhism christianity islam and any oth er religious creeds we find that fire is always present in one form or another the mystical use of fire dates back to the time wh human beings began to distinguish good from evil and associated the fo rmer with light and the latter with darkness this is expressed in reli gious texts because all have made fire the symbol of human virtue or the ex pression of divine perfection fire has always been the basic element of material alchemy however the latter was only the counterpart of spiritual alch emy that was based on the gradual purification of the human soul that is why fire also symbolizes the gradual regeneration of humanity for rosicrucians fire in its mundane appearance corresponds to the highest expression of the manifestations of spirit on the alchemical and spiritual planes we attribute to fire the symbolis m that past
