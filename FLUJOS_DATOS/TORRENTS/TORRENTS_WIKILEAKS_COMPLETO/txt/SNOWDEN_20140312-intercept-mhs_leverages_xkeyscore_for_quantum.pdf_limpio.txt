u mhs leverages xks for quantum against yahoo and hotmail top secretsirel to usa fvey tssirel mhs leverages xkeyscore deepdive packet analysis to identify feasibility of quantum against yahoo and hotmail tssirel automated deep packet analysis of yahoo and hotmail providers gives keen insight into the potential success of quantumtheory exploitation against these services tssirel quantumtheory is set of cno manontheside capabilities that involves realtime packet inject in response to passive collection of target communications quantumtheory inspects each packet one at time for set of keywords that determine if the packet originated from cne target and if modified response to that packet might result in exploitation of the client computer because each packet is inspected individually if keywords occur across packet boundaries the quantumtheory technique will not tip the sigint system to attempt exploitation of client as http headers and the size of cookies grows the likelihood of all keywords occurring within single packet reduces mhs analysts in collaboration with xkeyscore and the roc productized draggablekitten an xkeyscore mapreduce analytic that leverages the packets collected and made accessible to analytics by xkeyscore deepdive systems draggablekitten identifies the quantumtheory keywords in packet capture and generates statistics for each service currently hotmail and yahoo to determine how often all of the keywords occur within single packet this would not have been possible without xkeyscore providing platform for analysis to massdeploy packetlevel processing approximately 50 of hotmail and 90 of yahoo sessions contain the keywords necessary within single packet to be targeted by quantumtheory collaboration uzfouojeem access operations division xkeyscore r1 poc ufouo name redacted i index division mhsj phone number redacted top secretsirel to usa fvey
