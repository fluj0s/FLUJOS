pl 108447 hr 4818 the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act within which foreign operations is included as division d as enacted th measure provides 1964 billion for foreign operations after adjusting for required 08 acrosstheboard rescission although this is 168 billion or nearly 8 below the presidents request congress increased amounts passed earlier by the house 1939 billion and the nate 1961 billion the conference agreement is about 23 b illion 13 more than the regular fy2004 foreign operations level but far less than the 3878 billion total appropriation in fy2004 that included 212 b illion for iraq reconstruction and other supplemental needs for the core development and child rvival accounts including the global aids initiative pl 108447 provides 436 billion after adjusting for the 08 acrosstheboard resci ssion bout 675 million higher than fy2004 and 160 million more than the request within these totals hr 4818 provides 228 billion for the presidents emergency plan for ai ds relief pepfar after applying the rescission roughly 80 million higher than the request and the housepassed level but 139 million less than passed by the nate funding for international hivaids included in other appropriation bills brings the total to 292 billion 100 million more than the request on family planning and reproductive heath matters the conference on hr 4818 sets bilateral assistance at 441 milli on between house nd senatepassed amounts the bill includes 34 million for the population fund unfpa subject to the kempkasten conditions but drops the senate language amending

city conditions on bilateral family planning assistance in way that may have reversed the policy restrictions for specific countries pl 108447 provides 404 million for relief and peace and security activities in sudan 85 million for haiti and 980 million for afghanistan the sudan amount is in ddition to 95 million emergency funding for the darfur region approved by pl 108 287 the fy2005 defense appropriation bill the largest reduction in the enacted appropriation falls on the millennium challenge account reduced by 1 billi on from the presidents 25 billion requesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs2 1 although the foreign operations appropriations bill is often characterized as the foreign aid spending measure it does not include f unding for all foreign aid programs food aid an international humanitarian aid program administered under the pl 480 program is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill foreign operations also include funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is regarded as trade promotion program rather than foreign aid in recent years funding for food aid and the eximbank have been about the same so that foreign operations and th official foreign aid budget are nearly identical throughout this report the terms foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeablythe final level however is 250 million and 380 million than amounts recommended earlier by the h ouse and senate respectivel coming only after strong pressure from the white house the meas ure further reduces funding for the export import bank debt reduction the peace corps and multila teral development bank contributions among other accounts introduction the annual foreign operati ons appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews nd votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences major aspects of executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it contains the largest share about twothirds of total international affairs spending by the united states the legislation funds all us bilate ral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and afri can development foundations foreign operations also includes resources for the two newest administration initiatives the millennium challenge corporation mcc and the global aids initiative managed by the state departments hivaids coordinator most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations in cluding usaids disasterfamine program and the state departments refugee relie f support foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the form er soviet union als referred to as the independent states account and centraleastern europe activities that are jointly managed by usaid and th state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending meas ure as are other security aid programs administered largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon most recently foreign operati ons has funded recons truction programs in both afghanistan and iraq us contribu tions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill fi nally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and th trade and development agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs3 for two decades the foreign operati ons appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressi onal oversight of fore ign affairs and for congressional involvement in foreign polic making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorizati on bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular author izations originating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the global war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 and launched afghan and iraq i reconstruction operations the appropriations measure has also been key instrument used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently re sulted in executivelegislative clashes

8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs4 foreign operations policy trends and goals arguably from the end of world war ii until the early 1990s the underlying rationale for providing foreign aid was the sa as that for all us foreign policy the defeat of communism us aid prog rams were designed to promote economic development and policy reforms in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to american allies nd friendly states some of wh ich faced soviet or soviet proxy threats aid programs also were used to help the us gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy american forces foreign aid programs also supported number of secondary us policy goals such as reducing high rates of populati on growth promoting wider access to health care expanding the availability of basic education in the developing world advancing us trade interest s and protecting the environment if these secondary goals were also achieved us aid programs could be promoted as delivering more bang for the buck with the end of the cold war the united states launched expansive aid programs in russia and many easternbloc states that were previously those that us assistance tried to combat while these and other new elements of american foreign aid emerged broad consensus develope d over what should be the new overarching rationale for us aid programs thr oughout the 1990s policymakers and congress explored number of alternative strate gic frameworks around which to construct revised foreign assistance po licy rationale not only did policy consensus fail to emerge but efforts to overhaul the largely cold warbased foreign aid legislation also did not succeed during this period the clinton admin istration emphasized the promotion of sustainable development as the new postcold war main strategy of those parts of the foreign aid program under the aegis of the us agency for international development usaid economic assi stance supported six interrelated goals achievement of broa dbased economic grow th development of democratic systems stabilization of world population and prot ection of human health sustainable management of the envir onment building human capacity through education and training and meeting humanitarian needs early in the bush administration th goals were modified around three strategic pillars of 1 economic growth ag riculture and trade 2 global health and 3 democracy conflict prev ention and humanitarian assistance more recently usaid white paper on american foreign ai d identified five core operational goals of us foreign assistance promoting transformational development especially in the areas of governance institutional capacity and economic restructuring strengthening fragile states providing humanitarian assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs5 2 us agency for international development us foreign aid meeting the challenges of the twentyfirst century january 2004supporting us geostrategic interest s particularly in countries such as iraq afghanistan pakistan jordan egypt and israel and mitigating global and international ills including hivaids2 perhaps the most defining change in us foreign aid policy came following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states when american foreign assistance has taken on more strategic sense of importance and has been cast frequently in terms of contributing to th global war on terrorism in september 2002 president bush released his administr ations national secu rity strategy that established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense nd diplomacy also in 2002 executive branch foreign assistance budget justifications be gan to underscore the war on terrorism as the top foreign aid priority highlightin g amounts of us assistance to about 30 frontline states in the rrorism war countries that cooperated with the united states in the war on terrorism or faced terro rist threats themselves the substantial reconstruction programs in afghanistan and iraq which total more in fy2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid prog rams are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of american foreign aid the bush admin istration announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened two additional key foreign assistance goals promoting economic growth and re ducing poverty and combating the global hivaids pandemic the millennium challenge corporation mcc is new aid delivery concept authorized by congre ss and established in early 2004 that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of us resources in few low and lowmiddle income countries that ve demonstrated strong commitment to political economic and social reforms if fully funded 5 billi on will be available by fy2006 to support these best development performers in order to accelerate economic growth and lower the number of people living in absolute poverty addressing global health pr oblems has further become core us aid objective in recent years congress created sepa rate appropriation account for child survival and health activities in the mid1990s nd increased funding for international hivaids and other infecti ous disease programs president bushs announcement at his 2003 state of the union message of fiveyear 15 billion effort to combat aids malaria and tuberculos is has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective beyond these recently emerging foreign aid goals other prominent objectives that have continued since the early 1990s have included supporting peace in the middle east through assistance to israel egypt jordan and the palestinians fostering democratization and stability for c ountries in crisis such as bosnia haiti rwanda kosovo and liberia facilita ting democratizati on and free market economies in central europe nd the former soviet union suppressing international narcotics production and traf ficking through assistance to colombia and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs6 3 some of these swings in budget levels shown in the figure are not the result of policy decisions but are due to t echnical budget accounting changes involving how congress scores various programs for example th large increase in fy1981 did not represent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations rather than as offbudget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than only the partial appropriati on required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropriation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loan s funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data trend line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown here can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign operations appropriations over the past 29 years figure 1 foreign operations funding trendsandean drugproducing countries and lleviating famine nd mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world foreign operations funding trends as shown in the figure 1 foreign opera tions funding levels expressed in real terms taking into account the effects of infl ation have fluctuated widely over the past 29 years3 after peaking at over 34 billion in fy1985 constant fy2005 dollars foreign operations appropria tions began period of decline to lowpoint of 141 billion in fy1997 with only brief period of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals for panama and nicaragua 1990 countries affected by the gulf war 1991 and the form er soviet states 1993httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs7 arguing that declining international ffairs resources seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events clinton administration officials and other outside groups vigorously campaigned to reverse the decadelong dec line in the foreign policy budget foreign aid spending increased slightly in fy1998 but beginning the following year and continuing to the present foreign oper ations appropriations have trended upward due in large part to the approval of resources for special and in some cases unanticipated foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives while funding for regular continuing fo reign aid programs also rose modestly during this period supplemental spending for special activities such as central american hurricane relief fy1999 kos ovo emergency assistance fy1999 wye rivermiddle east peace acco rd support fy2000 count ernarcotics initiative in colombia and the andean region f y2000 and fy2002fy2004 aid to the front line states in the war on terrorism and iraqwar related assistance fy2003fy2004 was chiefly responsible for the grow th in foreign aid appropriations while foreign operations appropriations had been ri sing for five consecutive years amounts approved in fy2003 and fy2004 reached unprecedented levels over the past 40 years regular appropriations approve d in these two years were roughly on par with amounts of the previous few year s but substantial supplementals of 75 billion and 212 billion respectively for assist ance to the front line states in the war on terrorism and afghanistan and iraq r econstruction have pus hed spending upward the regular foreign operations bill si gned by the president on january 23 2004 combined with an earlier iraq supplem ental approved in n ovember 2003 pl 108 106 and subsequent emergency relief for darfur sudan pl 108287 brought fy2004 appropriations to 394 billion consta nt fy2005 dollars the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s the enacted level for fy2005 of 1974 billion while less than the previous two years is the largest foreign operations ppropriation in real terms than all other years in over decade moreover the fy 2005 total is likely to grow when congress considers supplemental funding for tsunami disaster relief and possibly additional iraq reconstruction needs supplemental resources for foreign op erations programs which in fy2004 exceeded regular foreign operations funding have become significant channel of funding for us internati onal activities due to the nature of rapidly changing overseas events and the emergence of unanticipated contingencies to which it is in the us national interest to respond it is not surprising that foreign aid and defense resources from time to time are the major reason for considering and approving supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle supplementals have provided resources for such major foreign policy events as the camp david accords fy1979 central america conflicts f y1983 africa famine and middle east economic downturn fy1985 panama and nicaragua government

congress has adopted budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is refe rred to as the section 302a allocation process reference to the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act following this house and senate appropriations committees separately decide how to allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees staying

the appropriations committees nevert heless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implicati ons for the budget limitations within which the house and senate foreign operations subcommittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropr iation bills on may 19 2004 house and nate conferees agreed to budget framework for fy2005 sconres 95 that include d 821 billion in discretionary budget authority the discretionary budget author ity target for the international affairs function out of which foreign operations programs receive their funding was 2928 billion 22 billion or 7 less than the pr esidents request if the conference recommendations were followed during the appropriation process it was likely that the administrations proposal for foreig n operations could not be fully met the house and senate appropriations committees however can choose to allocate the 2928 billion among the four subcom mittees pr oportionally different than what the president proposed or to alter the overall amount for foreign policy activities depending on other competing priorities the final allocations can diverge significantly from those assumed in the budget resolution complicating decisions related to the 302 b allocation process was the lack of final vote on the fy2005 budget resolution s conference agreement the house passed the measure on may 19 216213 and deemed the 821 billion discretionary budget authority cap included in the budget resolution as guidance for the appropriations committee the resolu tion however remained pending in the senate where disagreements focused on the size of the deficit budget enforcement mechanisms and extending existing tax cuts matters unrelated to international affairs funding issues while congress ca n and did proceed with consideration of appropriation bills without finalizing th budget resolu tion the lack of broad consensus on overall spending levels can ma ke it more difficult to pass each of the 13 appropriation measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs11 4 in issuing the subcommittee allocations house and senate committees also compared fy2005 levels with amounts enacted for fy2004 in the case of foreign operations the committees compared their 1939 billion recommendation for fy2005 with the 1748 billion total approved in the regular foreign operations appropriation bill enacted in pl 108199 using this point of measurement the fy2005 allocation was 19 billi on or 109 higher than fy2004 levels however because congress approved large foreign operations supplemental prior to enactment of the regular various baselines for fy2004 could be used in drawing comparisons between the two years since the fy2004 supplemental included some amounts that had be previously earmarked in house and senatepassed regular pakistan and afghanistan ai d for example one method would be to include those levels in the fy2004 regular baselineon june 2 the house appropriations co mmittee released its 302b allocations providing 19 39 billion for foreign operations the amount is 193 billion or 91 less than the presidents request the senate ppropriations committee announced its subcommittee allocations on september 8 making available the identical amount for foreign operations as approved by the house panel the reduction for foreign operations in both houses was the largest for any of the 13 subcommittees when compared to the administrations recommendation4 as approved in hr 4818 the omnibus consolidated appropriation act 2005 the final total amount for foreign operati ons exceeds the level previously allocated for the bill this is largely the result of white housecongressional agreement to add funds for the millennium challeng account and to include 93 million in emergency funding an amount that doe s not count against the allocation cap for relief and peacekeeping activities in the da rfur region of sudan the final regular foreign operations measure provides 1964 billion this compares with the 1939 billion allocated under the earlier 302b allocations for foreign operations foreign operations appropriations request for fy2005 and congressional

law enforcement spending of 359 million proposed for fy2005 was 13 less than fy2004 totals but nearly 50 more than enacted in the regular appropriation for several other foreign operations accounts the fy2005 submission represented reduction below amounts pproved in fy2004 in which supplemental appropriations were not factor assistance to former soviet states and eastern europe collectively would decline by 65 million or 6 from fy2004 levels the request reflected reorientation in the fo rmer soviet aid account to focus more on central asian states linked to the war on terrorism and to continue the process of graduating russia and ukraine from us aid roles bilateral development assistance assessing the administrations request for bilateral development and health assistance was complicated due to the addition of new core development aid account for interna tional hivaids funding and the transfer of resources into this new account from the child survivalhealth lin item collectively the three core bilateral development aid accounts development assistance child survivalhealth and the global aids initiative would increase in fy2005 by about 500 million or 14 but because hivaids resources would grow by roughly 600 million the fy2005 request for most other development and health activities was below fy2004 enacted amounts further complicating comparisons between fy2005 and fy2004 was the mille nnium challenge corporation mcc that may add considerable amounts of b ilateral development aid resources for non hivaids programs once mcc compacts ar signed and funded in short overall development aid spending including th mcc rose about 43 under the fy2005 request although the impact on specifi c development programs could not be determined due to the uncertainty over how mcc allocations would affect specific sectors at the country level however it was cl ear that nations which had been named as hivaids focus countries or are selected for mcc

the past two years to em phasize at numerous congressional hearings that fighting terrorism is the most important objective of the foreign operations budget requests although there is disagreement regardin g the extent to which foreign aid can directly contribute to reducing the threat of terrorism most agree that economic and security assistance aimed at reducing pove rty promoting jobs and educational opportunities and helping st abilize conflictprone nations can indirectly address some of the factors that terrorists use in recruiting disenfranchised individuals for their cause foreign aid can be programmed in numbe r of ways that contribute to the war on terrorism assistance can be transferred as has occurred in pakistan and afghanistan to bolster efforts of coa litionpartner government to counter domestic dissent and armed attacks by extremist groups and to promote better health care education and employment opportunities to its people security assistance can finance the provision of military equipment and training to nations facing threats from their own internallybased terrorist movements as illustrated in table 6 below th united states provided through fy2004 more

spending since september 11 for fy2005 the administration requested 545 b illion for the frontline states based on passage of the fy2005 appropriation the estimated level for this year will be slightly less largely due to reductions in aid to turkey although increased levels of foreign aid are only one sign of the importance the united states assigns to the support provide d by these frontline states the amounts allocated since september 11 are in shar p contrast to the 34 billion provided to these 26 countries prior to the attack s in regular fy2001 appropriations the fy2005

and are possibly corrupt some members have been especially critical of administration efforts to include in aid proposals for fr ontline states legislative language that would waive all existing restrictions and pr ohibitions on the transfers instead these critics argue the administration should specifically identify any obstacles to proceeding with country aid program nd seek congressional waiver for those particular problems for example in 2001 the administration wanted to provide pakistan with 600 million in fastdisbursing economic aid instead of providing blanket waiver of legislative obstacles congress approved in pl 10757 specific waivers of aid prohibitions that applie d to countries that engaged in missile proliferation whose leaders came to pow er through military

other things how well the compact supports nations economic grow th and poverty reduction goals only those compacts that meet the mcc criteri will be funded it is expected that successful compacts will support programs sting three to five years providing level of resources roughly quivalent to the largest provi ders of assistance in the country this will most likely result in significant

and over the following weeks the corporation identified candi date countries for fy2004 published the criteria and methodology to be used for country lection solicited public comments issued guidelines for compact proposals nd on may 6 2004 selected 16 countries to participate in the mcas first year of operations this was followed on november 10 with the selection of fy2005 eligible mca

february 2 2004 the board of directors met agreed to corporation byl aws and approved undersecretary of state larson as the interim ceo subsequently the president nominated paul applegarth to be the pe rmanent mcc ceo an individual confirmed by the senate on may 5 ceo applegarth has held various international and development positions over the past 30 years primarily in the private sector most recently he was the managing director of emerging markets partnership serving as the coo of emerging africa infrastructure fund in 2002 naming fy2004 candidate countries also on february 2 the mcc board issued list of 63 candidate countri that would be reviewed for possible selection as mca participants in fy2004 these countries according to authorizing legislation must be eligib for assistance from the world banks international development association have per cap ita income of 1415 or less and not be otherwise ineligible to receive us assistance the latter condition eliminated twelve countries burma burundi ca mbodia central african republic cote divoire guineabissau liberia serbia somalia sudan uzbeki stan and zimbabwe that were statutorily barred from receiving american aid publishing the selection criteria and methodology pursuant to reporting requirements set in the mcc gislation the corporation on march 5 2004 sent to congress an overview of the crite ria and methodology that would be used to determine the eligibility of the 63 candi date countries in fy2004 the report suggested that there would be relatively few and only minor changes to the criteria and methodology that had been outlined 15 months earlier the same 16 performance indicators as listed in table 8 below would be utilized in few caseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs40 6 see for example steve radelet et comment on the millennium challenge account selection process center for global development march 9 2004data sources shifted from international institutions to national governments this was especially true in cases where existing data for an indicator were old or incomplete although the corporation did not alte r any of the original 16 performance indicators it attempted to address additional criteria dded by congress in pl 108 199 through the use of supplemental data and qualitative information while the legislative authorities broa dly match criteria proposed by the administration lawmakers included four dditional matters on which to evaluate countrys performance these relate to the degree to which country recognizes the rights of people with disabilities supports sustainable manage ment of natural resources respects worker rights and makes social investments pecially in women and girls given the range and diversity of sugges tions offered throughout the public and congressional debate of the mcc many observers were surprised that the corporation did not propose more subs tantive changes to the criteria and methodology some questioned how riously the administration considered alternative approaches and whether th corporation would be open to future revisions6 during the public comment period and at congressional oversight hearings some suggested that existing data sources needed to be refined or new surveys created in order to specifically measure countrys commitment on the four criteria added by congress after further study of the criteria nd methodology the corporation announced on august 26 2004 revised set of performan ce indicators that will be used for the fy2005 selection process the mcc will lower the inflation rate threshold from 20 to 15 making it somewhat more difficult to pass this test only 6 of the 63 candidate countri failed this test for fy2004 an indicator measuring girls primary education completi on rates will replace broader measure used in fy2004 that did not disaggregate primary educati on graduation by gender as noted above including the means to measure country performance on key women and girls issues is one of the requirements added by congress during deliberation on mcc authorizing legislation the corporation further indicated that it will explore additional criteria and methodology changes for fy2006 under consideration are options to lower the inflation level to 10 identify measurement related to natural resource management themcc has created working group to study possibilities review other possible indicators that would better measure trade barriers that are linked with economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs41 develop more comprehensive indi cator

may 6 the mcc board of directors determined that 16 countries would be ligible for fy2004 mca funding and invited each to submit program proposals armenia benin bolivia cape verde georgia ghana honduras lesothomadagascar mali mongolia mozambique nicaragua senegal sri lanka vanuatu as expected the selection process raised number of questions and concerns the administration had previously said that the board would be guided by but not entirely bound to the outcome of the perfor mance indicator revi ew process that board members could apply discretion in their selection performance trends missing or old data and recent policy actions might come into play during selection deliberations officials noted the final selection reflected decisi ons that both strictly followed the performance indicator outcomes and applied board discretion to take into account other factors ten of the countries comp lied with the stated criteria performing above the median in relation to their peer s on at least half of the indicators in each of the three policy clusters and perfor ming above the median on corruption the board also examined whether country performed substantially below average on any single indicator and whether their selection was suppor ted by supplemental information each of the ten countri also passed these additional tests for ten other countries however some di scretion was applied by the board in three cases cape verde lesotho and sr i lanka the countries met the criteria but fell significantly below average on one indicator yet were still selected by the board due to recent policy changes or pos itive trend lines for three others bolivia georgia and mozambique the bo ard deviated from strict application of the selection criteria because of evidence that the governments were taking corrective actions in the deficient areas on the other hand the mcc board chose not to select four countries that technically met the performance criteria but fell substantially below the median on one or more indicator in each of these cases the board did not believe that the government was taking any action to imp rove its performance although bhutan mauritania and vietnam passe d the corruption hurdle and half of the ruling justly indicators they scored very low on the measurements for political rights and civil liberties and in vietnams case on the voice and accountability indicator fourthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs42 country guyana was also not selected despite passing the necessary hurdles it scored particularly low on the fiscal policy measurement it has been long assumed by mcc officials and close observers of the mca initiative that when the country sel ections were announced there would be disagreements and possible surprises in the final list especially if the board exercised its discretionary authority as it did for fy2004 participants representative lowey for example expressed her view at may 13 house appropriations committee hearing that east timor which failed to pass the economic freedom hurdle in part due to missing data on two of the indicat ors should have been selected ceo applegarth responded that east timor is new nation and that it was premature to conclude that it was hig hperforming country he acknowledged however that east timor should be given close considerati on in the future if the current trend lines continue besides east timor some suggested that kenya should have been included because of its new governments commitme nt to education and anticorruption efforts usaid administrator natsios acknow ledged at the hearing that albania was close call failing because it scored slig htly below the median on corruption like albania malawi and mol dova would have qua lified on the basis of performance if not for slightly failing scores on corrupti on several small island states including kiribati sao tome and tonga were not selected even though the absence of data for several categories ma have played role despite these questions over specific count ry eligibility the selection process appeared to have satisfied two major concer ns that have been c onsistently expressed over the past year based on earlier analysis some argued that africa would be underrepresented in the final lection process with perhap s as few as three regional states participating in fact eight or half of the first year qualifying nations were from africa selection of countries that would give the appearance of geostrategic considerations was concern of many who view the absence of securityrelated factors from mca decisionmaking as one of the most attractive features of the initiative had the board used its discre tionary powers to select indonesia for example some critics would have likely charged that the decision stemmed more from jakartas role in the war on terro rism than on strict policy performance indonesia passed all necessary hurdles except for corruption country selection for fy2005 meeting on november 8 the mcc board of directors made its selection of fy2005 eligible countries armenia benin bolivia georgia ghana honduras lesotho madagascarmali mongolia morocco mozambique nicaragua senegal sri lanka vanuatuhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs43 the board chose one new country for fy2005 morocco while 15 of the 16 nations included for fy2004 were determined eligible again for fy2005 cape verde was not selected due to the fact that its per capita gni exceeded the 1465 ceiling cape verde however remain s eligible for mca support using fy2004 funds board selections represent both high degree of continuity between fy2004 decisions as well as sharp difference in the degree to which it applied its discretionary authority for qualifyi ng or denying countries for fy2005 the fact that each country except cape verde selected for fy2004 mca participation was also decl ared eligible for fy2005 should not be surprising given the nature of the mca concept th board identified in may 2004 what it determined to be the 16 best performers based on the assumption that these countries had and would continue to expr ess strong commitment to the types of economic governance and social policy refo rms measured by the mcc absent substantial negative development since may there was presumed expectation that these same countries would score well in subsequent performance comparison with their income peers moreover except in so extreme situations evidence of slide in policy performance as measured through the various data sources would likely lag behind the actual policy shif t and not be reflected in the immediate data updates in addition two other factors that may not apply in future years seem to have affected the outcome for fy2005 first with the selection dates for fy2004 and fy2005 coming only six months apart rather than one year as should be the case in the future it was likely that the data would indicate less change than might be the case if the comparisons occurred over longer period between may and november several of the data sources upon which the 16 performance indicators are based did not update or revise their figures as resu lt the review of countries for fy2005 was based on much of th same data and rankings as had been the case for the fy2004 selection moreover the addition of 13 new count ries for consideration in the fy2005 round had the effect for at least six of the indicators of lowering the median against which countries were compar ed because of this if country scored well above the median in the fy2004 selection deci sion it was likely that it would score the same or better in the review for fy2005 wh ere medians declined for example in may bolivia fell exactly at the median on the corruption indicator but in november when the median for corruption dropped so mewhat after new c ountries were added bolivia scored above the median even though bolivias score on corruption did not change this phenomena is unlikely to be repeated again to the same extent since countries in the lowincome group will be added or subtracted only if their economy grows beyond the per capita income ceiling or us foreign aid sanctions are applied or lifted since the last review the net effect is that the core set of lowincome countries competing for mca selection is unlikely to change as much as it did in fy2005 thereby reducing the extent to wh ich the median will be altered simply because of the addition of new countries despite the degree of continuity be tween fy2004 and fy2005 in the selection of eligible countries the mcc board parted somewhat from the previous round by not selecting large number of c ountries that technically met the mcahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs44 performance criteria many observers may raise questions over the fy2005 selections regarding th countries that were not selected rather than those that were as noted above in may 2004 the board c hose not to select four countries bhutan guyana ma uritania and vietnam although each passed the minimum number of indicators the board decided to exclude these four because they scored substantially below the median on one or more measurements although without defining precisely what represented ma rk substantially be low the median for fy2005 the board did not select 10 countries that met the criteria including three of the four left out of the fy2004 round mauritania did not meet the minimum qualifications in addition for fy2005 burkina faso china djibouti egypt nepal the philippines and swaziland met the minimum standards but were not selected thus far the corporation has offered little explanation as to why these countries were not chosen it appears however that scoring substantially below perhaps in the lowest 25th percentile has become defacto criteria for exclusion for example the corporati ons ceo paul applegarth commented that the philippines country that passed 13 of the 16 indicators did not qualify because manilla scored substantially below the median on tests for health expenditures and fiscal policy and that more recent trends indicated the fiscal policy situation was deteriorating further each of the other nine nations that met the minimum qualifications but were not select ed also had one score in the 25th percentile although the corporation has not commented on whet her this was the reason for not choosing them another possible reason for limiting the num ber of qualifying countries in the fy2005 round might be due to anticipated funding reductions the administration had requested combined fy2004fy2005 ppropriations of 38 billion but may have available 2530 less depending on the outcome of congressiona l debate on the fy2005 budget corporation officials have said that reduced funding would lead to fewer countries assisted andor smaller grants per c ountry situation that would be complicated further by qualifying additional nations instead the board of directors invited th ree of these 10 countries to participate in the threshold program intended to help nearmiss nations take steps to strengthen areas that would help them qualify for full mca assistance in the future burkina faso guyana and the philippine s may now apply for threshold program assistance another board departure in the fy2005 lection process was to avoid using its discretionary authority to qualify count ries that did not meet the minimum performance indicators in may the boar d chose three nations bolivia georgia and mozambique that did not pass the so called hardhurdle of corruption the latter two again qualified despite falling below the median on corruption while bolivia did not require an exemption afte r the median dropped below its score with the addition of new countries for fy2005 five nations malawi moldova paraguay tanzania and ukraine pa ssed the required number of performance indicators except corruption although malawi paraguay and tanzania are threshold countries none of the five were chosen for full mca statushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs45 threshold countries and us assistance in order to encourage non qualifying countries to improve in w eak areas the united states will help governments that are committed to reform to strengthen performance so that they would be more competitive for mca funding in future years congress provided in authorizing legislation that not more than 10 of mca appropriations 994 million in fy2004 could be used for such purposes stating that the funding could be made available through usaid the mcc t aside up to 40 million for countries that just missed qualifying for fy2004 funding and will announce an amount for fy2005 following enactment of new appropriations the corporation has made two announ cements regarding the selection of threshold countries on september 30 th corporation named seven participants albania east timor kenya sao tome and principe tanzania uganda and yemen five weeks later on november 8 the mcc added six more nations for fy2005 burkina faso guyana malawi paraguay th philippines and zambia according to the threshold program policy guidance issued by the corporation the program will assist countries make policy reforms and institutional changes in areas where they failed to meet the mca performance crite ria if the corporation in consultation with usaid determines that the concept paper shows sufficient commitment to reform and promise of success the count ry will prepare threshold country plan that specifically establishes program schedule the means to measure progress and financing requirements among other c onsiderations usaid is charged with overseeing the implementation of threshol d country plans including working with countries to identify appropr iate implementing partners such as local us and international firms ngos us gove rnment agencies and international organizations like regular mca compact s funding is not guaranteed for each country selected for the threshold progra m but will be based on the quality of the country plan role of usaid and the future of agency programs in mca countries as noted above how usaid woul d participate in the mca initiative has been continuing concern of congress and various policy analysts legislation authorizing the mcc requires the corporati ons ceo to coordinate with usaid and directs the agency to ensure that its programs play primary role in helping candidate countries prepar for mca consideration corporation and usaid officials have said there will be close collaboration between the two entities alt hough the precise nature of the relationship has yet to be made public usaid maintains missions in 14 of the 17 eligible countries might be expected to support mcc programs through contracting pr ocurement and monitoring tasks another question is how usaid will adjust its own programs in mca countries especially wher the agency maintains re latively small activities in relation to other donors since the goal is to provide resources that will make mca programs among the largest aid operations in country it is likely that usaid spending will fall well below amounts pr ovided through mcc compacts for example in mongolia where us aid programs have totaled 1012 million annually in recent years the united states was the fourth larg est bilateral donor in 2002 representing less than quarter of the size of japans economic aid disbursements in ghana senegal and sri lanka usaid maintains larger programs but spends far less than other c ountries and multilateral agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs46 like other issues involving usaid this question remains under review usaid administrator natsios told the house appropriations committee on may 9 2004 that the agency would not withdraw from or cut programs in mca countries but would not increase spending either he said however that usaid would work to ensure that its programs operate in an integrated way w ith mcafunded activities funding issues and the fy2005 mcc request as mentioned above congress appropriated 994 million for fy2004 mcc programs and considered 25 billion request for fy2005 this was by far the largest increase sought by the administration in the foreign operations appropriations proposal and viewed by many observers as one of the most vulne rable items in an increasingly difficult budget environment growing concern raised by some memb ers of congress was whether sufficient funds would be available to support mcc programs in every country selected especially if the board continues to ma ke exceptions and qua lifies more countries than meet the strict criteria representa tive kolbe chairman of the house foreign operations subcommittee speculated at may 9 hearing that based on recent board decisions by 2006 as many as 40 countries might have qualified this he believed could not be fully supported w ith likely funding levels and might raise country expectations that could not be met thereby undermining program incentives mcc officials point out that qualifica tion for the program does not mean that government will receive funding that decision will be based on the quality of the compact proposals and it is possible th at the corporation will not finalize agreements with all eligible countries march 2004 gao report estimated that the mcc could adequately fund 813 compacts with an appropriation of 35 billion the combined fy2004 enacted and fy2005 amounts this suggests that even if congress fully funds the pending proposal the corporation will not be able to support programs in all 16 countries pproved for fy2004 and those selected for fy2005 if congress reduces the 25 billi on request the mcc may face increasing difficulties funding compacts of sufficient size that will have meaningful impact on countrys economic grow th and poverty reduc tion goals this may lead to further congressional examination of the bo ards selection proce ss and consideration of ways to limit the number of count ries selected in the future congressional action foreign operations bills passed in both the house and senate hr 4818 made substantial reductions to the pr esidents mcc request for fy2005 the bill as approved by the h ouse reduced by half the presidents 25 billion proposal in cutting the mcc pr oposal the house appropriations committee noted that its decision resulted solely from the constrained budget environment in fy2005 and the need to address other ad ministration and cong ressional priorities the executive branch in its statement of administration policy on hr 4818 issued prior to house debate expr essed its disappointment ove r the level of mcc funding and urged congress to increase resources during floor consideration on july 15 the house defeated 41379 an amendment by representative paul to liminate all mcc appropriations the house committee in its report on h r 4818 also expressed concern over corporation plans to enter into mult iyear compacts without committing totalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs47 funding for these programs in the year the compact is signed this the committee believed would obligate future congre sses to fund prior year contracts consequently the bill requires the mcc to only sign compacts for which complete funding is available from existing ppropriations the house committee also recommended that compacts be limited to 34 year period rather than 35 year duration envisioned by the mcc the senate measure proposed more si gnificant cut to the presidents mcc request to 112 billion despite th reduction the sena appropriations committee noted its strong support for the pr ogram and reemphasi zed some aspects of the mcc set out in authorizing legisla tion the senate pane l requested report on how the mcc will monitor and evaluate program compacts recommended that the corporation use funds to identify source of data to measure country performance with respect to people with disabilities and urged the mcc to use the expertise of higher education instituti ons and to eliminate from compact proposals elements that would have an adverse environmental impact the senate committee further noted that rural elect rification should be regarded as significant part of countrys rural development goal following strong pressure from the white house to increase mcc funding above house and senatep assed levels conferees settled on 15 billion for the mcc in fy2005 like the house bill the conference agreement requires that the mcc fully fund multiyear compacts selected in fy2004 and fy2005 the measure further amends mca authorizin g legislation adding more specific definition of the performance criteria related to investing in people in the future this category will extend to government polic ies promoting health edu cation and other factors contributing to the wellbein g and productivity of its c itizens including access to affordable housing the combination of reduced appropr iation and the requirement for funding fy2004 and fy2005 compacts with existing appropriations may significantly limit the number andor size of

disagreement between the executive branch and congress is how to allocate the roug hly 3 billion core budget for usaid development assistance and global health programs among the top congressional development aid funding priorities in r ecent years have been programs supporting child survival basic education and efforts to combat hivaids and other infectious diseases the administration has also back ed these programs but officials object to congressional efforts to increase funding for children and health activities when it comes at the expense of other development sectors more recently during the fy2003 and fy2004 budget cycles some memb ers of congress argued that it has been the executive branch that has adde d funds for administration priorities by cutting resources for other development activities in years when congress has increased appropriations for its priorities but not included corresponding boost in the overa ll development aid budget resources for other aid sectors such as economic gr owth and the environment have been substantially reduced this was more pr oblematic during the midtolate 1990s when worldwide development aid funding fell si gnificantly in more recent years and especially for fy2003 and fy2004 congre ss increased overall development assistance so that both congressional and executive program priorities could be funded without significant reductions for nonearmarked activ ities nevertheless administration officials continue to ar gue that such practices undermine their flexibility to adjust resource allocations to changing global circumstances in 2001 the bush administration set out revised usaid core goals for sustainable development programs focu sed around three sphere s of emphasis or strategic pillars that include global h ealth economic growth and agriculture and conflict prevention and developmental relief the administration further introduced new initiative the global developm ent alliance gda in an effort to expand publicprivate partnershi ps in development program implementation under the initiative usaid identifie s good development opportunities being conducted by private foundations nongovern mental organizations universities and forprofit organizations and pr ovides parallel financ ing to leverage resources already committed to these activities usaid officials envisioned that the agency would become much more of coordinating and integrating institution to expand and enhance development efforts of these nongovernmental deve lopment partners although it started out as much more ambitious project usaid requested 160 million for fy2002 the gda has received re latively modest funding allocations with high of 20 million in fy2002 declining to 15 million in fy2004 usaid seeks 10 million for fy2005 underscoring the importance of the debate over funding allocations of development aid resources has been an elev ation by the administration of the value of foreign economic assistance as an inst rument of us foreign policy since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress has approve d two presidential foreign aid initiatives the millennium challenge account mca and the presidents emergency program for aids relief pepfar that are increasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs50 funding significantly for development assistance programs moreover the presidents september 2002 national secu rity strategy established global development for the first time as the third pillar of us national security along with defense and diplomacy for fy2005 the president proposed anot her substantial increase in overall development assistance although the progra ms were configured differently than they have been in the past and the additional re sources were heavily concentrated in few activities where about 30 countries would r eceive the greatest benefits although development activists including numerous nongovernmental organizations ngos strongly support these rising foreign aid budgets they have also raised questions about the degree of resource concentra tion and whether the administration is committed to broadbased worldwide velopment strategy while country participants in the two new foreign aid initiatives pepfar which concentrates resources in 15 focus countries and the mca for which 17 have been selected in fy2004 and fy 2005 are likely to see development aid from the united states grow significantly the outlook for the ot her 3040 recipients of american economic assistance is projection of flat or slightly lower levels of aid the administration further has said that mca funding would be in addition to not substitute for continuing core development activities critics have charged that the fy2004 and fy2005 budget requests

however only if the president determines that the organization meets certain conditions although funding considerations have at times been heatedly debated by congress the most contentious family planning issues addressed in nearly every annual congressional consideration of foreign opera tions bills have focused on two matters whether the united states should contribute to the population fund unfpa if the organization maintains program in china where allegations of coercive family planning have been widespread for many years and whether abortionrelated rest rictions should be applied to bilateral usaid population aid grants commonly known as the mexico city policy unfpa funding the most contentious issue usually concerns the abortion restriction question but most recent ttention has focused on unfpa and white house decision in july 2002 to block the 34 million us contribution to the organization during the reagan and geor ge hw bush administrations the united states did not contribute to unfpa because of concerns over practices of forced abortion and involuntary ster ilization in china where unf pa maintains programs in 1985 congress passed the socalled ke mpkasten amendment which has been made part of every foreign operations appropriation since barring us funds to any organization that supports or participates in the management of program of coercive abortion or involunt ary sterilization in 1993 pr esident clinton determined that unfpa despite its presence in china was not involved in the management of coercive program from 1993 through the end of the decade in most years congress appropriate d about 25 million for unfpa but added directive that required that the amount be reduced by however much unfpa spent in china consequently the us contribution has fluctuated between 215 million and 25 million for fy2002 president george w bush requested 25 million for unfpa congress provided in the fy2002 foreign operations bill not more than 34 million for unfpa while members of the appropriations committees said it was their intent to provide the full 34 million the language allowed the president to allocate however much he chose up to 34 million ceiling the white house placed hold on unfpa funds in january 2002 because new evidence suggested that coercive practices were continuing in chinese counties where unfpa concentrates its programs september 2001 investiga tion team sponsored by the population research institute concluded that consistent pattern of coercion continued in model unfpa counties including forced abortions and invol untary sterilizations refuting these findings unfpacommi ssioned review team found in october 2001 absolutely evidence that the population fund supports coercive fa mily planning practices in china or violates the human rights of chinese people in any way see house international relations committee hearing coercive population control in china new evidence of forced abortion and forced sterilization october 17 2001 see also testimony of josephine guy and nicholaas biegman before the senate foreign re lations committee february 27 2002 although most observers agree that coer cive family planning practices continue in china differences remain over the extent to which if any unfpa supports involuntary activities and whether unfpa s hould operate at all in country wherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs60 such conditions exist given the conflicting reports the state department sent its own investigative team to china for tw oweek review of unfpa programs on may 13 2002 the team which was led by fo rmer ambassador william brown and included bonnie glick former state depa rtment official and dr theodore tong public health professor at the univers ity of arizona made three findings and recommendations in its report dated may 31 2002 findings there is evidence that unfpa knowingly supported or participated in the management of program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china china maintains coercive elements in its population programs and chinese leaders view population c ontrol as high priority and remain concerned over implications of loosening controls for socioeconomic change recommendations the united states should rel ease not more than 34 million of previously appropria ted funds to unfpa until china ends all forms of coercion in law and practice us government funds should be allo cated to population programs in china and appropriate resources possibly from the united states should be allocated to monitor and eval uate chinese population control programs despite the teams recommendation to release the 34 million secretary of state powell decided on july 22 2002 to withhold funds to unfpa and to recommend that they be redirected to other international family planning and reproductive health activities the state partments analysis of the secretarys determination found that even though unfpa did not knowingly support or participate in coercive practice that alone would not preclude the application of kempkasten instead finding that the recipient of us funds in this case unfpa simply supports or participates in such program whether knowingly or unknowingly would trigger the restriction the team found that the chinese gove rnment imposes fi nes and penalties on families that have children exceeding the number approved by the government practice that in some cases coerces women to have abortions they would not otherwise undergo the state departme nt analysis concluded that unfpas involvement in chinas family planning program allows the chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive aborti on the full text of the state departments analysis is

fy2003 the president proposed funding for unfpa although 25 million was requested in reserve for the account from which unfpa receives its funding presumably this could have been made available to unfpa if it was found not to be in violation of kempkasten following several legislative attempts to reverse the administrations denial of unfpa in both fy2002 supplemental appropriations and regular fy2003 foreig n operations measures congress approved in pl 1087 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2003 provision allocating 34 million to unfpa the same as in fy2002 so long as several conditions were met the most significant requirement was that the president must certify that unfpa is longer i nvolved in the management of coercive family planning program following the july 2002 determinati on the administration transferred to usaid 34 million from fy2002 appropriations and 25 million from fy2003 that would have otherwise been provided to unfpa in order to fund usaid

circumstances do not support making determination that unfpa longer supports or particip ates in the management of program of coercive abortion or invol untary sterilization section 572 of the fy2003 foreign operations appropriations re quired the president to issue such statement before restoring us funding to unfpa these transferred funds however remained unspent due to holds placed on them by members of congress the intent in placing the holds by some members was to keep the money available for unfpa in the event that circumstances changed and the administration would make unfpa eligible once again in the fy2004 foreign operations enacted bill division d of pl 108199 congress earmarked 34 million for unfpa s ubject however to the kempkasten conditions the conference agreement further directed how the previously withheld money would be disbursed thereby resolv ing longstanding dispute over whether to commit these resources to other developm ent programs or place them in reserve account in case unfpa again became elig ible for us support the fy2004 appropriation specified that the 34 million withheld in fy2002 shall be used for family planning programs in twelve countries including congo ethiopia uganda haiti and russia the 25 million in fy2003 funds that was earmarked for but not transferred to unfpa would be made av ailable for vulnerable children and for new initiative within the child survival and health account assisting young women mothers and children who are victims of trafficking in persons on july 16 2 004 the state depar tment announced that it had again found unfpa to be in violation of the kemp kasten amendment and would not provide the 34 million designated in the fy2004 appropr iation measure in statement the department said that the united states s been urging unfpa and china to modify the organizations program in manner that would per mit us support to resume the state department found that key ch anges had occurred in unfpas programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs62 that would permit resumption of us funding under the conditions of the kemp kasten provision mexico city policy the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decad ago in 1973 when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan administrati on and later the george h w bush administration restricted f unds for foreig n nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or prom oting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activ ities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial support in some subsequent years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clin ton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding fo r all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortion related work between 1996 and 2000 the house and nate took opposing positions on the mexico city issue actions that repeatedly held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measures the h ouse position articulated by representative chris smith nj and others supported re instatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign or ganizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign c ountries the senate on the other hand rejected in most cases house provisions dealing with mexico city policy favoring position that left th decisions in the hands of the administration unable to reach an agr eement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted interim arrangements during this period that did not resolve the broad population program controversy but pe rmitted the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward the annual compromise removed houseadded mexico city restrictions but reduced populati on assistance to 385 million and in several years metered the availability of the f unds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month in fy2000 when the issue became linked with the separate foreign policy matter of paying us arrears owed to the united nations reluctant president clinton agreed to modified version of abortion restrictions marking the first time that mexico city conditions had been include d in legislation signed by the president enacted in the foreign operations act for fy2000 hr 3422 incorporated into hr 3194 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 because the president could waive the restrictions for 15 million in grants to organizations that refused to certify there was major impact on usaid family planning programs in fy2000 other than the reduction of 125 million in population assistance that the legislation re quired if the white house exercised the waiver authorityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs63 when congress again came to an impasse in fy2001 lawmakers agreed to allow the new president to set policy under the fy2001 foreign operations measure none of the 425 million appropr iation could be obligated until after february 15 2001 subsequently on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator rescinding the 1993 memorandum from president clinton and directing the administrator to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 the president further said that it was his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was co mmitted to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services the press secretary further emphasized that it was the intent that any restrictions do not limit organizations from treating injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions for example post abortion care on february 15 2001 the day on which fy2001 population aid funds b ecame available for obligati on usaid issued specific policy language and contract clauses to implement the presidents directive the guidelines are nearly identical to those used in the 1980s and early 1990s when the mexico city policy applied critics of the certification requireme nt oppose it on several grounds they believe that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the rest rictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding this they contend will lead to higher numbers of unwanted pregnancies and possi bly more abortions oppone nts also believe the new conditions undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating s ituation in which the united states challenges their decisions on how to spend their own money they further argue that us policy imposes socalled gag order on the ability of foreign ngos and multilateral groups to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations this would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states critics note supporters of the certification requireme nt argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible organizations receiving american taxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abor tion laws and regulations the certification process they contend closes the fungibility loophole since reinstatement of the mexico city policy in early 2001 several bills have been introduced to reverse the policy but except for language included in the senate fy2004 foreign operations ppropriations bill s 1426 none has passed either the house or senate and measur has been enacted into law congressional action the conference agreement on hr 4818 provides 441 million for bilateral family planningr eproductive health programs betweenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs64 levels passed earlier by the house 432 million and the senate 450 million the approved amount for fy2005 is 42 million or about 10 higher than the administrations request conferees further earmarked 34 million for unfpa 25 million drawn from the international organizations nd programs iop account and 9 million drawn from the child survivalhealth account the entire 34 million is subject to kempkasten restrictions if the president determines that unfpa is ineligible for us funding under kempkasten the conference agreement directs the administration to transfer the 25 million iop account funds to the child survivalhealth account for usaidmana ged family planning maternal and reproductive health programs confer ees further specified that fy2004 funds previously earmarked for unfpa be sp ent on antitrafficking programs 125 million and family planning and maternal and reproduc tive health activities 125 million after declaring unfpa ineligib for fy2004 funds the administration had signaled that it would reprogram the entire 25 million for antitrafficking programs previously house and natepassed foreign opera tions bills had provided 25 million and 34 million respectively for unfpa the senate measure also directed that the 25 million withheld fro m unfpa for fy2004 shall be available for usaid bilateral family planningrep roductive health activities in 15 specific nations in addition floor amendment s ponsored by senators leahy and bingaman specified that if unfpa is not eligib for us funds in fy2005 the 34 million earmark may not be available for any ot her purpose unless specified in subsequent legislation an earlier attemp t in the house sponsored by representative lowey to make the unfpa contribution available onl for programs in iraq afghanistan tanzania jordan kenya and pakistan countries which re strict or prohibit abortion was defeated by the house appropriations committee 2632 conferees also rejected two senate provi sions that were strongly opposed by the administration and which in previous years prompted veto threats by the president the first provision passed by the senate but dropped in conference amended the kempkasten language in way that w ould narrow somewhat the grounds on which the administration could find unfpa in viol ation of the restrictions the senate text stated that an organization must directly support coercive abortions or involuntary sterilizations in order to be denied us support adding the word directly to the condition the amendment further included new text stating that organization can be denied funds solely b ecause the government of country engaged in coercive practices this presumably was an indirect reference to china intending to establish policy that unfpa could be declared ineligible for us funding exclusively because of coer cive practices by chinese family planning officials the second senate amendment would ve revised the presidents mexico city policy that prohibits foreign non governmental organi zations ngos from receiving us funds if they perform or promote abortion as method of family planning whether or not such activities ar supported with usprovided resources the senatepassed language stipulated that foreign ngos could not be declared ineligible for us aid for conducting any health or medical services with nonus government funds so long as the practices did not violate laws in the country inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs65 7 this section was prepared by rhoda margessonwhich the services were provided or woul d not violate us law the provision further provided that foreign ngos would not be subject to conditions associated with the use of nonus government f unds for advocacy and lobbying activities that were more restrictive than those applied to american ngos it is generally assumed that the mexico city policy ban on advocacy and lobbying would be f ound to be constitutional violation of the right of free speech if it were to be applied to us ngo afghanistan reconstruction7 the conditions in afghanistan for rec onstruction represent challenging mix of ongoing security concerns infrastruct ure destruction and humanitarian needs that require robust and sustained interven tion while the hunt for qaeda forces within afghanistan continues transitional and reconstruction assistance are well underway so far the international co mmunity has continue d to provide large amounts of aid and resources for the rec onstruction effort longterm commitment will likely be necessary to ensure that st able democratic afghan istan emerges the outcomes of internationa l donors conferences since january 2002 indicate continued strong willingness on the part of the international community to assist in the restoration of afghanistan however reconstruction costs are estimated by some to be more than 1530 billion over the next decade the 911 commission report praises the us efforts in afghanistan thus far but emphasizes the need for sustained longterm commitment by the united states and the international community to afghanistans stability and security recognizing that afghanistan remains vulnerable to illicit drug production and

framework through the bonn conference and afghanistan interim administration aia the loya jirga and islamic transitional government of afghanistan itga the constitutional loya jirga and approval of new c onstitution presidential and parliamentary elections and renewed diplomatic ties with the international community third the creation of strategy for reconstr uction beginning with the t okyo

recoveryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32311crs66 the most serious challenges facing afghanistan today are the lack of security and growing trafficking in narcotics an ongoing insurgency involving remnants of the taliban particularly in the southeast has created insecurity and slowed reconstruction there moreover former commanders maintain control over their own areas throughout the country and continue
