agriculture have generated interest among lawmakers in the first session of the 108th congress many similar to matters considered by previous congresses th ey include farm prices weatherrelated concerns such as lingering drought in so parts of the count ry trade negotiations and disputes affecting meat and poultry exports and the environmental impacts of large animal feeding operations among ot her issues of concern are government oversight of meat and poultr product safety protection of animal health including protection against diseases with potentia lly serious economic consequences and guarding against threats of bioterro rism the may 2003 announcement that canadian cow had mad co w disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse illustrated the potential for such consequences see page 27 of ongoing interest are the continuing changes occurring in the livestock and meat markets including concentration and consolidation in livestock production another issue is increasing globaliza tion which not only has expanded export opportunities for us producers but also exposed them to more competition from imports producer groups meat packers nd others have brought their perspectives on the impacts both positive and negative to the attention of lawmakers who have debated and in some cases passed gislation to address these issues for example the us department of agri culture usda oversees law on mandatory price reporting for large meat packers and it is now implementing law requiring that all red meat muscle cuts and gr ound products along with fresh fruits and vegetables peanuts and seafood carry count ry of origin information for the retail consumer effective september 30 2004 legislation limiting packer ownership or control of animals before sl aughter and providing usda w ith more tools to address competitiveness issues in the industry reemerged in the 108th congress as well us beef pork and poultry producers have long prided themselves as self reliant industries that have operated with few if any fe deral subsidies yet in recent years government payments have become more commonplace at least for livestock producers particularly in the form of di saster aid and environmental technical and costsharing support on the other hand such assistance is significantly less than the billions of dollars annually provided to crop and milk pr oducers moreover animal agriculture can be impacted by variety of government policie s like environmental regulation food safety laws and trade disputes and negotiations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs2 1shagam shayle d world agricultura l outlook board usda february 21 2003industry overview economic situation animal production is si gnificant segment of us agriculture in 2002 for example us farmers and ranchers received 94 billion from the sale of animal products or about half of all us farm cash receipts in 2000 and 2001 they received 100 billion and 106 b illion respectively cash r eceipts from feed crops add another 2025 billion to the value of the sector not including soybeans and other oilseeds which also are often fed to animals the fall in cash receipts in 2002 was due to number of unfavorable conditions at usdas agricultural outlook forum 2003 livestock analyst summarized the livestock and poultry sectors experienced stressful year in 2002 as confluence of weather disease and trade disturbances affected markets drought gripped much of the nation diminishing forage and increasing grain costs as result economic conditions which might have been favorable for cowcalf producers to hold back heifers to add to the breeding herd were overshadowed by the continued inability of the forage ba to maintain the existing herd and the cattle cycle entered its 7th year of liquidation hog producers expanded farrowings by about 3 percent in the firs t half of 2002 but as hog prices dropped in mid 2002 and grain prices rose to 5 year highs producers began liquidating sows and reduced farrowings below year ea rlier levels as result inventories which were 3 percent above 2001 on june 1 finished the year 1 percent below 2001 the poultry sector was hit with several outbreaks of disease which although having limited impacts on aggr egate production resulted in disruptions of trade flows coupled with ongoing disputes with russia on poultry imports exports fell sharply and pushed large supplies on the domestic market faced with poor returns the broiler industr began sustained production cutback in the fall of 2002 as the sector moves into 2003 prospects for livestock and poultry are somewhat improved although grain pr ices are higher than year ago return to normal weather may insure adequate forage supp lies for the reduced inventory tighter inventories should help support livestock and poultry prices during the year setting the stage for an expansion in inventories in the next years hog inventories may begin increasing next year and cattle the year beyond trade prospects are improved although seve ral countries have instituted barriers which may limit growth in exports to t hose countries it is hoped that they will bring degree of normalcy to trade patterns however number of uncertainties overhang any forecast in 2003 the economy remains sluggish and any economic disruption could limit meat dema nd disease and food safety concerns are increasing and could derail any expansion if foreign or domestic consumers shy away from meat consumption1 table 1 contains more recent outlook data for meat and poultry these newer usda data serve to illustrate that externalities like trade problems and animal disease outbreaks can alter forecasts see trade below for example the canadian bse outbreak contributed along with other factors to recordhigh cattlehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs3 prices in the fall of 2003 these types of changing conditions help to form the backdrop for animal agriculture issues in congress table 1 meat poultry selected

declining in 2002 both red meat and poultry meat exports were expected increase in 2003 usda reports usda analysts note that while trade prospects look brighter number of uncertainties have affected foreign and domestic demand including sluggish economic conditions and animal disease and food safety c oncerns in some markets for example beef demand in japan the num ber one foreign market for us beef was disrupted when that country in sept ember 2001 reported its first cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease then the discovery of bse in canadian cow in 2003 led to demand by japan and south korea that us beef shipments begin to carry veri fication that they are of us origin2 after assessing the risks of reopening the border us officials began admitting some lowrisk canadian beef products in september 2003 officials are currently working on proposal that might allow young er canadian cattle to enter perhaps starting in 2004 meanwhile usda and trade re ports indicate that as result of the 2003 import suspensions and other factors u s cattle supplies were the lowest in number of years contributing to the dramatic increases in us cattle prices separately japan has increased tariffs on beef imports including from the united states see page 18 for an explan ation existing or impending foreign imposed import barriers in other key export markets which us trade officials are working to reduce or eliminate also add to uncertainties industry structure consolidation and concen tration have fueled ongoing congressional interest in the structure nd business methods of agriculture animal production and marketing in pa rticular have been moving toward fewer and larger operations in recent years ownership or tight control of more than one phase of production and marketing by single fi rm known as vertical integration or coordination also is more common consolidation and concentration have occurred at varying paces within the animal production processing nd marketing sectors the most dramatic changes in recent years have occurred in the hog i ndustry twentyfive years ago the industry had many more smaller opera tions that often were part of traditional croplivestock farms where every phase from conception th rough finishing took place today us hog production is characterized by fewer number of operations that are very large and likely specialize in only one or two pr oduction steps large firms more typically own the pigs contract their production am ong many growers and likely control or coordinate slaughter pr ocessing and marketinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs5 3usda economic research service ers economic and structural relationships in us hog production agricultural economic report 818 february 2003 4ers

approximately 80000 howe ver the hog popula tion has remained relatively stable at an average of 60 million head due to consolidation on larger farms the percent of hogs on farms with 2000 or more head increased from 37 in 1994 to nearly 75 in 2001 according to usda as of 2002 nearly half of the us hog inventory was owned by operations with more than 50000 head3 postproduction the four largest firms share of hog slaughter climbed from 40 in 1990 to 45 in 1994 to 57 in 2001 according to industry trade data thes packers now purchase at most quarter of their hogs on the spot market compared with nearly 90 decade earlier according to one survey by university agricultural economists by contrast poultry production and processing has been ve rtically integrated for decades almost from its start as commercial industry structural changes in the beef industry generally have not b een as dramatic in recent years as for pork small operations still produce the majority of beef cattle in the united states and three quarters of the nations beef cattle spend at least some portion of their life on small farm according to usda4 nonetheless the cattle feeding industry the phase after cowcalving and before slaughte r continues to shift toward small number of very large specialized feedlots that are increasingly vertically integrated with the cowcalf nd processing sectors feedlots with 1000 head or more comprised 2 of the feedlots but marketed 85 of the fed slaughter ready cattle feedlots with 32000 head marketed 40 of the fed cattle5 the four largest beef packers accounted for 68 of all slaughter in 2001 about the same as in 1994 but up from 59 in 1990 according to industry trade statistics6 debate has revolved around the impacts negative and positive of industry structural changes on livestock prices on the traditional system of smallersized independent familybased farms and ranches and on the rural communities where they live and do business also at issue are implications for consumers for trade in global economy and what role govern ment should play in monitoring and regulating agricultural markets policy makers are examining whether current laws for ensuring competition and antitrust still are appropriate and are properly enforced as well as whether new po licy approaches might be consideredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs6 7for more detailed

packers and stockyards programs actions needed to improve investigations of competitive practices september 2000market oversight usdas grain inspection packers and stockyards administration gipsa is charged with oversight of animal markets primarily under the packers and stockyards act ps act of 1921 as amended 7 usc 192 however the agency does not have direct antitrust authority rather its role is to maintain fair competition rules specifically the ps act makes it illegal for meat packer or poultry dealer to engage in or use any unfair unjustly discriminatory or deceptive practice or device give undueunreasonable preferenceadvantage to persons or localities apporti on supply among packers in restraint of commerce trade in articles to manipulate or control prices or to create monopoly or conspire to apportion territory or sa or to manipulate or contro l prices gipsa is authorized to investigate alleged violations in the livestock industry but not the poultry industry the department of justice doj has the authority under several statutes to prosecute anticompetitive acts generally in cluding violations of the ps act upon referral by gipsa7 generally the goal of antitrust regulation is to protect competition for the benefit of consumers regulations are not intended to keep existing competitors producers in the mark et but rather to protect the market from unlawful anticompetitive behavior us da has undertaken number of actions intended to address concen tration and to promote competition including 1 enhanced reporting of livestock prices and other marketing data 2 expanded investigations of procurement and pricing practices in the fed cattle hog and lamb sectors and of poultry companies contr acts with growers and 3 an overhaul of gipsa to strengthen its ability to investigate and pursue prosecution of anti competitive practices several initiatives have been aimed at strengthening usdas oversight of livestock markets andor studying them september 2000 report by the general accounting office gao determined that gi psa lacks the staff the budget and the expertise to investigate anticompetitiv behavior in the livestock industry8 gaos recommendations included calls for an earlier integration of attorneys in the planning and review of investigations and for cl oser consultation between gipsa doj and the federal trade commission ftc during investigations requirement that usda implement gaos recommendations for improving the administration of the ps act was signed into law on november 9 2000 pl 106472 examples of other federal agencies that exert

administration animal drug regulationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs7 packer ownership issue more packers today are feeding animals that they own in advance of slaughter or are using contracts with producers to obtain their animals critics contend that as packers buy fewer animals on the spot open or public market they gain excessive market power in part through less price transparency they want congress to enact legislation that would ban packer ownership and control of livestock background many animal producers believe that th increasing concentration and other changes in their industries have resulted in less competitive market environment and contributed to lower prices than they otherwise could receive they argue that as meat packers those who slaughter and process animals acquire more of their production needs through direct ownershi p through closed contracts with animal feeders or through other marketing arrangements these packers purchase fewer animals on the spot market the resulting reduction in price transparency works to their increasing disadvantage they argue because packers have more access to pricing information and the ability to us it advantageously than do producers usda and private market analysts believe other factors like imbalances in supply and demand are the most significant fact ors in price dete rmination those who defend marketing contract s say they provide more stable producer prices than the spot market opponents of packer ban also argue that it would undermine production efficiency gains made in recent years they contend that production and processing firms must become larger in order to capture lower perunit costs when operating at or near capacity they argue that vertical coordination and the use of advance marketing arrangements ensure steady supply to fill this capacity such arrangements also are reflection of todays agricultural markets which are shifting from the production of few homogenous commodities eg cattle hogs without particular market in mind to creation of wider variety of specific consistently highquality products in response to consumer signals they assert past governmentsponsored studies have been inconclusive on the relationship between agribusiness consolida tion and farm prices one concentration in agriculture report of the usda advisory committee june 1996 confirmed widespread producer distrust of cattle pricing and procurement by packers among its recommendations were improved market data collection to reflect modern marketing practices better access to the data by all segments of the industry and more vigorous enforcement of existin g antitrust laws also see crs report rl31553 livestock ban on packer ownership role of congress in the 107th congress the senate farm

comprehensive examination of us livestock markets and potential legislative solutions the chairman of the house agriculture committee in august 2002 sent letter to producer groups economists packers

for usda 45 milli on for broad 2year study of the market and economic implications of laws that would prohibit packer control of livestock gipsa which is responsible for the study was directed in report language to tap those with industrial organiza tion and business expertise ie beyond traditional agricultural economics gipsa proposed in its next fy2004 budget request an increase of 1 million to implement new pilot program to audit the top four steer and heifer meat packers such audits which usda sa id have never been conduc ted are aimed at assessing the integrity of the packers financial records however the housepassed usda appropriation hr 2673 h rept 108193 does not include this funding the senate appropriati ons committee version s 1427 srept 108107 was awaiting floor action after

farmer cooperative owned packers exempted from the ban w ould be those that process fewer than 100000 hogs or 125000 cattle per year this num ber would be consistent with the exemption level in the livestock mandato ry price reporting law now in place under pl 10678 see page 9 senator grassley also introduced s 325 to require large packers to buy 25 of their daily slaugh ter needs from the spot

by usda is due to expire in october 2004 near the end of the 108th congress lmpr was passed as part of usda s fy2000 appropriation pl 10678 to address the concerns of some livestock producers about low prices increasing industry concentration and the availability of price inform ation under the previous voluntary system usda reporte d data provided on voluntary basis by meat packers and processors on the prices they pay for animals the new law requires large packers to report not only ne gotiated sales but also fo rward contract and formula arrangement transactions background and analysis under the broad authority of the agri cultural marketing act of 1946 7 usc 16211627 usdas agricultural marketing service ams had long collected livestock and meat price and related mark et information on voluntary basis the agencys trained market reporters attended public livestock auctions visited feedlots and packing plants personally contacted many individual buyer s and sellers and consulted with trade associa tions to develop data so buy ers and sellers all would have access to accurate and objective informa tion from major markets throughout the country the information was disseminated through daily weekly monthly and annual written and electronic re ports covering sales of live cattle hogs and sheep and of the wholesale meat products from these animals in more recent years growing numbers of animals have been sold under private marketing arrangements where prices have not been publicly di sclosed or reported some agricultural producers believing such arrangements made it difficult or impossible for them to determine fair market prices for their livestock called for mandatory price reporting m pr requirements for packer s and others who process and market meat opponents of mpr incl uding some meat packers and other farmers and ranchers argued that mpr would impose costly new burdens on the industry and could cause the release of confidential company information lmpr requires the reporting of market information by meatpackers who slaughter an average of at leas t 125000 cattle 100000 hogs or 75000 lambs per year and by importers with annual imports of 5000 tons of lamb usda in turn must publish frequent detaile d reports on these transactions besides preempting state laws the measure s ubjects packers to civil penalties of up to 10000 for each violation of not reporting and requires usda to collect and publish at least monthly information on retail prices for meat and pou ltry products the law also increases the number of required reports new reports under lmpr incl ude the prior days swine market forward contract and formula marketing arrangement cattle purchases packerowned cattle and sheep information sales and purchases of imported boxed lamb cuts and live lamb premiums and discounts ams continues to collect information under the voluntary system ho wever only data not published under the mandatory system are still publis hed under the voluntary system httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs10 role of congress the 108th congress could be asked to consid er legislation extending mandatory price reporting if so among the issues likely to arise are whether the program has in fact brought more transparency to livestock markets and is more effective at transmitting price information than the l ongstanding voluntary system whether the cost and administrative burdens outweigh be nefits and whether price data problems that arose with usdas implementation of the program have since been fixed as officials assert s ee also crs report rs20079 livestock mandatory price reporting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs11 countryoforigin labeling issue federal law requires most imports incl uding many food items to bear labels informing the ultimate purchaser of th eir country of origin various raw agricultural products generally have been exempt the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 contains requirement that many reta ilers provide starting on september 30 2004 countryoforigin labeling cool on fresh fru its and vegetables red meats seafood and peanuts the program is voluntary until then some food industry and producer groups want congress to override the manda such language banning funds for implementation of cool for meats only is in the housepassed version of the fy2004 usda appr opriation hr 2673 other producer groups are seeking retention of the mandate background and analysis in the 107th congress the housepasse d farm bill hr 2646 had included cool for fresh produce only the senatep assed version extended it also to meats peanuts and seafood conferees in 2002 ssentially accepted the senate coverage proponents have argued that cool will he lp us farmers and ranchers because consumers if offered clearer choice would choose domestic over foreign farm products they argue that the economic benefits to us producers will outweigh implementation costs which they believe have been grossly overestimated by usda and other opponents supporters main tain that consumers have right to know where their food is from particularly in light of recent animal health and food safety concerns such as outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease in some other countries many of which they add have their own cool requirements critics counter that cool is thinly di sguised trade barrier intended to increase the costs of imports and that it will undermine the united states own efforts to reduce foreign trade barriers and expand markets for us producers critics argue that implementation burdens will far out weigh any economic benefits to us producers and those who market their commod ities and that the us meat industry in particular will be less competitive with poultry wh ich is not covered by cool opponents also maintain that mandatory cool does not increase food safety and public health nor does it protect animal health they contend that scientifically based protection programs not geogra phical labels are the answer role of congress the house appropriations committee in june 2003 reported the fy2004 usda appropriation hr 2673 hrept 108193 with language prohibiting the use of funds for implementing mandatory cool for meats only on july 14 2003 the house defeated floor amendment to delete the committeeapproved prohibition 208193 before

production throughout the us farm belt in 2001 and 2002 it c ontinued in some areas in 2003 the 107th congress debated and the 108th congress ultimately provided ad hoc assistance for producers suffering disaste rrelated losses during the period proponents of the additional assistance had argued that ongoing programs for natural disaster assistance like crop insurance the noninsured assistan

indus tries has been cha llenging the mandatory aspects of checkoffs which they conte nd are taxes for activities they would not underwrite voluntarily groups representing beef and pork producers have mounted legal actions in the federal courts supreme court rulings on two similar cases involving mushrooms and peaches and n ectarines provide some precedent for the current pork and beef cases these legal ac tions have created much uncertainty about the checkoff programs future background and analysis in 1997 the supreme court ruled in glic kman v wileman bros elliot inc that checkoffs for peaches and nectarines did not violate plaintiffs first amendment rights however in 2001 the court found in united states v united foods inc that the mushroom checkoff was violation of the first amendment and therefore unconstitutional because it forced produ cers to pay for commercial speech the court reasoned that unlike the 1997 case the mushroom checkoff is standalone program whose principal objective was advertising the peach and nectarine order on the other hand rather than standalone promotion program is part of more comprehensive regulatory sche ie one of the marketin g

subsequently usda on february 28 2001 announced settlement with the suits plaintiffs allowing the program to continue with modifications the agreement is aimed at ensuring that the national pork promotion board operates separately from nppc and that the board will be more responsive to producers concerns about its activities in addition usda is to conduct survey earlier than june 2003 and if

much of this total poultry quota was expected to be allocated to the united states although the united states sells little pork or beef to russia new tariffrate quotas on th products would effectively

according to usda officials role of congress generally congress c onducts vigorous oversight of the administrations trade dispute activities on the russian meat and poultry issue for example some members of congress signed letters to the president urging him to be more aggressive in resolving the problem meanwhile section 407 of the trade and development act of 2000 pl 106200 di rects the us trade representative ustr periodically to revise the list of products subject to trade retaliation on the premise that rotating products subject to higher duties will expose broader swath of an offending countrys economy to pena lties thereby creating more pressure for compliance this socalled carousel provision was enacted partly out of frustration over the eu beef hormone and other disput

f oodborne illness longstanding issue is the effectiveness of these efforts and the need if any for policy changes such as increased fsis resources to improve them background and analysis since january 2000 all federally inspected slaughtering and processing plants are operating under the haccp for hazard analysis and critical control point inspection system it is intended to prev ent contamination by microbial pathogens at points along the manufacturing chain where it is most likely to occur haccp complements not replaces the traditiona l system of inspection under existing statutes where inspectors examine every animal before and after slaughter and are also present at least daily in plants that process meat and poultry after slaughter data show that haccp may reduce the presence of pathogens in facilities that produce meat and poultry products yet outbreaks of foodborne illness and sporadic recalls of ground beef and other meat and poultry products indicate the ongoing difficulty of preventing contamination of the products themselves although records show that packing plants for the most part have been abiding by the mandatory standards for pathogen levels major pl ayers in the industry argue that usdas regulations exceed the haccp concept by establishing what they view as impractical expensive testing regimes and unrealistic standards they also maintain that adding haccp while maintaining existing requirements increases regulatory burdens for meat and poultry processors with tangible improvement in public health consumer advocates have re mained supportive of haccp contending among other things that the testing prog ram is effective at reducing pathogens because it forces companies to emphasize prevention in their operating plans on

poultry producers having been using antibiotics to prevent and control diseas promote more efficient growth and address animal wellbeing their use has paralleled the gradual shift in the united states and in other leading animal pr oducing countries from production on smaller more diversified farms to much larger specialized and usua lly confined animal feeding operations some scientists regula tors and others have argued that misuse or overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture can create antimicrobial resistance to related drugs used to treat human diseases and they should be phased out others including many animal producers counter that such assertions have not been scientifically prove n and that an unfounded ban would cost producers millions of dollars in production costs and harm the quality of animal food products background and analysis17 although antimicrobial agents are used to treat illnesses both in humans and animals these agents are so used for nontherapeutic purposes ie in animal feed so that chickens cattle and pigs grow fa ster use less feed nd sometimes disease prevention concern is that such uses can also promote genetic changes that make microorganisms resistant to antibiotics used to treat human illnesses the food and drug administration fda states that due to the diffuse use of antimicrobials it is difficult to assess precisely whether the growing resistance in foodborne pathogens is attributable to the use of antimicrobi drugs in food producing animals or some other use animal producers and the animal drug industry have long argued that far more significant cause of antimicrobial resistance is medical doctors who over prescribe antibiotics for people who dont need them the fda has established standards in its drug approval process for examining the safety and efficacy of nontherapeutic uses of antimicrobial drugs both new and existing ones18 but critics have complained that the agency is not moving aggressively enough these critics were buoyed by world health organization who report issued in august 13 2003 c oncluding that phasing out antimicrobial growth promoters could be accomplis hed without major negative economic consequences for food animal producers in countries like the united states with systems similar to denmarks the who expert panel had studied their phaseout in the late 1990s in danish cattle broiler

health industry officials said the who report theorizes rather than proves that there are human health benef its from discontinued use of subtherapeutic antibiotics and that denmar k has tended to

promoters by the end of 2004 role of congress defining appropriate legi slative responses may be more difficult given the complexity of the antimicrobial resistance problem the limited data to assess the problem and the disagreement over the serious ness or the extent of the health threat of resistance nonetheless there is interest in congress in the issue for example on july 25 companion bills that would ban subtherapeutic uses of most antibiotics in animal feed were introduced into th senate s 1460 and house hr 2932 among other provisions fda would have to withdraw approval for each such drug within 2 years unless it has been proven harmless and usda would be authorized to provide financial assistance to farms especially small family farms to help them make the transitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs27 mad cow disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy issue on may 20 2003 canada announced that one cow in northern alberta herd had tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease usda immediately banned canadian live cattle and beef imports in august it began steps to gradually reopen the border to such products congress is monitoring closely us efforts to protect us agriculture and consumers from the entry here of bse as well as the econo mic and trade implications of the incident background and analysis variety of animal diseases have the potential to inflict extensive physical and economic harm on animal agriculture and to cause foreign countries to bar us imports some of them pose health risks to humans as well usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis is charged with protecting the health and marketability of animals and animal products the canadian bse case is illustrative of the difficulties that could confront us producers and aphis in the event of certain disease outbreaks bse is slowly progressive incurable disease affecting the nervous system of cattle it was first diagnosed in great britain in the mid1980s where it not only economically devastated the beef industry there and in other european countries but consumption of products from infected animals also wa s linked later to some cases of similar and fatal human disease case has ever been detected in the united states since surveillance began in 1989 when canada announced its bse case us officials quickly blocked imports of all canadian ruminants and ruminant products pending furt her investigation canadian authorities quarantined the farm and others 2700 cattle have been killed so far more animals have exhibited bse an intensive investigation was conducted to determine the cow s origin later found to be saskatchewan farm and movements how its remains were processed whether ot her herds might have been infected and the possibility that contaminated feed may have been the source on august 8 2003 usda announced that it would accept applications for permits to import selected ruminant pr oducts from canada in cluding boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old and boneless veal from calves older than 36 weeks at slaughter and boneless sheep nd goat meat from animals under 12 months old usdas decision was based on what it characterized as thorough scientific analysis that found minimal risk from these imports canadian beef began crossing the border again in september 2003 th ban on live canadi an cattle remains usda said it was working on proposed cond itions for opening the border to younger animals which possibly could occur sometime in 2004 international trade considerations complicated the us decision to reopen the border for example officials in japan the largest us beef export market insistedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs28 21for more information see

ters desiring to sell beef to japan or any other country that may request similar documentation can apply for bev certification from ams after satisfying list of requirements so that the agency can verify that their beef is from cattle slaughtered in the united states usda argued that the verification program was not scientifically justified but was developed to meet foreign market demands21 prior to the canadian case us officials already had taken series of precautionary steps to keep bse from enteri ng the united states and its food supply and developed an emergency response plan to implement if case is found usda since 1989 has banned the import of all liv ruminants and most ruminant products from countries where even si ngle case of bse is known to exist canada will be the first bse country permitted to import some beef in 1991 usda banned the import of rendered by produc ts from ruminants as of december 2000 the import of all rendered animal protei n products whether from rumin ants or not is prohibited the food and drug administration fda wh ich regulates animal feed ingredients banned the feeding of virtually all ma mmalian proteins to ruminants in 1997 additionally usdas food safety and inspec tion service fsis requires inspectors to divert from processing any cattle showing suspicious clinical symptoms of bse and send their brains for laboratory testing22 role of congress the 107th congress updated and consolidated variety of old animal quarantine and health laws by passing the animal hea lth protection act as part of the 2002 farm law pl 107171 7 usc 8301 et seq pl 1087 which contained the fy2003 appropriation for usda and related agen cies includes 62 million increase for aphis animal health monitoring and rveillance activities 133 million total in order to increase the agencys surveillance against and readiness for biological attack against us agriculture the 107th congress also passed the animal disease risk assessment prevention and contro l act of 2001 pl 107 9 which required usda to lead an interagency working group to assess and report on the economic impacts if bse or several other diseases were to be introduced into the united states federal prevention efforts the risks to public health from possible links of bse to human illness and the sufficiency of legislative authority to control these animal

force national identification work plan november 2002 it and revised 2003 version can be viewed at httpwwwusaipinfoanimal identification and meat traceability issue should us animal agriculture improve its capability to trace the movement of livestock and meat products from their sources through the marketing chain if so what type of system might be appropriate s hould it be mandatory what would it cost and who pays interest in such questions has grown in the wake of such developments as the discovery of bovine spongif orm encephalopathy bse in canadian cow related dema nd by japan for verification that us beef imports are of us origin and ongoing concerns about bioterrorism implementation of new countryoforigin labeling cool law for m eats and other products also has resulted in an interest in increased animal identification id capabilities background and analysis animal id refers to permanently markin g individual or groups of farm animals so that they can be tracked from birth to slaughter animal id is one segment of meat traceability generally the tracking of identifiable products through the entire marketing chain to the ultimate consumer animal id and meat traceability are not programs in themselves rather they may be useful tools in animal health food safety quality assuran ce and countryoforigin labeling programs many producers already keep records on the identities of each of their animals however nationwide comprehensive us animal id system is in place although many animals have been identified as part of animal disease programs governmentindustry task for ce is developing national animal id system it has stated that the health of us herds is th most urgent issue and therefore is the most significant focus of its proposed pl an it is anticipated that usdas animal and plant health inspection service aphis along with states and industry will oversee the system it initially will identify all premises where cattle are located to help in more quickly finding and eradicatin g animal diseases the effort is to evolve into program identifying individual animals herds andor flocks the task force effort is focused on animal disease tracking policy issues include whether it should be mandatory its cost and who should pay th ere is also interest in system that can trace meats to their birth animals where concerns also include the legal and economic impacts on producers and those w ho process and market meat products the task force notes other countries ar rapidly developing systems that are already being used as technical barriers to trade these systems are rapidly becoming the world standard to avoid the loss of international markets the united states needs to be consistent with the animal tr acking systems of our international trading partners as our export potential grows th need to quickly trace suspected foreign or emerging diseases will be more important than ever24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs30 the european union eu where bse cas have been concentrated most in the united kingdom now has an extensive but critics charge ineffective mandatory program beginning in decem ber 2001 japan began tagging all beef and dairy cattle and developed database to track each animals birth and movement current japanese country of origin labeling already identif ies us beef in food stores japans newer demands would require ot her documentation australia major exporter and us competitor has largely voluntary but universal system that identifies all cattle and uses carcass and boxed meat labeling procedures

countries argentina and canada can identify primary animal production sites and mo st individual cattle respec tively and also can trace back carcasses and meat cuts to slaughter and processing establishments role of congress in the 108th congress much of the debate over expanded animal id has occurred within the context of cool the 2002 farm bill pl 107171 requires many retailers to provide countryoforigin information on number of raw products including fresh and ground beef pork and lamb starting september 30 2004 in reviewing cool implementation issues s ee page 11 lawmakers have learned more about how animal id can be used for other purposes most notably to deal with harmful animal diseases they also have become more aware of trade implications surrounding animal id and meat traceability as japanese officials have made clear the canadian case of bse has critical implications for us producers the bse or other unforeseen events might further focus attention on animal id and meat traceability one proposed bill s 1202 w ould require traceability for all meat and poultry for further information see crs report rl32012 animal identification and meat traceability httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs31 humane treatment of farm animals issue aphis is responsible for enforcing the animal welfare act awa 7 usc 2131 et seq which requires minimum standard s of care for most warmblooded animals bred for commercial sale used in research transported commercially or exhibited to the public the awa specifically excludes commercial farm animals from coverage animal protection activists in the united states periodically seek legislation modifying andor curtailing many practices that have long been considered by us producers as acceptable and necessary background and analysis federal law prescribes standards fo r onfarm handling and care of animals two statutes the humane slaughter act 7 usc 1901 et seq enforced by usdas food safety and inspection service fsis and the socalled twentyeight hour law 45 usc 7174 enforced by aphis do govern respectively the humane slaughter and transport of livestock but not poultry most states have their own animal anticruelty laws which often but not always apply to farm animals such laws also generally do not prescr ibe onfarm treatment standards many animal protection groups contend that todays in tensive farming systems perpetuate standard practices that are harmful to animals wellbeing examples of such practices include rearing large numbers of livestock or poultry in close confinement with little room for natural movement and activity isolating veal calves in crates and performing surgery such as docking hog tails and trimming poultry beaks so that confined animals do not hur t each other some groups advance the more controversial argument that humans have right to use animals for any purpose even food agricultural producers have long maintain ed that they understand their animals welfare needs and address them adequately they express concern that efforts by poorly informed critics could lead to the imposition of mandatory regulations harmful to their industry and the animals alike support for science ducation and voluntary guidelines are more effective ways of assuring animal welfare they believe the us approach differs from that in europe where the european union and many of its member states have adopted legislation laying down minimum standards for farm animal care and transport in the united states surveys suggest that most people and many animal protection groups s till support agricultural uses of animals but many also appear to support some gove rnment action to insure humane treatment role of congress over the past several decades bills to require changes in the treatment of animals on the farm and during transpor t and slaughter have been offered in congress although few have advanced beyond the house and senate agriculture committees the committees in the past have held hearings on various farm animalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31945crs32 welfare issues and the pane ls generally have expresse d support for voluntary rather than more coercive methods of assuring adequate care as of august 2003 several proposal s had been offered in the 108th congress hr 857 sweeney would prohibit the trans port or slaughter of horses destined for human food consumption on july 14 2003 representative ackerman during house floor debate on the fy2004 usda ppropriations bill hr 2673 introduced an amendment to bar the use of federal funds for inspecting slaughtering and processing all nonambulator or downer livestock the amendment was defeated by vote of 199202 earlier on june 19 2003 representative ackerman offered similar proposal as freestanding bill senator akaka introduced companion legislation on the same date hr 2519s 1298 in january 2003 congress earmarked in the fy2003 usda appropriation part of pl 1087 5 million specifically for fs is to hire 50 new inspectors to oversee compliance with the humane slaughter ac t the agency had come under criticism in 2002 for what some view as lax enforcement of the act the 107th congress included in the 2002 farm law pl 107171 sense of congress resolution calling for full enforcement of the act sec 10305 the law also contains requirement that usda investigate the treatment of nonambulatory livestock
