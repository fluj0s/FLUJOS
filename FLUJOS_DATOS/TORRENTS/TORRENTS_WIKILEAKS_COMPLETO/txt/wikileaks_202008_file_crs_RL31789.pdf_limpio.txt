implementation act hr 2739 delay and s 1417 grassley was introduced and by july 17 had received committee approval the agreement has received s upport from the business community and consumer organizations but has been criticized by labor and some environmental interests some of the specific concerns raised deal with the restrictions on penalties for unresolvable disputes over labor nd environmental issues the integrated sourcing initiative potential capital contro ls temporary visas and access for us exports of chewing gum basic policy issue with respect to the fta is whether the united states should pursue free trade and i nvestment relations on bilateral basis rather than maintaining existing trade and investment practices on both sides or pursuing more liberalized trade relations through other means also at issue is the extent to which the fta language should be used as model fo r other agreements negotiations for the ussingapore fr ee trade agreement were launched under the clinton administration in decembe r 2000 the fta would be the fifth such agreement the united states has signed and the first with an asian country according to the us trade representative the fta has broken new ground in electronic commerce competition policy and government procurement it also includes what the us trade representative reportedly considers to be major advances in intellectual property protec tion environment labor transparency customs cooperation and transshipments the ussingapore fta required congressional imple mentation under expedited trade promotion authority legisla tive procedures it continues the trend toward greater trade liberalization and globalization contains new approach to imposing penalties for unresolvable environmental and labor disputes and may affect certain trade flows that would in turn affect us businesses since singapore is relatively small ec onomy the economic effects of the us singapore free trade agreement by themselves are not likely to be great the debate over implementation of the fta is falling between business and free trade interests who would benefit from more liberalized trade particularly in services and labor or antiglobalization interests who oppose more ftas because of the overall impact of imports on jobs and the gene ral effects of globalization on income distribution certain jobs and the environment specific provisions of the agreement also have generated debate this report will be updated as circumstances warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31789contents l g i s l t i v p r c d u

agreement potential economy and selected sectoral effe cts usitc publication 3603 june 2003 continuedsmall the report explained that this is not an unexpected finding given the open trade relationship small trade and bilateral investment flows relative to us trade and investment worldwide and singapore s small economy relative to that of the united states at the sectoral level the report concluded that some sectors of the us economy likely would experience increased import competition from singapore while other sectors likely would expe rience increased export opportunities in singapore however any such increases would be from very small base given singapores small economy nd small market size and thus have minimal impact on production prices or employment in co rresponding us sectors by the year 2016 the itc estimated the effects to be greater for us exports of vegetables fruits and nuts meats and other processed foods for us imports impacts most likely would be greater for electr onic equipment and other mach inery and equipment us imports of textiles apparel and leather products were estimated not likely to increase significantly because of the requirements for rules of origin in the fta legislative procedures the act providing trade promotion aut hority tpa to the president pl 107 210 contained certain cons ultation and notification re quirements in order for international trade agreements to be considered by congress under expedited procedures the requirements include the following11 at least 90 calendar days before entering into trade agreement the president must

as indicated in the provisions for xtiles and apparel bove the agreement contains rules of origin designed to sure that only us and singaporean goods benefit from the agreement chapter 3 these rules

exports with substantial tr ansformation and value adde d done in singapore can be conferred singapore origin and qualify for the fta tariff rates in the industry review of the fta the industry sector advisor committee on textiles and apparel reported that the most significant interest and sharp division among committee members revolved around the rules of origin and the issue of whether they might become preceden t for other trade agreements the fiber yarn and textile members largely supported the requirements of yarn forward rule that grants benefits only to the signatories of th agreement and not to third parties they believe this condition is an appropriate precedent for future trade agreements and since they felt it largely paralleled the north america free trade agreement it could create parity among us trading partne rs the industry did however express concerns over what they considered to be high tariffs levels in the stages of the agreement that could undermine the origin ru in the early years of the agreement23 in contrast apparel members largely expressed disappointment with the fta because they considered the nafta rule of origin as restrictive and that it would be made worse by additional comp lications and burdens they argued that the rule of origin discourages apparel trade among th beneficiary countries which will in turn diminish sales opportunities for fabric and trim suppliers th ey urged that the rule of origin in this fta not be seen as precedent for other ftas the fta provides for imported inputs us ed in the manufacture of the final product within singapore to be classified under different tari ff classification from the final product for some electronic produc ts the origin is singapore if certain percentage of the value added typically

ftas investment chapter 15 the agreement is to provide secure predictable legal framework for investors operating in each others economy all forms of investment are protected under the agreement unless specifically exempted us investors are provided treatment as favorable as local singaporean investors or any other foreign investor pursuant to us trade promotion authority the agreement draws from us legal principles and practi ces to provide us investors basic set of substantive protections that singapor ean investors currently enjoy under the us legal system among the rights afforded to investors consistent with those found in us law are due process protections and the right to receive fair market value for property in the event of an expropriation whether di rect or indirect the agreement prohibits and removes certain performan cerelated requireme nts or restrictions on investors such as limitations on the number of locations or requiring an investor to export given level of goods and services as condition for the investment the fta ties investor protections to standards developed under customary international law but environmentalists and business representatives reportedly differ on what this standard means and on whether it sets parameters that exceed or fall short of the standard in us law w hich tpa or fasttrack legislation bound negotiators not to exceed as for indir ect expropriation the fta incorporates the test used by the us supreme court fo r regulatory taking the singapore fta differs from the various clarifications to the north america free trade agreement nafta in that it obligates singapore nd the united states to give investors treatment in accordance with customary inte rnational law rather than in accordance with international law the latter was the formulation included in nafta which has been read by nafta panelists to in clude obligations under other international agreements such as the world trade organi zation such interpretations are explicitly rejected in the singapore fta by inclusion of text which holds that breach of other provisions of the fta or of other interna tional accords does not constitute violation of the minimum standard of treatment the fta also incorporates language from the clarification of nafta that says the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens is the standard that investors must be accorded and that obligations in the agreement to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security do not create subs tantive obligations over and above that standard27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31789crs17 27 continued march 14 2003another matter of considerable disput during the negotiations was investor rights the issue concerned the

the fta goes farther than previous freetrade agreements the fta also enhances enforcement of intellectual property rights nondiscrimination obligations apply to all types of intellect ual property the

date the measure was imposed in side letter dated march 7 2003 us under secretary of treasury for international affairs john b taylor wrote to the singapore monetary authority providing more detail on the term substantially impede transfers39 he stated that without attempting to exhaustively define the term we agree as rebuttable presumption that restrictive measures on outward payments and transfers will be deemed not to substantially impede transfers if they are applied on national treatment and mostfavorednation basis are pricebased are not confiscatory do not effectively prohibit or ban tr ansfers over any period of time do not constitute dual or multiple exchange rate practice do not restrict the sale or conversion of the assets to any other asset denominated in singapore dollars and do not otherwise interfere with the inve stors ability to earn market rate of return in singapore on the restricted assets measure will not be deemed to substantially impede transfers by virtue of the fact that it relies on approval procedures for outward payments nd transfers provided the approval procedures are based on objective and transparent rules and investors have an alternative means of making payments and transfers through pricebased mechanism the letter further states that if measure is found to substantially impede transfers the investor will have the burden of proving the existence and extent of diminution in its asset value as consequence of the measure if an investor can only speculate that the exchange rate would have been more favorable on the date when it was prepared to transfer its funds than when the funds were transferred and singapore presents evidence that the exchange rate could have been even less favorable at that time had the measure not been imposed the in vestor has not met its burden of proof the letter further states that if measure substantially impedes transfers it shall not prevent investors from earning market rate of return in singapore on any restricted assets following approval of the fta the legal definition of substantially impede is likely to be determined in actual dispute settlement cases it could be expectedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31789crs26 40 ibid in september 1998 malaysia prohibited its domestic banks from lending to non residents and stockbrokers or from engaging in any swap or repurchase

global economy perhaps to include singapore generally point to increasing competition from imports the accompanying threat to economic security in certain industries particularly labor intensive industries with significant us pr oduction the rising us trade deficit and claimed negative effects of globalization such as income maldistribution and increased pollution from industrialization among the 31 administration trade advisory committees only the labor advisory committee did not endorse the u ssingapore fta the labor committee rejected the proposed fta along with the uschile fta stating that it repeated the same mistakes of the north american free trade agreement and would likely lead to the same deteriorating trade balances lost jobs trampled rights and inadequate economic development that nafta created the other 30 advisory committees including the trade and environment policy advisory committee generally endorsed r were neutral on the agreement although there were dissenting opinions and reservations about particular provisions42 the key advisory committee on trade policy and negotiations strongly endorsed the agreement stating that it believed the fta strongly promotes the economic interests of the united states and substantially achieves the overall and principal negotiating objectives set fort h in the trade act of 2002 the labor representative on that committee however dissented saying that it failed to meet the objectives in number of areas including labor and environment as for the benefits of ftas thos in favor of trade and investment liberalization including ftas generally claim that it brings increased export opportunities greater business flexibility nd more efficient economy they also point out that foreign countries usually have higher trade and investment barriers than those in the united states trade agreements therefore usually require greater lowering of barriers by the foreign country than by the united states they

employment of this trade therefore is generally positive lthough bilateral trade balances have little effect on overall us employment levels on microeconomic level however the electronic equipmen t and other machinery and equipment industries could experience greater import competition under the fta the domestic apparel industry would appear to lose the most tariff and quota protection from

free trade agreements impact on us trade and implications for us trade policy by william h cooper 49 urban land institute singapore economist intelligence uniton which duties totaled 85 million for an average of duty rate 16347 these rates are relatively high other significant terms of the agreement appear to be in greater access to singapores services market by us companies the agreement not only includes lowering of regulatory barriers for us subsidiaries operating in singapore and legal protections comparable to those in the united states but it ensures that us based companies will be able to sell their services such as portfolio management consulting services video music and so ftware delivered electronically without border barriers or customs fees the si ngaporean market however is relatively small and highly competitive some have criticized bilateral ftas because they can introduce economic inefficiencies by distorting trade flows they tend to divert export and import trade toward the countries involved48 for example under the north american free trade agreement some us importers have turned to suppliers in mexico rather than buying from asia and some manufacturers from asia have relocated to mexico to take advantage of the tarifffree access to the north american market inefficiencies caused by such trade diversion however may be offset by gains in efficiency through trade creation additional trade generated by the existence of the larger unified market several factors mitigate against significant trade creation or trade diversion being caused by the ussingapore fta both singapore and the united states already have low trade barriers the two markets are separated by long distances and the singaporean economy is relatively sm all population of 44 million in an area roughly 35 times the size of the district of columbia still the country boasts substantial economy with gdp of about 88 billion or about the same size as that of oregon or south carolina and twoway trade with the united states of roughly 30 billion this trade however amounts to only 16 of total us trade of 1982 billion the ussingapore fta therefor does not seem likely to create significant amount of new us exports or imports of goods some trade diversion is possible under the fta manufacturers currently producing elsewhere in asia could relocate to singapore however with singapores per capita income at 20600 average hourly labor cost of 773 compared with 555 in taipei ta iwan 112 in ba ngkok thailand and 064 in guangzhou china and office occupancy costs 67 higher than those in guangzhou and 330 higher than those in bangkok49 it seems unlikely that great number of factories would move to singapore to take advantage of the fta attempted illegal trans shipments from

committee for trade negotiations and trade policy lac february 28 2003bilateral ftas moreover also play role in the trade liberalizing process currently markets are opene d primarily through multilate ral negotiations under the world trade organization through organiza tions such as apec or by sectoral initiatives given the slowness of the wto multilateral negotiating process and the lack of further progress on sectoral trade liberalization following the information technology agreement50 in 1996 c ountries can do an end run around the wto and liberalize trade with ot her likeminded countries th trade diversion created by such ftas however unleashes pressures fo r governments to either create ftas of their own or join into existing fta arrangements traditionally protectionist countries such as china or japan now ar actively seeking ftatype arrangements with other nations bilateral ftas therefore can become building blocks rather than stumbling blocks to global trade liberalization fta provisions on the temporary entry of bus iness personnel and professional workers are raising concerns among many in the field of immigration because immigration law traditionally is spe lled out by congress not the executive branch some maintain that the ustr has negotiated these immigration provisions without any authority or direction to do so from congress the labor advisory committee in particular was critical of the provisions on the temporary entry of business personnel and profe ssional workers because it appears to enable workers from singapore who have direct employment except service contract to enter the united states and such visa programs th ey argue would be in addition to the existing h1b system without the exis ting labor condition application lca protections for domestic workers51 the mock markup sessions in the house and senate judiciary committees addressed this issue see discussion in the above section of this report on temporary bu siness personnel and wo rkers for details more generally some point out that these provisions bound by the fta may constrain current and future congresses when they consider revising immigration law on business personnel treaty traders in tracompany transfer s and professional workers because the united states would run the risk of violating the fta in responding to the labor advisory committee report the ustr maintained that the temporary entry of professionals falls within tr ade promotion authority act objectives regarding the opening of foreig n country markets for us services and investment in particular to reduce or eliminate barriers that restrict the operations of service suppliers or the establishment or operations of investments the ustr claimed that ensuring crossborder mobility of professionals and other business persons is critical for us companies in developing new markets and business opportunities abroad the ustr also argued that it is incorrect to

indonesian manufacturers would not be covered by the labor environmental nd other provisions of the fta indonesia also would not be required to provide any reciprocal access to its markets concern was that other countries such as china might also be able to use the provision to ship product through singapore to the united states in order to avoid us customs users fees some language dropped from the final text of the fta appears to resolve this issue in order for third country to take advant age of the isi it would have to ship qualifying product from the united states to singapore to be incorporated into product subject to the regional content requi rement and then shipped back to the united states also at issue is the extent to which pa rticular provisions of the ussingapore fta

with australia as well as the proposed free trade area of the americas that would cover the western hemisphere in many of these countries labor and envi ronmental standards are considered to be lower than those in singapore the ussingapore fta states that both parties are to ensure that their domestic environmental laws provide for high levels of nvironmental protection and are to strive to continue to improve such laws the agreement also requires that the parties effectively enforce their own domestic environmental laws with respect to labor standards both parties also are to reaffirm their obligations as members of the international labor organization they are to strive to ensure that their domestic laws provide for labor standards consistent with internationally recognized labor principles the agreement further requires the parties to effectively enforce their own domestic labor and environmental laws these obligations are to be enforceable through the agreements dispute settlement procedures but with financial penalties capped in amount for noncompliance bor interests point out that while the singapore agreement commits the signatories to enforce their domestic labor
