6105c12 shspec2 assessment you in trying to equate relatively simple fundamental in scientology are of course picking up fundamental which sits right in the middle of anyones case and you tend to blow off little confusion in trying to get ahold of it it would be easy to teach you to run diesel engine but the data were teaching goes straight into the middle of reactive computation sop goals does this exact thing exactly reversing how the mind got aberrated the most hidden factors of mind were the things that aberrated mind because ones ever freed mind before so they must have been the most concealed or they would have asised sop goals undoes all the things that plowed someone in it consists of all the solutions person adopted to fix all the oddball circumstances he got into ever that longer apply who wouldnt want to have the kind of mind that could be happy doing something simple basically what youre afraid of is getting bored this happens because what you are doing is somehow inadequate to the demands of the environment if ones simple game gets invalidated one looks for more complicated one this could only happen if one had invalidated someone else already to get kicked in the butt you must have kicked someone in the butt and postulated that its bad to get kicked in the butt if the way to do perfect assessment were put on paper theres high probability that it wouldnt be followed because were dealing with the basic stuff of which the reactive mind is composed and on this subject more than any other youll find more confusion more silly questions the datum restimulates the whole confounded bank what happens is that the guy does something which eventually recoils on him in way which gives him new problem he gets his motivator and gets new beingness to have new game but hes now not being himself hes being solution to the problem of livingness the solution eventually ends him up with new problem which he solves with some new beingness some new game every time he gets overwhelmed in some game he shifts beingness to the new game which solves the old one if you clear someone without clearing up his bedohave condition hell realize he has game and hell recreate his old condition or be bored or worried hell go unclear he thinks its less dangerous to be aberrated than to have game if you clear erase his games conditions across the boards hell do this the essence of all games is beingness and doingness towards havingness the problem is that they get jammed into cant have must have situation in games condition the person has to be something but he cant be it there is something wrong with being what he is being so he cant be it and he dare not be it and yet he must be it and this emerges when you are auditing sop goals game or goal is abandoned because it was invalidated too many times guy goes into new game and valence and ends up not being himself in assessment you are backtracking these valences expressed as goals since by this time the pcs comm with the world is very poor you have to handle whats real to the pc so thats what you handle whats odd is that theres only one valence thats real to the pc at one time in life as the valence goes up the pc comes down this ends up with serene valence and the pc out the bottom so the individual goes around acting psychotic in serene valence this is the theetie weetie case as you audit the person the valence comes down and the pc starts taking over handling the game and the environment on his own determinism as the pc gets out of fixed games he can look around and find hes got more games if hes got more games hell go more clear if less hell go unclear the act of finishing off clearing doing more and more sop goals is what stabilizes the clear having to play the game is what prevents one from playing the game one can play the game as long as one doesnt have to details on running of sop goals any goal which is to put up mockup is liable to be false one and is dangerous one to audit it is perishable because the result of failure is to create mockup so that you get into an arts goal always be suspicious of an arts goal because theres always the thing you can do when all else fails and thats usually the arts when actual masses dont work to overwhelm the opposition they turn to aesthetic masses which are closer to the thought band if you go just little further with assessment the case will likely get into better goals channel you can ask what did you want to do before you went into the arts this also applies to professions in the thought band like philosophy and law featherweight goal denotes hell of failure just ahead of it
