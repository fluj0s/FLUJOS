the presidential candidate of the democrats obama pledged to go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs th at longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less

management and budget omb is seen as vehicle for conducting such reviews3 when accepting the republican nomination for president he called for changing the way government does almost everything from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network from the way we tr ain our workers to the way we educate our children all these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war we have to catch up

running mate alaska governor sarah palin indicated that govern ment reform was one of three areas she would focus on with mccains agreement during his presidency5 in terms of institutional changes it was reported several weeks prior to his becoming presidentelect that obama would likely create national technology czar with broad authority to develop policy elevating hightech issues to the cabinet level in major recalibration of the governments approach to regulating the communications sector6 that prospect was reitera ted after the election with much speculation about the role of such czar

agencies were determined by congress in the aftermath of world war i however with the rise of the new public administration profession and growing sentiment for attaining efficiency and economy in government came efforts to strengthen the presidents management ability in 1932 the chief executive was statutorily authorized to issue executive orders proposing reorganization within the executive branch for purposes of reducing expenditures and increasing efficiency in government13 reorganization order became effective after 60 days unless eith er house of congress adopted resolution of disapproval when president herbert hoover submitted 11 different reorganization orders in 1932 all were disapproved by th house of representatives on the grounds that his newly elected successo r franklin d roosevelt might have different reorganization ideas president roosevelt did submit number of reorganization orders pursuant to revised and extended version of the 1932 statute which expired automatically in 1935 some major actions taken in these orders included creating procurement and disbursement divisions in the treasury department establishing an enlarged national park service in the

disapproval in his initial reorganization plan president roosevelt created the executive office of the president an enclave for entities immediately assisting the chief executive such reorganization authority renewed periodically dozen times between 1945 and 1984 with slight variation remained ava ilable to the president for nearly half century at different junctures qualifi cations were placed upon its exercise for example reorganization plans could not bolish or create an entire department or deal with more than one logically consistent subject matter also the president was prohibited from submitting more than one plan within 30day period and was required to include clear statement on the projected economic savings expected to result from reorganization modification of the presidents reor ganization plan authority was made necessary in 1983 when the supreme court in the chadha case effectively invalidated continued c ongressional reliance upon c oncurrent resolution to disapprove proposed plan15 under the reorganization act amendments of 1984 several significant changes were ma in the reorganization plan law16 any time during the period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of congress following the submission of reorganization plan the president might make amendments or modifications to it within 90 calenda r days of continuous session of congress following the submission of reorganiza tion plan both houses must adopt joint resolution which unlike concurrent reso lution becomes law with the presidents signature central issue in the chadha case for plan to be

recommendations was to give the president expedited authority to reco mmend structural reorga nization of federal agencies and departments21 congressional interest in possibly restoring the presidents reorganization plan authority was evidenced with an april 3 2003 hearing on the matter by the house committee on government reform but soon faded22 in the absence of reorganization plan authority the president may propose executive branch reorganizations to be realized through the constitutionally prescribed legislative process the partments of energy education veterans affairs and homeland security were established in this manner this approach however does not incorporate actionfo rcing deadlines or required final congressional vote on proposed reorganization pl ans that are thought to expedite the consideration of reorganizations the president might attempt minor reorganization such as establishing sm all temporary entity within the executive office of the president by issuing directive such as an executive order attempting more ambitious reorganizations through presidential directive if not ultimately found to be illega l may incur congressional displeasure and subsequent

midjanuary 1995 with phase 2 of the npr which was detailed in the presidents fy1996 budget shortly thereafter in late february the president announced new regulatory reform proposals including page bypage review of federal regulations to determine those that were obsolete replaceable by private sector alternatives or better administered by state and local govern ment he also proposed to abolish the interstate commerce commission icc and reconstitute the federal aviation administrations air traffic control rvices as wholly owned government corporation the elimination of the icc was

and its leadership could not be legislatively guaranteed and still othe rs wondered aloud who would be willing to serve for very long in the l eadership of such department some initially criticized th presidents proposal as an inadequate response to what they viewed as intelligence failures suggesting that in the context of considering the components of the new hom eland security depa rtment the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the federal intelligence community particularly the central intelligence agency cia should not escape scrutiny two fbi units the national domestic preparedness office and the national infrastructure protection center would have been transferred to the new depa rtment under the presidents plan and ultimately were in the bill that was signed into law the criticism however suggested that those developing th presidents plan had not given adequate consideration to the prospect of tran sferring or restructuring fbi and cia counterterrorism responsibilitie s others questioned why the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the drug enfo rcement administration and the nuclear regulatory commission were not included gao among others noted that because the concept of homeland security had not been defined certain organizational management and budgetary decisions cannot currently be made consistently across agencies28 in creating the new department congre ss had the responsibility for determining the appropriate administrative structure for the secretary to manage with efficiency economy and effectiveness an organi zation of some 170000 employees many of whom would be working in field facilities composed of diverse units with shared responsibility and partnership w ith state and local government s as well as the private sector key consideration was the secr etarys span of control over the operations of primary divisions and internal agencies together with such broad departmental functions as human and information re sources

secret service were excepted fro m this arrangement and given independent status within the department the h eads of these six components along with upwards of 12 assistant secretaries and approximately 14 othe r senior officials appeared to report directly to the secretary in general the administrative framework statutorily established for the departme nt supported strong vertical management structures while being somewhat weak in detailing horizontal working arrangements among headquarters divisions and internal agencies the presidents proposal contained provision authorizing the secretary of homeland security in regulations prescribed jointly with the director of the office of personnel management to establish and from time to time adjust human resources management system for some or all of the organizational units of the department which shall be flexib contemporary and grounded in public employment principles of merit and fitn ess the provision raised various issues concerning staffing requirements such as adequate numbers of personnel and planning for the replacement of retiring staff hiring particularly direct hiring which would not involve trad itional guarantees of being meritbased and free of political influence and lacked preference for vetera ns and pay particul arly pay parity or equity for employees who are performing similar jobs civil service protections and collective bargaining rights for department workers were among the most contentious issues surrounding the establishment of the department of homeland security ultimately the statute mandating the ne w department largely supported the presidents position on these matters upon signing the homeland security act into law on november 25 2002 president bush transmitted pursuant to section 1502 of the statute his reorganization plan for the department of homeland security this document set deadlines for the transfer of agencies prog rams and functions to the new department
