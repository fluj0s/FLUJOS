fourteenthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30681crs3 amendment and section 2 of the thirteen th amendment and fifteenth amendment are the grants of power most often men tioned when discussing congress authority to proscribe hate crimes and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation under the commerce clause congress is empowered to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the severa l states and with the indian tribes usconst arti 8 cl3 the supreme c ourt has recently identified the three ways in which congress may exercise its prerog atives under the clause first congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce heart of atlanta motel inc v united states 379 us 241 256 1964the authority of congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained united states v darby 312 us 100 114 1941 second congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in inters tate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities shreveport rate cases 234 us 342 1914 southern rco v united states 222 us 20 1991upholding

ments 18 usc 659 finally congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce nlrb v jones laughlin steel 301 us 1 37 1937 united states v morrison 529 us 598 609 2000 quoting united states v lopez 514 us 549 55859 1995 the affects interstate commerce categor can sometimes be the most difficult to define for it may embrace what appears to be purely intrastate activity morrison cited with approval the signposts of this aspect of the commerce power that lopez sought in vain when examining the g unfree schools act 18 usc 922q1a first the statute had nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise however broadly one might defi ne those terms 529 us at 610 514 us at 561 second the statute contained express jurisd ictional element which might limit its reach to discrete set of fir earm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on in terstate commerce 529 us at 61112 514 us at 562 third neither the statute nor its legislative history contains express congressional findings regarding the ffects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in school zone 529 us at 612 514 us at 562 finally the link between gun possession in school zone and commerce interest urged by the government the cost of violent crime and damage to nationa l productivity caused by violent crime was too atte nuated without more to s upport claim to commerce clause authority 529 us at 61213 514 us at 56367 in this last regard morrison observed we accordingly reject the argument that congress may regulate noneconomic violent criminal conduct based solely on that conducts aggregate effect on intersta commerce the constitution requires distinction between what is truly nationa l and what is truly local the regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities channels or goods involved in inte rstate commerce has always been the province of the states 529 us at 617httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30681crs4 3 in contrast with the lack of c ongressional findings that we faced in lopez 13981 is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact that gendermotivated violence has on victims and their families but the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient by itself to sust ain the constitutionality of commerce clause legislation as we stated in lopez simply because congress may conclude that particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so rather whether particular operations affect interstate commer ce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of congress to regulate them is ultimatel judicial rather than legislative question and can be settled finally only by this court 529 us at 614the hate crime proposals present two so mewhat different claims to commerce clause power first they create federa l crime for which an aspect of interstate commerce is an element ie in the case of hr 74 either that in connection with the offense the defendant or the victim travels in interstate commerce or foreign commerce uses facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce or engages in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce or b the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce and in the case of s 625hr 1343 either that 1 the offense occurs during the course of or as result of the travel of the defendant or the victim either acr oss state line or national border or b using channel facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce or 2 the defendant uses channel facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in the commission of the offense or 3 in connection with the offense the defendant employs firearm explos ive or incendiary device or other weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce or 4 the offense either interferes with commercial or other economic activity in which the victim is engaged at the time of the conduct or b otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce then they create second federal cr ime whose claim to commerce clause nexus must be more inferential tied to the findings and the general nature and consequences of hate crimes morrison suggests that the findings and genera l nature of the offenses involved are likely to be insufficient to support an assertion that the commerce clause empowers congress to enact the provisions morrison rejected virtually the same argument with respect to statute creating civil remedy for the victims of gender motivated violence its success here woul d seem to depend on convincing the court that racemotivated or colormotivated or religionmotivated or national origin motivated violence are somehow more commercially influential than gender motivated violence3 brighter seem the prospects for judicial conclusion that the offenses that come with commerceexplicit elements come within congress commerce clause powers they have the distinct advantage of pr ecluding conviction unless the prosecution can convince the courts of the statutory nexu s between the defenda nts conduct and the commerce impacting element of the offense moreover several of the elements involve preventing the channels of commerce from becoming the avenues of destructive misconduct or protecting the flow of commerce from destructivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30681crs5 4 as noted earlier first congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce second congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities united states v morrison 529 us at 609 quoting united states v lopez 514 us 549 55859 1995internal citations omitted 5 section 1 all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside state

states or as member of any state legislature or as an executive or judicial officer of any st ate to support the constitution of the united states shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof but congress may by vote of twothirds of each house remove such disability section 4 the validity of the public debt of the united

any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incu rred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the united states or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave but all such debts obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void usconst amend xiv 1 to 4ingredients the mark of circumstances that indisputably fall within congress authority under the commerce clause4 section 5 of the fourteenth amendment where the proposals seem beyond cong ress reach under the commerce clause they may be within the scope of other legislative powers such as the legislative clauses of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments morrison addresses the breadth of congress gislative power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment the amendment guarantees certain civil rights often by forbidding state or federal interference5 under section 5 the congress is vested with power to enforce by appropriate gislation the amendments provisions morrison pointed out that united states v harris 106 us 629 640 1883 held that section 5 did not vest congress with the power to enact statute directed exclusively against the action of private persons without re ference to the laws of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30681crs6 6 the fifteenth amendment states that the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of r ace color or previous condition of servitude usconst amend xv 1 it too has legislative section the congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation usconst amend xv 2 the ggestion that it applies to private as well as state and federal action is fragile at best the references to badges and incidents of slavery in the findings indicat that proponents seem have to relied more squarely upon the legislative authority granted by the thirt eenth amendment from whose jurisprudence that term of art springs 7 hr 74 finds that violence motivated by bias that is relic of slavery can constitute badges and incidents of slavery the compan ion bill findings are even more explicit 10 for generations the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude were defined by the race color and ancestry of those held in bondage slavery and involuntary servitude were enforced both prior to and after the adopti on of the 13th amendment to the constitution of the united states through widespread public and private violence directed at persons because of their race color or ancestry or pe rceived race color or ancestry accordingly eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means of eliminating to the extent possible the badges incidents and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude 11 both at the time when the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution of the united states were adopted and conti nuing to date members of certain religious and national origin groups were and are perceived to be distinct races thus in order to eliminate to the extent possible the badges incidents and re lics of slavery it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of real or perceived religi ons or national origins at least to the extent such religions or national origins were regarded as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to th constitution of the united statesstate or their administration by he r officers 529 us at 621 and in civil rights cases 109 us at 1 11 1883 we held that the public accommodation provisions of the civil rights act of 1875 which applied to purely private conduct were beyond the scope of the 5 enforcement power the force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these decisions stems not only from the length of time they have been on the books but also from the insight attributable to the members of the court at that time who obviously had intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding the adoption of the fourteenth amendment 529 us at 62122 the statute in morrison created cause of action against private individuals who perpetrated gendermotivated violence enacted in the face of evidence that the states often failed to adequa tely investigate and prosecute ch crimes the authority under section 5 however extends only to state action including the enactment of remedy corrective in its character adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited state laws or proceedings of state officers the morrison statute rested on the wrong side of the divide for its remedy fell not upon wayward state officials but upon private individuals 529 us at 62425 the hate crime proposals seem perilously comparable at best they turn upon private misconduct not the ficiencies of state action6 section 2 of the thirteen amendment the companion bills and hr 74 each stak claim to the legislative authority in section 2 of the thirteen amendment within their findings7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30681crs7 the civil rights cases considered so instructive with respect to congressional powers under the fourteenth amendment also afforded the court its first opportunity to construe sec tion 2 of the thirteenth amendment unlike the fourteenth it speaks not of state action but declares neither sl avery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction usconst amend x iii 1 it finishes with the stipulation that congress shall have power to enforce th is article by appr opriate legislation usconst amend x iii 2 the civil rights cases observed that section 2 clothes congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the united states this power it concluded however reached those fundamental rights which appertain to th essence of citizenship and but not the social rights access lodging transporta tion and entertainment that congress had by statute endeavored to protect from racial discrimination 109 us at 2830 emphasis added the court said little of section 2 for nearly century thereafter until jones v alfred h mayer co 392 us 409 1968 which found that congress might ban racial discrimination from real estate tr ansactions under the section almost in passing jones dismissed without repudiating the soci rights distinction whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issuea question rendered largely academic by title ii of the civil rights act of 1964 78 stat 243 see heart of atlanta motel v united states 379 us 241 katzenbach v mcclung 379 us 294 confirming the titles validity as an exercise of commerce clause powerwe note that the entire court agreed upon at least one proposition the thirteen amendment authorizes congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of society half slave and half free by securing to ll citizens of every race and color the same right to make and enforce contracts to sue be parties give ev idence and to inherit purchase lease sell and convey property as is enjoyed by white citizens 392 us at 441 three years later the court confir med that 42 usc 19853relating to conspiracies in deprivation of the rights of citizenship was within the scope of section 2 authority griffin v breckenridge 403 us 88 1971 griffin opined that not only may congress impose such liability but the varieties of private conduct that it may make criminally punishable or civilly remedi able extend far beyond the actual imposition of slavery or involuntary rvitude by the thirteenth amendment we commit ourselves as nation to the propos ition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free to keep that promise congress has the power under the thirteenth amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation we can only conclude that congress as wholly within its powers under 2 of the thirteen amendment in creating statutory cause of action for negro citizens who have been the victims of cons piratorial racially discriminatory private action aimed at depriving them of the basis rights that the law secures to all free men 403 us at 105 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30681crs8 8 saint francis college v alkhazraji 481 us 604 61011 1987in the middle years of the 19th century dictionaries commonly referred to race as continued series of descendants from parent who is called the stock the descendants of common ancestor family tribe people or nation believe d or presumed to belong to the same stock the encyclopedia britannica so referred to arabs jews and other ethnic grounds such as germans hungarians and greeks as separate races see also shaare tefila congregation v cobb 481 us 615 617 1987section 2 envisions legislation for th benefit of those who bore the burdens slavery and their descendants race color but does it contemplate wider range of beneficiaries eg religion national origin th hate crime proposals would have encloaked groups subject to classificati on by race color religion or national origin in construing the civil rights statutes enacted contemporaneously with the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendment the supreme court held that arabs and jews would have been considered dis tinct races at the time the statutes were passed and the amendments dr afted debated and ratified8 whether this would be considered sufficient to embrace all relig ious discrimination is another question would roman catholics or methodists for example have been considered distinct races even in the nineteenth century of course even this expansion of bene ficiaries does not ensure that the court would consider violence badge or incide nt of slavery although commenting on its irrelevancy in light of congress use of the commerce clause even jones did not go so far as to reject the fundamental ve rsus the social rights distinction of the civil rights cases perhaps more to the point the anxiety of morrison and lopez lest an overly generous commerce clause construction swallow all state criminal jurisdiction over violence might argue against the prospect of the court embracing violence as badge or incident of slavery for purposes of congress legisl ative authority under section 2 of the thirteenth amendment appendices hate crime proposals new federal crimes s 625hr 1343 section 7 s19
