congress and legislative process government and finance division federal departments and agencies play an integral role in the development of the presidents budget the president is required to prepare and submit comprehensive federal budget to congress each year due to the size and complexity of the federal budget however the president relies on departments and agencies to bear the primary responsibility for formulating their budget requests for more information on the budget process see the crs guides to congressional processes at httpwwwcrsgovproducts guidesguidehomeshtml the initial development of the presidents budget begins at the agency level federal agencies typically rely on their own internal process to prepare their initial budget requests while these internal processes may vary by department and agency most generally follow bottomup process initial budget requests are formulated by the lowest organizational level of an agency and reviewed at successively higher levels some departments however follow topdown process in which budget guidelines are established by the highest level and communicated to the lower organizational levels federal agencies usually begin work on the budget about 10 months before the president submits his budget to congress about 18 months before the start of the fiscal year when federal agencies prepare their initial budget requests they usually take an incremental approach agencies estimate the resources necessary to continue the existing programs at current levels for the next fiscal year this includes spending estimates for personnel supplies equipment and other program expenses then agencies will include estimates for new initiatives funded with any available incremental resources in addition the office of management and budget omb will inform an agency of any presidential initiatives to be incorporated into its initial budget request in the typical bottomup process the preliminary budget request is reviewed by the next higher organizational unit decisions are made and passed back to the originating level any disagreements with these decisions may be appealed once decisions are made on appeals the budget request then is consolidated with the budget requests of similarly situated units to be reviewed at the next level this process of review and appeal continues at each level up to the highest level of department or agency all the lowerlevel budget requests then are consolidated into an agencywide budget to be submitted to omb crs2 the government performance and results act gpra of
