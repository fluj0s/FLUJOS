from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to myles allen mrallenrlacuk subject re observed temperature for ipcc power spectra date wed oct 4 085848 2000 cc curtis covey covey1llnlgov santer1llnlgov jfbmitchellmetogovuk myles and curt attached are the nh and sh averages from the new variance corrected analyses hadcrutv when the paper comes out in jgr probably early next year youll see that variance correction is only possible from 1870 so in these files ive patched on the 18561869 data on the front so they are the same length this early data is the same as the original version hadcrut for the global series i still think the best way of producing this is by averaging the two hemispheres hadcrut is what you all probably have it is on the cru web page again i would produce the globe by averaging the hemispheres so what chris folland has for the globe may differ slightly as the hadc produce this as one domain the way the variance correction is achieved is by reducing the highfreq variance of each gridbox series this means that when i update the series for 2000 some values for the last few years 19959 will be altered slightly i dont know much about chapter 2 but i dont recollect there being any power spectrum diagrams probably left for the detection chapter do make sure the axes and units are well explained dont leave anything for the skeptics to cling to cheers phil at 0516 pm 10300 0100 myles allen wrote hi phil if you could send the latest version that chapter 2 are using that would be great i certainly wont pass it on nor use it for anything else subtle differences in processing do make difference to the visual appearence of the plot and even though these differences are inside the noise indicated by the error bar you can bet potential critics will ignore that do you show power spectrum of global temperatures in chapter 2 and if so how was it computed it would certainly be tidy to make sure both are processed in the same way myles myles r allen phone ral 441235446480 space science technology department ph oxford 441865272085 rutherford appleton laboratory fax 441235445848 chilton didcot ox11 0qx email mrallenrlacuk united kingdom httpwwwclimatedynamicsrlacuk on tue 3 oct 2000 phil jones wrote curt myles and anyone else as the data on the web site has an end date of 1994 i suspect you may have an earlier version of the surface data different form of gridding and maybe few other differences in data usage so i suggest you use the latest one which can be got from the cru web site if this relates to ipcc work then chapter 2 on the observations is going to go with variance corrected version corrects for changing station numbers within individual grid boxes but the effect of this on the hemispheric and global temp series is small if anyone wants this new version hadcrutv then i can send the hemispheric and global series by email the normal version hadcrut is on the cru website this naming and the variance correction procedures are discussed in paper which has been accepted by jgr it will not be out for while as ive not yet sent the camera ready columns to the agu cheers phil at 0345 pm 10200 0700 curtis covey wrote myles allen wrote dear curt can you give the ancestry of the obsj global mean temperature series we need the source start date i think i can work it out by matching bumps but it would be better to be sure and how its been detrended for the figure caption sent you the data is the jones set used by the ipcc for its second 1995 its processed this particular data that dont remember exactly who gave it to either phil should invite phils latest including error bars now that im updating our web site httpwwwpcmdillnlgovcmippowerspechtml see attached postscript graphic regards curt attachment converted ceudoraattachtseries_obsjps prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk
