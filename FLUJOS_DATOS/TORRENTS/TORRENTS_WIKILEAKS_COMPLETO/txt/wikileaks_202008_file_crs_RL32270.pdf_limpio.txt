resources to enforce immigration law and that state and local w enforcement entities should be utilized others however question what role state and local law enforcement agencies should have in light of limited state and local resources and immigration expertise congress defined our nations immigration laws in the immigration and nationality act ina which contains both criminal and civil enforcement measures historically the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law has been construed to be limited to the criminal provisions of the ina by contrast the enforcement of the civil provisions which includes apprehension and removal of portable aliens has strictly been viewed as federal responsibility with states playing an inci dental supporting role the legislative proposals that have been introduced howeve r would appear to expand the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in the civil enforcement aspects of the ina congress through various amendments to the ina has gra dually broadened the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law and some recent statutes have begun to carve out possible state roles in the enforcement of civil matters indeed veral jurisdictions have signed agreements ina 287g with the federal government to allow their respective state and local law enforcement agencies to perform new limited duties relating to immigration law enforcement still the enforcement of immigration laws by state and local officials has sparked debate among ma ny who question what the proper role of state and local law enforcement officials shoul d be in enforcing such laws for example many have expressed concern over proper tr aining finite resources at the local level possible civil rights violations and the overall impact on communities some communities have taken steps to define or limit the involvement of local authorities in the implementation of immigration law in the 110th congress proposals have been intr oduced to enhance andor clarify the role of state and local officials in the enforcement of immigration law for example s 1348 the

role of state and local law enforcement introduction1 since the september 11 2001 terrorist att acks the enforcement of our nations immigration laws has received significan t amount of attention some observers contend that the federal government has scarce resources to enforce immigration law and that state and local law enforcement entities shoul d be utilized still many continue to question what role state and local law enforcement agencies should have in light of limited state and local resources and immigration expertise states and localities bear the primary re sponsibility for defining and prosecuting crimes but beyond enforcing the laws or or dinances of their state or locality state and local officials may also have the authority to enforce some federal laws especially criminal laws immigration law provides for both criminal punishments eg for alien smuggling which is prosecuted in the courts and civil violations eg lack of legal status which may lead to removal through separate administrative system the states and localities have traditionally only been permitted to directly enforce the criminal provisions whereas the enforcement of the civil provisions has been viewed as federal responsibility with states playing an incidental supporting role the immigration and nationality act ina 8 usc 1101 et seq currently provides limited avenues for state enforcement of both its civil and criminal provisions the legislative proposals th at have been introduced however would appear to expand the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in the civil regulatory aspects of immigration law ie identifying and detaining deportable aliens for purposes of removal adding the enforcement of civil immigration law to the role of state and local law enforcem ent could in essence involve the agencies in seemingly unfamiliar mission this pot ential expansion has prompted many to examine the legal authority by which state and local law enforcement agencies may enforce immigration law particularly the civil enforcement measures this report examines the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration law the disc ussion is limited to the role of state and local law enforcement in the investigation arrest and detention of ll immigration violators the report does not discuss the prosecution adjudication or rem oval of aliens who violate the law the report opens with brief discussion of the types of immigration interior enforcement activities that the former immigration and naturalizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs2 2 michael garcia director of the ice speech at the heritage foundation july 23 2003service ins pursued and the current immigration activities that are now the focus of the department of homeland security dhs discussion of the legal authority that permits state and local law enfor cement to enforce immigration law under certain circumstances follows current administrativ efforts to involve state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration law as well as selected issues are discussed the report concludes with di scussion of the potential pros and cons of such policy and an analysis of possible policy approaches for congress background the enforcement of immigration laws in the interior of the united states has been controversial traditionally the bate posed concern over large numbers of lawbreakers ie illegal aliens depressing wages against perceptions that foreign labor benefits the econom and promotes relations with source countries nonetheless after the attacks of septem ber 11 attention refocused on the adequacy of interior immigration enforcement especially the perceived lack of federal resources prior to the september 11 2001 rrorist attacks the ins had fewer than 2000 immigration agents to enforce immigration laws within the united states although that number has not changed since th terrorist attacks the merger of the interior enforcement function of the former ins with the investigative arm of the us customs service customs into the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice which is located in dhs has doubled the number of interior agents potentially available to enforce immigration laws2 in spite of the increase in interior enforcement agents many continue to believe that the number is still insufficient mo reover although the consolidation increased the number of interior enforcement agents they now have multiple missions which include enforcing immigration law in the interior of the united states stemming the flow of illicit drugs nd deterring money launderi ng among other things the enforcement of immigration law within the interior of the united states includes investigating aliens who violate the ina and other related laws prior to september 11 2001 immigration interior enfor cement focused on investigating 1 aliens committing crimes 2 suspected fraudulent activities ie possessing or manufacturing fraudulent immigration documen ts 3 suspected smuggling and trafficking of aliens and 4 suspected work site violations frequently involving aliens who work without gal permission and employer s who knowingly hire illegal aliens since the terrorist attacks howev er the majority of ices resources have been directed at stemming terroristrelated activities and activities that have national security interest currently there are express provisions in federal law that provide state and local law enforcement the authority to assist federal officers with the enforcement of immigration law under certain circumstances such authorities were enacted into law in 1996 in 439 of the antiterrorism and ffective death penalty act aedpa pl 104132 nd133 nd 372 of the illegal immigration reform and

in addition to the provisions enacted in aedpa and iirira the dhs has several initiatives with state and local law enforcement agencies to facilitate th investigation arrest and apprehension of foreign nationals who have violat ed the law as discussed below criminal alien program4 the criminal alien program formerly known as the alien criminal apprehension program was tablished in 1991 by the former ins although it has evolved since its initial inception the prima ry purpose of the program has remained the identification of criminal aliens under the current program criminal aliens are identified by immigration officials as they are incarcerated but prior to their release by identifying criminal aliens while they are serving criminal sentence dhs in conjunction with doj is able to facilitate their removal while in state or federal custody absconder apprehension initiative the absconder apprehension initiative wa s initially created to clear up the backlog of cases of aliens who had an unexecuted final order of removal absconders are unauthorized or criminal aliens or nonimmigrants who violated immigration law and have been ordered deported by an immigration court although the identification and removal of criminal aliens had been focus of the former ins the terrorist attacks brought renewed intere st in their removal in 2001 the former ins commissioner james ziglar in c ooperation with the federal bureau of investigation fbi decided to list the names of absconders in the fbis national criminal information center ncic5 current practices although there is quite bit of debate with respect to state and local law enforcement officers authority to enforce immigration law see discussion below as matter of practice it is permissible for state and local law enforcement officers to inquire into the status of an immigrant during the course of their normal duties in enforcing state and local law this practice allows state and local law enforcement officers to play an indirect role that is incidental to their general criminal enforcement authority for example when state or local officers question the immigration status of someone they have detained for state or local violation they may contact an icehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs4 6 under current practice in most jurisd ictions state and local law enforcement officials can inquire into an aliens immigration status if th alien is being questioned by an officer as result of criminal investigation or other rela ted matters ie traffic violation the lesc is discussed in selected issues under

enforcem ent support center lesc6 the federal agent may then place detainer on the suspect requesting the state official to keep the suspect in custody until determination can be made as to the suspects immigration status however the continued detention of such suspect beyond the needs of local law enforcement designed to aid in the enforcement of federal immigration laws may be unlawful7 indirect state participation by mean s of immigration detain ers is not without controversy many have alleged such abuses as state detentions premised on immigrant status alone and custodial arrests for traffic violations or similar offenses as pretexts for verifying an individuals status with immigration authorities past allegations of abuse at times have led to states and localities entering into consent decrees that strictly limit their role in the enforcement of immigration law on the other hand some localities have been concerned that an active role in enforcing immigration law may stretch re sources and hinder community cooperation in curbing criminal activity see later di scussion under selected issues authorities to enforce immigration law the power to prescribe rules as to whic h aliens may enter the united states and which aliens may be removed resides solely with the federal government8 particularly with the congress to implement its plenary power congress hasenacted and amended the ina comprehensive set of rules for legal immigration naturalization depor tation and enforcement conco mitant to its exclusive power to determine which aliens may enter and which may stay the federal government also has power to proscribe activitie s that subvert these rules eg alien smuggling and to set criminal or civ il penalties for those who undertake these activities in examining the ina it is crucial to distinguish the civil from criminal violations mere illegal presence in the us is civil not criminal violation of the ina and subsequent deportation and asso ciated administrative processes are civil proceedings 9 for instance lawfully ad mitted nonimmigrant lien may become deportable under civil provisions if his visitors visa expire s or if his student status changes criminal violations of the ina on the other hand include felonies and misdemeanors and are prosecute d in the federal courts these types of violations include for example 8 usc 1324 which ddresses the bringing in and harboringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs5 10 other criminal provisions include 1253a disobeying removal order 1306 offenses relating to registration of aliens and 1324af engaging in pattern or practice of hiring illegal aliens 11 the federal authority to set rules on the entry of aliens and the conditions of their stay still leaves limited room for state law aimed at the alien community if state regulation is consistent with federal law and the equa l protection requirements of the fourteenth amendment it may stand see generally canas v bica 424 us 351 355 1976 12

stay and the right of aliens in these proceedings subject to the individual rights all aliens in the united states enjoy under the c onstitution however exclusive authority to prescribe the rules on immigration11 does not necessarily imply exclusive authority to enforce those rules while enforcement standards and procedures may differ between the criminal and civil aspects of immigration law congress may authorize the states to assist in enforcing both and state officers may exercise this authority to the degree permitted under federal and state law there is notion however one being more frequently articulated by the federal courts and the executive branch that states have inherent authority to enforce at least the federal criminal law related to immigra tion this inherent authority position is now appare ntly beginning to be expressed with regard to the enforcement of the civil aspects of immigration law as well state enforcement nonetheless must always be c onsistent with federal authority even assuming states have some inherent authority to enforce immigration law federal law preempts inconsis tent state law where concurrent jurisdiction exists congress power to preempt state law arises from the supremacy clause of the constitution which provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding12 congressional intent is paramount in preemption analysis accordingly court must determine whether congress expressly or implicitly intended to preempt state or local action13 generally court will determine that congress intended to preempt state regulation or enforcement when 1 congress expresses preemptive intent in explicit statutory language 2 when state entity regulates in field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively or 3 when state entitys activity actually conflicts with federal

of immigration law setting the rules on the entry and rem oval of aliens is unquestionably an exclusive federal power and some would argue that uniformity in enforcing those rules is critical to the exercise of sovereign authority ie it should not be enforced by states15 accordingly it has been suggested that state involvement in immigration law should be stri ctly limited to express c ongressional indication for such participation16 on the other hand congress can not compel the states to enforce federal immigration law and to do so in particular way17 from the states point of view the federal governments exclusive power over immigration does not preempt every state activity affecting aliens18 and it generally has been assumed that state and local officers may enforce the criminal provisions of the ina if state law permits them to do so but are precluded from directly enforcing the inas civil provisions19 this view may be changing however state enforcement of the criminal provisions of the ina is seen as being consistent with the states police power to make arrests for criminal acts and the expectation that states are expected to cooperate in the enforcement of federal criminal laws20 civil immigration law enforcemen t on the other hand has generally been viewed as strictly federal respons ibility the civil provisions of the ina

authority of state and local officers to arrest aliens suspected of civil infractions of federal immigration law 7 benders immigration bulletin 15 p 944 august 1 2002 22 illegal entry is misdemeanor under ina 275 because many encounters between local police and undocumented aliens involve warrantless arrests an officers authority to apprehend person in violation of 275 will necessarily depend on whether state arrest statutes permit an arrest for misdemeanor oc curring outside the officers presence since the misdemeanor of illegal entry is apparently completed at the time of entry and is not continuing offense that occurs in the presen ce of the officer continuing offense may be found under ina 276 which applies to aliens previously deported who enter or are found in the united states 23

august 9 1978 p 306 quoting doj press releasebeen assumed to constitute pervasive and preemptive regulatory scheme leaving room for direct state or local role21 the distinction between civil and criminal violations in the ina has been seen to suggest bifurcated role for states and localities for example state and local law enforcement officers cannot arrest someone solely for illegal presence for th purpose of deporting them because it is civil violation but they can arrest someone for the criminal offense of entering the country illegally22 to the degree that it is not preem pted the authority of state and local law enforcement officers to investigate and arrest for violations of federal law is determined by reference to state law23 this may be done through express authorization in state law however this may not be necessary according to some recent decisions from the tenth circuit that appear to suggest that state and local law enforcement officers may possess inherent authority within their respective jurisdictions to investigate and make arrests for criminal immigration matters the following sections briefly examine partment of justice office of legal counsel olc opinions that have exa mined immigration enforcement authority analyze the major cases on the issue and describe current provisions in law that authorize state and local i nvolvement in the enforcement of immigration law office of legal counsel opinions several administrations have spoken on the scope of state and local involvement for example 1978 press re lease during the carter administration stressed the need for cooperation and joint federalstate law forcement operations but placed much emphasis on the exclusive federal role to enforce civil immigration law and the special training required to do so24 1983 statement issued by the reagan justice department emphasized similar cooperative measures but still made clear that only ins could make arrests for civil immigration

unclearunder current law whether local police could enforce noncriminal federal statutes26 more recently 1996 olc opinion concluded that state and local police did possess the authority to arrest aliens for criminal violations of the ina but lacked recognized legal authority to enforce the civil provisions of immigration law27 shift in policy towards increasing the role and authority of local law enforcement officers in the field of immigration enforcement came following the terrorist attacks in september 2001 in december 2001 the ins reportedly began sending the names of thousands of noncitizens to the ncic databases as part of the absconder apprehension initiative at 2002 press conference attorney general ashcroft confirmed the existence of new olc opinion that among other things expressed the departments view that state and local officials have inherent authority to enforce federal immigration law including the civil enforcement provisions according to the attorney general when federal state and local law enforcement officers encounter an alien of national security concern who has b een listed on the ncic for violating immigration law federal law permits them to arrest that person and transfer him to the custody of the ins the justice departments office of legal counsel has concluded that this narrow limited mission that we are asking state and local police to undertake voluntarily arresting aliens who have violated criminal provisions of the immigration and nationality act or civil provisions that render an alien deportable and who are listed on the ncic is within the inherent authority of states28 emphasis added initially the department of justice did not release or publish the 2002 olc opinion accordingly several immigrant and public interest groups sought disclosure under the freedom of informati on act foia the department however claimed that the memorandum was exempt from disclosure under foia based on the deliberative process and

31 for example the 2002 opinion states that th issue at hand does not fit under the typical preemption scenario but instead presents the question of whether states can assist the federal government by arresting aliens who have violated federal law emphasis in original as such relying on the dictum discussed in the gonzales v city of peoria case see text under case law was entirely misplaced according to the opinion 32 american civil liberties union refu tation of 2002 doj memo september 6 2005 available at httpwwwacluorgfilespdfsacf3189pdf 33 for example it has been suggested that the

2000department released the opinion in july of 2005 but was allowed to redact certain sections30 the 2002 olc opinion concludes that 1 states have inherent power subject to federal preemption to make arrests for violations of federal law 2 the advice provided in the 1996 olc opinion that fe deral law precludes state police from arresting aliens on the basis of civil deportability was mistaken and 3 8 usc 1252c did not preempt state authority to arrest for federal violations as to the first conclusion the opinion focuses on the authority of states as sovereign entities to retain certain police powers under the cons titution namely the inherent authority to make arrests for violation of federal law with resp ect to the second conclusion the 2002 opinion discredits much of the authority cited in the 1996 and 1989 opinions takes into account case law not previously considered and frames the preemption issue differently from the earlier opinions31 the analysis under the third conclusion examines the legislative history of 1252c and tenth circuit case to find strong presumption against preemption critics have described the newly released opinion as deeply flawed and unsupported by legislative history or judicial precedent32 it has been stated for example that 1 immigration has long been recognized as distinctly federal concern 2 federal law authorizes state and local enforcement of the immigration laws only in specific circumstances not br oadly 3 the opinion does not address the significant distinction between criminal and noncriminal enforcement and 4 the opinion could have implications far beyond the immigration context33 it should also be recognized that although the 2002 ol c opinion describes position in contrast to previous policy it cannot compel state action nor does it carry the same weight as an act of congress generally interpre tations contained in opinion letters are not controlling and should be followed only in sofar as they have the power to persuade34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs10 35 gonzalez v city of peoria 722 f2d 468 474 9th cir 1983 36 the plaintiffs alleged that the city police gaged in the practice of stopping and arresting persons of mexican descent without reasonabl suspicion or probable cause and based only on their race furthermore they alleged that those persons stopped under this policy were required to provide identification of legal pr esence in the us and that anyone without acceptable identification was detained at the jail for release to immigration authorities 37 8 usc 1324 prohibits the

law the issue of whether state and local law enforcement agencies are precluded from enforcing provisions of the ina was analyzed in the ninth circuit case of gonzalez v city of peoria 35 in gonzalez the ninth circuit examined the city of peorias policies that authorized local officers to arrest illegal immigrants for violating the criminal entry provision of the ina 8 usc 132536 the arrestees claimed that the ina represented full fe deral occupation of the field which would in turn preempt state action the court rned to the legislative history of 1324c37 and determined that when congress specifically removed language limiting the enforcement of 1324 to federal officers and inserted specific language authorizing local enforcement that it implicitly made the local enforcement authority as to all three criminal statutes ie 1324 1325 1326 identical38 accordingly the ninth circuit declared that local police officers may subject to state law constitutionally stop or detain individuals when there is r easonable suspicion or in the case of arrests probable cause that such persons have violated or are violating the criminal provisions of the ina39 with regards to preemption the gonzalez court determined that the criminal immigration provisions were few in number relatively simple in their terms constituted narrow and distinct element of the ina and did not require complex administrative structure consistent with exclusive federal control40 the court therefore concluded that the criminal provisions did not support the inference that the federal government occupied the field of criminal immigration enforcement with respect to civil immigration enforcement gonzalez has been construed to support the argument that states do not po ssess the authority inherent or otherwise unless specifically granted by congress to enforce the civil enforcement measures of the ina41 in conducting preemption analysis for certain criminal provisions of the ina the ninth circuit in gonzalez made distinction between the civil and criminal provisions of the ina and assumed that the former constituted pervasive and preemptive regulatory scheme whereas the latter did not the

that the authority of state officials to enforce the provisions of the ina is limited to criminal provisions43 the preemption analysis in gonzalez has been criticized by some for parsing the ina when statutory construction and preemption principles gene rally require consider ation of the whole statutory scheme in eval uating specific provision44 while gonzalez appears to stand for the proposition that states do not possess the authority to enforce civil immigration laws it has been argued that the preemption analysis in gonzalez was based merely on an assumpti on and was outside the holding of the case and thus does not constitute binding precedent45 whether this conclusion is completely accurate has yet to be tested in the c ourts in definitive manner although some decisions from the tenth circuit regarding criminal investigations may be seen by some as strengthening the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement in the tenth circuit case of united states v salinascalderon46 state trooper pulled over the defendant for driving erratically but soon found six individuals in the back of the defendants truck because the defendant who was eventually charged with the crime of illegally tr ansporting aliens did not speak english the state trooper questioned the passenger the defendants wife and learne d that the driver and the other six individuals were in the country ille gally from this line of questioning the court determined that the trooper had proba ble cause to detain and arrest all the individuals in addition to the probable cause conclu sion the tenth circuit determined that state trooper has general investigatory authority to inquire into possible immigration violations47 it has been argued that since there was reason to believe that the alien passengers had committed any criminal violations ie they were only in the country illegally civil violation the courts statement appears to apply fully to civil as well as criminal violations48 the salinascalderon court however did not differentiate between civil and criminal ina violations nor did ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs12 49 united states v vasquezalvarez 176 f 3d

states v vasquezalvarez an oklahoma police officer arrested hispanic male suspected of drug dea ling because he was an illegal alien49 specific provision in the ina 8 usc 1252c authorizes state officers to pick up and hold for deportation previously depor ted alien who had been convicted of crime in the united states and reentere d illegally section 1225c requires state officers to obtain confirmation from the ins before making such an arrest at the time of the arrest in vasquezalvarez however the state offi cer did not have actual knowledge of the defendants immigration status or past criminal behavior it was only later discovered that th alien had history of pr ior criminal convictions and deportations the defendant argued that the state police could only arrest him in accordance with the restrictions detaile d in 8 usc 1252c and since his arrest did not meet the requirements of that provi sion it was unauthorized th tenth circuit however ultimately concluded that 1252c does not limit or displ ace the preexisting general authority of state or local police officers to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal law including immigration law instead 1252c merely creates an additional vehicle for the enforcement of federal immigration law50 the court also recognized that it had previously determined in salinascalderon that state law enforcement officers have the general authority to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal immigration laws51 the court concluded that the legislative history of 1252c does not contai n the slightest indication that congress intended to displace any preexisting enforcement power already in the hands of state and local officers52 while vasquezalvarez may be interpreted to suggest that state and local police officers do in fact possess the inherent authority to enforce all aspects of immigration law it should be noted that the case arose in the context of criminal investigation and was premised on oklahoma law which allows local law enforcement officials to make arrests fo r violations of federal law including immigration laws53 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs13 53 continued offense rev stat

54 again addressed the role of local law enforcement in immigration in santanagarcia utah police officer stopped ve hicle for traffi c violation the driver of the car did not speak english nd did not possess drivers license the passenger of the car spoke limited english nd explained that they were traveling from mexico to colorado which prompted th officer to ask if they were legal the passenger and the driver appeared to understand the question and answered from these facts the court held that the officer had probable cause to arrest both defendants for suspected violation of federal immigration law in recognizing that state and local police officers had implicit authority within their respective jurisdictions to investig ate and make arrests for violations of immigration law the court seemingly dismissed the suggestion that state law must explicitly grant local authorities the power to arrest for federal immigration law violation55 to come to this conclusion the court relied upon number of inferences from earlier decisions that recognized the implicit authority or general investigatory authority of state offi cers to inquire into possible immigration violations56 the court also seemed to rely upon broad understanding of utah state law that empowers officers to make warrantless arrests fo r any public offense committed in the officers presence to include violations of federal law57 although the defendants in santanagarcia were apparently in violation of civil provision of the ina ie illegal presence the santanagarcia court made distinction between the civil and criminal violations of the ina and the authorities the court cited generally i nvolved arrests for criminal ma tters moreover it remains unclear how the court pursuant to its br oad understanding of the utah state law it relied upon would have ruled absent the initial reason for the stop the traffic violation accordingly it can be argued th at this case still seem s to leave unresolved the extent to which state and local police officers may enforce the civil provisions of the ina as such the aforementioned cases ultimately arose in the context of enforcing criminal matters or violations of stat law this would seem to weaken the argument for an independent role in enforcing civil immigration matters nonetheless as the cases from the tenth circuit illustrate there appears to be general movement towardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs14 58 conversely state action may be preempted where congress explicitly manifests its intent in law such an intent is evidenced in ina 274ah2 8 usc

of the status of such individual and only for such period of time as may be required for the service to take the individual into federal custody for purposes of deporting or removing the alien from the united states the purpose of 1252c was to overcome perceived fede ral limitation on the ability of state and local officers to arrest an alien known by them to be dangerous because of past crimes

other hand maintain that they are called for by resource and gal constraints the need to avoid the disruption of critical municipal services or basic human rights considerations although there is generally accepted definition of what polic ies constitute sanctuary the issue has become increasingly contentious other jurisdictions have taken steps to reject what they characterize as sanctuary policies and encourage their law enforcement officers to cooperate with ice for example on may 1 2006 the general assembly of colorado passed legislation requiring all peace officers to c ooperate

the overriding concerns with st ate and local police involvement in the enforcement of immigration law is the potential for civil rights violations person is afforded certain civil rights under the fi fth amendment which guarantees that person shall be deprived of life liberty or property w ithout the due process of law and the fourteenth amendment whic h prohibits state from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal prot ection of the laws it should also be noted that courts have reviewed alleged police misconduct under the fourth amendments prohibition against unreas onable searches and seizures congress has also statutorily prohibited certain discriminatory actions and has made available various reme dies to victims of such discrimination for example title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 prohibits discrimin ation under federally assisted programs on the grounds of race which can include federal and state law enforcement entities 42 usc 1983 enacted as part of the civil rights act of 1871 provides monetary dama ges remedy for harm caused by deprivation of federal constitutional rights by state or local governmental officials the violent crime and control and law enforcem ent act of 1994 included provision 42 usc 14141 which authorizes the doj but not private victims to bring civil actions for equitable and declaratory re lief against any police agency engaged in unconstitutional patterns or practices because unauthorized aliens are likel to be members of minority groups complications may arise in enforcing immigration law due to the difficulty in identifying illegal aliens while at the same time avoiding the appearance of discrimination based on ethnicity or alienage thus high risk for civil rights violations may occur if st ate and local police do not obt ain the requisite knowledge training and experience in dealing with the enforcement of immigration lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs26 97 see department of homeland security

of state nd local law enforcement with respect to enforcing immigration law following is discussion of few of the issues that have arisen in this debate impact on communities critics argue that utilizing state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law would undermin the relationship between local law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve99 for example potential

see for example harris testimony 102 ibidvictims of crime may be reluctant to come forward to report crimes in fear of actions that might be taken against them by immigration officials they assert that the trust between immigrants and local authorities is tenuous in many jurisdictions and that such policy could exacerbate the negative relationship100 proponents contend however that state and local law enforcement officers would best be able to enforce such laws because they know the communities they argue that state and local law enforcement officers already have the power to enforce criminal immigration violations and have not seen reluctance on the part of the communities they serve to coopera in these investigations resources opponents argue that state and local w enforcement resources should not be used to fund federal responsibility they contend that such action could result in the reduction of local law enforcement re sources available for other purposes and constitute cost shift onto state and local law enforcement agencies according to some local jurisdictions are already witne ssing depletion of traditional funding to fight crime these critics also contend that there could be deemphasis on certain types of criminal investigations in an effort to focus on enforcing immigration law which would divert law enforcement authorities from their primary duties proponents in favor of utiliz ing state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law argue that such assistance would help the federal government to enforce the immigration law deeper into the interior of the united states moreover they contend that local law enforcement agencies would bring additional resources to assist the federal government with enforcing immigration law101 national security as previously stated since the 911 terrorist attacks there has been increased emphasis placed on enforcing the nations immig ration laws while the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws continues to be debated critics maintain that by allowing state and local law enforcement to enforce such laws would undermine public safety and could force many undocumented aliens to go underground thus making it more difficu lt to solicit their cooperation in criminal investigations which could also incl ude terroristrelate d investigations102 proponents

with states and localities that would permit qualified officers to perform specified immigrationrelated duties since federal immigration law is complex body of law it requires extensive training and expertise to adequately enforce some argue that there are variety of documents that allow someone to be legally present in the united states and state and local law enforcement officials do not have the necessary training on how to differentiate between those documents additionally opponents maintain that the use of fraudulent docum ents is growing problem and immigration authorities must be familiar with the various techniques that are used to misrepresent document104 proponents contend that each 287g agreemen t is unique and the current training under the program is sufficient to adequate ly train state and cal law enforcement officials to properly enforce immigration law105 possible policy approaches as congress continues to debate the use of state and local law enforcement officers to enforce immigration law it may want to consider several policy options which may represent choice among the options listed below or combination congress may also choose to take action which could leave it to the courts to define these boundaries direct access to databases under current practice state and local law enforcement officials have indirect access to the immigration status of alie ns through lesc and direct access to absconders through the fbis ncic some law enforcement officials argue that direct access to databases th at contain information on th immigrants status

to certain information on aliens with whom they come into contact according to some other issues arise when addressing state and local law enforcements access to immigration databases 1 how much access should be granted to state and local law enforcemen t officials 2 who should have access to the databases 3 what level of back ground clearance would be sufficient for the officers accessing the database 4 what ty pe of privacy protection should be given for individuals whose personal information is being accessed and 5 how can the quality of the databases be improved to avoid potential problems such as false positives and individuals with similar names which could potentially clog up the system funding for state cooperation congress could appropriate additiona l funding to state and local law enforcement agencies fo r their cooperation with enforcing immigration law106 common argument made by local law enforcement officials against enforcing immigration law is the lack of resources107 many states are f acing budget crises and police departments have seen decreases in federal funding for some law enforcement programs state criminal alien assistance program scaap108 over

2000 census bureau estimated that th ere are approximately 8 million undocumented aliens in the united statescriminalizing civil immigration violations at the center of the current debate to permit state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration law is whether state and local law enforcement has the inherent authority to enforce civil immigration violations such as nonimmigrant who overstays his visa while this issue still appears somewhat unclear from legal perspective see earlier discussion in authorities to enforce immigration law and state involvement in the enforcement of immigration law by criminalizing all civil immigration violations state and local law enforcement agencies could seemingly arrest and detain all immigration violators while some view this option as closin g the existing loophole others express concern that state and local law enforcement officials are not adequately trained to ascertain the difference between bonafide asylum seeker and an individual who may be fraudulently trying to circumvent the system others express concern that the pool of violators is great 8 million or more undocumented aliens110 and the immigration system is already overburdened observers question that if civil immigration violations were to become criminal would it be retroactive and if so to what date and would it preempt aliens who have civil immigration violations from adjusting their statushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32270crs31 appendix list of law enforcement entities participating in 287g program training date law enforcement entitynumber
