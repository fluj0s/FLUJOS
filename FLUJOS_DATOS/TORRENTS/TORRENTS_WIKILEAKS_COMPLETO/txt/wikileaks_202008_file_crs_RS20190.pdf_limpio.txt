dropout rate calculations jeffrey j kuenzi analyst in social legislation domestic social policy division summary high school dropout rates continue to be major concern in the united states this report outlines several ways in which dropout rates are measured and reported each year the us department of education ed reports on three dropout rates status dropout rate an event dropout rate and cohort dropout rate that are different indicators of the frequency with which students withdraw prior to completing school high school completion rates also reported by ed as well as regional and state data and the number of dropouts in the us provide other useful perspectives for information on federal programs for dropouts or students at risk of dropping out see crs report rl30134 high school dropouts current federal programs this report will be updated periodically introduction the rate at which students finish high school or leave without completing their degree continues to be major concern in the united states there are several ways to define and measure dropout rates depending on the particular question asked and the type of information sought typically the us department of education ed reports three dropout rates status rate an event rate and cohort rate each providing different indicator of the frequency of withdrawal from school prior to completion all three dropout rates are useful though none alone reflects the full extent of the dropout population national dropout rates each of the three primary ways in which dropout rates are calculated is reviewed in this section these dropout rates provide information on national totals by raceethnicity and in the case of the event dropout rate by family income level because of changes in the dropout definition over the years in the us bureau of the censuss current population survey cps completely comparable data are not available prior to 1994 an event dropout rate identifies the proportion of students who were in grades 10 12 in october of one year and did not either graduate or reenroll the following octoberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20190crs2 1 the general educational development ged test is the most common form of

presents snapshot of what is happening with students in particular year however it is limited because it only reports on individuals during the year immediately after they dropped out ed reports the event dropout rate for students age 1524 in grades 1012 using cps data in this definition to be considered as having completed high school an individual could earn high school diploma or complete an alternative credential such as ged1 table 1 indicates that for 2000 the national event dropout rate was 482 compared to 53 in 1994 in 2000 white nonhispanics had the lowest event dropout rate of 41 nonhispanic blacks had 61 event rate and hispanics had the highest event dropout rate with 74 in 2000 10 of students in grades 1012 from the lowest 20 of the income distribution left school while 52

thus it is more complete measure of the overall dropout rate in the population at large ed uses the 1624 year old age range in its estimates of this dropout rate ed measures this rate using cps data for young adults ages 1624 in 2000 there were 38 million individuals representing 109 of the total population within this age range who had not completed high school program and who were not currently enrolled in school table 2 shows that hispanics had significantly higher status dropout rates thanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20190crs3 either nonhispanic whites or nonhispanic blacks in 2000 278 of hispanics ages 16 24 were status dropouts compared to 69 of nonhispanic whites and 131 of non hispanic blacks table 2 status dropout rates for individuals ages 1624 by raceethnicity 1994 and 2000

2000 nces 2002114 washington november 2001 the cohort dropout rate measures dropout rates for specific group of students over time this figure answers the question that people usually have in mind when asking how many students drop out of school ed measures cohort dropout rates by using longitudinal surveys of secondary school students these data usually provide more background information on the students who drop out than other surveys such as the cps data the most recent longitudinal study by ed the national education longitudinal study of 1988 nels88 began with cohort of students in the 8th grade during the 19871988 school year by august 1994 the overall cohort dropout rate for this group was 72 other nels88 dropout rates were 57 for nonhispanic whites 84 for nonhispanic blacks and 143 for hispanics by august 1994 other relevant data number of dropouts ed estimates that approximately 488000 students in grades 1012 dropped out of school in 2000 this does not take into consideration students in earlier grades who dropped out in that same year which could add several hundred thousand more to this figure completion rates high school completion rates offer another perspective in 2000 ed estimates that 865 of all individuals ages 1824 had received their high school diploma or equivalency certificate eg ged among this age group hispanics showed the lowest overall high school completion rates with approximately 641 compared to 918 of nonhispanic whites and 837 of nonhispanic blacks regional and state data in 2000 the highest status dropout rates were in the southern and western part of the country in the south 129 of all 1624 year olds had dropped out compared to 113 in the west 92 in the midwest and 85 in the northeast ed has been working with states to develop national database of school dropouts using the common core of data ccd collection however as of 2000 nearly half of all states failed to report according to ed standards event dropout rates for those states that do report properly are presented in table 3 below unlike the national event dropouthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20190crs4 rate discussed earlier these rates are for grades 912 also these rates count individuals who receive ged outside of regular approved secondary education program as dropout while the cps data counts all ged certificate holders as high school completers during the 19981999 school year louisiana 100 arizona 84 and nevada 79 had the highest dropout rates among the states reported by ed the dropout rate for the district of columbia in that school year was 82

education statistics dropout rates in the united states 2000 nces 2002114 washington november 2001 states were asked to report on an october through september cycle however these states reported on an alternative july through june cycle b the following states reported data using an alternative calendar in the years indicated alaska 1995 1996 and wisconsin 19971998 c effective in the 19951996 school year louisiana changed its dropout data collection from schoollevel aggregate counts reported to districts to an individual studentrecord system the apparent increase in the dropout rate is partly due to the increased ability to track students note of the 37 states and the district of columbia that reported dropouts in 19981999 27 said that they adhered exactly to the standard common core data ccd definition and collection procedures set out by ed conclusion these figures present national picture of high school dropout rates but do not provide any definite answers about trends according to ed national high school dropout rates have been declining over the last 2 decades3 there is some debate however about whether the national dropout rates are in fact declining comparability of data and lack of standardized dropout measures inaccurate or incomplete reporting by states and other issues raise questions about the reliability of the national dropout figures available particularly when looking at the figures over time in addition the data do not necessarily reflect the extent of the dropout problem in some states or local districts furthermore at this point state and national data are not comparable since the definitions of dropouts differ across the cps and the ccd and ccd data are available for just over half the states
