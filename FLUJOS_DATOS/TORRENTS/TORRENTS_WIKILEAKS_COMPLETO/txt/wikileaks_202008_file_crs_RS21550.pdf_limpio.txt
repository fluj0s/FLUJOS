fourteenth amendment does not include the unbornthe uvva amends title 18 of the u s code and the uniform code of military justice to add new sections for the protection of unborn children3 under the act any person who injures or kills child in utero during the commission of certain specified crimes is guilty of an offens separate from one involving the pregnant woman such crimes include driveby shootings in furtherance of or to escape major drug offense and violations of the freedom of access to clinic entrances act4 punishment for the separate offense is the same as if the offense had been committed against the pregnant woman in addition an offense does not require proof that the person engaging in the misconduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant or that the defendant intended to cause the death of or bodily injury to the child in utero the phras child in utero is defined by the act to mean member of the species homo sapiens at any stage of development who is carried in the womb5 certain individuals are exempt from prosecution under the uvva the pregnant woman may not be prosecuted under the act any person administering consensual abortion may not be prosecuted finally any person providing medical treatment to the pregnant woman or the unborn child may not be prosecuted the uvva had been introduced during the pa st two congresses and was passed by the house during the 106th and 107th congresses during the 106th congress the house passed hr 2436 by vote of 254172 during the 107th congress the

impact on abortion10 they emphasized that the act was drafted narrowly to not interfere with womans ability to have an bortion under current law inst ead the act seeks to protect the unborn from criminal assaila nts and attempts to impose penalty when acts of violence against unborn victims fa ll within federal jurisdiction11 at least twentynine states have statutes that criminalize the killing of fetus or unborn child these statutes vary with re spect to the point at which criminal liability will attach that is the states identify different gestational stages at which the killing of an embryo or fetus will result in criminal liability in three states the killing of viable fetus will result in criminal liability12 fetus becomes viable when it is potentially able to live outside the mothers womb albeit with artificial aid13 viability usually occurs at the twentyeighth week of pregnancy but may occur as early as the twentyfourth week14 six states criminalize the killing of quick fetus15 quickening refers to the period prior to viability when the mother first feels the fetus move in her womb16 quickening usually occurs between the sixteenth and eighteenth weeks of pregnancy17 in sixteen states the killing of an unborn child or the termination of human pregnancy without the consent of the mother will result in criminal liability18 like

stage at which criminal liability attaches finally in four states the killing of an unborn child at specified gestational stage will result in criminal liability for example in arkansas the killing of an unborn child of twelve weeks or greater is murder manslaughter or negligent homicide19 i n california the killing of an unborn child after the embryonic stage is murder20 idaho defines murder to be the unlawful killing of human being including but not limited to human embryo or fetus 21 and in new york the killing of an unborn child after twentyfour weeks of pregnancy is homicide22 courts have declined to invalidate state fetal homicide statutes in state v merrill the minnesota supreme court concluded that the states unborn child homicide statutes did not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment of the us constitution and were not unconstitutionally vague23 merrill shot woman who was pregnant with twentyseven or twentyeight dayold embryo with respect to his equal protection claim merrill argued that the statutes subjected him to prosecution for ending pregnancy while allowing pregnant woma n to terminate nonviable fetus or embryo without criminal consequences24 merrill contended that the statutes treated similarly situated persons differently the court rejected merrills equal protection claim on th grounds that the defendant and pregnant woman are not similarly situated the defendant who assaults pregnant woman causing the death of the fetus she is carrying destroys the fetus without the consent of the woman this is not the sa as the woman who elects to have her pregnancy terminated by one legally authorized to perform the act25 unlike the assailant who has right to kill fetus the pregnant woman has right to decide to terminate her pregnancy the actions of the womans doctor are based on the womans constitutionally protected rights under roe merrill advanced two arguments for finding the statutes to be unconstitutionally vague first he contended that the statutes failed to give fair wa rning of the prohibited conduct merrill maintained that it was unfair to punish an assailant for the murder of an unborn child when neither he nor the pregna nt woman may be aware of the pregnancy however the court found that the statutes provided fair warning based on the doctrine ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21550crs5 26 merrill 450 nw2d at 323 27 id 28 merrill 450 nw2d at 324 29 id 30 id 31 581 ne2d 1189 ill 1991 in subsequent proceeding ford v ahitow 104 f3d 926 7th cir 1997 the us court of appeals for the sevent h circuit determined that habeas corpus relief was not appropriate for ford 32 ford 581 ne at 1199 33 ford 581 ne at 1200transferred intent26 the court noted that even if the offender did not intend to kill particular victim he shoul d have fair warning that he would be held criminally accountable given that the same type of harm would result if another vi ctim was killed merrills second argument was that the statutes encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by using the phr ase cause the death of an unborn child to identify prohibited conduct without actua lly defining when death may occur27 merrill believed that the failure to identify when death occurs for the unborn child would result in judges and juries providing their own definitions moreover merrill asserted that because an embryo is not alive it could not experience death28 the court determined that to have life mean s to have the property of all living things to grow to become29 the court avoided the question of whether the unborn child should be considered person or human being instead the court observed that criminal liability requires only that the embryo be living or ganism that is growing into human being death occurs when the embryo is longer living when it ceases to have the properties of life30 thus the trier of fact would simply have to determine wh ether an assailants acts caused the embryo or unborn child to st op growing or stop showing the properties of life in people v ford the appellate court of illinois concluded similarly that the states fetal homicide statute did not violate the equal protecti on clause of the fourteenth amendment and was not unconstitutionally vague31 like merrill ford argued that the statute treated similarly situated people differently while pregnant woman could terminate her nonviable fetus without puni shment an assailant would face criminal penalties for killing such fetus following the minnesota supreme court the illinois court found that the defenda nt and pregnant woman are not similarly situated32 in addition the court determined that the statut could be upheld as rationally related to legitimate governmental purpose because the statute did not affect fundamental right held by the defendant and because it did not discriminate against suspect class the validity of the statute could be considered under the rational basis standard of review the court concluded that the statute was rationally related to legitimate governmental interest in protecting the potentiality of human life33 fords vagueness argument focused on the statutes use of the phrase cause the death of an unborn child ford contended th at the absence of stat utory definitions forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21550crs6 34 id 35 in 2004 federal district court in pennsylvania granted motion to dismiss an action that sought to repeal part of the unborn victims of violence act and roe v wade the pro complaint alleged in part that the ac t superseded the courts decision in roe the case was dismissed on procedural grounds see carlin v united states civa 041666 2004 wl 1661229 ed pa july 26 2004when life begins and death occurs would resu lt in the application of subjective definitions by the trier of fact and lead to the arb itrary and discriminatory enforcement of the statute34 citing merrill the court maintained that the tr ier of fact would be required only to determine whether there was an embryo or fetus that was growing into human being and whether because of the acts of an assaila nt that growing was stopped the statute did not require the trier of fact to apply its subjective views passage of the uvva may prompt similar cases that challenge the validity of the act35 equal protection and vaguene ss claims like those alleged in merrill and ford would probably be asserted for that reas on the two cases provide some guidance as to how court may consider future case involving the uvva
