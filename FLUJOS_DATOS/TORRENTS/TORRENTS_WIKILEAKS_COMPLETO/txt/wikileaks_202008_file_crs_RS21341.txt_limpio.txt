this report will be updated in the event of significant legislative or regulatory developments congressional research service the library of congress crs2 background on insurance scoring an insurance score type of credit score is number produced by proprietary computer scoring model that analyzes persons credit history information such as payment history collection balances and bankruptcies while credit scores are used by lenders to help them decide whether to offer person loan insurance scores are used by insurers to determine what level of risk person represents the information used in credit and insurance score models is obtained principally from credit reports generated by the three major national credit reporting agencies cras equifax experian and trans union1 cras are subject to the consumer protections set forth in the fair credit reporting act fcra2 credit scores have been used widely for some time in credit related businesses such as banks home mortgage lenders and credit card issuers but the use of insurance scores by insurers is relatively new fcra allows cras to furnish credit report without the consumers permission to an insurer when the report is to be used in connection with the underwriting of insurance however fcra also provides that when any users of credit information from cras use such information to take action that is adverse to the consumer then notification of that action must be given to the consumer httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21341 over the past several years insurers increasingly have included credit information from credit reports as factors in insurance underwriting especially in personal lines of insurance such as automobile and homeowners insurance there is some indication however that credit information may also have some relevance in commercial lines of insurance3 it has been estimated that 90 of property insurers now use credit information in some way in their underwriting decisions4 insurers maintain that there is clear statistical connection between persons insurance score and the likelihood of that person filing claims as well as how expensive such claims might be thus even though good insurance score does not necessarily mean person is good driver or more responsible homeowner insurers contend that their research has shown that persons with better insurance scores generally file fewer insurance claims and have lower insurance losses insurers maintain that as result of using insurance scores they can charge lower premiums or give discounts to many customers who otherwise would pay more for insurance and are also able to offer coverage to more consumers many insurers have developed their own scoring models while others contract with third parties to obtain their insurance scores either way insurers say the link between insurance scores and insurance losses is clear and point to two possible explanations the first explanation relates to stress that people under stress are more likely to have auto accidents and financial problems are known cause of stress the second explanation relates to risk taking behavior that people have different aversions to risk and people with poor insurance scores are more likely to engage in risky behavior and therefore more likely to incur losses 1 for additional information on credit scores see crs report rs21298 credit scores development use and

albert b crenshaw bad credit big premiums washington post june 18 2002 p e1 citing robert p hartwig chief economist of the insurance information institute crs3 state insurance laws generally provide that insurance rates cannot be unfairly discriminatory some state regulators and consumer advocates insist that insurance scores do in fact discriminate against lowincome and minority consumers and that their use should be banned or limited critics also say that insurance scores penalize poor people immigrants and seniors who may not have credit records one consumer advocate recently asserted that insurance scores are the most controversial new addition to the rate setting process that they allow insurers to double automobile premiums even for drivers whose records are pristine and that states should ban insurers from using them to set rates5 another consumer advocate has created separate website to inform insurance consumers about the use of insurance scores and to urge them to get involved in forcing insurers to abandon the practice6 federal regulatory aspects fcra allows cras to furnish credit report to an insurer without the consumers permission if the report is to be used in connection with the underwriting of insurance however if any user of credit information from cras uses such information to take any adverse action the person so affected must be given notification of that action the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21341 provisions of fcra fall under the enforcement jurisdiction of the federal trade commission ftc which in its commentary on fcra stated that an insurer may obtain consumer report to decide whether or not to issue policy to the consumer the amount and terms of coverage the duration of the policy the rates or fees charged or whether or not to renew or cancel policy because these are all underwriting decisions7 subsequently in an interpretative letter the ftc opined that the term underwriting decision included the case where an insurer would be obtaining credit reports on existing policyholders to determine whether they would be entitled to discount under good credit discount program upon renewal of existing policies8 the use of credit scores in the mortgage lending industry and its potential impact on mortgage applicants have been addressed by the federal reserve systems mortgage credit partnership credit scoring committee the federal reserve bank of chicago published an article in 2000 in which it outlined how credit scores are used in the mortgage application process and also addressed several related issues9 one such issue is that while credit scores can serve an important function to facilitate access to credit their nature and usage could result in unlawful discrimination against minorities and low income applicants this is generally referred to as the disparate impact of the use of credit scores 5 jim guest highrate robbery consumer reports oct 2002 p 7 6 see httpwwwinsurancescoredcom visited dec 8

portions of fcra were set to expire at the end of 2003 following wideranging series of hearings and two markups the house financial services committee reported hr2622 amending the fair credit reporting act on july 25 2003 while the fcras primary focus is on the regulation of credit information the usage of this information particularly insurance scores by insurers drew congressional interest congressman gutierrez previously introduced hr1473 to specifically regulate insurers use of credit information and he offered an amendment at the subcommittee markup of hr2622 calling for study of insurer usage of credit information this amendment was accepted and included in the bill as reported from the full committee the senate held hearings and passed bill amending the fcra s 1753 after the house this bill also included the requirement for slightly different study on the usage of credit information in insurance the conference committee made further slight changes to the study requirement and it was included in the conference report as passed and signed by the president pl 108159 state regulatory aspects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21341 unlike banks and other financial institutions that are regulated primarily at the federal level insurers are regulated primarily at the state level10 most state insurance laws prohibit unfair trade practices and also require that insurance rates not be unfairly discriminatory many states require prior approval of insurance premium rates especially those for personal lines such as automobile and homeowners insurance state lawmakers are beginning to turn their attention to the issue of insurers using creditbased insurance scores in making underwriting marketing and rating decisions according to the national association of mutual insurance companies namic 48 states have taken legislative or regulatory action addressing insurer use of credit history information11 many of the state laws are following model law12 recommended by the national conference of insurance legislators ncoil and generally supported by insurers the law was described in congressional testimony13 as requiring insurers to notify an applicant for insurance if credit information will be used in underwriting and rating to notify consumer in the event of an adverse action based on credit information including notification of factors that were the primary influences on the adverse action to reunderwrite and rerate policyholder whose credit report was corrected 10 for additional information on the background of state regulation of

procedures and according to applicable laws and regulations to file its scoring models with the applicable state department of insurance such filings are deemed trade secrets although described by prominent consumer group as improving upon the previous market practices the ncoil law is seen as far from the prohibition on use of credit scores that some would prefer14 state insurance regulators are also increasing their regulatory oversight over credit based insurance scores in some states the regulators have already addressed the issue but in an effort to develop more unified national approach most regulators are working through their trade organization the national association of insurance commissioners naic in march 2002 the naic appointed credit scoring working group to focus on the various regulatory issues related to the use of credit information in the insurance underwriting and rating process the working group has drafted documents to aid insurance consumers and to assist the regulators in clarifying the issues and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21341 recommending set of best practices two draft documents were cited in naic congressional testimony15 and approved by the full naic shortly thereafter consumer brochure understanding how insurers use credit information this is questionanswer brochure addressing such matters as the legality of an insurers obtaining credit report under fcra without permission why and how insurers use credit information and how to improve ones insurance score creditbased insurance scoring regulatory options this document seeks to set forth the pros and cons of various regulation options including ban on the use of credit history for rating purposes these two documents however did not complete the recommendations or policies some hoped would emanate from the working group and the naic study on the possible disparate impact of credit scoring was proposed this proposed study however provoked significant debate and opposition the working group cancelled previously scheduled session at the regular naic summer national meeting that was held june 2124 200316 at the naic fall national meeting held september 1316 2003 this study was put off and it was suggested that concerned states should do studies of their own17 indiana louisiana maryland missouri montana nevada oregon and washington 14 see comments of birny birnbaum on

recently the naic working group produced white paper with set of best practices relating to the usage of credit scoring litigation number of lawsuits have been filed alleging violations of either state or federal law relating to the usage of credit information for example lawsuit against allstate was filed seeking class action status in us district court in san antonio texas by several

similarly situated whites allstates motion to dismiss was denied and the case as been allowed to proceed after successive appeals to the 5th us circuit court and the us supreme court insurers are concerned that the case could lead to determination of new discrimination standard over and above the state law prohibiting unfair discrimination and thus usurp the authority of state insurance
