this act provides that upon receipt by congress of presidential determination that contains specific stipulations regarding pakistan the president may waive provisions in law that would otherwise prevent us military assistance to pakistan this authority is valid through fy2008 see crs report rl33498 pakistanus relations influence of the soviet union for its part pakistan saw its relationship with the united states as useful counterweight to india s military power and its prospective threat to pakistans security beginning in the mid1970s pakistan responded to indias 1974 underground nuclear test by seeking its own nuclear weapons capability these efforts subsequently led the united states to suspend military aid beginning in 1979 soon thereafter following the soviet unions invasion of afghanistan the us waived its sanctions on assistance to pakistan in an effort to gain its support for the effort to force the withdrawal of the soviet miliary from afghanistan early in the presidency of ronald reagan the united states sold pakistan 40 f16 ab combat fighter aircraft an indication of the reagan admin istrations view of that c ountrys potential as supporter against soviet union expansionism in south asia yet in spite of the renewal of us aid and the development of closer military ties in the early 1980s many in congress remained concerned with pakistans deve loping nuclear weapons program in 1985 congress added section 620ee to the foreign assistance act2 this provision known as the pressler amendment re quired the president to certify to congress that pakistan did not possess nuclear explosive device during each fiscal year in which the administration proposed to provide assist ance to pakistan this placed an important brake on expansion of defense supply re lationship between the united states and pakistan with the withdrawal of soviet military forces from afghanistan the nuclear weapons development program of pakistan came under intensive us examination again finally in october 1990 president george h w bush suspended us military assistance to pakistan as result of this action the united states stopped the delivery of 28 f16 fighter aircraft th at pakistan had purchased 19893 throughout the 1990s the united states ssentially ended milita ry cooperation and arms sales to pakistan it was only after the terrorist attacks against the united states on september 11 2001 that the bush administration chose to reengage with pakistan in the area of defense cooperation nd was willing once again to consider and approve major weapons sales to that country it secu red authority from congress which has been extended annually as required to waive restrictions on aid to pakistan president bush has invoked this authority to keep providing ai d the rationale for this change of policy regarding arms sales to pakistan was to secure its governments support for the us counterterrorism program in june 2004 pres ident george w bush designated pakistan major nonnato ally4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22757crs3 5 transmittal 0609 june 28 2006 pakistan f16cd block 5052 aircraft defense security cooperation agency available on the dsca website at

the aeca can place conditions on the use of us weapons sold to foreign nations is in crs report rl30982 us defense articles and services supplied to foreign recipients restrictions on their use by richard f grimmettafter decade of denying pakistan the right to purchase advanced military equipment and assistance in purchasing it major contract was signed in 2006 for the purchase of 36 new f16cd aircraft and associ ated equipment the express rationale of the bush administration for this specific sale was given its geostrategic location and pa rtnership in the global war on terrorism gwot pakistan is vital ally of the united statesthis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the united states by helping an ally meet its legitimate defense requireme nts the aircraft also will be used for close air support in ongoing opera tions contributing to the gwot5 this statement succinctly summarizes what c ontinues to be the underlying argument by the bush administration for arms sales and military assistance to pakistan apart from the 40 f16ab aircraft sold to pakistan during the early years of the reagan administration few other major weapons systems have been sold to pakistan by the united states until the 2006 f16 aircraft sale other systems sold have primarily been missiles such as the sidewinder for the f16 aircraft and limited number of harpoon antiship missiles since the bush adminis tration has announced its willingness to sell major weapons systems to pakistan va rious press accounts ve speculated about possible new sales apart from the majo r 2006 f16 sales and re lated equipment noted above additional major weapon systems have been sold to pakistan6 the statutory authority governing us arms sales to pakistan is found in the arms export control act aeca7 this statute sets out terms and conditions that must be met before any country can be permitted to pur chase any item on the united states munitions list an essential re quirement is that the country seek ing us weapons be eligible to purchase them thus if there is other prohibition in other us law that would preclude the sale of weapon to pakistan then it would be eligible to make such purchase from the united states because c ountry is eligible to purchase weapon does not mean that the united states is obligated to sell it8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22757crs4 9 22 usc 2791eshould the united states government choos to do so it can stop the transfer of defense articles and services to pakistan for which valid c ontracts exist without finding it in violation of an applicable agreement with the united states relating to permissible uses of weapons previously sold the aut hority for suspension of deliveries or defense items or cancellation of military sales contracts is found in s ections 2b and 42e12 of the aeca section 2b of the arms export control act permits the secretary of state under the presidents direction to am ong other things determine whether there shall be delivery or other performance rega rding sales or exports under the aeca in order that the foreign policy of the ited states is best served thereby section 42e19 of the arms export control act states that each contract for sale entered into under sections 21 22 29 and 30 of this act and each contract entered into under section 27 d of the act shall provide that such contract may be canceled in whole or in part or its execution suspended by the united states at any time under unusual or compelling circumstances if the national interest so requires section 42e2a of the arms expor t control act further states that each export license issued under section 38 of this act shall provide that such license may be revoked suspended or amended by the secretary of st ate without prior notice whenever the secretary deems such action to be advisable thus all governmenttogovernment agr eements or licensed commercial contracts for the transfer of defense articles or fense services may be halted modified or terminated by the executive branch should it dete rmine that it is advisable to do so in this context should the bush administration decide that actions taken by the government of pakistan are contrary to the national security interests of the united states the president can suspend or terminate existing arms sales agreements or prevent the delivery of weapons previously ordered as he deem s appropriate the congress can also pass legislation that would suspend modify or terminate any arms sale contract should it choose to do so
