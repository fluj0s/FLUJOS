summary the perpetrators of the urban rampaging refs in france are by and large of arabafrican and blackafrican background in most cases they are also muslims raising the question as to what extent their religious affiliation helps explain the explosion in frances immigrant suburbs there is widespread agreement that unemployment and lack of education and not religious affiliation are the primary factors underlying the angry hopelessness of urban youth that said responsible commentators on the situation from officials who monitor potential support for terrorist activities to rights activists with long experience working in troubled neighborhoods see religious affiliation as complicating factor thus far most of the youths in question while happening to be muslim by culture are generally not viewed as individually inspired by islam just as islamic political groupings are generally not viewed as being directly behind the violence observers note however that these groups have not hesitated to try to exploit the unrest for their own purposes just as extremist and nativist politicians on the farright have played to racism and xenophobic fears the governments decision to turn to muslim leaders to quell the unrest is itself seen by some as misdirected and bad precedent in contradiction with the french republics strict secularism in sum while efforts to politicize the unrest are seen as unsuccessful to date there is concern that not getting it right in dealing with the problems of frances underclass muslims could eventually produce the very islamic extremism identity that almost one wants end summary direct links to islamic extremism 2 c though it has carefully watched for it the french government has not discerned any significant link between islamic extremism and the recent unrest as christophe chaboud head of the ministry of interiors counterterrorism coordination body known by its french acronym uclat categorically reconfirmed to poloff on november 15 we the gof have not found any link between islamic extremists and those fomenting the unrest he acknowledged that police and internal intelligence organizations have received few signs that some islamic extremists have participated in the violence that said he believed that they were acting as individuals and not as members of coordinated islamic group fears of extremist and criminal exploitation 3 c chaboud reported that gof monitoring of websites and blogs in france and abroad nonetheless reveals that extremists are trying to exploit the unrest to their advantage claiming for example that it results from gof attempts to control and muzzle islam in france asked whether there was any connection between organized criminal gangs and islamic extremists in exploiting the unrest chaboud said those in the revolt movement were at most only petty criminals indeed police are quoted in press as observing that where organized crime is strongest is often where there has been counter to conventional expectations little unrest presumably because drugselling organizations view burning cars as bad for business see also ref c for the views of investigating judge on the connection between criminality and current unrest just hoodlums 4 sbu samira cadasse vicepresident of leading womens rights group that focuses on empowering women in poor immigrant communities told poloff that the small groups of youths responsible for car burnings and police taunting are the same ones who hold hostage suburban housing projects throughout france cadasses ngo putes soumises npns translated literally as neither whores nor submissives focuses on the difficulties poor often muslim women of immigrant background face in resisting discrimination from french society as well as oppression within their own cultural traditions cadasse said npns has tried to highlight for years the way frustrated angry aimless young men in poor neighborhoods under the blind eye of french authorities visit their powerlessness first and foremost on their female relatives or islamic hoodlums 5 sbu contrary to much of the media reporting cadasse said she definitely also perceived an islamist element behind some of the violence exclaiming that we all know who these guys are she claimed they had shaved their islamic beards in order to spread violence these unemployed islamist youths were the same troublemakers who had sought to repress women in the troubled suburban neighborhoods she also believed it significant that there were girls among the troublemakers that said while cadasse clearly believed that the misapplication of tenets some attribute to islam abets the widespread oppression of women in these immigrant communities she stopped well short of calling the big brothers committed islamist fundamentalists role models or jobs 6 sbu cadasse identified lack of jobs as the real root of the problem which was compounded by the relative generosity of the social safety net as result young men sat idle at home while receiving generous but ultimately insufficient and humiliating 950euro stipend from the government they could not afford to move away from their parents but at the same time accepted parental control she did not think it accurate to portray these youths as victims these young men were guilty of arson and other crimes and should be punished at the same time she thought it would be difficult to break the vicious cycle cadasse saw the current crisis due to larger failures and shortfalls in education employment opportunities and housing as very difficult to resolve and doubted that the government had the will do go beyond the bandaid solutions employed in the past 30 years of ghettoization 7 sbu according to cadasse the governments history of treating only the symptoms rather than the causes of minority unemployment and social exclusion and its failure to curb thirtyyear ghettoization trend among french immigrant communities has been an error of governments of both left and right cadasse was pessimistic about the prospects of bettering the circumstances of frances immigrants of arab background she said that overall were better off than 22 years ago at the time of the march of the beurs turning point in north african immigrant activism while she did not envision marshall plan for frances innercitylike suburbs she believed that drastic measures were necessary nonetheless pm villepins pledge to reverse the budget cuts to associations like npns and to offer range of other social program enhancements was positive start government funding was also critical for secular ngos like npns to combat the influence of islamists but she doubted the government had the will to stay the course in her view it was too tempting for the government to focus on security in an attempt to appeal to farrightleaning voters in the upcoming presidential election 8 sbu comment french ngos are largely dependent on government support and typically receive 80 percent or more of their funding from the state these associations are essential to holding together the social fabric of poor neighborhoods providing everything from food kitchens to tutoring to psychological support activities soon after president chiracs reelection in 2002 the state financing of these associations was cut severely prime minister villepin last week promised to restore the cuts the government appears to understand that diminishing the viability of these secular statefunded charitable organization risks vacuum that could be filled by home grown islamist selfhelp organizations end comment gof guilty of using religion 9 sbu interestingly some see the government itself as guilty to some degree of having violated the principle of secularism it holds so dear in meeting with the rector of the grand mosque of lyon on november 15 one muslim religious leaders criticized the government for violating frances strict separation of the religious and the public the rector kamel kabtane took to task the governments effort to use muslim religious figures to calm the situation in troubled neighborhoods kabtane said that many of his fellowclerics were also ambivalent about the french governments call on religious leaders to do the work of the government and security forces if farmers started protesting said the rector the government wouldnt call on the archbishop to resolve the situation he warned against attributing religious dimension to socioeconomic problems there was risk it could become selffulfilling prophecy better ecumenical than muslimonly 10 sbu kabtane went on to point out that the government says that france is secular state but then when it serves its purposes to do so it turns around and calls on religious leaders to solve nonreligious problems that the secular state should have been addressing over the last 2030 years kabtane has not issued statement condemning the violence or calling upon the perpetrators to stop as he believes it is important not to conflate the actions of violent youths with islam if religious leaders are to be involved he believes it would be preferable to adopt an ecumenical rather than sectarian approach to that end he was organizing meeting of religious leaders from the muslim christian and jewish communities in lyon on november 16 his aim was to convince those present to issue joint statement condemning the violence and calling for it to end the risk of an antimuslim backlash 11 sbu kabtane indicated that he was much more worried about backlash against muslims following on the recent unrest than about any putative use of the unrest by fundamentalists on november 12 molotov cocktail was thrown over the wall into the grand mosque of lyon then on november 13 someone threw molotov cocktail over the wall of mosque in saintchamond town near lyon kabtane said that muslims were paying the price for the fact that french politicians and foreign media have blamed the violence on muslims and immigrants instead of on unemployed or underprivileged youths comment we have now heard reports of handful of such attacks against mosques in all likelihood they were perpetrated by rightwing antiimmigrant nativists end comment kabtane added that he was satisfied with the demonstrations of support he had received from french authorities in the wake of the attack on the mosque the local prefect visited the site the following morning and interior minister sarkozy had telephoned kabtane to offer support the french school system as the key 12 sbu during public affairs talk show on the evening of november 13 conservative philosopher alain finkelkraut addressed how the republic could reclaim the troubled innercitylike neighborhoods lost to both law and order and social integration finkelkraut poetically evoked his experience in frances public school system stressing its role in separating youths from surrounding society in order better to inculcate the values that underpin the republican ideal of equal citizenship blind to race nationality religion and social class finkelkraut lamented the way society had invaded the schools bringing with it raft of demands identities exceptions and resentments that taken together interfered with the inculcation of shared national identity in finkelkrauts view taking back the neighborhoods for republican law and order was the lesser half of the battle providing to those most removed from the possibility of it the convictions and opportunities required for successfully integrating into french society was the more difficult and most urgent challenge facing france today otherwise sectarianism could follow 13 sbu finkelkraut warned that failure to meet this challenge would inevitably open the door to the ascendancy of separate alternative identities focused on religion controversial islamic activist tarik ramadan who also participated in the roundtable discussion indirectly confirmed as much turning around the image of the republic needing to take back the neighborhoods ramadan unctuously but deftly argued for the right of the neighborhoods their cultures identities religion etc to take the republic the french fear of communitarism 14 sbu former prime minister alain juppe spending semester teaching in canada posted long piece to his blog wwwal1jupcom that clearly identified islam in france specifically radical islam as factor also responsible for the current unrest in juppes view french islams refusal so far to solemnly proclaim its acceptance of the separation of the temporal from the spiritual and its recognition of nonnegotiable universal human rights including gender equality contributes to the difficulty of integrating those who live in the neighborhoods where radical islam presents itself as an alternative model for social organization comment 15 sbu the gangs of underclass youths who are the perpetrators of the car burnings and urban violence in france are not islamists nor are they at all motivated by religion it is highly misleading to characterize them as is often done in media coverage as insurgent and muslim youths the anger felt by these youths stems from how they are trapped and without future facing pervasive racial prejudice and without the skills and education needed to getalife of employment and conventional respect 16 sbu that said the dominant religion in frances lowincome housing projects affected by the recent violence is islam and there are those intent on saving these communities from their social ills by refounding them on religious as opposed to secular principles in effect filling the vacuum where french republican values have failed to take root whether or not islamic organizations and fundamentalist proselytizing will make significant inroads among the inhabitants of frances immigrant suburbs of course depends on the effectiveness of the gofs social programs and the willingness of french society at large to face up to its pervasive prejudices against blacks and arabs please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
