bduction and the number of missing children who are recovered14 since the acts passage in 1984 two national incidence studies have been conducted however the studies ar dated one was c onducted in

limitations of the data set are discussed in the issues section of this report as discussed below the 1999 study i ndicates that of the 13 million children who went missing that year most had run away from home or were forced to leave their home and nearly all were returned to their caretakers cases of serious nonfamily abductions in which the child is tr ansported and held fo r ransom or killed are rare the discussion be low indicates that the true number of child sexual exploitation incidents is unknown because of the secrecy around exploitation missing children nismart1 the first national incidence study of missing children known as the national incidence study of missi ng abducted runaway and thrownaway children commonly known as nismar t1 was conducted in 1988 pursuant to the missing childrens assistance act nismart1 provided the first nationally representative comprehensive data on the incidence of missing children unlike previous sources of missing children data the study provided two counts of children who were missing one count was based on whether pa rent considered the child missing regardless of the seriousness of the incident and another was based on whether law enforcement considered missing child at risk and in need of immediate intervention15 the study classified five categories of missing children 1 children who were missing because they were lost injured or did not adequately communicate with their caretakers about thei r whereabouts 2 children abducted by family members 3 children abducted by nonfa mily members 4 runawa ys and 5 thrownaways forced to leave their homes nismart 1 did not aggregate the number of missing children across these categories because res earchers viewed each category as distinct from other categories researchers also ra ised concerns that some children were not literally missing because caretakers knew of their childrens location but could not recover them nismart2 nismart2 attempted to reso lve some of the

the police or missing childrens agency to locate the child17 nismart2 added to and combined so of the missing children categories created in nismart118 missing benign was added as category to describe child who goes missing due to miscommunication and is not in any danger the survey consolidated the runaway and thrownaway categories that had been separate in nismart1 nismart2 researchers determined that the categorization of each type of runaway or thrownaway episode frequently depended on whether information was gathered from the children who tended to emphasize the thrownaway aspects of the episode or their caretakers who tended to emphasize the runaway aspects19 findings from nismart2 nismart2 combined the data across the five categories to calculate total number for both caretaker missing and reported missing episodes the survey found that 1315600 children were missing based on the caretaker missing definition in about 798000 61 of these cases parents reported their child missing to the police or missi ng childrens agency nearly all 998 caretaker missing children were recove red only 2500 02caretaker missing children had not returned home or been cated and the majority of these children were runaways from institutions20 figure 1 below summarizes the number of caretaker missing and reported missing incidents within the five missing children categories 1 nonfamily

kidnapping cases such as those involving adam walsh 1981 polly klaas 1993 and elizabeth smart 2002 ma contribute to the belief that these missing children incidents are common howe ver such cases are

abduction vi ctims in 1999 experienced stereotypical kidnapping this information is not shown in figure 1 22 although nonfamily abductions rarely result in more serious cases children who are not recovered immediately in such cases are at increased risk of becoming harm ed studies show that the first three hours after an abduction are the most crucial for the recovery of the child just over 75 of abducted children who are murdered are dead within three hours of the abduction23 nismart2 shows that children missing in 1999 tended to be teenagers male and white about half 45 of caretaker
